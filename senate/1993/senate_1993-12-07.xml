<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The legislation before us today, the Industrial Relations Reform Bill 1993 and the Industrial Relations Court (Judges' Remuneration) Bill 1993, is certainly the most significant piece of industrial legislation that this parliament has seen in the last 10 years. It focuses on four or five important developments in industrial relations. I think the most important principle in this legislation is that dealing with enterprise bargaining. The government's concept of enterprise bargaining includes the principles that no-one should be worse off in totality than the award provisions, which the enterprise bargaining is replacing. Central to this is also the concept that the award system continues in tandem with the enterprise bargain and that, from time to time, the award system is adjusted through national wage deliberations. The latest of those is the current $8 round.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The award system is to remain as a safety net to ensure that those people who are participating in enterprise bargaining are no worse off. Those not protected by the no disadvantage test in the federal act will enjoy a series of minimum standards based on the ILO conventions of the United Nations. They will include a fair minimum wage, equal pay, protection against unfair dismissals and 12 months unpaid parental leave. To those opposite who seem to believe that we should not be embodying those principles based on the various conventions of the United Nations International Labour Organisation, I say that they are what I think are the very basic minimum standards&mdash;they are certainly nothing startling&mdash;that all workers in Australia should be covered by. But, unfortunately, because of recent changes in industrial legislation, particularly in Victoria and Western Australia and some aspects of the legislation in Tasmania, some workers do not enjoy these minimum standards. The legislation also includes provisions for the right to strike and amends the sanctions under the current Trade Practices Act, known as sections 45D and E. There has been extensive consultation on these variations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I note the interjection and remind honourable senators opposite of the lack of consultation that occurred in Victoria and Tasmania when the legislation was being put together in those states. The legislation was presented in the dead of night and rushed through the parliament with minimal time for consultation, yet we have those opposite complaining about the alleged lack of consultation by this government. In fact, this government has spent some six months since the election, when the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) made a speech before a business forum, consulting with all groups in the community. I think that stands in stark contrast to the behaviour of state governments, particularly in Victoria and Tasmania.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to deal particularly with the direct bargaining processes that are contained in the legislation. The making of agreements between groups of workers and employees at the enterprise level with management will be encouraged. To encourage this, a new division of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission is to be established. There will be two types of industrial agreements&mdash;a certified agreement and an enterprise flexibility agreement&mdash;which, as I referred to earlier, will ensure that the no disadvantage test applies too. On expiry of the certified agreements, it will continue; so the wages and conditions in a certified agreement covering workers will not disappear overnight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The corporations power is being used in this area in order to remove the requirement of an interstate dispute. There are significant protections to workers through these two types of agreements: a no disadvantage test; a right to union representation for union members; consent by a majority of employees; protection of unionists from discrimination; the right of unions to be heard&mdash;the non-unionised enjoy further protections&mdash;and refusal to register the agreements on public interest grounds. The commission can make orders that a party take actions consistent with bargaining in good faith&mdash;that is a particularly important aspect&mdash;and there is guidance in the act as to what constitutes good faith, such as attendance at agreed meetings, disclosure of relevant information, compliance with agreed commitments, not withdrawing or adding terms capriciously and not refusing to bargain with an organisation. So this issue of enterprise bargaining is a very important matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of principles that I want to deal with on the issue of enterprise bargaining. It is interesting to note that Justice Higgins, as he then was, said in 1915 in a very famous judgment:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the process of conciliation, with arbitration in the background, is substituted for the rude and barbarous process of strike and lockout. Reason is to displace force; the might of the State is to enhance peace between industrial combatants as well as between other combatants; and all in the interests of the public.</PARA>
<PARA>This is a very important quotation because I believe it underlines one of the important principles we have in industrial relations in this country. There are two propositions contained in this quote. The first is an empirical proposition that industrial tribunals will bring about an end to strikes and lockouts. The second proposition, which is more conceptual, is that the power of the state can and should be employed in industrial relations in the public interest. That is a particularly important principle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Arising from this debate over the last 10 years particularly is the fact that enterprise bargaining has been seen as a structural fix which has been part of the industrial relations debate but the move towards decentralisation and the focus on the enterprise have been important principles of discussion in industrial relations. However, there are a number of quite dramatically different interpretations particularly between the government and the Liberal and National parties as to how we define and implement enterprise bargaining. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition's argument, which is central to most of the debate that it has put forward, involves much more of an economic focus. Its theme includes the notions that industrial relations performance can be improved. This will lead to increases in the productivity of Australian firms and industries which will then be able to compete on international markets. This will overcome the balance of payments and&mdash;whoopee!&mdash;investment will result and our unemployment will go down dramatically. That is the central proposition of those opposite. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That proposition is based on a number of assumptions that I want to deal with very briefly in this debate. Firstly, it assumes that the labour market is the source of the current economic problems of this country and, indeed, of the world. It is not correct to assume that labour market problems are the source of our economic recession and associated problems. The problems of the economy are much more complex than what happens in the labour market. We have to look only at the international evidence in this regard. If we compare the economic indicators with the industrial relations systems in a number of overseas countries, we see that, at best, the evidence is very mixed and that industrial relations has a great deal to do with economic performance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will read the figures out to Senator McGauran. I glanced down the economic and financial indicators of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS> of last week. Let us look at unemployment in particular countries that have so-called free and flexible labour markets, such as the United Kingdom, which has an unemployment figure of 10.3 per cent. The United Kingdom has what would be defined as a totally free labour market in the sense that it now has no awards whatsoever to provide any safety mechanism for workers. Indeed, there is a range of rigorous repressive measures against the trade union movement in the United Kingdom, but it still has a 10.3 per cent unemployment rate. Why? If the vigorous reforms of the Thatcher era were so impressive and were to lead to such economic buoyancy, why have they not resulted in lower unemployment? This continuing argument that there is a link between unemployment and the labour market is largely a nonsense and a fiction.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The continual focus on enterprise bargaining is nothing new. Those people who have some knowledge of industrial relations would be aware that, over the last 90 years, while we have had a federal industrial relations system, there has always been very extensive focus on the enterprise. There are very significant over-award payments right through the economy. This issue of enterprise bargaining is nothing new. One of the arguments from the opposition and from employers is that enterprise bargaining will produce significant changes in attitude which will enhance common goals and interests. It is interesting to note the argument of the Business Council of Australia. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Shared interests are more likely to blossom where employees bargain as one unit and with a workplace focus.</PARA>
<PARA>The opposition shares that attitude. However, even the Business Council of Australia's publications tend to refute this argument that common goals and interests will blossom as a result of enterprise bargaining. The Business Council of Australia commissioned the National Institute of Labour Studies to conduct research into a small number of paired Australian and overseas&mdash;mainly American&mdash;companies. It did so in order to analyse the attitudes of the work forces when covered by multiple union and non-union managements. The National Institute of Labour Studies found:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a curious anomaly in the data. American managers seem more innovative in terms of motivating employees through pay and incentives and participative management. Yet Australian employees are more satisfied and committed to their organisations. The Australian industrial relations system seems to provide an atmosphere where both high job satisfaction and commitment to organisations and peers flourish. The system may also act to protect employees from poor styles of supervision.</PARA>
<PARA>That quotation is particularly important because it was sourced and commissioned by the Business Council and directly refutes the arguments of those opposite and the Business Council that, somehow, moving to enterprise bargaining will create a flourishing and blossoming of relationships at the enterprise level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth matter is an element that is often overlooked in the debate on industrial relations; that is, that there may be important transition costs which will need to be considered between employers, unions, employees and other interested parties. They will need to devote considerably more resources to this notion of enterprise bargaining. While larger companies and unions may have the expertise and personnel to manage such a movement&mdash;if they have not already moved in that direction, and many firms have not&mdash;many smaller to medium sized firms may not be so well placed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Senator Peter Cook was the responsible minister he tabled a labour studies report which indicated that only seven per cent of small firms in this country were interested in moving towards enterprise bargaining. Why? I contend that most small employers are not skilled or interested in direct negotiation with their employees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This brings me to the next point, which is a central and critical element in one of the failings of businesses today&mdash;that they may not have the managerial expertise, personnel or financial wherewithal. There is no doubt that, in attempting to improve our economy, we have become preoccupied in our industrial relations focus, to the neglect of other issues&mdash;one of which is the lack of management expertise in many firms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fifth issue, which is unclear but certainly has to be dealt with, is the reduction in the level of industrial conflict. It is correct to say that over the last 10 years, under this government, there has been a significant reduction in industrial disputes. The total abolition of the role of tribunals and unions in the negotiating process is championed by the more extreme members of the opposition, who advocate the so-called New Right position of the H.R. Nicholls Society. They say that unions and arbitration have no place in the workplace. That is a two-sided coin; a two-edged sword. In a booming labour market, they say they are advocating&mdash;I do not believe they advocate it seriously&mdash;that the power of the marketplace, the power of force, those who have the greatest might, shall prevail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite want to ensure that there is a set of draconian laws&mdash;including no right to strike, sections 45D and 45E&mdash;and a set of draconian interventions in this so-called free labour market to restrict unions and employees when they do have the upper hand in the bargaining process. That is a consistent theme of the New Right. I believe the ultimate goal of the Business Council of Australia and the opposition is a union-free workplace as the final solution to industrial relations. They are the issues that I wanted to touch on in dealing with enterprise bargaining. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have also touched on the central issue of the so-called flexibility in the labour market that allegedly will deliver low unemployment. I referred to the economists' figures for the United Kingdom which are clear evidence that this simply does not happen. There is a range of other issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite refer continually to Asia. They say that we should be basing and modelling ourselves on our international competitors. But many aspects of the Asian economy are very unlike those in Australia. Whilst wage differentials in Asia are significantly different from Australia&mdash;usually below&mdash;they are catching up quickly; they are no longer cheap wage economies. Certainly Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore have had significant increases in their wage levels over the last three or four decades. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, importantly, there is a vastly different social structure in these countries. They do not enjoy pension entitlements or workers' compensation entitlements&mdash;the sorts of social structures that are provided by government in this country because of the nature of our society and family structure. In most parts of Asia those services are provided via a family structure. So it is not a valid comparison to make in continually referring to our Asian competitors.

I urge the federal minister, who has done a very good job in this debate despite some significant difficulties, to ensure that the provisions of the federal legislation override the provisions of the Tasmanian legislation which provides no protection for workers as part of workplace bargaining. That was evidenced recently in a Supreme Court appeal of a decision by Commissioner Johnson, the workplace commissioner in Tasmania. I believe that where states do not provide decent protection for their work forces the federal legislation should override that state legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Industrial Relations Reform Bill 1993 is nothing more than a pay-off from the government to the trade union movement for the role which the union movement played in supporting the campaign of lies embarked upon by the Australian Labor Party during the last election campaign with regard to the policies of the Liberal and National parties. This legislation therefore demonstrates, as I will show in a moment, that not only is this government incompetent but also it is corrupt.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen another example of that corruption recently in Minister Kelly's sports rorts. As I say, that corruption is reinforced by this legislation. Why else would this legislation fall so dismally short of delivering the much heralded new era in industrial relations that was promised by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in his speech to the Institute of Directors on 21 April this year?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two to 2 1/2 weeks ago, I was part of the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training which examined this legislation. As I said in the debate in this chamber on the report of that committee, in support of the dissenting report of Senator Crane and me, the overwhelming evidence presented to that committee was that this legislation fails dismally to deliver what the Prime Minister promised. It is clear of course why the Prime Minister has broken yet another promise. He has had to provide the unions with a pay-off for their election support. He has had to bow to the demands of the ACTU with regard to this bill. Nothing could make that clearer than what Jennie George said after the federal election in a debate with Bryan Noakes from the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we won the election in March and this bill is a pay back for the commitments that were made by the government in the course of that election campaign.</PARA>
<PARA>Clearly, there is the example of corruption embodied in this legislation. But we also ought to remember the incompetence associated with this legislation. In the other place 170 amendments to this legislation were introduced at the last minute. Those amendments were introduced after our committee had given consideration to this legislation. So that committee did not have any opportunity to look at the proposed amendments. One hundred and seventy amendments were introduced in the House of Representatives and guillotined through there. It is clear that this bill is a capitulation by the government to the demands of the trade union movement. It therefore represents a gross dereliction of duty on the part of the government in providing legislation in this form for a sectional interest rather than legislating for the community as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to consider the comments of the Labor senators who have so far taken part in the debate. Last night we heard Senator Carr, Senator Childs and Senator Murphy, and this morning we have heard Senator Sherry. Almost to a man, they have not attempted to defend this legislation. At least they have been honest about the legislation, unlike the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton), who seeks to create a fantasy about this legislation's capacity to promote and develop enterprise bargaining and get genuine enterprise agreements. We have not had any of that fantasy from the honourable senators debating the legislation in this place. They told us the truth about the legislation&mdash;what it is really about. It is about protecting the interests of trade unions and protecting and maintaining our current outmoded system of industrial relations in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Carr referred to the Higgins model&mdash;the model of industrial relations that we have had in Australia for most of this century. Of course, that model was based on the 19th century experiences of workers and employers and, as I said, was introduced early this century. It is a system of industrial relations which has largely been responsible for Australia's standard of living in terms of per capita income falling from the highest in the world&mdash;Australia was the richest country in the world at the turn of the century&mdash;to now being well down on the international table of economic wellbeing. That system is outdated and needs urgent replacement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Carr also claimed that businesses and employers wanted an industrial relations system based on making employees fear the sack. That is errant nonsense. Nothing could make employees fear the sack more than this bill because of the detrimental effect it will have on the capacity of employers to maintain employment and to provide jobs. Certainly, the only people who will not fear the sack under this legislation are those who will not get jobs because of the inhibiting effect this legislation will have on the capacity of business to grow and create employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole of the speech of Senator Childs was devoted to the capacity of this legislation to provide protections for workers. There were no claims in Senator Childs's speech that this legislation was going to provide greater flexibility with regard to industrial relations. In fact, he argued strongly against enterprise agreements. In particular, he argued that women were the losers under such a system of industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind him of the experience of the female textile workers in Sydney some time ago who sought to change their hours of work so that they could conveniently fit it in with their family responsibilities. They wanted to start and finish work earlier in the day so that they could be home from work to care for their children when they arrived home. They reached that agreement with their employer but then the textile workers union and Anna Booth got into the act and said, `You can't do that. That's contrary to the award. That's breaking down hard-won gains by the union movement'. So that whole agreement was overturned by the intervention of the trade unions. Women lost out because of the restrictions of the current structure. They were going to gain by an enterprise agreement, by the bargain they had reached with the employer; but, as soon as the union and the existing bureaucratic structure got involved, they lost out on that flexibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All we heard from Senator Murphy was a gross misrepresentation of the jobsback policy of the federal coalition. This morning we again heard Senator Sherry laud the outdated Higgins approach to industrial relations. He put up a straw man as far as the Liberal Party's understanding of enterprise bargaining and enterprise agreements is concerned, which he then sought to knock down. He also claimed that employers wanted to restrict employees in the negotiating process for enterprise agreements. Employers and this side of politics want some balance in the system. Senator Sherry ignored the fact that, under our approach to industrial relations, whatever restrictions apply to the trade union movement and to employees would also apply to employers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In contrast, this legislation is extremely one-sided and gives special privileges to the trade union movement. Senator Sherry also tried to argue that there is no relationship between the structure of the labour market and employment levels. Certainly, the labour market is not the only factor that determines employment levels, but it flies in the face of reality and of experience to attempt to argue that there is no relationship between the structure of the labour market and employment levels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last night we also heard Senator Bell's address on behalf of the Australian Democrats. He clearly showed that he swallowed hook, line and sinker the fantasy the minister has tried to create as far as this legislation is concerned. In fact, he probably made a better fist of defending the government's legislation than we have heard from the government's own senators. In particular, he indicated his support for trade unions and their involvement in enterprise bargaining, irrespective of whether those trade unions have any members in the workplace involved with that particular enterprise agreement&mdash;one of the strong objections that the coalition has to this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that the legislation is excessively prescriptive and interventionist on the development of a flexible approach to industrial relations and a genuine development of enterprise agreements and, therefore, does not provide any incentive or encouragement to improve the direct relationship between employers and employees in their negotiating process. The opposition believes that the legislation is heading in exactly the wrong direction as far as getting a more flexible industrial relations system is concerned. It does that in three particular areas: firstly, by increasing trade union power by removing sections 45D and 45E from the Trade Practices Act, where they are competent in preventing secondary boycotts, and putting those sections into the industrial relations legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the legislation increases union power by requiring that trade unions be consulted on the conduct and achievement of enterprise agreements if one member in a particular workplace belongs to a trade union. Even where no employees in a particular workplace are union members, the trade union still has the right to appear before the Industrial Relations Commission when that enterprise agreement goes before the commission for ratification. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, the legislation increases trade union power by having a sanction-free period during which enterprise agreements are negotiated, which in effect confirms a definite right to strike on the part of trade unions irrespective of the damage that that industrial action might cause to a particular business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation is also heading in the wrong direction by making enterprise agreements much more difficult to achieve. It does that by requiring, firstly, that an award be in place before an enterprise agreement can be struck; secondly, that an industrial dispute exists; thirdly, that there be no disadvantage, so that in effect enterprise agreements will be nothing more than over-award agreements; and fourthly, as I have already mentioned, that both trade unions and the Industrial Relations Commission be involved in the establishment of these enterprise agreements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ultimate folly of this legislation is that there is a requirement for an industrial dispute to exist before an employer and his or her employees can strike an enterprise agreement. They cannot simply get together and say, `Let's do a deal. Let's establish work arrangements that will improve our productivity, which will improve the competitiveness of our particular business, and which will benefit me, the employer, and you, the employees'. The employer cannot get his employees together and work that out. He has got to actually create a dispute with them before he can go ahead and establish that enterprise agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That highlights the nonsense of this legislation. So in the context of those two particular aspects&mdash;the increase in union power involved and the greater difficulty in reaching enterprise agreements, which will be inherent in this legislation&mdash;the legislation has many individual shortcomings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Four particular shortcomings stand out in the legislation. The first of those shortcomings is the removal of sections 45D and 45E from the Trade Practices Act, which I have already referred to in brief; the second is the specific provisions relating to the establishment of enterprise agreements; the third is the use of the International Labour Organisation conventions and recommendations to establish minimum employment standards; and the fourth is the establishment of the Industrial Court to deal with industrial matters replacing the industrial division of the Federal Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This clearly demonstrates that this is legislation for a minority. It is legislation for trade union leaders. It is scandalous in the context that this government is legislating for a group which leads less than 30 per cent of the work force in the private sector of this country. That shows again the sectional nature of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it is no wonder that employers, especially small businessmen, are increasingly concerned about this legislation. But it is not only small businessmen who have recently expressed their concern. Towards the end of last week we heard two of the most senior businessmen in this country, both of whom have served on government advisory organisations, express their concern at this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first of those was Mr Ian Webber, the chief executive of Mayne Nickless. In one address last week he voiced his concern by saying that he believed that business did not understand the full implications of the legislation and had not been vocal enough in criticising it. He went on to call on the Minister for Industrial Relations, Mr Brereton, to tear up this legislation and start again. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think business has not fully appreciated the extent of the fine print in this Bill and they may not even fully appreciate some of the legislative effects.</PARA>
<PARA>Hugh Morgan of Western Mining made similar statements. I have also received a letter from the chief executive officer of one of the major automotive component manufacturers, a national firm based in South Australia. He said:</PARA>

Please continue to do whatever you can to prevent this legislation from passing in its present form.</PARA>
<PARA>I have received many letters from small businessmen throughout Australia, including my own state of South Australia. We have received upward of 300 letters from small businessmen expressing their concern about the effect of this legislation on small business and the impact that it will have. I will quote from some of those:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are a typical small business employing 10. None are, or want to be union members, but all are cared for on a personal basis and paid above award (in most cases substantially).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have carefully studied the proposed Amendment Bill . . . and have grave reservations about the potential impact of certain aspects on our business. These include:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.The unbelievable complexity of the process required to establish an enterprise flexibility agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.Notification of terms of a EFA to relevant unions, which potentially exposes us to their interference.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.Inflexibility of the `no disadvantage test', which if applied arbitrarily would prevent trading certain benefits for others, and may even be applied to above award payments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.The possibility of us being roped into an industry-wide certified agreement which is aimed at securing increased wages and benefits from those who can pay and has nothing to do with increased productivity or increased employment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.Much greater powers given to unions including the `right to strike', supposedly to fulfil Australia's international obligations, although the `right to strike' was never meant to apply where compulsory independent arbitration exists.</PARA>
<PARA>I have letter after letter expressing similar concerns and raising further concerns about various aspects of this legislation. I could quote from them at length, and they warrant quoting from. It is only a lack of time that prevents me from doing so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Undoubtedly, the government is shoring up the position of trade unions with this legislation. In addition, the government will be funding, with taxpayers' money, the training of union organisers in the art of recruiting members to trade unions. It was highlighted in an article in the press yesterday that for the first time there will be formal training of union organisers in the art of recruitment. Part of that training process will be undertaken by the Trade Union Training Authority, funded by the federal government with taxpayers' money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The trade union movement in the private sector is continuing to decline in numbers because it is not providing a service to its members. For that reason, the taxpayers will now be funding the training of union organisers in recruitment of more members. Who will be advising them on this matter? It will be Tas Bull, formerly of the Waterside Workers Federation, and Tom McDonald of the Building Workers Industrial Union&mdash;two typical union thugs who have caused so much damage to Australia's capacity to be productive and to our international reputation as a trading nation. They will be telling the union organisers how to behave as thugs&mdash;how to force people into unions when they do not want to be members.

His ideology is based on the belief that the system cannot work unless employers have an unfettered control, unless they can hire, fire and set conditions without anybody else being involved&mdash;certainly without employees being involved because they do not have brains; they leave them behind at the work gate&mdash;with no-one to make sure that the contract is fair.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Exploitation does not occur in Senator Chapman's ideology or in the ideology of the Liberal-National parties opposite. It is a system based on an inability to countenance the involvement of unions, unless those unions are supine, ineffective and powerless. That is fine. The opposition says, `If you have got powerless unions, we accept them; if they show any sort of guts at all,'&mdash;which a union ought to do if it is representing its members&mdash;`we don't want a bar of it'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To talk of Tas Bull and people such as him as thugs is a disgrace. It shows no capacity to understand the contribution that that man and many others in the union movement have made towards the restructuring of the economy of this country. Tas Bull led the charge in waterfront reform. He was central in reforming that industry in a way in which people did not believe it could be reformed. The whole position that Senator Chapman takes, which, as I have said, encapsulates the ideology of the opposition, is amazing in its irrelevance to the needs of a modern economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By contrast, I believe that this bill marks one of the greatest achievements in the 10-year history of this government. It will ensure that Australia has an industrial relations system which is fair, adaptable and efficient. It also provides the Australian people with an opportunity to compare this government's approach with that of the Liberal and National parties. It is particularly appropriate that this bill is before the Commonwealth parliament when other Liberal-National Party state governments are legislating to destroy the award safety net in their parliaments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my own state of Western Australia, for example, the Court government has introduced laws which give employers power over employees' wages and conditions, which they have not possessed for 90 years. They are punitive laws modelled on those in New Zealand and Victoria. They are based on an outdated philosophy which seeks to give employers the power to dictate employment conditions save for an obligation to provide a few so-called minimum conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a system which enshrines the old 19th century concept of employer prerogative based on a conflict model of industrial relations rather than the model upon which this bill is based, a concept of partnership in which both parties&mdash;the employers and the employees&mdash;not only have rights, but they also have responsibilities to each other. The bill before us will greatly assist in restoring employees' capacity to effectively bargain with their employer, with the help of their union, for those employees unable to gain the full protection of the federal award system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One can only speculate where the Liberal and National parties got their current industrial relations policies from. Perhaps it was the United States where many employees have to exist on a very low minimum wage of $5 or $6 a hour which, in the United States, does not go far. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You would like that, Senator. Some employers, particularly in the hospitality industry, are not even obliged to pay those minimums. Even in the United States, however, employees and their unions have statutory rights guaranteeing that employers recognise unions and bargain in good faith. Even in the land of free enterprise, employees and unions have a right to strike in the bargaining process, and immunity from civil action during that period.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the source was the United Kingdom where Margaret Thatcher legislated to restrict trade union activities while at the same time her policies wiped out much of Britain's manufacturing industry. But even in the UK unions have a right to strike and freedom from civil suit in many circumstances. Bargaining in good faith is also enshrined in its system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only the Liberal and National parties would legislate for an industrial relations system which any tin-pot Third World dictatorship would be proud of. That is the sort of legislation we have seen already in Western Australia and Victoria, which we could characterise as the Jurassic Parks of industrial relations. The Industrial Relations Reform Bill will overturn some of the worst aspects of those laws and restore a fair and open system for Australia in the 21st century. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will detail some of the provisions of the WA legislation and show how the Commonwealth legislation will redress the imbalances and injustices that WA workers face under these state laws. Perhaps the most iniquitous aspect of the WA minimum conditions of employment legislation is the power given to the minister for labour relations to set minimum wages. Honourable senators can imagine the howls of protest which would arise if the Minister for Health could arbitrarily set the medical benefits schedule fee with no consultation with or reference to the medical profession. Under the WA act, however, the minister can set whatever minimum wage he wishes. He is not obliged to consult with anyone or anybody, not even the employers. He is not required to give reasons for his decision. He is the Caesar of salaries, and his decree is law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the Industrial Relations Reform Bill, WA employees will have access to the Australian Industrial Court, which will set them fair wages. The Industrial Court process will be open and accountable; its decisions will be reasoned and based on evidence presented in open proceedings. The IRC will take into account the needs of employees and their families, and similar factors it uses in deciding awards in industries. The contrast between the imperial decrees of a WA Liberal minister and the IRC processes are stark. It is a contrast between an arbitrary and capricious politicised process and one which guarantees natural justice to all parties, and in the integrity of a system in which the public can have confidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One can further illustrate the quaintly outmoded coalition industrial relations policies by reference to the substantial power that the WA laws give to employers to sack employees who refuse to forgo or bargain away their existing state award conditions. Ian Viner QC, a former Liberal industrial relations minister, summarised his findings in his recent joint legal opinion on the Workplace Agreements Bill:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation does not protect prospective employees who wish to be employed pursuant to an award rather than a workplace agreement in circumstances where the prospective employer requires that they enter into a workplace agreement as a precondition to employment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation does not protect employees who have entered into workplace agreements in circumstances where their employer threatens to dismiss them from their employment by notice, in accordance with their contract of employment, for the purpose of compelling them to accept less favourable terms and conditions of employment in a new workplace agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation does not protect employees in circumstances where their employer threatens to dismiss them from their employment by notice, in accordance with their contract of employment, for the purpose of compelling them to accept the terms and conditions of employment in a workplace agreement proposed by the employer, except in the situation where an employer has not previously entered into a workplace agreement. Whether the employee is actually protected will depend upon the particular circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The legislation does not protect employees if their employer dismisses all its work force by notice, advertises their jobs and then employs only those persons, including the former employees, who are willing to enter into a workplace agreement on the terms and conditions specified by the employer.</PARA>
<PARA>Both Ian Viner and the opinion's co-author, Rene Lemiere, are well-respected members of the Perth independent bar. Their opinion is a careful and reasoned analysis of the law. It reveals that employees who want to retain state award coverage can be forced off their award and onto individual contracts containing no more than the minimum conditions set by a minister. That is not the straw man that Senator Chapman just referred to; the man he accused Senator Sherry of setting up to knock over. This is fact; this is law and is currently being applied in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a massive inequality of bargaining power under the WA legislation. In a period of high unemployment, few employees will be able to resist employer pressure to surrender their award. Fewer will be able to afford the legal costs involved in challenging their employer. The Industrial Relations Reform Bill ensures that any WA employee who is dismissed will have access to the new Industrial Relations Court, which can decide the fairness of any dismissal. The court can order reinstatement of an unfairly dismissed employee, and the bill also provides substantial protection from dismissal on a range of grounds, including temporary absence from work, from illness or injury, and absence from work during maternity or paternity leave. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most cynical provisions of the Western Australian legislation is that which requires employers who intend to dismiss redundant employees to give their employees eight hours off work to look for another job. That is it. For example, a middle aged long-serving employee with a family to support can be given two weeks notice or pay in lieu and be told that he can have tomorrow off to job hunt. This provision reflects the mean spirited, greedy and insensitive philosophy behind the Western Australian legislation, which is supported by those opposite. It is bad enough that employees in the metropolitan area of Perth get one day to try to organise their working life, but it may take workers in country areas, which Senator Panizza represents and where there is no access to CES offices, eight hours simply to drive to the nearest office, let alone reorganise their lives and those of their families. The Commonwealth bill will guarantee retrenched employees minimum periods of notice, ranging up to four weeks for those with more than five years service. Those employees over 45 years of age will receive an extra week to reflect their special needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth bill also ensures that parents who take leave will be able to return to the same position they held when they took that leave. Under the state legislation the right to return to work is merely subject to the `availability' of a position. The provision is vague in the extreme. It offers a convenient escape for employers who want to rid themselves of employees with family responsibilities who take leave. The Industrial Relations Reform Bill will restore certainty and security to families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now wish to turn to some general comments about the philosophy underlying the approach the Liberal and National parties have adopted in industrial relations in the 1990s. Perhaps `philosophy' is too gentle a term to describe what motivates these policies. We have here, manifested particularly in Victoria and Western Australia, an intention to institutionalise massive inequalities of bargaining power in a period of high unemployment. The conservatives' legislation provides virtually no role for unions; it enables employers to apply their extensive financial and legal powers on individual employees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As in New Zealand and Victoria, employees will be presented with pre-printed contracts of employment with conditions determined solely by the employer. There will be as much negotiation in these cases as there is if a consumer goes to a bank and asks for a Bankcard loan. The individual small borrower would be laughed out the doors of the bank if he or she tried to negotiate a lower interest rate. The same inequality of bargaining power exists in most workplaces, and the result would be the same. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recently visited New Zealand. As I went around, I purposely questioned numerous people about this and I found that the vast majority of them had had contracts presented to them by the employer on a sign or leave basis. They were all pre-prepared, with no negotiation and no consultation at all with the employees or the unions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note the euphemisms employed to describe this crude contractual process. The term `bargaining' is used to disguise what is in truth the imposition of terms and conditions over which most individual employees will have no control. `Flexibility' in the Liberal lexicon is code for wholesale reduction in wages and conditions and the restoration of total employer control over every aspect of the workplace&mdash;or the return, as I have said before, to the old and outdated concept of managerial prerogative, a term dear to the heart of the Western Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, at whose bidding the Western Australian bill was introduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Industrial Relations Reform Bill cuts through this Liberal Party obfuscation and euphemism to expose the reality of its industrial relations policy. There are many other features of the bill which will expedite the resolution of disputes and bring Australia's industrial relation laws into line with those of other nations who regard themselves as modern, not those who are trying to trip back into the 19th century. The bill reaffirms Labor's commitment to a system of genuine workplace bargaining supported by a substantial safety net of basic conditions. For those workers forced out of their state award systems under Liberal legislation, it provides access to an independent and fair tribunal to set their wages and safeguard them against unfair dismissals. I urge the Senate to support the bill. </PARA>

I attended that parliamentary delegation with Senator Beahan, and we must have been in two different countries. Frankly, the New Zealand industrial relations system, the enterprise bargaining system, is held up to be a great success, and we were told of that by employers and employees. Senator Beahan has defended Tas Bull and defended our waterfront practices, and that is indefensible. He has been telling us that the New Zealand experiment on enterprise bargaining is not a success. So, he is speaking with a political slant. He is not presenting the issue in its true light; he is not debating the issue as it ought to be debated in this forum. He has just given the government line, the government brief, and been quite misleading in so doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prior to Senator Beahan, Senator Sherry spoke for the government side. I do not think we can let pass Senator Sherry's limp defence of the Industrial Relations Reform Bill. As my colleague Senator Chapman pointed out, Senator Sherry put up a straw man by quoting the English experience. We are not here to defend England or any other nation. We are running our own industrial relations and are debating our own Industrial Relations Reform Bill. We are running our own sovereign government, regardless of what the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) would have us believe. We are not here to defend other nations or to overly examine their systems, because each system is different, nation by nation. We know that. Senator Sherry put up the straw man by saying that during the Thatcher years the United Kingdom entered the realms of genuine enterprise bargaining, or a totally de-regulated system, and yet, as Senator Sherry tell us, it still had a high unemployment rate of 10 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Sherry quoted outdated figures from <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Economist</EMPHASIS> but, putting that aside, he failed to explain that the United Kingdom had faced decades of bad work practices, and it is still going through a transition and making those adjustments. But, worse than that, the United Kingdom is right on the doorstep of Europe, which is facing the worst recession since the 1930s. Frankly, it is cutting far deeper than it is here in Australia. I know this country is suffering greatly with its one million unemployed, but England and the rest of Europe is worse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Sherry failed to tell us that France has an unemployment rate of 12 to 15 per cent. Of course, he skipped over America, which has a very similar system to that in the United Kingdom and which has an unemployment rate of six per cent. We cannot compare apples and oranges. That is what Senator Sherry was trying to do. Even so, the unemployment rate in England would be far worse if it were not on the doorstep of Europe, which is facing its worst recession. We all know that England, being such a small country, is very export orientated and does not have strong commodity prices for its exports or a strong domestic market. I cannot tell honourable senators off the top of my head what the unemployment rate is in Germany, but I venture to say that it is greater than 15 per cent.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once, now a very long time ago, the award system was not such a subject of debate in this country.

Quite frankly, we no longer have that luxury and we can no longer afford that luxury. Our backs are to the wall. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the government and the unions have any concern or any heart for the unemployed, not just for the employed, they would allow the introduction of genuine employer and employee bargaining systems. Yet, incredibly, this legislation fails through a twisted path of ambivalent language, false perception and cumbersome structures. It would have been better if the government had left the system alone than to have introduced this so-called reform system. The legislation places an even greater block on the creation of employment for the great pool of unemployed in this country. It is accepted as a matter of commonsense by both sides of the house, the media, employer groups, such as the Business Council of Australia, and even the Treasury, that, if Australia is to pull itself towards a higher level of international competitiveness, it is vital to provide enterprise bargaining solutions to enterprise based problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet all this bill does is spread the old combative, rigid union power structures even more than before, at a time when large and small companies are scratching for every possible productivity gain to keep themselves in the marketplace.

That is a simple fact of business life which is very much lost on the government and the unions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just prior to the introduction of this bill, the existing system of so-called enterprise bargaining, now to be replaced by the bill before the Senate, was never successful in freeing up the marketplace and producing productivity gains for business. It provided no more than the award being the base rate, and any agreements that were made were to be over-award payments. After all, these conditions were written into the charter of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. While this system maintained all its rigidities, it was seen and hoped to be but the first step in freeing up the system. It was the first signal to an entrenched and bloody-minded union movement that Australia needed desperately to change its industrial relations laws. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Paul Keating addressed the Institute of Directors in April, employers were persuaded that he could deliver the goods. Other factors gave employers grounds for hope. Few really believed that the Prime Minister would deliver such a landmark speech in April on industrial relations without the blessing of the ACTU and Mr Bill Kelty. Moreover, his choice of Laurie Brereton as Minister for Industrial Relations suggested to some employers that the Prime Minister wanted to counter the ACTU's influence on policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Key sections of the bureaucracy, notably Treasury, have argued for a more flexible system of enterprise bargaining. It is little wonder that employers were so optimistic this time round. Instead, the union movement proved what we have all known in this country for a very long time: they are in charge. What could be more profound than the statement made in the media by Jennie George while debating the contents of the bill. This has been referred to by many speakers on this side of the house before, but it warrants repeating. Straight after the election, she said:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a great pleasure to follow Senator McGauran who has some practical knowledge of good industrial relations in the workplace. The Industrial Relations Reform Bill returns to the totally discredited 1987 Industrial Relations Bill which was withdrawn and reduces the protection available for employers against primary and secondary boycotts. It does so by restricting access both to common law and to the seriously weakened anti-boycott provisions, which have been transferred from the Trade Practices Act to the Industrial Relations Act, and by setting up a special labour court.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition utterly opposes this bill. It should be withdrawn and we will do all we can to amend it or delay its passage through the Senate. It was forced through the House of Representatives without amendment on 22 November. Unfortunately, with the support of the Australian Democrats and the Greens, it will pass substantially here, but hopefully with amendments. Like other opposition senators, my fax is running hot from small businesses worried sick by this legislation. I urge the Greens and the Democrats to acknowledge the concerns of worried and decent Australian employers who are already burdened enough with Labor incompetence and industrial relations featherbedding. I have taken a few excerpts out of letters to demonstrate how small business people perceive this disastrous bill:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government does not have a mandate from the people to enter into secret negotiations with the trade union movement, which will result in serious consequences upon the nation as a whole; employment levels and the economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill will give unions too much power and restrict small business confidence seriously.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will bash on the head any remaining incentive for me to employ&mdash;and I'm not Robinson Crusoe!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill, when uncloaked, is a radical piece of proposed legislation which if passed, will strip business proprietors and employees of basic contractual rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill gives everything to the unions, and takes everything away from employers, particularly business confidence which this country so badly needs right now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill places all the privilege with the unions, leaving small business&mdash;the spearhead of economic advancement and increased employment&mdash;defenceless.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill will put unions above the law in matters of strikes, boycotts and will discriminate against the majority of workers who are non-unionists.</PARA>
<PARA>These are mere samples of the concerns raised with me over this legislation. Labor will never attempt to govern for all Australians. I think that is perfectly clear from those letters. It rules only for its mates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the surface, the bill does provide for the making of industrial agreements. However, the bill provides unions with immunity from almost any legal liability, both civil and criminal, during the negotiation of a certified agreement. This immunity period will be initiated by the union and could extend for two years or longer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As awards will become less comprehensive and more of a safety net, employees will be expected by the unions to make an enterprise agreement to cover their business. Though agreements are supposed to be voluntary, this will be an added pressure to enter into an agreement. Because of the period of immunity from liability, the relevant union will more readily be able to impose its will on employers without any restraint whatsoever from the Industrial Relations Commission and will be given the right to appear at the hearing for application for registration of the agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effective emasculation of section 45D of the Trade Practices Act will encourage boycotts to be used more frequently. Section 45D of the Trade Practices Act was effective and had quick results, as the very threat of such action brought many critical situations to a quick conclusion. A strike or primary boycott will be made completely legal in most cases. Even if a case can be made to satisfy the new watered down boycott provisions, employers will have to wait three days before they can obtain a certificate from the Industrial Relations Commission to enable them to begin legal action. By this time, many small businesses will be in severe financial difficulty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is described as an industrial relations reform bill but anyone who has looked at it and what it proposes&mdash;and debate has gone on in the community in the past month&mdash;will recognise that far from being an industrial relations reform bill, it is a trade union payback bill. This bill is paying back the trade union movement for the enormous and bigoted support it gave the government in March. This is a payback to the social and economic dinosaurs, best shown in this place by Senator Carr in his contribution last night. I include Senator Burns in that, too. The people he champions&mdash;or should I say patronises&mdash;are in the unionised work force in Victoria. Senator Carr views all workers as insipid, weak or exploited and all employers as greedy grubs. The trouble with the likes of Senator Carr is that he has not produced one dollar of wealth in his life. He is an example of the worst sort of modern Labor do-gooder. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have one million unemployed. What a legacy to the union movement and a Labor government that is. It is the 10-year partnership that has been trumpeted between Labor and the unions which has shamefully created the economic situation we are in now. There is no getting away from that. This bill is an 11th hour attempt to regain some respectability. Contrary to what Senator Murphy said last night, the freeing up of wages and the industrial relations system, as proposed by the coalition, would have increased productivity and competition and, more importantly, the number of jobs; jobs for almost all the one million people out of work today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How can the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, claim to represent the interests of working men and women in Australia when he has allowed Australia's industrial relations agenda to be hijacked by the Zegna-suited union bosses now demanding their payback? Labor has aided and abetted them in this process. The Industrial Relations Bill that we are debating today will hand back considerable power to the trade unions. The Minister for Industrial Relations, Mr Brereton, was rolled completely on enterprise bargaining. The terms are as laid down by the new labour union bosses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government pours taxpayers' dollars into the trade union movement and trade unions. In return, it gets support in its election campaigns. The Vice-President of the ACTU, Jennie George&mdash;Senator McGauran also quoted what she had said, but the words are worth repeating&mdash;said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What the employers have got to understand is that we won the election&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>absolute power corrupts&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">in March and this bill is a pay back for the commitments that were made by the government in the course of that election campaign.</PARA>
<PARA>That is incredible. This bill will choke moves towards the true enterprise bargaining that is vital for this country to return to economic prosperity. It will make it harder and more expensive for employers to hire labour at a time when we are experiencing near record unemployment levels. This government cannot understand that until it frees up wages and the labour market, the economy will stagnate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor support for compulsory unionism is undemocratic and full of humbug. The coalition's position at the last election was that we would have made it voluntary to be a member of a union, and those who joined unions would have been protected against victimisation. We would have prohibited the closed shop and removed union preference clauses in awards and agreements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by saying that it is little wonder that union membership has been in continual decline. Workers are sick and tired of being bullied by heavy-handed unions which have only delivered higher and higher unemployment. Recent figures show that workplaces with fewer than 10 employees have only 16.3 per cent unionism; those with between 10 and 19 employees have 29.8 per cent unionism; those with between 20 and 29 employees have 46.1 per cent unionism; and workplaces with greater than 100 employees have 57.6 per cent unionism. Despite that, 67 per cent of the private sector workplaces have no union members at all. The game is up for the union movement in its present form. It knows it, workers know it and all Australians know it. It is a throwback to a more sinister time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the Industrial Relations Reform Bill but I indicate that the Australian Democrats have a number of amendments which we believe would improve it significantly. My colleague Senator Bell will present those at a later time. I, too, have received many faxes on this issue. In my contribution I will analyse a number of these faxes which have come from a particular and peculiar source. I do not want to simply sample the faxes, as Senator Sandy Macdonald has done, but to analyse in depth what they say.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was also lobbied fairly extensively by a number of people who are also represented in those faxes. Many of these people come from a Christian sect known as the Exclusive Brethren. The emphasis must be on `exclusive' because they view the world as being totally hostile to them and believe in total separation from the world, except for the points at which it suits them to have contact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They have a total right to pursue their own beliefs. There is no debate about that. But they do not have a right to impose those beliefs on the rest of the country; and certainly not to impose those beliefs on other Christians who do not agree with their particular and peculiar interpretation of scripture.

<PARA>That is the tone of many of the faxes which I have received.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator O'Chee and those opposite need to understand this when they quote the faxes which have been received, because if they understood where those faxes were coming from I do not think even they would believe the kind of position which the people sending those faxes actually represent. I respect the right of these people to hold their opinions and to put their opinions to me, but I reject their understanding of the trade union movement and especially the way that they use scripture to support their opinion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to their use of scripture and quote particularly from one of the faxes from a business called Civiquip. One of the statements it makes is `Government is of God'. It uses a passage from Paul's letter to the Romans, chapter 13, verses 1 to 10. In this passage, Paul argues that it is the duty of citizens to obey state authorities. He is arguing that this supports the orderly functioning of society. It is a letter he wrote to Christians in Rome at a particular time&mdash;known as the Pax Romana&mdash;when there was great stability throughout the Mediterranean world, and at a time which allowed St Paul and other Christian missionaries to travel extensively in that part of the world in order to spread their message. Paul, as a Roman citizen, appealed on a number of occasions to the Roman emperor for protection from Jewish authorities whom he saw as persecuting him. So this is the context of the statement by Paul that citizens ought to obey the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the same passage, he also talks of that obedience as being in the context of loving one another and of loving one's neighbour as oneself&mdash;in other words, government can operate to support the mutual relationship of citizens, one with another, and to support neighbourliness. Paul's experience at that time, as the background to the writing of this letter, was very positive with regard to government and the Roman Empire. Unfortunately, it was not many years before Paul's experience turned very sour indeed as, under the new Roman emperor, Nero, Christians were not only persecuted but many of them were executed, including Paul himself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Eventually, from that position of being seen to be supporting good government within Rome, Christians came to be regarded as the worst of citizens. The requirement of Roman citizens under Nero was that they make a small sacrifice each year and declare that `Caesar is Lord'. Of course, the Christians' declaration was `Christ is Lord', and because of that they were seen to be very bad citizens who should be excluded from the empire. Many of them were excluded and killed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">About 40 years after the writing of Paul's letter to the Romans, the Book of Revelation was written. By this time, this benign Roman Empire had become the whore of Babylon and a horrible beast. The point I am trying to make is that one simply cannot transfer scripture across thousands of years without first understanding the historical background from which it comes. Government is of God to the extent that it supports the relationships based on the love of neighbour. In that light this legislation can be judged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second statement which is made is that unionism is not of God. There is no biblical reference given because the trade union movement is a relatively modern concept which had no equivalent at all in biblical times. But I would like to point to a couple of historical examples where Christians, because of their faith, became very involved in the trade union movement. One which is very important to me is the incident of the Tolpuddle martyrs. They were six Methodist lay preachers who, because of their training within the Methodist church as leaders and lay preachers, also became union organisers amongst farm labourers in England in the 19th century. They were arrested for belonging to an illegal association and were transported as convicts to Australia. They certainly understood that trade unionism was an expression of their faith. I point to the Australian experience where for many years Roman Catholics, particularly Irish Catholics, were very much at the forefront of the labour movement because of the oppression that they suffered here in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am trying to underline that, as a Christian, I believe the trade union movement has delivered many benefits. But it is not perfect. I have some problems at times with some of the actions of the trade union movement, but, like any human institution or like any of us as human beings, we have both bad and good within our lives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to another reference which occurred time and time again in many of the faxes. I hope that the opposition really understands what this reference is saying because it is about master-servant relationships. The biblical passage is Colossians 3:22 to Colossians 4:1. The passage is not talking about master-servant relationships. The word in most of the modern English translations is the Greek word `doulos', which means `slave'. So it is talking about master-slave relationships. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The background to this passage was the conversion of hundreds, perhaps thousands, of slaves within the Roman Empire at the time when Paul wrote his letter. The question which came to Paul was: what do I do about this? Do I tell the slaves that they should revolt against their masters? He did not, in his own wisdom, make that decision. He told the slaves that they should remain in the service of their masters. To the masters, he then wrote `be fair and just in the way you treat your slaves'. Ultimately, Christians such as William Wilberforce and John Wesley opposed the slave trade and it was finally overthrown. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I want to make is that this passage has little application to industrial relationships today, unless we believe that the master-slave relationship is an appropriate model. Surely the opposition is not saying that when it reads to us the 300 or whatever faxes that it says it has received. I cannot believe that the opposition really could say that the master-slave relationship is an appropriate model. The principle, of course, which Paul was establishing and which eventually became something which broke open the whole of the slave trade was that we must treat one another with respect. Certainly, that is a good principle to use within industrial relationships. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But let me turn to one other passage which was not used by any of the people who sent me faxes. It is a very useful passage. It is one which underlines the problem of trying to translate social conditions of 2,000 years ago and thinking that we can simply make reference to them without some kind of background to the contemporary situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a parable, which was told by Jesus, about an employer and an industrial dispute. In the parable, the employer goes to a labour pool early in the morning and agrees with some labourers that they will work for a particular wage for that day. At the third hour, and the sixth hour, and the ninth hour and the 11th hour he hires labourers. In other words, at different times during the day he hires people to work for him. There is no discussion with the later workers about the wage they should be paid. At the end of the day he pays them all the same amount. Of course, they complain. The employer says, `Friend, I am doing you no wrong. Did you not agree with me to work for a denarius? Take what belongs to you and go. I choose to give to this last as I give to you. Am I not allowed to do what I choose with what belongs to me or do you begrudge my generosity?'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the meaning of the parable? I suppose we could, if we wanted to, simply carry it across without any interpretation and say that payment need not bear any relation to quantity or quality of work done. I am certain that the opposition would not want to support that proposition. It underlines the difficulty of transferring biblical concepts to the contemporary situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This parable is not really about industrial relationships, although it is about an industrial dispute. It is rather about the nature of God's dealing with humanity. As we understand it, the amount quoted by the employer as the agreed wage was the amount needed to support a family for one day. So the proportional wage which would have been paid for the late workers could never have been adequate. They would have been left destitute. The point the parable is making is that God's generosity or grace is based on human need, not on the ability to bargain for a better deal for the strong over the weak. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principle is that social intercourse ought to mirror God's determination and generosity to the disadvantaged and marginalised. Whenever trade unions follow these principles, to that extent they fulfil the purpose of God. I believe that often in early movements for social justice they did just that. However, when a trade union or any human institution, including this parliament, fails to protect those at the bottom and advantages only those on top, then that  institution is outside the purpose of God for both human and industrial relationships. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This morning we are discussing, at the second reading stage, the Industrial Relations Reform Bill 1993. It is a very significant piece of legislation. Like all significant pieces of legislation that go through this parliament, the intent of the legislation gets distorted by some with a vested interest in it and by others who merely seek to distort it. I would like to direct my remarks to some of those distortions this morning and hopefully correct them and clear up what this bill is about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I do so, I want to acknowledge the fact that some of my constituents, particularly the employers in Western Australia, have also been sending me faxes. I dare say that every senator is receiving them. But, unfortunately, I have not yet had time to address and respond to those faxes. I certainly will do so. If any of the people who have attempted to make contact with me in the past few days are listening to this speech, I will lay it down very clearly for them now that I am strongly supporting this piece of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In strongly supporting it, I also commend the Minister for Industrial Relations, Mr Laurie Brereton, for bringing the legislation to the floor of the parliament. It has been a long time coming and we are aware of the enormous amount of work that he personally, his staff and the departmental officers have put into bringing this legislation before the Senate of Australia today. He is to be commended for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In commending and acknowledging his role in things, we must not forget the groundwork that had previously been put in by his predecessor in the portfolio, Senator Peter Cook. He is a colleague of mine from Western Australia. Senator Cook laid the groundwork for it. I am sure that, if he were in the chamber today, he too would be commending it and be very pleased that the culmination of his work, and that of Mr Brereton, is coming to the fore and that shortly we will be passing the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had expected to see on the desks in the chamber some amendments that may be being proposed by opposition members. After their escapades a couple of weeks ago, I expected opposition members would seek the disbandment of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and its replacement by the estimates committees. We saw rather a furphy here a couple of weeks ago where a matter of industrial relations was, in turn, going to be referred to an estimates committee. I am surprised that they have not been consistent and stuck with that and referred all matters of industrial relations to estimates committees. We will see how useful estimates committees can be in the resolution of industrial disputes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That aside, I want to address some of the furphies that  have been attached to this bill. In particular, what has riled me, apart from the distortions that have been directly presented to me, is an advertisement that was placed in the Australian press, certainly in my state of Western Australia, on 23 November this year which criticised the government's Industrial Relations Reform Bill on a number of grounds. The criticisms, of course, were inaccurate, misleading and caused some concern in the community by those who believe everything they read in newspapers. That is a problem in one instance, but when we end up believing what is in advertisements we, unfortunately, are going to have some problems. They certainly gave me some concern that advertisements of this nature appear and people get the wrong impression of what government action is about.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first point that was made in the advertisement that attracted my attention said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill could give trade unions a lawful right to interfere in your workplace agreements with your employees.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, the bill does not provide unions with any form of automatic right to interfere in the workplace agreements between employers and employees. The fact of life is that currently in Australia, in all states and territories, trade unions, in the most enterprising of places, play a role in how the enterprise is being managed and being run. When a union operates with the agreement of an employer, it plays a productive and constructive role in an enterprise agreement. It was very irresponsible of the persons who paid for this advertisement to print such a contrary lie on the role of trade unions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill provides for two enterprise agreements: certified agreements made directly with the employers and unions and flexible enterprise agreements made directly between the employer and employee. If no union is involved in a particular workplace there is no need for union involvement. That has raised concern amongst some of my colleagues in the trade union movement, but it is a fact of life that there is no union representation in some workplaces in Australia because the workers have chosen not to belong to a trade union. So those people will have the right if they wish to directly enter a flexible enterprise agreement with their employer and have it ratified in the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even if unions are part of a workplace which negotiates an enterprise agreement, they will have no veto over what happens in that agreement. If the majority of workers within the enterprise democratically decide they want to be part of an enterprise agreement with their employer, the union will not be able to veto that agreement. So, hopefully, this bill will put to bed hereafter the lie that this legislation will give trade unions a lawful right to interfere in the workplace. The second distortion that appeared in the advertisement stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill explicitly protects unions from almost any action against themselves by employers seeking protection from oppressive boycott or intimidatory action.</PARA>
<PARA>Again, that is a distortion of reality, a distortion of the truth, and it does not well serve those people who paid for the advertisement to stretch their imagination to this length. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill does not protect unions against employer action in the case of illegal secondary boycotts. Unions will be held liable if they are engaged in unlawful actions. The bill adopts a commonsense approach which should have been taken years ago. Senator Cook was very keen about this and, upon his departure from the industrial relations portfolio, would love to have had this approach credited to his name. The bill transfers sections 45D and E of the Trade Practices Act 1974 to the Industrial Relations Act 1988. Senator Cook worked long and hard to try to bring about this commonsense change in this country's industrial legislation. That change has now come to fruition and I again acknowledge the role that Senator Cook played. Those comments are not meant to detract from anything Mr Brereton has achieved here today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The transfer of the provisions of the Trade Practices Act to the Industrial Relations Act confines the operation of those provisions to secondary boycotts, which also covers a wide range of primary boycotts and provides exemptions for certain action&mdash;for example, peaceful picketing.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The transfer of these provisions to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission requires the AIRC in both secondary boycotts and common law actions to conciliate between the parties before either party can seek a remedy from the court. This approach is designed to find and bring about a lasting resolution to industrial differences and recognises that litigation often hardens the attitudes of the parties, making a smooth return to work much more difficult. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even when there is a return to work after very divisive and difficult industrial conflict, it is not always a satisfactory result because, in many cases, the action has left a bad taste and coloured the different attitudes. Many employers around Australia who have corrected their previous bad practices have found that such litigation does not lend itself to good industrial relations or good productivity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The provisions transferring these matters to the Industrial Relations Commission also contain a number of protective clauses. Conciliation will be limited to 72 hours, after which either party will be free to seek a remedy from the court if so desired. When it is clear that conciliation will not resolve a dispute or where the damage is likely to be so serious that it would be inappropriate to delay legal action, the AIRC may allow immediate access to the court. Injunctions and damages will be available to the new Industrial Relations Court for breaches of the secondary boycott provisions. The advertisement went on with another distortion:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill allows trade unions to vet and monitor every job interview and termination in your business.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a load of bull. It is a load of codswallop because the bill does nothing of the sort. Unfortunately, the advertisement did not go on to say exactly where the bill states that trade unions would be allowed to vet and monitor job interviews and terminations. The writers of this advertisement could not do so because the bill contains no such provision&mdash;the bill does not deal with recruitment or job interviews.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am particularly pleased, though, that the bill does address some aspects of job termination. The bill establishes minimum notice periods of termination of employment based on years of service and protection against unfair dismissal, including a general requirement for procedural fairness in dismissals. Trade unions will have a right to be consulted in those cases of terminations that are limited to redundancies of 15 or more people for economic, technological, structural or similar reasons. So, if somebody wants to get rid of 14 people for another reason, there is no compulsion on that person to make direct contact with the union. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill provides for unfair dismissals to be determined in the Industrial Relations Court.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill takes away the freedom of employers and employees to decide how to operate their enterprise.</PARA>
<PARA>We have got to give it to the person who thought up that because, again, it is a gross distortion of the truth.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly this bill does not take away the freedom of employers and employees to decide how to operate their enterprise. In fact, it does the opposite. By extending enterprise bargaining to the non-union sector and encouraging the use of enterprise flexibility clauses in awards the legislation increases the flexibility available to enterprises.

One that springs to mind immediately when I am looking for left-wing nations is the United States of America.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to address just a small aspect of the Industrial Relations Reform Bill 1993 and cognate bills which deal with the proposal to set up an Industrial Relations Court. It is a matter which concerns me greatly. There are four reasons why I would oppose the inception of such a body.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My first reason for opposing this proposal is that the government has not demonstrated any need whatsoever to set up a new industrial relations court. In fact, in 1976 the Federal Court was invested with the industrial division and since then has adequately dealt with this area of law. I see no reason whatsoever for there to be a change in this practice. As such, the Federal Court, through its specialist division, has had to deal with the interpretation and enforcement of awards and has also had to determine disputes involving registered organisations and references of questions of law from the Industrial Relations Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nowhere has the government given any cogent reason for such a new body to be set up. The government is proposing by the stroke of a hand to abolish an entire division of the Federal Court. It is really quite extraordinary that we have such a proposal before us without any supporting evidence or argument. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My second reason for opposing this proposal is that the taxpayer will unnecessarily incur a significant additional expense. The current budget allowance for the Federal Court and the Family Court is $164 million per year, including court construction. In these hard times we need to look very carefully at additional government spending. We also need to look at limiting the creation of further bureaucracies. There is an old saying that if there is no need for the new bureaucracy then it becomes necessary not to have the new bureaucracy. I say to the Senate that it is necessary for there to be no change for the reasons I have outlined. The Federal Court is doing an admirable job and there is just no need for this additional expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third reason is to maintain the independence of the judiciary. The Law Council of Australia has had much to say on this aspect of the proposed legislation. It is perhaps an essential principle of our system of government that the judiciary maintain its independence from the executive arm of government and the legislature. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> today Mr Mansfield QC, the President of the Law Council of Australia, was reported as saying that he feared that if such a court was set up its independence from government could not be guaranteed. In fact, the Law Council of Australia in a letter to me dated 3 December 1993 stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed new Court, in those circumstances may be vulnerable (whether fairly or not) to the suspicion that it will not be as independent and impartial as the Federal Court.</PARA>
<PARA>One runs the danger in setting up such a specialist judicial body of its being seen to be influenced by government. On the other hand, simply having an industrial division in a court such as the Federal Court, with all its might, gives that division a perception of independence founded quite correctly on the basis that one would not expect a body such as the Federal Court to be subject to government influence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth reason is that it is generally undesirable to establish specialist judicial bodies. In the last 10 years this country has seen a growth of such tribunals and I do not believe in any way that it serves the ends of justice. It may be seen that a specialist judicial body is set up to advance a certain social purpose and that as such it is more an extension of the arm of policy than of the judiciary. That is another aspect that I find disturbing in relation to the setting up of such a specialist body. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Federal Court is quite capable of dealing with the industrial jurisdiction. It has its own division to deal with that jurisdiction and I believe that it has dealt with that jurisdiction quite admirably. The Law Council of Australia is also of that view, and I ask the Senate to bear in mind the comments attributed to the President of the Law Council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to this one aspect of the legislation, there are four cogent reasons why this proposed Industrial Relations Court should not be set up. Firstly, the government has not proposed or advanced a cogent reason for the setting up of such a court. Secondly, the cost to the taxpayer would be substantial and there is no substantiation for such cost. Thirdly, there is the question of maintaining the independence of the judiciary, an essential part of our system. Finally, specialist judicial bodies have not served the ends of justice as well as people might think they have. In fact, they could be seen as bodies of policy more than judicial bodies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by reminding the Senate of a recent report on the cost of justice delivered by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. In Australia, the cost of justice is getting out of hand. We do not need more bureaucratic bodies with more forms, more costs, more employees and more public servants. We simply do not need that, and the citizens of this country who would need to avail themselves of that judicial system do not need it either. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are compelling arguments against the institution of this Industrial Relations Court. I do not think that it advances the government's proposals in this legislation in any way. Really, the setting up of this court can only have a detrimental effect. I cannot see it benefiting the people of Australia in any way. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy President, I rise to support the Industrial Relations Reform Bill 1993 and the Industrial Relations Court (Judges' Remuneration) Bill 1993 and to congratulate the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) for their formulation and presentation to the parliament. At the outset, I would like to make some comments in response to a number of remarks from honourable senators opposite.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Sandy Macdonald suggested that this legislation would put the unions above the law. They have never been above the law; when they have broken the law they have been penalised in accordance with it. Is he not smart enough, educated enough, knowledgeable enough to realise that when this legislation is promulgated it will be the law and it will be a question for judicial bodies in this country to decide on its superior jurisdiction over other laws that are in place?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable senator was also nasty enough to get personal and suggest that I have done nothing with my life. I have spent some 40 years in the trade union movement. Most of my efforts I would call, and other people would call, unselfish. I have been concerned with the community in general and not with trying to accrue assets to myself through private business. By saying that, I am not suggesting that all private business people are evil. I will allow history to judge my role in society when both the honourable senator and I have gone, and history will make the comparison. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator McGauran raised the matter of unemployment. The unemployment situation is affected by a number of factors. In this country we have embraced the proposition of a world economy, reducing tariffs in the long-term interests of not only this nation but all the trading nations of the world. We have decided, on the initiative of the unions for the most part, to embrace the proposition of using the highest levels of technology and seeking the cooperation of employers in introducing and using the best possible methods of management to reduce areas of conflict at the workplace. We have done all of these things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, in the process of using the highest levels of technology, better management strategies, and in changing workplace philosophy and approach, many jobs have been destroyed. They have been destroyed through our seeking competitiveness with other countries&mdash;enabling us to earn income through world trade which is then passed on to the community. It is stupid to suggest that, because we put in place a proposal which would guarantee minimum wages, we do not care about unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government clearly believes that the setting of minimum wages and conditions is not responsible for unemployment. The key factor in our current high rate of unemployment is lack of demand, not higher labour costs. Yes, we are concerned, and we have introduced all these macro-economic changes to minimise unemployment but, at the same time, for the sake of the broader picture, we have introduced legislation which provides a social wage and assists those people who are worse off than others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bills were clearly intended to create two things. One was the provision of a safety net to maintain the awards system at a particular level for those who cannot negotiate&mdash;for example, those who may be in industries where the capacity to create wealth is lessened because their products are in less demand or their cost is slightly higher. The other was to free up the process of labour and the process of management so that we could be much more creative, flexible and productive, thereby improving our wealth creation capacity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator O'Chee and others have talked about my going back 100 years in history. I want to go back to 1947, to the judgment of the Full Court in the standard hours inquiry in order to show that attitudes have not changed a great deal over the years. The judgment says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has been the historic role of employers to oppose workers' claims for increased leisure. They have, as is well known, opposed in Parliament and everywhere every step in this direction, and this case is no exception. The arguments have not much changed in 100 years. Employers have feared such changes as threats to profits and added obstacles to production, a limitation upon industrial expansion, and a threat to internal and international trade relations. Steadily, first in one country then in another, this opposition has been overcome until great institutions, like the International Labour Organisation in the international arena, this Court in this country, and legislatures both here and elsewhere have declared the desirability of added leisure. History has invariably proved this foreboding of employers to be unfounded.</PARA>
<PARA>That same attitude is being expressed by employers today. One reason for looking at the need for minimum awards is to examine existing attitudes to what people should be paid, the level below which wages should not go, and the sorts of conditions in which people should work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also wish to quote from the Harvester decision, which goes back even further but which still has relevance. Those who ignore history are bound to repeat it. On page three of the decision it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The provision for fair and reasonable remuneration is obviously designed for the benefit of employees in the industry; and it must be meant to secure to them something which they cannot get by the ordinary system of individual bargaining with employers.</PARA>
<PARA>Even then, even though the industrial relations field did not operate in a sophisticated way, industrial commissions and courts understood that the capacity of individuals to bargain with employers was very limited, and it has not changed today except for the fact that employers have become more skilled at that game. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my 40 years as a trade unionist I have met some very fair and decent employers who have been driven by a desire to maximise their profits within the boundaries of reasonable behaviour. However, I have met a lot of terrible ones, and I am sure I will meet more before I leave this planet. The judgment continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If Parliament meant that the conditions shall be such as they can get by individual bargaining&mdash;if it meant that those conditions are to be fair and reasonable, which employees will accept and employers will give, in contracts of service&mdash;there would have been no need for this provision. The remuneration could safely have been left to the usual, but unequal, contest, the "higgling of the market" for labour, with the pressure for bread on one side, and the pressure for profits on the other. The standard of "fair and reasonable" must, therefore, be something else; and I cannot think of any other standard appropriate than the normal needs of the average employee, regarded as a human being living in a civilized community. I have invited counsel and all concerned to suggest any other standard; and they have been unable to do so. If, instead of individual bargaining, one can conceive of a collective agreement&mdash;an agreement between all the employers in a given trade on the one side, and all the employees on the other&mdash;it seems to me that the framers of the agreement would have to take, as the first and dominant factor, the cost of living as a civilized being.</PARA>
<PARA>The judgment goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If A lets B have the use of his horses, on the terms that he give them fair and reasonable treatment, I have no doubt that it is B's duty to give them proper food and water, and such shelter and rest as they need; and, as wages are the means of obtaining commodities, surely the State, in stipulating for fair and reasonable remuneration for the employees, means that the wages shall be sufficient to provide these things, and clothing, and a condition of frugal comfort estimated by current human standards.</PARA>
<PARA>When we talk about maintaining the award situation, we are saying that awards can be assured by way of arguments in the commission and in the main&mdash;as has always been the case&mdash;they will be based on what is happening in the community. I just make the point that in the future, because of changes that have taken place in the world and because of the enormous amounts of resources that are taken out of the world's capacity by the advanced nations of the world&mdash;nations like China, some of the other Asian nations and some of the eastern European countries which are now seeking to lift their living standards&mdash;we may well have a reduction of living standards in this country to accommodate reasonableness in the world. But it should be on the basis of equity, and people should not continue to make huge profits while others certainly do not have a reasonable standard of living. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Notwithstanding the sort of attitude that was held by the trade unions, in 1982, if I recall, before the election, we made an agreement with the Labor government on wages and conditions, training, safety and health in industry. Amongst those things was an agreement by the trade unions that we would allow certain elements of revenue from businesses, which could easily have gone to wages if we continued to seek higher wage levels, to go to employers and to owners of businesses as profit. We allowed them to redirect wage increases into profits. We took low wages and allowed employers to go into a profit situation. This was not an unselfish approach. On behalf of our members, we explained to employers why it was a good proposition, and we were able to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The power of trade unions lies in their ability to go to their members and talk to them about what policy should be, about where the future lies and about what should be done in their interests and in the community interest. After all, trade unions are representative bodies of a particular group of people in the community and, while they do have concern for community values and community interests, they cannot serve their membership if they do not focus on the interests of those members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">History has shown very clearly that, if left up to the community, it certainly will not go to bat of its own initiative, nor will it respond to reasonable requests from those people in the work force who might be badly done by. So those people have had to make their own way and make their own arguments to achieve what they see as a reasonable proposition. That is the importance of the safety net. The safety net will provide minimum amounts; it will not provide maximum amounts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the question of negotiated agreements, two kinds of attitude exist in the community.

It was not thrust upon them; it was a matter of negotiation, of people seeing the light and going in a direction that would be helpful not only to them but to the whole community. The agreement continues:</PARA>

<PARA>That agreement is a collective approach to try to better productivity levels. A difference of opinion has now developed between the parties. The parties were embracing the process of developing skills, both horizontally and vertically, in a way that had never been considered before. The unions were very clear that there should be academic training as well as on-the-job training and that, as people reached a certain level of ability, understanding, skill and knowledge, they should be recognised by some sort of certificate entitling them to be able to go to another employer when unemployed or when seeking permanent employment and say, `Here are my qualifications; there is my level of skill'. At the moment, the employers are suggesting that there should an informal arrangement. There is some argument about it, but I am sure it can be worked out within the spirit of this agreement.

They informed me very clearly that, as far as they were concerned, workers were now an asset and not a burden on the company.

Other companies had the same view and have been appreciative of the fact that workers on the job have the capacity to make a very real and important contribution. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill was a long time in drafting. The Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) claims he consulted widely with those who will be most affected by it, but I sincerely doubt that. He consulted with the unions. He has done what the ACTU told him to do. Obviously, he has paid it back for the help and assistance it gave during the election campaign. But he failed to consult with the employers&mdash;the ones whom Senator Burns has just been attacking. The employers have the ability to employ people. He did not consult with those people who have the ability to create jobs. He did not consult with those people charged with the responsibility of finding wages each week so they can pay their employees and keep them off the dole. That is what is really wrong with this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister failed to find out what employers wanted reformed in the present industrial relations system in order to help them to better working relations with their employees. He failed to understand that a successful industrial relations policy must contain mutually beneficial agreement between employer and employee. It has to be like a good marriage. There has to be a good coming together of the two parties to make sure that they will consummate a good working relationship. The minister failed to understand that we have to compete in the world market. We cannot go through our lives thinking we are in isolation here in Australia, with different types of strictures and different sets of rules and conditions which make us uncompetitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill was supposed to be about consultation. In reality, it will be about confrontation. I have received close to 200 letters in my office since yesterday from ordinary Australians trying to make a living in today's tough economic conditions. They have come from electricians, cabinet-makers, motor mechanics, landscapers, orchardists and steel fabricators. They have asked for more consultation on the bill. They have asked for whole passages to be disallowed and they are frightened. I will quote from a few of those letters. This one comes from Moss Vale. It states:</PARA>

<PARA>The letter goes on to say:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am an employer of a non-union workshop in a so-called free country. I have found that the Government is intending to legalise a system of bondage. Where is our liberty?</PARA>
<PARA>The coalition's objections to this legislation are quite clear. It is quite clear what those people in the community are thinking about it as well. Our objections are well known, and they have the support of most non-unionist workers&mdash;that 70-odd per cent; perhaps closer to 80 per cent&mdash;in the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Legislation will not make the union movement more popular with the workers. If unions want members they have to work for those members&mdash;not legislate to ensure that the unions get them. The sad thing is that here we have a government which is trying to enshrine in legislation a membership that will give it the money to fight election campaigns. I have another letter. It comes from an earth boring company in rural New South Wales. What does it say? It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From our 35 years experience of the militancy of trade union delegates on building sites, we know that the proposed Industrial Relations Reform Bill will be a disaster for builders and subcontractors. The Giles report partly exposed the violence &amp; corruption that then existed.</PARA>
<PARA>In Australia it is not the weakness of the trade union movement that is crippling the country; it is the weakness of the economy, the lack of competitiveness, the lack of a will to deliver quality goods on time and a lack of productivity. But this bill does not address any of those issues. It enshrines the power of the unions, it outlaws all forms of discrimination in the workplace, except the one discriminatory practice that is most common&mdash;that is, discrimination against the non-unionist&mdash;yet non-unionists, as I said, make up 70-odd per cent of the work force. This legislation discriminates in favour of 20-odd per cent of the work force and discriminates against 70-odd per cent. Where is the balance and equity in that? The majority report of the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee is confident that the reforms proposed in this Bill will serve Australia well as the basis for an industrial relations system that is open to all.</PARA>
<PARA>The coalition senators on that committee disagreed with that conclusion and, from the correspondence that I have received, so do most, if not all, of the 70-odd per cent of non-unionist workers. A large number of employers and business witnesses who came before the committee were clearly not of that view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To suggest that the bill is a sound basis for industrial relations in this country is an outrageous exaggeration: for example, the requirement that unions be involved in the development of certified agreements and enterprise flexibility agreements. Small business will continue to remain outside the industrial relations structure because the hurdles involved are too great and too high. How does that reform the present system? How does that ensure that workers are protected against unscrupulous employers? It will not. Apart from what Senator Burns said, it will not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Parer told the Senate last night, this legislation is no more or less than a payback to the ACTU for delivering another term of office to the Labor Party. That it did so under false pretences and by outrageously misleading scare campaigns seemed to have been forgotten. Given our track record overseas as an unreliable supplier, a country with uncertain quality control, with heads of state who clearly do not know how to behave in national forums, such as our present Prime Minister (Mr Keating), and unions who manage to go on strike at the most inappropriate times and for the most spurious of reasons, I would have thought that this  government would be keen to establish legislation that works on improving the image of our work force. This legislation will not do that. It merely transfers even more power to those whose names never appear on the ballot paper but who, nevertheless and assuredly, control what this government does and how it does it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose that helps to explain why the Labor Party is prepared to introduce this obnoxious bill. It does not explain, however, why the Australian Democrats are prepared to support it. Maybe the Greens will think of not supporting it. It remains to be determined why the Democrats have chosen to support it. Perhaps further down the track we will be wiser. In the meantime, all Australians will have to suffer yet another piece of iniquitous legislation. One of the recommendations of the dissenting report, signed by Senator Chapman and Senator Crane, of the inquiry into the Industrial Relations Reform Bill 1993 reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government withdraws the bill and enters into full, proper and meaningful consultation with all parties to produce a bill which encourages direct negotiations between employers and employees to achieve the productivity gains Australia needs to reduce unemployment and improve living standards.</PARA>
<PARA>This bill will not do what the minister purports; it will do completely the opposite. It will put Australia back behind the eight-ball again as regards competitiveness on the world markets and the recovery that we hope will soon happen will be decimated. I ask the Greens, who are sitting in the chamber at the moment, to think of defeating this bill, to consider voting against it, to ensure that we do not have legislation that will definitely hurt the work force and hurt the employers that create the jobs in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It must be stated at the outset that the Greens WA believe that, as a nation, we must rethink the concept of work. Whilst many Australians unsuccessfully seek paid work, many others in paid work are working to the point of illness.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens welcome many aspects of the Industrial Relations Reform Bill, especially those aimed at guaranteeing minimum standards of employment with respect to wages, equal pay for equal work, termination of employment and unpaid parental leave. It is particularly important that these be national standards in times when working conditions are under attack in a number of states. The Greens consider that the use of international conventions to allow the federal government to provide a safety net for workers is both appropriate and necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main thrust of the bill, however, is to promote enterprise bargaining, and the Greens have considerable doubts over the motives behind the introduction of enterprise bargaining and the ways in which it is being pushed upon the Australian work force as part of a worldwide trend for labour market deregulation associated with the increasing mobility of capital and the obsession with attracting multinational investment. Employers and the major political parties are all extolling enterprise bargaining and labour market deregulation in general as the solution to Australia's industrial woes. The Greens believe that this view distracts us from the real issue, namely, the poor performance of Australian management.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many Australian employers seem to want to perpetuate the `us' and `them' dichotomy between management and workers and are well behind international best practice in creating workplaces that run on cooperation and participation rather than hierarchies. Just as financial deregulation caused as many ills as it cured, so may inappropriate labour market deregulation. It is also conveniently forgotten that workers are much more than just a cost of production. They are also the clients and customers of small business. Squeeze them too hard and many local shops and businesses are plummeted into insolvency. We do not create employment by pushing down wages and conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One thing that has been created in recent times is record corporate profits and executive salaries. The figures are there. However, enterprise bargaining is the flavour of the month. So we&mdash;and the Democrats, I would note&mdash;have focused our efforts on the protection of women and other groups that often have the weakest bargaining positions in the work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is only relatively recently that women have seen advances in the workplace that take account of their particular requirements and responsibilities and which recognise the traditional disadvantages faced by women in this society. Even unions have been quite slow in putting the needs of women onto their agenda. Women are participating in the work force in greater numbers than ever before and, gradually, they have been obtaining greater consideration for their family responsibilities and their different style of working and overcoming the legacy of discrimination in rates of pay, conditions and promotions that have been unaddressed by governments for too long. Enterprise bargaining could see some of these advances lost if there are not adequate safeguards, as has been shown by the experience in some states and several surveys that have examined the impacts of enterprise bargaining. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of these surveys has shown that male workers were four times more likely to receive a wage increase under enterprise bargaining in New South Wales than female workers. The survey found that some enterprise arrangements had the potential to disadvantage female workers. It is not hard to understand why this may be the case. Basically, women have very rarely had sufficient bargaining power to adequately protect, let alone advance, their interests. There are many reasons for this. Women are relatively inexperienced in industrial relations negotiations. They often work in non-unionised areas. In addition, even unions have tended to favour traditional male concerns. I note that only 10 per cent of so-called management positions in unions are filled by women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens have been critical of the union movement in terms of centralisation and have called for appropriate structures to be able to deal with the needs of women in the work force, especially in smaller workplaces, small and medium sized businesses in Australia. I am pleased that the federal government has been quite receptive to our concern to protect women and other parties in weak bargaining positions. The government has made several changes in its own legislation and is supporting a number of further amendments. The Greens have also requested the government to ensure that the Sex Discrimination Commissioner is involved in the design and analysis of the annual survey of developments in enterprise bargaining. I expect Senator McMullan to make comments to this effect in his concluding remarks on the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that this survey, which will be tabled annually in parliament, will be a vital safeguard with respect to enterprise bargaining. It will provide a mechanism by which the impacts on women and other underrepresented groups can be monitored. If it shows that the government has been wrong in viewing enterprise bargaining as the greatest thing since sliced bread, then we and the rest of the community will be warned and can make sure that the government takes some action before it is too late. Another action by the Greens to ensure that the interests of underrepresented groups are adequately protected will be an amendment that requires the Industrial Relations Commission to ascertain that all employees were consulted and informed in relation to negotiations and agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable senators will have noted the very important amendments by the government to the bill that are designed to prevent and eliminate discrimination on various grounds. I also look forward to the amendments by the Democrats being passed to additionally prevent discrimination on the grounds of sexuality, age and disability. I believe that Australia will be demonstrating considerable maturity as a society in enshrining these objectives into legislation. The government is still reticent about the use of the International Labour Organisation convention No. 111 to allow `spouse' to be defined as including same sex partners. The Greens will be following that one closely. We also expect the government to include such anti-discrimination objects into all relevant legislation that comes before the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect to helping prevent and eliminate discrimination in our society, there is a glaring inconsistency that exists in the Industrial Relations Act 1988. This occurs in section 113(2)(b) that allows discrimination against women to continue in awards if it is `in the public interest'. Accordingly, we will be moving an amendment that subjects industrial awards and agreements to the full force of the Sex Discrimination Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has made some very welcome changes to the secondary boycott provisions in the 1974 Trade Practices Act. Nevertheless, there has been disquiet expressed, especially in Western Australia, about the impact of remaining sections on boycotts. Hence, the Greens will be moving an amendment to repeal the relevant parts of these sections. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to finish off with some observations about enterprise bargaining in my own state of Western Australia. Several Western Australian companies have already been using generous enterprise agreements to hive off core workers. However, these agreements include no strike clauses which enable the company to drastically reduce the level of wages for the majority of workers who are outside the chosen few. Hence, parts of the federal legislation are particularly necessary, given the regressive steps that have been taken by the Western Australian government. That the WA legislation is a step backwards for the workers of that state is clearly illustrated by the fact that the Western Australian legislation fails to comply with the relevant conventions of the International Labour Organisation in quite a few respects. Hamersley Iron's new workplace agreement does not even give workers freedom to choose to stay within existing industrial awards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to minimum wages, the Western Australian legislation is inadequate in meeting the requirements of International Labour Organisation convention No. 131. The Western Australian legislation does not properly specify the factors to be taken into consideration in fixing minimum pay. Most importantly, it does not require full consultation with worker and employer representatives. In fact, a person can get a workers' agreement in Western Australia that is secret. Nobody else is allowed to look at it, so who can check it? What kind of equal bargaining power is that?</PARA>

What could be more ridiculous than that? The employees say, `Listen, we don't want to have anything to do with this union. We don't want to have anything to do with any of the other unions which try to represent us'.

This so-called reform bill goes further. In entrenching the rights of unionists, it deprives those who are not unionists of equivalent rights. That is what this bill does; it strips away the rights of individuals unless they are willing to belong to a union. In some cases, it is not one union to which they have to belong, they often need two or three union tickets to get a start on a job. For example, a fellow working on a bobcat or using a jackhammer in many cases has to belong not only to the CFMEU but to the Building Workers Industrial Union&mdash;and other unions as well. It is not just a case of single jeopardy, or even a case of double jeopardy; under this bill it is a case of triple jeopardy or not getting equal rights. </PARA>

That is why I support Mr Barry Laing, the General Manager of Gold Coast Bakeries.

Senator Woodley spoke for 15 minutes. I was in the chamber. I was almost going to take a point of order to ask when he would address the bill. But I wanted to let him finish his last parable before I did so. Having finished his parable, he sat down. </PARA>

The Exclusive Brethren are saying that this government, this parliament, and the people who make up this parliament, should actually do something to make those prayers come true. Yet, Senator Woodley says that that is somehow unsatisfactory. Senator Woodley's theological expositions, whilst always interesting, are not always very apposite. I would be interested to see Senator Woodley take his particular view of theology to the parts of Queensland he purports to represent to let the people there hear how he believes that God is on the side of the unions and against the individual consciences of particular people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think there is anything in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bible</EMPHASIS> that says that God supports unions over individuals or that it is wrong for  persons to negotiate their own private agreement. I thought that the essence of Christianity was the fact that individuals were in communication with God and were judged on their merits and their faith. Yet, seemingly, Senator Woodley would install the trade unions to negotiate for us with God. He is saying that there is no basis for individual conscience or for individual agreements; people must have a trade union to act for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have gone through all of the Old Testament and the New Testament and I cannot find one case where God has appointed a trade union representative to negotiate on behalf of the penitents. In fact, the Reformation, which gave birth to the religious denomination to which Senator Woodley belongs, was based on the fact that the Pope did not have exclusive right to negotiate with God on behalf of the faithful. That is what Martin Luther was on about; that is why there was a revolt against the whole idea of indulgences&mdash;because an individual's relationship with God is an individual thing. I will say no more about Senator Woodley but I will make some concluding remarks on this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been said by those opposite that this bill is a great step forward. I have heard other people saying that one does not go forward by starting with a backward step. This bill is a backward step because it seeks to impose on Australians as a whole an ideology which has been shown to be moribund in practice and in morality. The bill says in a particularly offensive and patronising way that ordinary Australians who exercise their rights of freedom of association and freedom of choice are somehow not capable of making decisions on their own behalf or of deciding what is in their best interests. Even if they eschew a union, this bill tells us that they require a union representative to express their view on the particular voluntary employment agreement, or enterprise agreement, or whatever we want to call it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at some of the former union representatives in this place, it should give honourable senators enormous grounds for concern. Who are we going to choose to be the great representative and spokesman, to be the voice of reason, truth and logic? Are we to choose Senator Carr? Are we to choose Senator Murphy? If it were a matter of standing up for the right to interject, I am sure Senator Murphy would be a wonderful voice, but on matters of productivity, profitability and job creation, I do not think he knows very much. In fact, last night he tried to tell the chamber that it did not matter if a business made a profit provided it sold its goods. The  business might sell its goods for a short time but unless it makes a profit it will not continue manufacturing those goods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, are we to choose Senator Carr, Senator Murphy, or the third member of the Three Stooges, Senator Burns? I say that we should not be compelled to choose any of them and that, more importantly, when individuals choose freedom and exercise freedom of choice they should not be compelled to hear any of these people unless they so choose. That is why the opposition opposes the bill, the compulsion and the stripping of rights from individuals but supports freedom over this bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we are debating the Industrial Relations Reform Bill 1993. This is the most poorly drafted, ill-conceived piece of legislation we have seen for at least a week. We are likely to see another next week, of course&mdash;the Mabo bill. This bill is one which has been put together by a government that is chock-a-block full of people who have never had to run a business. The problem is that they do not understand what business is about. They do not understand what negotiations between employer and employees are all about. They do not understand profitability or the fact that profit means continuation of the business and that, without profit, one cannot employ a soul. They do not understand that many employers and self-employed people actually pay their workers more than they are paid themselves. Moreover, they do not want to know.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result, we have this mishmash of industrial relations legislation that has been cobbled together not in consultation with business but in consultation with the ACTU&mdash;the political masters of this Labor Government. We must never forget, as my colleagues pointed out last night and today, that this is the ultimate payback. This government sits opposite thanks to the ACTU. Not only did the ACTU fund the lie campaign but it helped to distribute it to all its union members and their families right up until the Friday night prior to the election. The lies contained within that material were just breathtaking but, nonetheless, the ACTU did it. It funded this government to the tune of millions and millions of dollars. Many of the dollars poured in to fund this campaign were given by workers who could not afford the money in the first place and, secondly, did not want it given. But here we are today debating a piece of legislation that is all about saying, `Thank you very much for your kind donation'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This piece of legislation does not focus on the real problems and attempt to solve them; it simply creates more. The Labor Party ignores the plight of so many&mdash;whether it is a small business struggling to survive, a medium-sized business trying to stop becoming small or a large business trying to stop going out of business. The Labor Party does not care about the low-paid workers; it does not care about the women; and it most certainly does not care about those of overseas origin&mdash;not at all. There is nothing in this bill that will go to the heart of solving the high levels of unemployment among our migrant communities&mdash;not a thing. The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus) has obviously not contributed one thing to this legislation to ensure that the unacceptably high levels of unemployment being experienced by the ethnic communities are turned around. This bill will exacerbate that problem. It will create even higher levels of unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two groups that are enormously vulnerable in this bill are women and the migrant communities. Where was Senator Crowley when this legislation was drawn up? She is meant to be representing the interests of women. She has been deafening in her silence&mdash;absolutely deafening. She is not on the speakers list; she has not been heard of. She probably has not read this bill either. If she is not capable of reading her own guidelines on child care, I suppose she would not be capable of reading this bill. We have two minister in this chamber&mdash;one representing women and one representing the ethnic communities&mdash;who are not contributing to the solution of the plight of those people whatsoever under this legislation. Senator Patterson last night clearly put down the coalition's concern affecting women&mdash;how badly the trade union movement treats the interest of women, how poorly represented they are in the trade union hierarchy and how few are given opportunities.

How many of them have been represented by their ministers in this parliament through this piece of legislation? How does this bill impact on their well-being? How many people of overseas origin are represented in the trade union movement at key decision making levels? I exclude those who have been imported as militant union heavies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think it is adequate to hear half a dozen English, Scottish, Irish&mdash;or whatever nationality&mdash;union leaders talk of how they brought industry to its knees in their home countries and say that that is representative of the millions of people and the many migrants who have come to Australia to make a new life for themselves and their families. What those people want is jobs, security and a future. What they do not want is the unacceptably high rates of unemployment which have been delivered to them by this Labor government. Some rates are as high as 30 per cent&mdash;rates that the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs has totally and utterly ignored. He has done nothing in this legislation or in any other piece of legislation to try to overturn that situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What people really want is to be able to work. They do not want to be given an opportunity to work and then be pulled out on strike by some militant union leader, who will get paid whether he works or not. That is the difficulty, because that union leader could not give a continental about the interests of the workers, who actually lose a lot of money. The union leader will simply get paid, and paid very well. Let us face it: most of them end up in this parliament. That is the sad fact. None of them have had to earn a buck. None of them have ever had to pay the wages bill, the rent for a business, the telephone account or any of the other impositions that this mob has put on top of them. They have not had to pay those bills. I have. Senator Panizza has. That is the real coalface of the facts of life. This mob has never, ever had to do it, and it is simply reflected in this piece of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those union bosses will get paid regardless of any outcome of the dispute. The people who are the meat in the sandwich are those workers who are taken out on strike. What we will see in this legislation is more strike action. What we will see with sections 45D and 45E effectively disappearing&mdash;the 72-hour clause&mdash;is more industrial disputation. The 72-hour factor in this bill is a further demonstration of the lack of understanding of this Labor government. It does not understand that within 72 hours a business can be brought to its knees and sent out of business forevermore. Evidence was given to the Senate standing committee that looked at this legislation to that very fact. Seventy-two hours is of no help to many businesses; 72 hours can be total, utter and permanent devastation. Does the government care? No. Is it doing anything to try to resolve the unemployment levels? No. The government is simply exacerbating the situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One would think that over the last 10 years this mob would be satisfied with the extraordinarily high levels of bankruptcy that it has already achieved. It would say, `At least we have got to the end of that. We have really set the goal, and we have exceeded our expectations in sending businesses belly up. But, we want more, so we will devise a nice piece of legislation'. That is what the government has done here. This bill will certainly not help any of those people to whom I have referred. All it will deliver to them is fewer opportunities, particularly in the small business sector. As stated by a witness at the recent Senate committee, a greater degree of confusion will also prevail for many people in small business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Can honourable senators imagine people of overseas origin struggling to come to terms with the way in which business operates here? This government is imposing more restrictions upon them, so this will make it more difficult for them to be able to start up a business and run one successfully. What small and larger businesses alike need is less red tape, not more. What this bill delivers is the latter. As I said before, the coalition totally rejects the changes to the boycott provisions. It is not just the coalition which is rejecting that; it is also every employer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From my quick reading of the reports from the Senate standing committee, not one employer came before that committee and said that he or she did not reject it. What does this Labor Party say? It says, `Too bad, tough, because this is the deal that has been done with the ACTU. We do not care if you go out of business. What we do care about is our Labor mates in the ACTU'. We as a nation cannot afford to have that situation occur. Why does this Labor Party continue to acquiesce to a bunch of people who are effectively running this country? The Fergusons, the Keltys and so on have long since been de facto members of cabinet in this government, because not a decision is made without their being dragged to Canberra and taken into the cabinet room. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When are the interests of Australian business and workers taken into account? Those interests do not get a guernsey. With whom has all the alleged consultation taken place? It certainly has not taken place with business; rather, as everyone knows, that consultation has been with the ACTU, and the ACTU alone. The business community has simply been ignored again by this Labor government. Why have the pleas of the business community been in vain, its valid concerns dismissed and its interests in security of operation and profitability treated with disdain? It is simply because this Labor government is in power today only because of the ACTU. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are almost 300,000 employers in Australia, many of whom employ fewer than 10 people. If an employer wants to make an enterprise deal, this bill insists that, before negotiations can even begin, the employer has to contact the union of which he and his staff are most likely not members. What absolute and utter nonsense. Today, more and more workers are opting out of unions rather than joining them. Hence, a few years ago we were confronted with the legislation to create mega-unions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government is hell-bent on creating more power for the union movement when the workers on the shop floor want less union involvement.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know whether Senator West will speak on this bill. However, I have had the distressing experience of listening to her speak on this subject a number of times. She too does not understand what this is all about because she has never employed people&mdash;she has never had to pay the bills. Genuinely concerned people have been listening to this debate ever since it started&mdash;people who pay the bills, worry about profitability and worry about the security of their employees. Government members should not think for one moment that such worry is simply self-interest, which is how it will be described by Senator West if she speaks. Senator West always talks about the greedy employer&mdash;`All employers are greedy'. Employers could be a darned sight greedier if they did not employ people; but they actually create the vehicle by which people buy their homes, put food on the table and earn a living. </PARA>

Such criticism simply highlights the policy of envy of this Labor government because its members have never had to struggle to make a business work. From personal experience I can tell those members that, if they had to struggle to make a business work, they would have a very different view of life. If they had to struggle to pay the wages bill every week, they would have a greatly different view on life. If they had to actually pay themselves less than their employees, they would be astounded.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to be able to inform the Senate that work on a new regulatory scheme for computer games and computer generated images is very much at an advanced stage. As part of the background to this, federal, state and territory ministers agreed last month on a national approach for a regulatory scheme and asked for legislation to be drafted as a matter of priority.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The scheme will classify all computer games which are available for sale or hire or for use in places such as amusement arcades. The games will be classified by the Office of Film and Literature Classification according to age groupings to help parents decide which games are suitable for their children. The classifications will be based on the age categories for film and videos. However, all ministers agreed&mdash;the classifications will reflect this agreement&mdash;that the guidelines will be tighter in all categories, given the concern about the powerful influence these games may very well have on young people, particularly when they are played time and again. The games will also be labelled with consumer advice so that parents in particular will have full details of the strongest elements of the games.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the categories, all governments share the concern of others in the community about violent and sexually explicit computer games being marketed in Australia. We have taken steps to ensure that unacceptable material will not be sold. The scheme provides for restrictions on the stronger games to keep them away from younger children. A new category called G8 is also being created to warn parents about games that might be suitable for older children but not for the very young.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ministers have also made it clear to the classification enforcement authorities that the scheme should operate in such a way to ensure that such inappropriate material does not become available to younger people. They will be backing up this particular measure with heavy penalties for breaches. As well, there will be an MA category preventing children under the age of 15 from buying or hiring such videos in that category or playing them in arcades. There will also be a restricted category which will be available only to those over the age of 18.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The guidelines for this particular scheme were released for public comment on 13 November and they, and any suggested improvements, will be considered at a meeting scheduled for 20 December. This question is timely in that it is getting close to Christmas when parents are always asked to buy these games for their children. I think parents should also play their part if the new scheme is to be effective. The best advice we can give parents is to look carefully at the labels and the advice on each game before deciding whether or not to buy it. While the scheme is not yet in force, there is very much an appeal to parents to take this approach. I think it is fair to say that the industry has generally reacted responsibly to community concerns about its products and many businesses have introduced their own system of labelling ahead of compulsory schemes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal government intends to take urgent action early next year to develop a model ACT legislation for the classification of these computer games.

He said that, as we are preparing a major industry statement for next year, if the industry wanted to make submissions along those lines we would be interested in hearing those views. That invitation extends to any members of the community, including the Democrats. If they wish to make submissions along those lines, they will be considered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the last few months, Mr Griffiths and I have been to many industry and association meetings, particularly those at small and medium size enterprise level, where the issues of availability of seed, venture and development capital for such businesses have been raised consistently. The problem of raising capital from banks has been an issue that has been raised consistently. People have raised the issue that, as there is now an ever-growing superannuation pool of money in this country as a result of this government's policies to establish a superannuation scheme for all Australians, it is not unreasonable that the government ensure that some of that money is invested in small and medium size enterprises that want to expand and develop their businesses.</PARA>

As it presently stands, the draft agreement will require countries, which at the time of adoption of the Uruguay Round outcome&mdash;expected to be April 1994, if everything goes well in the next few days&mdash;do not have in place a system of equitable remuneration of right holders in respect of the rental of sound recordings, to provide right holders in sound recordings with an exclusive right to prohibit or authorise the rental of sound recordings. There is a strong international consensus developing in support of an exclusive rental right for copyright holders in sound recording.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the case at the moment that Australia does not have a system of rental rights for copyright owners in sound recordings. This matter is currently under consideration by my colleagues the Minister for the Arts and Administrative Services and the Minister for Justice.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The TRIPS agreement is not yet fully agreed and there are a number of proposals to amend the text, including in the area of rental rights for sound recordings. What emerges at the conclusion of the negotiations will obviously have a significant bearing on the form of rental rights that are introduced in Australia. It would compound the uncertainty of the record rental industry to make decisions on this prior to the TRIPS outcome and then to be required to alter those decisions as a result of the TRIPS outcome. Obviously, we have to wait until April next year to know where we are going in all this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the TRIPS agreement enters into force as it presently stands, rental rights will not need to be accorded to existing stocks of sound recordings. That needs to be made clear at the outset.</PARA>

My department has worked closely with the industry during the negotiations and has kept it regularly informed of developments in the negotiations. While latest figures do indicate that there are about 400 establishments around Australia renting out CDs, the situation is that in only about 10 of those 400 outlets is CD rental the main line of business. The rest are either video hire stores with a sideline in CDs or petrol stations, for example, which rent CDs as a sideline activity. There are also 3,000 sound recording retailers in Australia and their interests need to be weighed up against those of others. The ramifications of a rental right on both these groups will be taken into account in the development of a rental right in Australia.</PARA>

Does the government dispute the claim by the managing director, Mr Lucas Longginou, that his company has millions of dollars and many years invested in Malaysia and throughout the broader Asian rim, and that that investment, along with the investment of countless other Australian companies, is in immediate danger of irreparable damage? Would the minister please advise why the Australian High Commissioner in Malaysia told Voxson, which stands to lose $40 million a year in export income, to go away and sort the situation out for itself?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, the Defence Science and Technology Organisation is strengthening its close links with Australian industry. In doing this, it has two clear aims. First of all, close links will enable industry to better support the Australian Defence Force and reduce reliance on overseas suppliers. Secondly, these close links will also assist Australian industry to become more internationally competitive through enhancement of the Australian technology base.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These mutually beneficial links were demonstrated at an industry day at the DSTO laboratories at Salisbury in South Australia, which I attended on Tuesday of last week. Among a range of initiatives announced at that time, the industry day saw the launch of a communications research network by both me and my colleague Mr David Beddall, the Minister for Communications. This network, which has been developed in partnership by DSTO and Telecom, includes a high-technology communications link between Melbourne and Adelaide using asynchronous transfer mode technology.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This technology is expected to underpin the global information age of the 21st century and is likely to be the basis of many future civil and military networks. ATM technology will allow Defence to make maximum practical use of the national civil communications infrastructure. The research network is a product of a cooperative relationship between DSTO and Telecom, which has existed for some 20 years and was formalised by a memorandum of understanding in 1990.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I made a further announcement at the industry day regarding a new opportunity for industry to join DSTO in the development of high technology equipment. DSTO has sought proposals for companies to join it to further develop an Australian designed airborne synthetic aperture radar which can produce photograph-like images of the countryside up to 50 kilometres away from the aircraft which carries this radar. It has great potential for use by the Defence Force in surveillance of Australia's north and north west, and it also has some significant possible civil applications. DSTO expects that the radar can be produced at far less cost than that of similar equipment developed overseas. The radar has been named Ingara, which is an Aboriginal word meaning `long way'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ATM research network and the Ingara radar are, however, only two examples of how DSTO's partnership with industry is proving that the products of high technology defence research and development are now very good business indeed for Australian industry.</PARA>

Quite clearly, there is a difference of opinion in the industry; that I do not dispute at all. But it is quite wrong to claim that all people represented by the federation or all people represented by the confederation are opposed to accreditation and/or the link with fee relief. Many people, including many members of both those organisations, have been at pains to contact my office and make clear that their opinions differ from those of the peak representatives of those organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, there is a very big distinction between people who are opposed to accreditation and the link with fee relief and, as Senator Newman has said, those people who support accreditation but want it to be voluntary.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem with the opposition is that it does not actually know what accreditation constitutes.

If opposition senators want to understand this, they had better appreciate that accreditation is about the guidelines and a voluntary accreditation would be about exactly the same guidelines.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a program that is particularly directed to people in rural and regional areas and I am surprised that the National Party opposes it. In fact, I am not surprised because at the end of the day it never supports programs for people in remote areas; its members just come in here and talk about it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an extension of an important principle that has been underlying initiatives in Commonwealth arts and cultural policy for several years, with particular emphasis on issues of access and participation&mdash;not just access in terms of geography, of people disadvantaged by where they might live in Australia in the nature of Australia's demography, but that is an important element in it. This program will build on initiatives, particularly those over the past 12 months, that have been designed to provide opportunities for people all over the country, wherever they live, to participate in cultural activities and to overcome the disadvantage of people in rural and remote areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This program follows on from the very successful Playing Australia program, which has enabled performing arts to appear in cities where that would not otherwise have been possible and to assist people living in rural and remote areas to get access to performances that would not otherwise have been available outside the major capital cities. That has been a very successful program and has been responded to very positively by people outside the major cities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We announced in the election, and are now implementing, a proposal so that Australians living outside the major cities will also be able to enjoy such benefits with regard to visual arts. This will occur through the federal government's first national exhibition touring program, which will be called Visions of Australia. That is the basis of the advertisement which Senator Denman saw in the newspapers on the weekend&mdash;the first round of advertisements, which I was pleased to announce on a visit to Hobart recently and which will have significant benefits for Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Visions of Australia will make it possible for more Australians to enjoy and take great pride in the high standard of visual arts and crafts and collections of heritage and scientific material that are spread all over this country. It will enable exhibitions to move from the major cities to the regional centres, into new cities, into regional areas where they might not otherwise have gone, providing opportunities for small communities to see major collections.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One other thing we have learnt from Playing Australia, and which will be reflected in this program, is that there are also significant collections in major regional centres that can go to other regional centres to their benefit. I recently had the opportunity to see an outstanding collection of glassware in the Wagga art gallery which would be an outstanding basis for tour to many other cities and, of course, there are art galleries around Australia in regional centres which could also benefit. It is designed to meet community needs and hopefully will open up options that have been closed to people around Australia for too long.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As announced in the budget, we have provided $1 million this financial year and will provide a further $5 million over the next three years. The most important point I want to reiterate is that the committee that has been appointed to supervise this program which I announced last week is representative of the industry and of all the states and territories and, although the advertisements appeared in the newspapers only last weekend, I am pleased to tell the Senate that we have already had more than 50 inquiries in the last two days from people hoping to take up this important program.</PARA>

<PARA>I was absolutely amazed by Senator Gareth Evans's answer to my question today, which related to a specific company which is currently having specific problems because of remarks made by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the ongoing effect of those remarks on industry throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What staggers me is that the government and the Prime Minister had the chance to save a $200 million project. The Prime Minister was warned by a letter faxed to his office on 2 December by SEAS Sapfor Ltd from south-east South Australia but, at that stage, the government took absolutely no action. I will read the letter for the sake of the Senate. It is addressed to the Prime Minister, the Hon. Paul Keating, and states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is with deep concern that this company views the deteriorating relations that have developed between Malaysia and Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">S.E.A.S. Sapfor Limited has spent considerable time, effort and expense in fostering a relationship with the Malaysian Minister of Primary Industries and the Malaysian Timber Industry Development Council to progress our involvement in a major plantation development scheme in Peninsula Malaysia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have just been informed that the Malaysian Cabinet have put aside all trade and developments with Australia which will now severely impact our future planning with the Malaysian Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are looking at the loss of a multi million dollar project which would have significant benefits to Australia and to S.E.A.S. Sapfor Limited.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We would appreciate your sincere assistance to the industry and Australia to recover the position as a matter of urgency.</PARA>
<PARA>This letter was faxed to the Prime Minister's office on 2 December. I would have thought that an industry worth $200 million, which was being placed in jeopardy purely because of the insensitive remarks that the Prime Minister made in Seattle, at least would have warranted an acknowledgment or reply in the intervening period. As of this morning, SEAS Sapfor has received no reply or acknowledgment of that faxed letter sent to the Prime Minister, outlining the facts about placing this whole development and $200 million investment in jeopardy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This morning I received a letter from SEAS Sapfor which gives some background of the Australian based forestry company. The letter reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . its corporate office located near Mount Gambier . . . The Company has a large plantation resource (42,000 hectares) with downstream processing through sawmills and preservative treatment plants in South Australia, Victoria and Tasmania. Timber products from the Company's own production in combination with other Australian and imported timbers are marketed throughout Australia through Timbersales Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary company.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">S.E.A.S. Sapfor Ltd has developed high levels of expertise in plantation management with its first plantings dating back to 1926. The Company's practical approach to commercial and financial management of plantations is recognised throughout Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is extremely disappointing to now be placed in the position of losing the opportunity to be appointed as consultants and managers of a large plantation development program in Malaysia involving expenditure of an estimated $A200 million.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This project had been progressed by S.E.A.S. Sapfor Ltd senior executives during the year involving a number of visits to Kuala Lumpur. The Company was very favourably placed to proceed with the contract and yesterday we were advised that we can no longer proceed due to the deteriorating relations between Malaysia and Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Gareth Evans, said in the Senate today and on other days that we have had a good relationship with Malaysia in the past and we will have a good relationship with it in the future. Yet absolutely nothing is being done to try to save these companies from losing money.

He has caused offence and it is having extremely negative effects in Australia.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many years ago we had what is known as the 30-20 investment rule whereby legislative provisions meant that investment had to be 30 per cent in government securities of which a minimum had to be placed in Commonwealth bonds. Although unpopular at the time, I remind the Senate that both capital and income in such a legislative provision were secure, but not so; with income flowing to medium and small size businesses, even the capital could be at risk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also draw the Senate's attention to the fact that in the event of loss of such capital, there could be constitutional implications for the Commonwealth's directives. But attempts by state governments in recent times to meddle in capital markets have not been good, and I draw the Senate's attention to the Victorian Economic Development Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When banks cannot be persuaded to lend, why should the government allow small contributions from people to be put at risk? It also runs counter to the prudential standards and the need to protect retirees' superannuation moneys, particularly in the recently passed superannuation security investment legislation package of seven important bills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's failure to enable moneys to be attracted through incentives, such as development capital for new corporations through the MICs, which provided generous tax incentives, is but one example of the government's failed attempts to provide a climate in which capital could be available to small business. Therefore, I use this opportunity to call on the government to promote small business not only through economic reform but also to develop appropriate finance mechanisms available to small business, but not by putting retirees' funds at risk in the form of a direction of superannuation moneys. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Senate that a set percentage of superannuation directed to small business can also cause dilemmas for trustees because under the SIS legislation, the prudential controls which were designed to protect the superannuation moneys of retirees, these trustees and investment managers are charged with the responsibility of upholding prudential standards and investing securely. </PARA>
<PARA>They could be legislatively at risk in terms of a financial or a gaol penalty in the event of investing in small companies which, for example, go bankrupt. I urge the government to approach this issue with caution because it has many ramifications, particularly for the superannuation industry. I think finance for small business can be better served by other avenues. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Watson will not be surprised to know, considering the remarks I have made in the Select Committee on Superannuation over several years, that I look with great interest at this policy U-turn by the government. He will recall from the Senate committee recommendations that I was hoping that we would be more specific about the direction of investment, but I agreed to the recommendation which said, `Give us time, we'll change the culture, and we'll have a three-year review of how the industry is changing its own culture'. I am not convinced that that is happening as swiftly as ASFA is claiming in today's press.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should not lose sight of the facts that the superannuation funds have already received an absolutely massive fillip from this government from the compulsory collection of superannuation and that the scheme is underpinned by a massive $5 billion in tax concessions. That is why I think it is a legitimate question to ask: should not a very small fixed proportion of this $5 billion be invested in Australian small and medium business enterprises in this wonderfully nebulous national interest?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view, it is wrong to say that we cannot pick winners. We can have set criteria. Other countries do it and they do it well. It is also erroneous to assume that all of us would not benefit from the productive investment of some small fixed amount of this money. If we look at the investment patterns of the super funds, we see that many of them have overinvested in property, equities, cash and overseas investments. In fact, $26 billion of the $169 billion in super fund assets is held overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the answer of the Minister for Science and Small Business (Senator Schacht) today, I think there is clear evidence that banks are not lending the necessary capital to small and medium businesses and that the interest rate spread on fully secured small business loans is currently between eight and 10 per cent&mdash;and is rising. That is not conducive to the success of small and medium sized businesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the mandating of this small amount, we have not even seen some sort of requirement from the government which says, `Okay, let fund members nominate if they are prepared to take a small risk in the longer term national interest'. As I have said before, if someone had put that to me when I was just starting in the work force, I am the sort of person who would have said, `Yes, I am'. I think there are a lot of other Australians out there who would be willing to do it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overall, this situation points to the failure of voluntarism. Voluntarism underpinned the government's entire superannuation policy. It failed.

The very structure and nature of superannuation, with the trustee system, do not encourage a sufficient spread of investment, particularly in some of the more innovative capital areas. That is not to accept the logic of the Democrats' argument that one would therefore mandate investment. There are other ways of overcoming what may be problems with the trustee system.

It may well be that we have to mandate them to take part in investment courses and education and training of some standing. Minister Griffiths is, I think quite rightly, ensuring that we have a rigorous public debate on this matter.

The posting was part of a scheme hatched by the late Senator Lionel Murphy to create a more favourable numbers balance for the government in the Senate but was thwarted by some very clever footwork by the then Queensland Premier, Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen, and his Canberra party colleagues. Nevertheless, the episode contributed greatly to the party's Senate demise in 1974. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Condon Byrne was a polished debater who relied only on a handful of written notes. He was firmly committed to the DLP policies of the time of opposition to communism internationally and within the Australian industrial movement, economic justice for the family, equality in educational funding for government and non-government schools and the distributist philosophy of decentralisation of administration and ownership. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Senate Condon Byrne played a key part in the resurgence of the Senate committee system in the late 1960s and early 1970s and performed the role of consensus promoter between the unlikely alliance of the ALP and the DLP. In this role he formulated resolutions which could attract the support of both parties and he worked closely with the then clerk of the Senate, the late Jim Odgers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During his time at the Queensland bar Condon Byrne was part of what one might describe as a salon of criminal and civil barristers, which included Jim Killen in his pre-ministerial days, Dan Casey, and Bill Cuthbert, with whom he shared ownership of several, mostly unsuccessful, horses. To an outsider, the salon was believed to be in perpetual debate about current social and political issues with court appearances an irritating interruption. Another colleague with whom he enjoyed discussing the great issues of the day was the late Kevin Cairns, MHR, from Queensland who became minister for housing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those who worked with Condon in the parliamentary arena will remember him as a charming and courteous person who, despite the often bitter experience of the Labor split, did not bear personal grudges. On New Year's day this year he phoned a former colleague in Canberra to say that his legs were packing up and it seemed as though he would have to enter a nursing home. Reminiscing about the Gair affair, he recalled that he had been in the chair when Vince Gair was expelled from the parliamentary DLP. For a man who always sought to focus on the best side of human nature and to promote reconciliation, this episode involving his former political mentor and parliamentary colleague must have been a bitter experience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Condon Byrne came from an era when writers such as G.K. Chesterton were popular in some circles. In a copy of one of G.K. Chesterton's books, which Condon Byrne probably used, a saying has been marked which one could almost visualise Condon introducing into a debate about education in the Senate. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Modern education means handing down the customs of the minority, and rooting out the customs of the majority.</PARA>
<PARA>Condon enjoyed these pithy sayings, another favourite being:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tradition is the democracy of the dead.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The late Condon Byrne was a defender of tradition and customs&mdash;not as a reactionary, but as a believer who laid claim to a Labor tradition which, in earlier times, once found a coexistence with a philosophy of social action based on religious beliefs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak about Condon Byrne, as I knew him in his maturity. I think Senator Harradine summarised his character very well. He was a man of absolute integrity.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was a great delight to meet Condon Byrne in company with the fabled Dan Casey, the leader of the bar in Queensland in his time and a person who dominated the law in Queensland. With both of them quipping away, as they did in their maturity&mdash;I think they were in their seventies at the time&mdash;one could not spend a more pleasant time than spend a few minutes with them while they debated the issues of the day, solving all the problems affecting Australia and the world at large.

<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>The reason for the recommendation, which reflects a submission received by the Committee, appears to be to correct a perceived gap in proposed section 116(5) of the Act, which would be added by enactment of paragraph 7(f) of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Consequential Amendments Bill 1993. The perceived gap is that there is no provision for the time and method of valuation of `the value of the property' in proposed section 116(5) of the Act.</PARA>
<PARA>The Government does not consider, there is any such gap as the proposed subsection 116(7) of the Act provides for a comprehensive power to make Statutory Rules prescribing the time and method of valuation of `the value of the property' in proposed section 116(5) of the Act.</PARA>

<PARA>The Australian National Botanic Gardens is one of our national collecting institutions, like the Australian National Gallery. It was the first major botanic gardens to be devoted to Australian native plants.

<PARA>I congratulate Mr Irving, Mr Clements, the other members of the board, and the staff of the Australian Horticultural Corporation on the progress that has been made since 1988. The horticultural industries of Australia offer vast export potential. A lot of people in our part of the world are going to require a lot of food in the years ahead, and Australia is still best placed to provide top quality products as they further develop. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For instance, the CSIRO and others have provided considerable assistance in developing the green plastic film and in improving the transport of fruit and vegetables by chilling and humidifying them. We have all sorts of developing areas that can still do much to develop Australia's export trade. On page 19 of the annual report, we see how significant Malaysia is for our export industries. Of the horticultural corporation members' exports to the Far East, apples comprise 28 per cent, pears comprise 12 per cent, naval oranges comprise 28 per cent, and valencia oranges comprise 25 per cent. What will happen with all these things?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is absolutely no feeling of urgency as, day by day, we watch our trade disappear down the gurgler. How long will it be before somebody does something? Are these people supposed to leave the apples on the trees? Are they supposed to not plant their vegetables? These people have spent considerable amounts of money. They have spent years of work establishing industries and trade in this part of the world and, with one word, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) can put it all down the chute and then do nothing at all about trying to get some recovery. What is going to happen? Will it be hours, days, weeks or months before something will happen? Are these people not entitled to be told? It is all very well to produce a nice book and come up with photos of Senator Sherry, but the figures are absolutely disastrous. This is a major export area that has been shot to ribbons and nothing is happening to put it back together. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to look at the effort that has been put into working closely with these countries and their industries. I realise that this matter probably does not worry the government members too much; they do not seem to be at all concerned about it. But I point out to those opposite that the industries that I am talking about are worried. Those of us on this side of the chamber are also worried. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The value of vegetable exports in the Malaysian trade  increased by $21 million in 1992-93. The growth in export of vegetables was 13 per cent over the previous year, and 34 per cent from 1990-91. That is an enormous increase. It has happened after a big investment of money and a long time. The value of exports of fruit and nuts for 1992-93 was $33.2 million. This represents an increase of 28 per cent over the previous year, and an increase of 69 per cent from 1990 to 1992. Out of all these agricultural products that we are talking about, milk and cream products, at a value of $105 million, represent a significantly larger export than everything, other than horticultural products. We do need to know what is going to happen with this situation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In responding to this report, I wish to make some comments relating to the funding of the Australian Horticultural Corporation and to its functions. I recently spoke to representatives of some of the fruit growers in Western Australia who expressed great concern about the levy system used to fund the activities of the Australian Horticultural Corporation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Currently, a levy is charged on the gross value of farm-gate production to fund marketing programs by the Australian Horticultural Corporation. Whilst this is a laudable aim, the concern in Western Australia is that the regional differences in this large nation are not acknowledged within the centralised AHC system. This point was made by the Western Australian Fruit Growers Association to the horticultural task force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key points made in that submission relate to the uniqueness of the Western Australian fruit industry with its geographical isolation, which is exacerbated by quarantine restrictions. This isolation has resulted in a dependence on local markets and exports to South-East Asia. The current Malaysian debacle is not helping in this regard. As a result, the Western Australian apple, pear, citrus and stone fruit industries have resolved to achieve a withdrawal from the AHC and an exemption from the levy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note in this regard that reference to this problem is made in the Industry Commission report, which was also tabled today. Page 24 of that report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commission proposed that levy funds used for programs requested by the contributing industry should be paid directly to that industry, with no obligation on the industry to engage the services of the AHC. Because of disparate regional characteristics of many parts of the sector, the Commission also proposed that levy funds be devolved to regional industry bodies.</PARA>

<PARA>The 1992-93 annual report of the Industry Commission that has been tabled here today provides a quite damning indictment of Labor's poor economic management. In particular, it shows quite clearly that either Labor has given up the game of economic reform or it simply does not know where to go from here. More likely, it is a combination of both. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opening page of the report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia has the knowledge and the resources to achieve the rapid and sustained growth needed to improve living standards and to make real inroads into unacceptably high levels of unemployment. But we need to improve the operation of the Australian economy quickly if we are to make the most of the opportunities that are available to us. This means both stepping up the progress on existing reform and extending reforms to new areas. A key issue is to remove the institutional blockages to reform that are preventing a better functioning of Australia's federal system of government. More than ever, Australia needs to establish a national approach to resolving truly national problems.</PARA>
<PARA>The report says many things in amplification of that. I will try to touch on two or three of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the outset, I congratulate the Industry Commission for identifying an improvement in federal-state relations as an essential institutional reform that is required in this country if we are to achieve our potential. That was one of the key planks of the coalition's policies at the last election. It is regrettable that this Prime Minister, a very centralist Prime Minister, has through most of his actions, not just as Prime Minister but in his earlier years, fought to prevent a proper balance of federal-state relations. The Industry Commission seems to have picked that up in its report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The commission also states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">More than a decade ago, the Commonwealth Government recognised that Australians could only secure a better long-term future by opening the economy to the rest of the world and confronting the challenges and opportunities in global markets.</PARA>
<PARA>It then goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With a more open economy, world economic conditions and Australia's ability to improve its productivity performance are of critical importance for our prosperity.</PARA>
<PARA>It says that the movement towards the achievement of those things and the necessary reforms have been frustratingly slow in some areas and that, although some reform achievements have been made, `much more remains to be done'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a very interesting appendix to the report. Appendix C attempts to measure Australia's comparative economic performance against its top 16 trading partners. On virtually all of the criteria that the measurement comparison is taken against, Australia performs very poorly. By 1992, Australia had the second highest rate of unemployment against the economies with which it was being compared. We had the fifth lowest rate of economic growth of all the economies shown. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of our ranking as an exporter, we have gone backwards in the decade from 1980 to 1990 as far as merchandise trade is concerned. In 1990, we were 18th in the world in world trade in merchandise. By 1990, we had slipped to 22nd. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very disturbing to note that Australia has lost its market share in important east Asian markets. We have fallen from a 4.3 per cent share of that market in the mid-1980s to a 3.8 per cent share in the early 1990s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said at the outset, the report on all counts is a quite damning indictment of our lack of progress in terms of economic reform when our progress is compared to other countries in the world.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats believe that there ought to be a wide-ranging inquiry of which the Industry Commission inquiry could be a part.

Although they were supposed to have been made available a week ago, we have still not been able to get our hands on them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to us that issues such as accounting and audit standards, law reform and a more complete list of church, welfare and not-for-profit sector organisations would be a very useful area of inquiry for the Senate. Our problem is that we believe that an inquiry by the Industry Commission would have too narrow a focus&mdash;a focus on economic and efficiency issues&mdash;and that this framework would not get at the areas in the whole charity and welfare sector which we believe need to be addressed.

That is an absolutely legitimate thing to do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My concern is with the totality of the report. I share Senator Woodley's concern but I suggest to him that we look at the Industry Commission in a new light now that it has a new chairman and hope that it will move out of the rut that it has got into as a propagator of economic rationalist theory in so many of its reports. The report I read recently that fits accurately into that category was the report on regional development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sensitive to the fact that the churches and charities are to be looked at.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">facilitate adjustment to structural change in the economy and to ease social and economic hardships arising from those changes.</PARA>
<PARA>Once again, I believe that this report lacks the emphasis on the need for social and economic hardship to be addressed in its reports. It has been my belief over time that the Industry Commission presents a one sided analysis of the particular problems of industry. It is dominated by a theoretical economic approach in most cases. At the same time it has not taken up the need to give the government advice on addressing the social and economic hardships which inevitably must occur if we seek to change the structure of society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For those reasons I am looking to the Chairman, Mr Scales, to broaden the approach of the Industry Commission in the future. I believe that the current inquiry into welfare and charities will probably be the final test for the commission. If the Industry Commission cannot be sensitive in this area in the way that I have described and finally achieve its objectives&mdash;I do not believe it has been able to do so up until now&mdash;we will have to examine whether it is worthwhile and if it is to be an authority for economic rationalist theories whether it might be better if it moves into the private sector. This would be one organisation that I could probably support for privatisation if it cannot give government balanced information and proposals for inevitable changes. If we propose change and we do not consider human beings, then we have failed. Up until now I believe that has been a singular weakness in the reports that have come from the Industry Commission.

<PARA>We have to think about the refugees coming into Australia at the moment and the problems they may create with some of their foods when they drop them on our northern shores.

<PARA>In Australia, our reputation in quarantine matters is second to none. Fortunately, the council has developed a formula for paying compensation before we have had a major outbreak. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This recommends that the valuation, for compensation payments, of animals that are destroyed pursuant to response programs or that die of exotic disease, be assessed on a `post-quarantine clearance' basis (`market value' at the time of death/ destruction, adjusted if necessary to take account of any upward movement in market value at the time the affected property is cleared from quarantine restrictions and thus is eligible for restocking).</PARA>

It also has significant potential implications for the total amount of money that the Australian taxpayers fork out to meet the salaries and other costs of employment of members of the Australian Public Service.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As my colleague Senator Kemp says, there are either a lot of very high performers or there are some very real questions to be asked about the underlying bases of the scheme. The second finding states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.there is an urgent need for the PSC and DIR to make a clear statement on whether performance pay is to be used as a reward for performance above normal job requirements or as recognition for the achievement of an officer's normal job requirements </PARA>
<PARA>In other words&mdash;and I am confident that my colleague Senator Kemp may build on this in his own remarks&mdash;we have been concerned for some time as to whether this system is simply going to be a method of giving a lot more people a lot more pay without any real performance requirement so far as increased productivity or efficiency is concerned. The third finding states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the higher the officer's classification the more likely they were to achieve a higher performance appraisal rating</PARA>
<PARA>Again, that raises many questions. It raises the old question in a different context of who guards the guardians, in my opinion, because if the main spin-offs&mdash;the higher appraisal ratings and, therefore, the higher financial rewards&mdash;are going to higher officers, one would surely have to question the efficiency of the operation and implementation of the scheme. It is an important finding that certainly requires a very careful explanation. The fourth finding states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.in some agencies, ratings and payments have not been awarded in accordance with the spirit of the guidelines</PARA>
<PARA>This is very damning criticism indeed. The Auditor-General's next finding states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the scheme is not always being used to identify poor performance or to ensure that poor performance is not rewarded</PARA>
<PARA>Again, this is a very important finding and a very critical one in terms of needing elaboration, identification and correction. The audit office also found that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the scheme is costly in administrative terms&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>not just in the amount of extra money paid to people but simply in the cost of administering the arrangements. For this initial cycle the cost was $52 million. That is a lot of money before one adds in one cent of the additional payments that have been made as a result of the appraisals resulting from the administration of the scheme. The audit office then goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However a significant number of agencies did not expect any improvement against the majority of the objectives for performance appraisal and pay  . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The final main finding of the audit office states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.most agencies plan to review their scheme. However, many have not identified any performance indicators to measure outcomes against performance appraisal and pay objectives.</PARA>
<PARA>This matter has also exercised the mind and attracted the concern of the coalition considerably in recent times. I think we have had some very worthwhile improvements in management practices in the public sector over the last few years. For example, the implementation of the financial management improvement program is a very desirable step forward, as are the performance statements, now required of government departments at the time of the budget, which form the basis of estimates committee examinations. There certainly have been improvements in some of these areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One thing that has always concerned me and a lot of my colleagues is that far too often results are immeasurable, or are seen to be immeasurable, because there have not been the proper performance indicators against which to make the necessary judgments. For the audit office to say that, even in the course of planning to review their schemes, many agencies still have not identified any performance indicators to measure outcomes against performance appraisal and pay objectives is a matter of considerable concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The audit office goes on to make various recommendations as a result of the deficiencies that it has noted in its audit. I will not go into all of those, other than to say that I believe many of these recommendations should not have needed to be made because the whole introduction of performance pay arrangements should have been much more efficiently managed than appears to have been the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General is to be commended for drawing the attention of the parliament and the community to the problems in the present arrangements. I hope that those deficiencies can be overcome, from the point of view not just of the taxpayers' dollars that are involved but also of the efficiency of the Public Service as a whole and the service that it provides to the community. After all, the one and only objective and the rationale for the Public Service is to provide that service to the Australian taxpayers, who are its clients. I commend the report to the Senate. I know others may wish to speak to it. This subject as a whole needs to be kept on the agenda of the Senate because it is a matter of considerable ongoing importance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I endorse the remarks of my colleague Senator Short on the Auditor-General's report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Pay for performance</EMPHASIS>. I do not propose to traverse the ground that he has covered so well in his comments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Acting Deputy President, you will be aware that the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration is currently considering the whole issue of performance pay. I am a member of that esteemed committee, which has had a number of days of hearings with people throughout the Public Service. We may have one or two more days of hearings and then we will move to a report. I certainly would not wish to pre-empt that report. The Auditor-General's office has offered to brief our committee tomorrow on this report. I certainly look forward to hearing its remarks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a very important report, and it presents the government with a major problem. The performance pay issue was rushed in prior to the last election. It has always surprised me that the Public Service unions were prepared to agree to significant pay rises for higher paid officers in the service and agree to lower pay rises for the so-called lower grades. It has always surprised me that in a period of serious recession, with incomes being cut all over the place, the Labor government was prepared to negotiate an agreement which, certainly at face value, seemed to be particularly generous to higher paid officers and less generous to lower paid officers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The story of how and why this agreement was reached certainly has to be written. It has not been written to date. Nonetheless, the performance pay scheme came in. It is now a significant part of the pay for higher paid officers in the Public Service. This report shows that it has run into very serious problems. From the evidence that I have heard from public servants, I have to say that the Auditor-General's views are widely confirmed by my experience and by comments that have been received. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently I had the privilege of addressing a seminar of middle management public servants. At the end of the seminar, the idea was that they should question me and put me on the spot so as to speak about the performance of senators. We are always questioning the performance of public servants, and we thought that public servants might like to return the compliment and fire some questions at me. The questions I received were not unkind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of the presentation, I asked them whether they could assist me. I asked the large number&mdash;probably in the order of 60 to 80&mdash;of public servants who were there, `Is there anyone in this room who is opposed to performance pay arrangements?'. There was obviously a degree of nervousness. I said, `Let me repeat it, just to get it clear and make it easier. Is there anyone in this room who supports performance arrangements?'. Despite a couple of urgings, I could not get one hand in the air. I think that shows that, at least amongst the middle management levels of the Public Service, there is widespread concern about the whole nature of this in the Public Service, the theoretical basis on which this has been brought into the Public Service, and the practice which the Auditor-General is exposing in his report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Performance pay can be very generous. At the very top level, for higher paid public servants, it can provide bonuses of up to $15,000. This scheme may well have been brought in to address what were perceived to be some anomalies between the public sector and the private sector, but the hearings that I have attended seem to show not only that there is a somewhat shaky theoretical base for performance pay but also that the implementation of it is a nightmare. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To illustrate just why this report is a big problem for the government, I will mention one of the recommendations which has not been mentioned to date. A number of agencies have decided to just provide a flat rate&mdash;in other words, to not really grade people on performance but provide a flat bonus to all who come within the ambit of the scheme. A couple of major agencies have done that, including, I think, the Australian Taxation Office. The Auditor-General recommends that this sort of arrangement, this flat rate payment, should be expressly excluded and says that it is contrary to the guidelines. The report goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . agencies with more than six senior officers who rate and/or pay all staff the same be subject to a review of their performance appraisal and pay practices&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>That is a very interesting proposal by the Auditor-General. The report further recommends:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that DoF&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the Department of Finance&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">be given the power to withhold supplementation for performance based pay for one cycle from agencies found to have taken a flat rating or payment approach to performance appraisal.</PARA>
<PARA>It is a very strong recommendation. It is directed at a number of senior agencies in the government that have, in effect, decided that it is better for staff morale to pay flat rate performance pay increases. Not surprisingly, this is causing a degree of angst in some of the departments, as we can see from their responses to this particular recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other issue that emerges here, which I do not think Senator Short touched on, is the need for government departments to be accountable on the one hand and to retain some privacy for the financial arrangements of officers on the other. This has been criticised in the Senate. Indeed, very real fears were expressed that this performance pay money could be used as a sort of political slush fund to reward mates. I can understand this because I think there is a real dilemma. Often in politics there are clashes of principle. One is the principle of privacy and another is the principle of accountability. In relation to performance pay, those two important principles clash. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that a couple of the more senior government departments were loath to provide the Auditor-General with the papers so that he could carry out his assessment because they felt it would intrude on the privacy of individuals. In the end, those departments, the Department of Treasury and the Department of Finance, decided to provide the papers, but the Auditor-General expressed concern that there should be any question at all that he should have access to all papers which relate to the expenditure of public funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude my remarks by saying that this is an important report. It has given the government a real problem from the perspective of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, which I can speak for, albeit only on my own behalf. I think it is an important document and will certainly be carefully studied by members of that committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This report of the Senate Select Committee on Community Standards Relevant to the Supply of Services Utilising Electronic Technologies is an important report as it goes to the question of the protection of privacy of individual Australians. The Senate over the years has regarded as a special duty the protection of the rights of individual citizens. That has always been regarded by the Senate as one of its special functions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 18 August 1993, the Senate referred to the committee for inquiry and report the following matter:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The 0055 service offered by Telecom called `Reverse Phone Directory', which enabled subscribers to match private telephone numbers with specific residential addresses and the development of a proper and enforceable code of conduct to protect the privacy of Telecom customers from developments of this kind.</PARA>
<PARA>I indicate&mdash;the report notes this on page 3&mdash;that the reverse phone directory referred to the committee for inquiry was not actually offered by Telecom, as could be inferred by the committee's terms of reference. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) provided by Telstra Corporation Limited (Telecom's parent company) is used to access the service, and the Service Provider of the 0055 technology is in a contractual relationship with Telstra for access to the PSTN, Telstra stressed in its submission that the suppliers of the several reverse directories currently on the market are not associated with Telstra in any way and their reproduction of the information contained in the conventional printed directories had not been authorised.</PARA>
<PARA>This report, though brief, is important. I think honourable senators would do well to read it and the public would do well to obtain copies. Just to explain, as the committee report does, reverse directories are directories which enable a user to ascertain a name and address by reference to a phone number, or the name and phone number by reference to an address. Unlike traditional printed directories, reverse directories are computer based. Whilst the reverse phone directory, RPD, is a relatively new initiative, reverse directories have been available in Australia for several years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Telstra's submission informed the committee that these reverse directories are compiled through a process of rekeying or scanning the entries contained in conventional printed directories and reproducing the information on a CD-ROM disk. The CD-ROM disk can then be loaded onto a computer where a number of tasks can be performed, including number to name searching. Honourable senators will realise that this has great and grave privacy implications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee received submissions from a number of organisations and groups and the committee is grateful for those submissions. We received submissions from Austel; Barwon Bank Pty Ltd; the Privacy Commissioner, Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission; the Telephone Service Providers Association of Australia; Telstra Pty Ltd, which is Telecom Australia; and the Victoria Police. We are most grateful for those submissions and the cooperation of those organisations with the work of the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 13 August Telecom announced a permanent ban from its network of all 0055 reverse directory services containing information about residential customers. In a prominent media announcement on 23 August it stated that, because of concerns having been expressed by many people about personal information being disclosed by the privately operated 0055 reverse directory service, the residential search reverse service was no longer available on its network. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also had an assurance from a private operator that, prior to any complaints being lodged, that operator had initiated privacy considerations to clarify what it believed to be its obligations. That is all to be supported, but the committee concluded that, whilst that private operator claimed the residential component of the RPD had been permanently suspended, there is a possibility that the service might be reintroduced in the future, unless the regulatory situation is settled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does the committee recommend for that regulatory situation? The committee has made certain recommendations which I think should be placed on the record. Our first recommendation is:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the principle of informed consent apply in relation to the use and re-use for commercial purposes of telephone directories containing personal details of individual subscribers.</PARA>
<PARA>Our second recommendation is:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Telephone Information Services Standards Committee implement as a matter of priority an amendment to the 0055 Code of Practice to entrench this principle.</PARA>
<PARA>Our third recommendation is:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Information Provider offering the Reverse Phone Directory service be instructed by Telstra&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is Telecom&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to immediately amend the 0055 message to indicate that only business information based on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Yellow Pages</EMPHASIS> is available from the service.</PARA>
<PARA>Our fourth recommendation is:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Government, in its consideration of AUSTEL's December 1992 <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Telecommunications Privacy</EMPHASIS> report, ensure that all telecommunications carriers and service providers will be required to provide subscribers with such privacy protection as the right to refuse, free of charge and without justification, to have their personal data included in a directory, and that the consent of silent number subscribers must be obtained before their personal data is provided by directory inquiries services.</PARA>
<PARA>I understand, of course, that this could well be costly, but I believe that the interests of privacy are paramount in this particular area, and the Senate committee was conscious of all the factors involved when it came to those conclusions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the report to the Senate. I think the Senate should realise that this is a hard working committee. It is composed of persons with very diverse views on a range of subjects. The Chair of the committee is Senator the Hon. Margaret Reynolds and the Deputy Chair is Senator John Tierney. We have Senator Bourne representing the Australian Democrats; Senator Burns from Queensland, Senator Barney Cooney from Victoria and Senator Stephen Loosley from New South Wales representing the ALP; Senator John Herron from Queensland representing the Liberal Party; and me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have made unanimous recommendations, one of which was recently directed to state censorship ministers on the question of guidelines for computer and video games. Unfortunately, it appears&mdash;and perhaps I am a little premature in saying this because it will be said more authoritatively&mdash;that the OFLC has chosen not to accept the unanimous recommendations of our committee in respect of that matter. Perhaps the federal and state Attorneys-General and censorship ministers should have a good look at what the Senate committee has unanimously recommended. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the subject of the current motion, it is urgent that our report be heeded because it has grave ramifications for the privacy of individuals within Australia. If organisations can access the names and addresses of individual Australians simply by accessing a telephone number through a CD ROM purchased by a company or a government department, it will be an intrusion into the privacy of the individuals if they have not had an opportunity to make clear that that information should not be available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I refer the Senate to our report at page 13, paragraph 2.24, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee concludes that, while it is claimed by&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and I will not mention the name of the private organisation&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that the residential component of the RPD is `permanently suspended', there is a real possibility that the service might be re-introduced in the future unless the regulatory situation is settled. One of the Committee's research staff has rung the relevant 0055 number and, at extra expense caused by various malfunctions of the service, ascertained that the service still claims to provide residential and business information, although `at present only business numbers will be given in full'. Clearly, the service exists and could be re-activated at short notice.</PARA>
<PARA>Unless the committee's recommendations are promptly taken account of, it is our view that there will be serious privacy consequences for a large number of Australians. I take this opportunity to thank the members of the staff of the committee for their excellent work. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would be the first to admit that in the past unions have not been terribly speedy in picking up the needs of female members of their unions in the work force. But in recent times that has changed quite markedly. I welcome the day when we have in this chamber the likes of Jennie George, Pat Staunton and Anna Booth. They would make a lot of women in the opposition have second thoughts about the ability of women and the ability of unionists. These are women who have great ability, knowledge and the capacity to work well within their unions, to work well for the people that they represent and for the businesses for which they work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the very interesting and important things that has been happening in recent times has been the fact that the ACTU and business have been working together to improve the number of jobs available for the unemployed and looking at how they can address the issues of regional development. These are all the important issues that relate to employment and unemployment. We are seeing cooperation between business and the union movement. The Industrial Relations Reform Bill is all about cooperation and bringing down something that was agreed to by all sectors of industry and the union movement aimed at improving the industrial relations area and to work towards the future. This is of vital importance to this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this debate we have heard a lot about the faxes that we have been receiving. I think Senator Woodley summed up the faxes particularly well. When it comes to theology, if there is anyone in this place who wishes to discuss theology and cast themselves as experts on theology, I would take heed of the opinion of one person only in that debate&mdash;I may be casting aspersions on others&mdash;and that is the opinion of Senator Woodley. He has been practising in this area and has been dealing with these matters for some considerable time. Therefore, I think he is a man who knows the subject and the issues involved.I found his contribution today to be very informative. It certainly exposed a number of the issues relating to the faxes that we have been sent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was interesting to hear on this morning's news that the opposition's shadow spokesperson on industrial relations is saying that there is only one thing that the opposition would revisit with Jobsback, namely the minimum youth wage. It is wonderful that we have actually had it outlined that, irrespective of what the election result was in March, this is the debate we were going to have. We were going to have this debate because of what the opposition was planning to introduce. All through Jobsback, and through Fightback for those who remember it, the opposition talked about the rights of the individual. But those opposite keep talking about these faxes that we have been receiving in our offices. The interesting thing is that they keep talking about the importance of the master-servant relationship. A master-servant relationship is certainly not a relationship where individuals are equal. It is a relationship where one is superior to the other. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Jobsback the opposition also talks about the right of the individual to negotiate. For negotiation to have any meaning, relevance or importance it has to be negotiation between people of equal ability, knowledge and standing. Master-servant relationships do not have people of equal ability, status and standing; they immediately put one on a more superior level than the other. I know that is something that opposition senators find very hard and very unpalatable, but if they want to talk to me about reading the faxes, I will certainly pick out the bits that they should be very conscious of. If they want to come in here and talk about the rights of the individual to negotiate, they have to make sure that the individual is able to negotiate from a position of equal power and equal ability. This does not happen with individual enterprise bargaining or master-servant relationships. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As has been said previously, the master-servant relationship is very similar to the master-slave relationship. I will tell those people who do not agree with me&mdash;and who do not want to agree with me&mdash;of the sorts of things that people are telling me when they come into my electorate office. They are not in unions. Why are they not in unions? Because their boss forbids it. What is the boss doing to them?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I currently have one case in my office where a whole series of employees are being paid $5 an hour. That is the allegation. There are also allegations of two sets of books and things like that. These are the sorts of things that one has to be very conscious of. Whilst opposition senators have said that all evil things belong to the unions and accuse us of saying that all evil things belong to the employers, I think it is very important to say that the bulk of the unions are good and the bulk of the employers are good, but let no-one come in here and tell me that there are no bosses who want to rip off their people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are the sorts of things that are happening now. These people have no ability to negotiate an individual contract because they have been given one of $5 of an hour. If they do not like it, they are out the front door.

They are unsure of themselves because things in the work force will have changed a lot in the last 10 years. These women do not feel that they are in the same equal position as their employer to be able to negotiate on a one-to-one basis and an equal basis. What about young people who have not developed the negotiating skills? Opposition senators tell us, `These people are fine. Let them go. It doesn't matter what happens to them'.

Not one of these new Labor types stood up for two decent working class women.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Industrial Relations Reform Bill is, as many of my colleagues have said, a pay-off to the trade unions for the support that they gave Labor during the election. It is not about reform, labour market flexibility, tackling the problem of one million unemployed in this country or increasing productivity. It is about none of those things. It is about entrenching union power and privilege and enabling unions to further interfere in proper arrangements between employers and employees. It is also about ensuring that the trade unions and governments decide industrial relations questions, not independent tribunals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will bring large sections of the private sector work force within the ambit of the federal industrial relations machinery by allowing the AIRC to prescribe minimum conditions for all employees. The bill also serves to undermine the independence of state systems. There is no question that it attempts to severely limit the capacity of democratically elected state governments&mdash;Victoria and Western Australia, in particular&mdash;to implement their mandates. This legislation singles out and discriminates against those state governments which have elected to pursue a different path to industrial relations reform from that sanctioned by the federal government and its ACTU mates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator West sneered at the faxes that so many of us have received from large numbers of people in small business. I do not demean those people. They are putting up their capital, their homes, their whole futures and their businesses and they are creating jobs. They are quite entitled to bring their views to the attention of senators without being demeaned by Labor parliamentarians. They have pointed out that this bill will cause major problems. It will lead to further interference by trade unions and their business. In some areas it will make it very difficult for them to manage their business and it will certainly inhibit investment. I am delighted that those people brought their views to my attention and have called my office to apprise me of their thoughts. Above all, small employers are greatly concerned about the possibilities of union intimidation as the secondary boycott provisions, which existed for so long in the Trade Practices Act, are gutted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill will pass the Senate only because of the support given to it by the Australian Democrats and the Greens. In the first 10 years of their existence, the Australian Democrats strongly opposed any measure to increase the power and privilege of big unions. Don Chipp's slogans attacked big unions and big business. That rang a pretty strong chord in many sections of the Australian public. The Australian Democrats strongly supported the secondary boycott provisions on many occasions in this parliament. In 1984 they voted against the government's legislation which would have repealed these sections.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no secret that the ACTU and some trades and labour councils in the states have actively courted the Australian Democrats for a number of years. I believe that this lobbying effort, as far as the unions are concerned, has been very fruitful. As far as the Democrats are concerned, it is a tragedy that they have thrown over their traditions and positioned themselves so closely to the Bill Keltys and Martin Fergusons of this world. </PARA>

<PARA>That was a very important statement by Don Chipp. I hope that Senator Kernot and Senator Spindler, when they consider this bill, will consider the traditions of their party, which have always been to defend small business. I hope that they will reconsider their position, throw over their new mates&mdash;the Bill Keltys, the Martin Fergusons and the John Halfpennys&mdash;and return to their source, because there are hundreds of thousands of people in small business who are waiting anxiously for their vote to defend them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleagues have extensively canvassed the reasons why the coalition will be strongly opposing this bill. I wish to touch on two aspects: firstly, the bill invites the High Court to subvert the constitution and proper democratic processes through adventurous and inappropriate uses of ILO conventions; and, secondly, I believe this bill undermines proper independent tribunals in the labour market area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is profoundly undemocratic in its basis. The Commonwealth is acquiring new powers, not through the democratic process of constitutional amendment but by misusing international treaties, ILO conventions and so-called customary international law. In taking this course, the Commonwealth is arrogating to itself powers which the Australian public has denied to it on at least six occasions since 1901. The regulation of industrial relations was a highly controversial topic at the turn of the century. The power conferred upon the Commonwealth government with respect to private sector employees was extremely limited. The limits the constitutional founders placed on the Commonwealth's power over industrial relations has been, and will be, totally subverted by international treaties. These treaties can be signed by the executive without any involvement of parliament, state or federal, and without proper consultation with the interested parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To show how absurd this position is, one clause of the bill relates to terminations. It depends on ILO convention No. 158. The termination provisions are hugely onerous and will make any employer think twice before putting on new staff. No-one suggests that employees should not be treated fairly, unlike the summary dismissal of the two housekeepers by Mr Keating at the Lodge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation will make the dismissal of incompetent, lazy or trouble making employees a legal nightmare. Under proposed section 334A one cannot dismiss someone for taking industrial action. This gives, in effect, a blank cheque for rogue behaviour by union officials. Strikes are legal in the negotiating phase but, interestingly, this bill makes it impossible to sack a person on strike outside this legal period. In fact, some people suggest that one may not even be able to stop pay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ILO convention on termination of employment was ratified during the government's caretaker period, on 26 February 1993, just two weeks before the election. No announcement was made at the time of what the government had done. This was a major international agreement which would provide a constitutional head of power and no announcement was made at the time. No press release was issued. There was no meaningful consultation with the states and no meaningful consultation with employers. No state government agreed to the ratification. My advice is that no Australian jurisdiction currently complies with the terms of that convention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is quite contrary to normal practice in the ratification of ILO conventions, whereby conventions are not ratified until after proper consultation with the states. The Commonwealth is able to assure the ILO that domestic law and practice conform with the terms of the convention. In short, this is an extraordinary state of affairs&mdash;unprecedented&mdash;and it may lead the High Court to conclude that the convention was merely entered into as a device for attracting power to the Commonwealth to enact legislation which it could not otherwise be able to validly implement. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ILO Termination of Employment Convention shows the absurdity of our current constitutional arrangements. The executive government merely has to sign a convention. The government acquires, as a result of the present High Court's generous interpretation of the external affairs power, the right to legislate on the termination of employment, overriding all state prerogatives. The federal government's aggressive use of ILO conventions, allied with the external affairs power, demonstrates the way in which it can impose its policies on the states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overall, some six ILO conventions are relied on by the government to give it the constitutional basis for this legislation. In other words, the conventions provide the major underpinning for the more controversial aspects of the bill which the Senate is now considering. This legislation allows the federal government to legislate directly in relation to terms and conditions of employment. It sharply curtails flexibility by limiting the matters over which employers and employees may bargain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One other area that is perhaps worth bringing to the attention of the Senate is the issue of the right to strike. The government is very uncertain of its powers in this area. From reading the covering memorandum to the bill, one sees that the government has thrown every available ILO convention and international instrument&mdash;as well as what it claims to be international customary law&mdash;into the bill in the hope that one or other of these devices will provide a legal foundation for its legislation on the right to strike. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may come as a bit of a surprise to many observers that there is no right to strike under ILO conventions. There is some jurisprudence which suggests that such a right may exist in limited circumstances. But a definitive opinion by the International Court of Justice&mdash;the only body which can rule on such matters&mdash;has never been made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that the government wants to confine the right to strike to unionists. A close reading of section 170P(a)(ii) tells us that the strike activity leading up to a certified agreement by union members is protected from civil action. Strike activity leading up to an enterprise flexibility non-union agreement is not protected. I believe that no such law is needed in this country. Australians have long exercised a right to strike. We believe that, in certain circumstances, it is justified. But there is no doubt that this agreement will probably lead to more intimidation of employers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final point I wish to make relates to how the federal government is undermining the independence and authority of our own arbitral bodies. It is really the politics of revenge. The arrogant Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and his mate Bill Kelty will simply not tolerate views different from their own. The commission has made the mistake of bucking such views and it is now to pay the price. When the commission rejected the accord, Mr Keating said&mdash;it is a quite famous quote&mdash;in the Sunday <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> on 5 May 1991, `Put in the parlance of the Gulf War, it will take some collateral damage'. Since then the commission has been taking damage. This bill is the culmination of this process of punishment for the commission. Furthermore, it will make sure that we never again have a commission with any semblance of real independence. This legislation will put the ACTU into the driver's seat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Proposed section 170QC of the legislation allows the Governor-General to assign a member of the commission to the bargaining division. As we all know&mdash;unlike Senator Evans's UN committees&mdash;the Governor-General acts on the advice of Australian ministers, and we all know what sort of person the minister recommends. How would honourable senators feel if they were an employer going up against an ACTU person before a member of the commission whose job depends on pleasing the ACTU? This goes to the heart of independence and being able to judge a case on its merits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also represents a malicious attack on the powers of the president of the commission. Proposed section 170QD makes it quite clear that when these people pick the new vice-president they want to run the bargaining division of the commission, that person will be able to tell the president what to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other examples of how the government and the ACTU have been at pains to destroy those who exercise independence of mind. It had already stacked the senior levels of the current commission with ACTU officials in order to ensure that the president could not create a full bench without the ACTU having a major say. However, even this was not good enough for the government and the ACTU. The remote control devices on a number of commissioners were obviously not working properly, thus the proposal for an industrial court of Australia&mdash;a labour court in the most perverse sense of the word, in that organised labour will be the only group to have any real say. It will be very interesting to see who is actually appointed to this body. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Law Council of Australia has added weight to a number of these points. It has observed that there is no reason for creating a specialist labour court, and it has stated very clearly that there are substantive reasons why this is the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will be particularly interesting to see whether this new court will come within the ministerial purview of the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) or the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton). At the moment a battle royal is occurring between the two ministers on this issue. I am opposed to the creation of this court. If it comes within the ambit of the Minister for Industrial Relations, the chance of this court achieving any standing and credibility amongst employers will be zero. This bill can be summed up in the following terms: it is a bill of the unions, by the unions, and for the unions. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe it is also true to say that we have been constrained to ensure that small business is not jeopardised in this process. I believe that the balance that has been achieved in this bill will benefit small business to a very great extent. Small business, just like large business, is dependent on a stable, just and predictable industrial relations environment together with a degree of flexibility, as I have mentioned. But small business will not benefit from a situation where employees are exploited for the gain of unscrupulous employers. We must guard against this in our society or we will rue the day and pay for it with not only social but also economic disadvantage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to confine my comments tonight to particular areas of the bill where I will be moving amendments. This bill is a welcome opportunity to advance the cause of basic equality in employment situations and the issue of equal rights generally. My comments will be confined to the two areas where I have already foreshadowed the moving of amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, I will be moving to remove discrimination on the grounds of sexuality, age or disability in an employment situation and to prohibit these areas as grounds for dismissal. Secondly, I will include in the Democrats' amendments a range of provisions to establish unpaid leave entitlements for workers caring for members of their immediate families who have fallen ill. In particular, my amendments will seek to ensure that the definition of an employee's immediate family includes the employee's spouse or de facto spouse irrespective of whether that person is of the same or opposite sex. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The central question on the discrimination issue is whether decisions relating to a person's employment should be made on the employee's capacity to carry out a particular job, and the person's conduct in the employment situation, or whether they should be made, all other things being equal, on the basis of a person's disability, age or sexuality. Even at a time when there is little or no legal redress available to people with disabilities, the Victorian Disability Employment Action Centre has dealt with 24 cases during the last 12 months in which it was claimed that individuals were wrongfully dismissed. The number of cases brought to the centre's industrial advocate would clearly be much higher if information on possible courses of action and greater recourse to the law were available to people with disabilities in employment situations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Complaints to the disability discrimination commissioner totalled 120, of which more than 50 per cent related to redundancy and dismissal. Refusal to hire, accessibility and appropriateness of training and other workplace issues also constituted a number of complaints to the commissioner. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Panizza may think that people with disabilities should not have any jobs and should not be considered for work. I am saying that people with disabilities should be treated, in an employment situation, just like any other person.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Elizabeth Hastings, the federal disability discrimination commissioner, has identified that discrimination in employment&mdash;particularly in the employment and dismissal of people with disabilities&mdash;is a key issue of human rights on which much more action is needed. The commission is currently putting together a manual on employment and disability discrimination issues which will complement the move to legislate against dismissal and discrimination on disability grounds, which my amendments will seek to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also time that our society paid some attention to the treatment that people receive on the basis of age. Upper age limits in the employment area seem now to have dropped to something like 35 to 40 years plus for women and 45 years plus for men. Australian Bureau of Statistics figures show that the number of job seekers between 45 and 54 years rose by 19 per cent between 1975 and 1981. In the 55 to 64 age bracket, the number of job seekers has risen by 142 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The latest ABS statistics illustrate that included in the 145,600 discouraged job seekers who have totally opted out of participation in the labour market are 32,200 individuals between 45 and 54 years and 32,800 individuals in the 55 to 64 age bracket. Clearly, age has become a major factor in inaccessibility to the labour market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other end of the scale&mdash;youth&mdash;also deserves some attention. The Australian Youth Policy and Action Coalition asserts that the sole use of age as a determinant of wages is the most serious form of discrimination in employment related to age. The coalition supports moves towards competency based wage fixing whereby experience, skill and overall employability are the determinants of rewards and not just the arbitrarily ascribed characteristic of an individual's age. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For young Australians, access to employment can be extremely difficult. Any moves that seek to address the discrimination faced by young people when seeking employment would, I submit, be moves in the right direction. Of the 400,000 Australians who are the very long-term unemployed&mdash;that is, those who are out of the labour force for 12 months or more&mdash;40 per cent are between 16 and 25 years of age. We should note this figure and realise that we are mortgaging the future of today's young generation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Inquiries to the Victorian Equal Opportunity Commission on age related discrimination issues are certainly on the increase. For the period from July 1991 to June 1992, 340 inquiries relating to age discrimination in employment were taken by the commission. For the period from July 1992 to June 1993, 429 inquiries were received. It is envisaged that, if the commission were empowered to act on these complaints, the number of inquiries would increase markedly, as is the case in areas such as sex and race discrimination, in which the commission has power to intervene. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now turn to the area of sexuality. Inquiries to the Victorian commissioner for equal opportunity on discrimination in employment in relation to sexuality have also been significant. From July 1991 to June 1992, the commission received 70 inquiries relating to sexuality discrimination. From July 1992 to June 1993, the inquiries had risen to 76. Statistics available for the period from July to October 1993 show that the commission received a record number of 51 inquiries for that four-month period. A research project conducted by the Melbourne group GLAD&mdash;Gay men and Lesbians Against Discrimination&mdash;based on a comprehensive survey of over 1,000 gay men and lesbians in Victoria, reported that lesbians and gay men in Victoria face considerable discrimination, harassment and violence solely due to their sexuality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular the survey notes the problems relating to employment. Some 45 per cent of lesbians and 45 per cent of gay men reported some form of discrimination or harassment, including loss of jobs, and they experienced this as a result of their sexuality. Clearly better community knowledge of the legal right to take action under ILO convention 111, which the Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission has control of, would increase the number of complaints that would be lodged. We need to consider whether we, as a civilised society, want to discriminate against a group of people in our society in the area of employment for no reason other than that they belong to a group that has a particular form of sexuality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will briefly turn to the other amendments which seek to ensure that carers, who care for members of their immediate family who have fallen ill, should include people who are not just from the traditional form of family. That concept should be expanded to include a de facto partner even where that person is not of the opposite sex. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principle that we need to look at is the very nature of the family and what family means to us. Should it be a traditional construct that says that a family is nothing but a husband, a wife and 2.2 children behind the white picket fence, or are we looking at the family as basically the caring unit of our community?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently we have had occasion to look at surveys that have been carried out in relation to the nature of the family, and it is there for all to see that the traditional structure of the family has changed substantially. That traditional structure is in the minority when we compare it with people who live either singularly or in households which have only one parent or in households which have a configuration of people of different sexualities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not suggesting that this is a desirable trend. I am simply putting it forward as an observable fact. I am challenging this chamber as well as the community generally to take account of that and to ensure that we treat human beings as human beings, irrespective of the structure in which they happen to live. I believe they are entitled to know that the family that they have chosen&mdash;in most cases this is beyond their control&mdash;should give them the same nurturing and the same caring that other people expect from a traditional family structure. I believe that this society will be judged on the degree to which it can claim to be a civilised society and the degree to which it can fulfil that obligation. </PARA>

By that definition, the family is reduced to an absolute nothing and has no quality or value whatsoever. The family in Australia overwhelming consists of a man and a woman and their children. That is what a family is all about. The primary purpose of a family is the care and nurture of children. The Democrats are jumping into bed with the government in the total debasement of the notion of family in the Australian community. I am absolutely appalled to hear that reinforced today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I oppose this bill because it appears to have been prepared totally in an ACTU inspired vacuum. It is almost as though there is no Australian economic problem, no massive foreign debt and no government deficit and we are in the balmy days of the 1950s when this country had a strong economy and was growing well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that we are not in a vacuum. We are in an absolute crisis of unemployment. This is the worst unemployment problem that we have had for 60 years. We have 11 per cent unemployment and one million Australians cannot get a job. I am reminded of that fact every time I fly into Adelaide, which is a city of one million people. When one flies over that city and recalls that the population of that city equates to the total number of people in this country who cannot get a job, it is appalling to think that this government has produced a bill which takes no account of that problem whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill deals with the operation of the labour market. Yet the government is prepared to continue as though the problem of unemployment, a labour market problem, does not exist. It is a sad reflection on this government that the second reading speech of the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton), as far as I can tell, made absolutely no reference to the problem of unemployment. Again, there is no evidence that the government knows that this problem exists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot find any publicly available assessment by the government of the impact of this bill on the level of unemployment. In my view, just about every piece of government legislation should be subject to an employment impact test. This bill should certainly be subject to such a test. I wonder whether the government has internally prepared such an assessment. Has it found out what the effect of this legislation will be on our disastrous level of unemployment? Either it has not done so, because it really does not care, or it has and the results are so appalling that it is frightened to expose them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill of all bills should be designed to deal with this massive problem of unemployment. If we examine the details of the bill and the effect it will have on business, it is pretty clear that it is likely to increase unemployment by making it more expensive and more difficult for business to employ people. I remind the government that it is business that generates jobs. The government's answer to unemployment is to float the idea of yet another tax on working Australians. It creates the problem, it brings in another industrial relations bill that exacerbates the problem and then it talks about another tax which will only increase unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill really does expose the ACTU-ALP conspiracy against the unemployed in this country. The government's senior Treasury officer, Ted Evans, put the spotlight firmly on this conspiracy when he said a while ago that our 11 per cent unemployment rate was `a matter of choice'. In other words, the senior Treasury officer of this country is saying that we are in a position where we can choose a lower level of unemployment and, therefore, a lower level of poverty. He said to the government, `It is up to you. You can choose a lower level of unemployment.' The government's senior Treasury adviser told it that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has happened? The ACTU-ALP government&mdash;and that is what it is&mdash;has chosen a high level of unemployment. This bill entrenches the status quo and thus entrenches the policy prescription which has sustained and produced this high level of unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is nothing more than a union based, over-award bargaining system. It is nothing more than that. It leaves us with a rigid, inflexible centralised system which fails miserably to ensure that everyone who wants a job can get a job. If there was something that emerged out of the depression that this country went through 60 years ago, it was a consensus between the parties that the objective of policy should be that everyone who can get a job should be able to get a job. This bill does not do anything to address that policy objective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Everything the government does should be aimed at promoting economic growth through encouraging investment. That will produce jobs. The government in its lighter moments would admit that. It admits that the answer is to produce growth through investment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what does this bill do? Businesses have reacted with horror to this bill. They are absolutely amazed that the government could in one breath say that it wants to encourage investment and in the next breath say that it wants to bring in such a bill. By definition, if business is horrified by this bill, investment will not be encouraged by this bill and business will start looking overseas more and more for business and investment opportunities. This bill will encourage the employment of people in other countries but not in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The irony is that this government, to its credit, has done quite a bit to open up the Australian economy. It has encouraged businesses to export and to think in world terms. They sure are going to think in world terms after they see this bill. They are going to think in terms of investing around the world. This bill will drive investment overseas and, therefore, drive jobs overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is regrettably a very silly and short-sighted sell-out to the ACTU and the union movement. It is very hard for those of us on this side who went through the last federal election campaign to escape the conclusion that this is the great payback for what the unions did for the ALP in that last election campaign. Those of us who were in the trenches saw the union movement rally behind this government by allocating a union to every federal seat that was in trouble and investing vast sums of hardworking union members' dues into the most filthy campaign against this side of the house; thus it returned this government. Here we see the price for that campaign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the really insidious aspects of this bill is its reliance on the International Labour Organisation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Strikes have gone down most dramatically. If a situation arises where there may be a boycott, where a boycott is threatened or even where a boycott is taken&mdash;and we on this side admit that boycotts can sow very deep seeds of division between employer and employee&mdash;this legislation says, `Look, let's not act while the blood is in the head, while nasty things may be said which we might regret saying later on. Let's not move for three days. Let everybody calm down. Let's cool things down. Let's see if we can establish things by direct relationship between employer and employee', which is what I thought the other side wanted. We could almost call that the coalition provision.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The secondary boycott provisions set down in part 6 are far-sighted, visionary provisions to enable employers and employees to work together well. On those rare occasions&mdash;becoming rarer under this government&mdash;when an unhappy relationship develops and, as a result of that, when there may be an attempt to carry out a secondary boycott, when tempers are high, this provides a breathing space whereby people can get back, as Senator Boswell would want, to talking to each other without rushing off to the courts. Part 7 of this bill details the establishment of a new Industrial Relations Court of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the scheme of these provisions, we see a continuation of the past. When that great liberal in Australian history Sir Alfred Deakin set up the Conciliation and Arbitration Act in 1904, I think he foresaw the sorts of things that the Labor government is now doing. I would think that perhaps he would be disappointed that the people who take their soul and their origins from him&mdash;coalition members&mdash;have not done this.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part VIA of the bill talks about the minimum entitlements of employees. Part 5 refers to promoting bargaining and facilitating agreements. Reference is also made in part VIB to promoting bargaining and facilitating agreements. Part 5 and part VIB achieve that purpose and provide the flexibility that people think should be present in the workplace. That is the new part of the scheme. The old part&mdash;the award system&mdash;and this new part are married. It is no good going in for radical and revolutionary methods when a slow but gentle and effective change is what is needed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is said we should adopt a system of direct bargaining between employers and employees. What happens with that system is that the employer, quite properly from his, her or its point of view, establishes sets of conditions and wages which the employee can either accept or not accept. A great illustration of that, I suppose, is the case that dealt with contracting and subcontracting outside the wage system&mdash;the Building Workers' Industrial Union of Australia and Others v. ODCO Pty Ltd, better known as the troubleshooters case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will read a passage from the judgment of the court of appeal, consisting of Messrs Justices Wilcox, Burchett and Ryan. The judge on the case being appealed was Mr Justice Woodward. They are all great judges. In the first instance, the full court referred to Mr Justice Woodward. The judges said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">His Honour also found that the rates of pay offered to its workers were adjusted unilaterally each year by Troubleshooters without consultation with the workers who were nevertheless advised of each adjustment shortly before or immediately after it occurred. He noted as well that the written contract between Troubleshooters and its workers set out above did not include the whole of the terms of engagement because it contained no reference to wet weather allowance, the six hours minimum payment or overtime provisions.</PARA>
<PARA>The point I want to make is that if we go ahead with a system that does not take into account the Industrial Relations Commission, the award system and the part the union movement plays in that, we will get a system in which there will be negotiations, but negotiations on the terms set by employers. We cannot blame the employers for wanting to do that, but we can blame the parliament if it does not set up a system, such as is contained in this bill, to prevent that happening. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Industrial Relations Reform Bill 1993, which we are debating tonight, should be a landmark in the essential reform of Australia's outdated, rigid, inflexible and very costly industrial relations system, and should reduce the iron-like grip of the trade union movement over our industrial relations structure. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The government had a golden opportunity, perhaps a once in a lifetime opportunity, to promote major reform. It had the support of the Australian public; it had the support of that 71 per cent of all private sector employees who have chosen not to belong to a trade union; it had the support of small and large employers and employer associations; it had the support of not a few of the more responsible trade union leaders; and it had the support of the coalition, which has long seen meaningful, sweeping reform of our industrial relations system as arguably the most important and serious challenge and opportunity facing our nation. That sweeping reform is essential is undeniable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we want to reduce the present cruel, intolerable and  unacceptable level of a million Australians unemployed, if we want to encourage new investment and so increase our productivity to improve our international competitiveness, both in our domestic markets and in overseas markets, and thereby increase job creation, reduce unemployment, give hope to our people and raise the living standards of all Australians, then we must remove the inhibitions and roadblocks that our antiquated industrial relations system places in the way of achieving these fundamental objectives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen today in the report of the Industry Commission, which follows a plethora of reports from government and other agencies, that industrial relations reform is quite crucial to the future of our nation. That is what was needed with this legislation. That is what we hoped the government might provide. Indeed, our hopes were buoyed shortly after the March election when, on 21 April, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said in an important speech&mdash;we hope it was an important speech; he thought it was an important speech&mdash;that there were not enough genuine enterprise bargains, that the agreements that did exist were insufficiently comprehensive and that too often they were merely add-ons to awards when they should be full substitutes for awards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At that time the new Minister for Industrial Relations, Mr Brereton, grandly echoed these noble sentiments, both in Australia and overseas. They were aspirations that had the full support of the Liberal and National parties because, in large part, they reflected the key objectives of the coalition's own industrial relations policy. But what happened? In a nutshell, the fact is that the government, the Prime Minister, his industrial relations minister, and the caucus in the end, never had any intention of following through on their fine rhetoric. Why not? Simply because the trade union movement demanded, as it always has, a payback for the massive support that it gave the Keating government during the federal election campaign in March of this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lest there be any doubt at all, let me just quote from the public debate which occurred between the ACTU Vice President, Jennie George, and Bryan Noakes of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, ACCI, on the contents of the bill now before us. In that debate Ms George said openly, frankly, blatantly and unashamedly:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What employers have to understand is that we won the election in March and this bill is a payback for the commitments that were made by the government in the course of that election campaign.</PARA>
<PARA>As my colleague Senator Parer, I think, said in his remarks yesterday, I do not recall Jennie George or the ACTU actually standing for election in March of this year. But so close is the relationship between the ACTU, the whole of the trade union movement, and the Labor Party that she, the Vice-President of the ACTU, could not draw a distinction between the two. So there we have it from the horse's mouth, from the Vice President of the ACTU herself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have before us now is not an Industrial Relations Reform Bill, which is the title of the bill, in any meaningful sense whatsoever. Rather, as my colleague John Howard said so accurately in the other place recently, what we have is a trade union payback bill. It is, at best, a Clayton's industrial relations bill and, at worst, a bill that in the most damaging manner sets back the essential course of reform of our industrial relations system. At the same time, it entrenches still further the power of the trade union movement in this country, despite the fact that the majority of workers in Australia have chosen not to be part of the union movement, have chosen not to join a trade union. As I said, 71 per cent of all employees in the private sector have chosen not to belong to a union. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of my colleagues have already made significant contributions to this second reading debate, and we will be pursuing many further and more detailed issues during the committee stage of these bills. I do not propose to reiterate much of what has already been said, but I do now want to summarise very briefly what I see as some of the more fundamental weaknesses and dangers in these bills before the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, before doing that, I would place on the public record my appreciation for the work done on these bills by several of my Senate colleagues. In particular I mention Senator Winston Crane and Senator Grant Chapman. Their dissenting report to the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training which inquired into these bills should be required reading for anyone who is interested in these matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before going to the content of the bill, let me also digress just briefly to comment on a couple of points that were made previously by a couple of government speakers. Before diner tonight, Senator West claimed that all the faxes we have all received about the urgency and problems of the bills before us are&mdash;so Senator West claimed&mdash;something to do with a master-servant relationship; indeed, she went on to talk, I think, about a master-slave relationship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What absolute nonsense that is. It is a complete lie because, in fact, very few, a handful, less than 10 of the many hundreds of faxes that most of us have received have made any mention at all of a master-servant relationship or anything vaguely relating to it. Rather, the faxes reveal the full extent of the huge concern felt throughout the community, and particularly throughout small business&mdash;the backbone of this nation, the very important sector of this nation without which we will never prosper and thrive and go on to higher living standards, job creation and reduced unemployment&mdash;about the grave dangers inherent in this legislation. That is what the faxes I have been receiving are all about; that is what the faxes that my colleagues have been receiving are all about. Quite frankly, the comments made by Senator West before dinner tonight were just absolute nonsense and totally incorrect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a couple of factors I would like to mention in relation to Senator Cooney's speech which preceded mine. He talked about this bill being a pro-employer and a pro-employee bill. I agree that we can have a bill which is a win-win; there is no doubt about that. If the government had got its act together and got it right, we would have had a win-win bill for employers, employees and Australia. But I believe that for Senator Cooney to say this is a bill which is pro-employer and pro-employee is just cloud-cuckoo land. He has obviously read a bill which is different from the one I have read, because everything in this bill is stacked against employers&mdash;and shortly I will come in some detail to my reasons for that statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Cooney also, though, questioned why there had not been a discussion in this debate on what minimum standards should apply. So far as the coalition is concerned, that has all been set out and its policy is there and has been on the record for a long time for all to see. So far as terms and conditions of employment are concerned, there are minimum standards that should apply in this country; there is a safety net in any policy that the coalition has put forward; and to imply, as Senator Cooney has implied tonight, that opposition to the provisions of this bill somehow or other means opposition to having a set of minimum standards is, with due respect to my friend Senator Cooney, equal nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bills suffer grievously from lack of involvement in their formulation by employer representatives. The consultations leading to this bill were supposed to be tripartite; they were supposed to involve the government, the unions and employers. But employers were almost totally shut out; it was a lock out, so far as they were concerned. For example, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry&mdash;which represents 30,000 Australian businesses of every size, shape and colour across the length and breadth of this nation&mdash;was not represented on the negotiating committee. It was not even provided with a copy of the final agreement which was struck between the government and the ACTU. One could only describe that as an act of vindictive, spiteful, petty and counterproductive retribution by a vengeful Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The lack of consultation and the unseemly haste involved in the drafting of this legislation was reflected in the government itself, when it went into the House of Representatives with its famous bill, having to produce no less than 177 amendments to its own bill. That is an absolute disgrace for a government which claims to be an efficient and competent manager. Not only that but, having gone through all that process, it comes into the Senate with the bill and in the last day circulates amongst us a whole raft of further amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite contrary to the Prime Minister's post election rhetoric, these bills entrench the rigid award system as the basis for our wage fixing system. This inhibits the flexibility and labour mobility that is essential for increased job creation and improved productivity. This is the great lost opportunity&mdash;the opportunity to grasp the nettle and introduce a framework for an environment of dynamic, responsive human and industrial relations needed so desperately by this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill comprehensively advantages trade unions and, equally, it comprehensively disadvantages employers&mdash;and, I must say, many individual employees. The employers' rights of access to common law are restricted and disadvantaged by this bill; so also is employer redress against secondary boycotts significantly weakened in this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> This bill has a totally different philosophy from that which the government intimated, through the Prime Minister's speech back in April, that it would introduce. The philosophy behind this bill is that one should not move away from strict award provisions without considerable difficulty. What is needed in this country is a bill which encourages direct negotiations between employers and employees to achieve essential productivity gains needed to reduce unemployment and increase living standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The transfer of sections 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act to the Industrial Relations Act removes employers' protection against political boycotts by rogue unions and others. The proposed changes mean that a business, organisation or individual will not have access to quick and effective relief against an irresponsible boycott action. Indeed, what happens under this bill is that it would take 72 hours before any action can take place; that is, before an employer can go to law and get injunctive relief. Lots of businesses, particularly small businesses in the climate that we have in Australia today, can go broke in 72 hours. Yet this bill prevents them from taking any action of an injunctive or any other nature to solve that problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because the bill reinforces and extends the reach of the federal award system, it reinforces and extends the reach of trade unions. Unions are given extraordinary standing, even in the case of agreements for non-unionised workplaces. The bill allows preference to be given to unionists over non-unionists when an agreement is being negotiated. That is a problem of very significant measure so far as employees who choose not to join a trade union are concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But a preference clause the other way&mdash;that is, in favour of a non-unionist&mdash;is prohibited under this bill; in other words, in effect we have a proposal that leads us to the closed shop and to compulsory unionism. That is just like the familiar `no ticket, no start' demand that we have had in this country for far too long. Unions should not be able to demand preference and employers should not be able to trade on it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also relies on the use of the external affairs power of the constitution to create minimum standards based on ILO conventions and recommendations and to impose them on traditional state jurisdictions. In my view, that is simply not on in a democratic country such as ours. First of all, there is the use of the external affairs power at all for these measures, but even worse than that is the selective use that the government has made of the external affairs power in this legislation. That is a use that my colleagues Senator Crane and Senator Chapman, in their dissenting report on the inquiry into this matter, described very accurately as obnoxious. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will not facilitate access to enterprise agreements by non-union workplaces. Indeed, the bill will deter most, if not all, non-unionised workplaces from seeking access to an enterprise flexibility agreement. We on this side of the chamber believe that when striking an enterprise flexibility agreement there should be no requirement either for a dispute to exist or for a trade union to be able to participate in the approval process by right. Sure, a trade union can participate if all parties want it to participate, but it should not be there to participate by right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Industrial Relations Court (Judges' Remuneration) Bill 1993 establishes an Industrial Relations Court of Australia. There is no valid reason at all that has been given for that. It was rejected by this government in 1988. There has been no evidence as to why that situation should change. There are many other provisions in the bill which are equally objectionable and questionable, but time does not permit us to go into them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, this legislation is worse than a lost opportunity; it is a massive sacrifice of our nation's competitive future, the hopes of the unemployed and underemployed and the prospects for employers and employees alike to work together to achieve success in this very important area of industrial relations. For all of those reasons, I join with my other coalition colleagues in flatly rejecting this bill, hoping that the government will withdraw it, go back to the drawing board and start again. That is the only thing that can satisfactorily conclude this debate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During this debate there has been a lot of hyperbole but we have just heard it lifted to an art form. It was an argument so overstated and overblown as to be almost a parody of itself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Industrial Relations Reform Bill 1993 is an important bill that warrants an important debate. I welcome the fact that there has been such an extensive debate; in both houses of parliament there have been more than 50 speakers. That is an indication of the interest in the bill, of the substance of the bill and of the significant differences about the issues raised by the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the government's point of view, this is a bill which makes a very important contribution to labour market reform in Australia. Notwithstanding the strength of difference of views about how such reform should be pursued, I think there is an agreed concern that we need to lift competitiveness and efficiency in Australia. What we need to focus on in considering this bill&mdash;and what the public needs to focus on in making its decisions about the merits of the arguments put forward, as the public concentrated on the issues in contention with regard to this bill during the course of the election&mdash;is the different approaches to achieve the reform that we all agree is required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the course of the election, in the development of this bill, in the bill and in the debate about the bill, the government has consistently said that there are twin themes: flexibility and fairness. We hear a lot said about flexibility. I do not want to underestimate its significance but sometimes in the debate people have been mute about fairness; that is, about being fair to those who are, in many instances, the weaker party in the contract negotiations in the industrial relations arena. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because the government is very concerned about fairness, we made it an important issue in the election. We reiterated it in the debate leading up to this bill. It is in the bill on the basis of very strong worker protection with a secure and relevant award safety net. These are not only important in social terms, in terms of the rights of the individuals who are affected; they are also vital to the success of labour market reform. When there is a secure safety net, the possibility exists for constructive workplace flexibility and for negotiations without fear of a major loss of conditions and entitlements, because the underpinning exists. So a basis exists for mutually confident negotiations that can lead to workplace flexibility and dynamic productivity growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Throughout the decade the government has had a commitment to a cooperative approach to industrial relations, to recognising the importance of protecting and advancing the interests of working men and women in Australia, but it has done so in a cooperative, agreed fashion. As part of that process the bill before us has been developed on the basis of an extensive consultation process. There has been a lot of talk, including in the most recent contribution, about there not being significant consultation, and I will detail that in just a moment. But the first thing to remember about the consultative approach in a democracy is that the government's basic approach to industrial relations reform was well established and known before the last election. It was an important issue in the last election and the people made their choice on that, amongst other factors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the election the proposed legislation has been subject to an intensive consultative process. Let me give a few figures. Since April the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) has had 36 face-to-face meetings with employer organisations and individual business leaders; he has had 28 meetings with trade unions; he has delivered 14 major speeches outlining progress with the bill's development; he has had two meetings of the tripartite National Labour Consultative Council; he has convened two meetings of Labor ministers, that is, with his state and territory colleagues; and he has had numerous meetings with interest groups. In the course of that consultation, the minister has visited all states, most of them on two or more occasions. As honourable senators would know, but perhaps not anybody else, the legislation has also been the subject of two Senate committee inquiries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said in my opening remarks, in the House of Representatives and the Senate combined we have had more than 50 speakers on the bill. There has been very widespread consultation and opportunity to participate in and contribute to the debate. Notwithstanding the widespread consultation, there is no agreement, and that is not surprising. No legislative package could ever hope to satisfy all the competing groups with an interest in industrial relations. It may well be that this is a bill&mdash;from the government's point of view, it is, but it is a matter for debate&mdash;that is broadly in the interests of employers, employees, the society as a whole and the economy as a whole. But it does not meet everybody's expectations; no bill ever will. So it is not surprising that we do not have consensus, notwithstanding the broad base of consultation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some important matters laid down in this legislation. They are matters that need to be recognised, acknowledged and given due weight in consideration of the bill itself and any amendments to it. I will not deal with the amendments in this speech because that is for the committee stage of the debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will outline the key principles underlying the bill. It is important to remember that the government's proposals put the onus on the industrial parties to take responsibility for their own industrial relations. It is another step away from the traditional approach in the early part of this century which assumed that there was, through an arbitral process, the capacity to resolve all problems through a centralised system. The proposals give greater access to formal enterprise bargaining through, on the one hand, certified agreements and, on the other hand, enterprise flexibility agreements. The scope for innovation through these mechanisms is already being shown through certified agreements under the existing legislation which are generating an impressive range of productivity measures. These will now be supplemented by enterprise flexibility agreements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> There has been concern that in some way the safeguards built into the process will deter employers from using these processes. But the safeguards protecting workers' wages and conditions do not seem to me, to the government or to the majority of Australians to be onerous. They are protections that will not cause any problem where any employer reaches an enterprise flexibility agreement which is fair. Nobody in those circumstances should face any difficulty in having agreements approved. Rather than impeding flexibility, the protections will ensure that negotiations can focus on sustainable productivity improvements and not the mere consideration of one-off cuts to wages and conditions and the inevitable conflict that arises from attempts so to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to reiterate the underlying reasons why trade unions responsible to the relevant award and members at the workplace have a right to be involved in the negotiation of agreements. It seems only fair in the circumstance when they are parties to the matter which is under discussion and when members of the organisation are at that workplace. It is very unusual to argue that a party to a matter under consideration should not have rights to participate in the reconsideration of that award or agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If unions do not have any members, then their right is limited to being heard before the Industrial Relations Commission during the approval process to argue whether the agreement meets the legislative requirements. But in those circumstances there is no union veto. It is for the Industrial Relations Commission to determine and apply the no disadvantage test. But the government regards the no disadvantage test as a very important principle. It does allow for agreed reductions if these are judged not to be against the public interest&mdash;for example, as part of a strategy for dealing with a short-term crisis and revival. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has unashamedly&mdash;in fact, quite proudly&mdash;underpinned its industrial relations reform with firm worker protections. It has done so in recognition of the sorts of concerns that have been raised, amongst others, by senators from the Greens, the Australian Democrats and members of the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key safeguards provided in the bill are about the effective award safety net, the no disadvantage test, the framework for fair and effective bargaining and protection for workers against discrimination. The bill's protective provisions will be complemented by other government measures, including an annual survey to monitor developments with enterprise bargaining and particularly its impact on disadvantaged groups. The design and analysis of this survey will be developed in conjunction with the Sex Discrimination Commissioner. The government will also meet its commitment to establish work in women's centres to advise women on enterprise bargaining and other work-related pay and conditions matters. Overall the government considers that the proposals strike the right balance between enhancing flexibility and ensuring an adequate safety net of employee protection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats have raised with the government the issue of special carers' leave for workers to look after sick dependants. The government will be giving consideration to future legislation to extend the minimum entitlements provisions, giving effect to ILO convention 156 on workers with family responsibilities, to provide for such leave. This would be pursued subject to the outcome of a test case conducted before the Australian Industrial Relations Commission on application from the ACTU seeking the setting of an appropriate standard. Adopting this approach, rather than legislating now for the leave, is seen as the preferable way to go, given the absence of existing community standards on this matter and the accepted role of the commission in setting such standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although this is a very important bill, I do not want to unduly delay consideration of it. In conclusion, the bill before the Senate is a balanced package. It does not pursue narrow, ideologically inspired, quick fix deregulationist approaches. Rather it is looking, with a sense of reality, towards a constructive way forward&mdash;not something prescribed in a first-year economic textbook or a theoretical model, but a practical, on the ground way of achieving what have the potential to be important reforms if the Senate passes them in the form sought by the government. It provides ample opportunities for flexibility and cooperative approaches to lift competitiveness and productivity. It also ensures that the interests of workers are protected. Its combination of flexibility and fairness is the only way to achieve the sustainable improvements that Australia needs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Amendment Bill implements an important wine agreement reached between the European Community and Australia last year. The agreement, which followed five years of negotiations, is a milestone for our export oriented wine industry&mdash;an industry which exported $293 million worth of wine last financial year. Almost half of that, or $144 million, went to the European Community, despite strong objections to Australia using wine names based on wine growing regions in Europe.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wine agreement means that Australia will phase out European names and protect a list of thousands of EC geographical names which are of no commercial significance to Australia. Little used names, such as frascati and white bordeaux, will be phased out by the end of the year, while the next group of names, including chianti and madeira, will be phased out by December 1997. No date has been set for the commercially important names, such as claret, chablis, burgundy and champagne, but negotiations on a phase-out date are due to conclude by 31 December 1997. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Importantly, the wine agreement will enable Australia to enter other international agreements; improve access to the European market by reducing the number of analyses required by the EC from eight to three; and allow Australian sweet wine into the EC for the first time. Under the agreement, each party will recognise each other's regions and winemaking practices and standards. In light of that, I am pleased that our winemakers have already starting replacing European names with varietal and brand names. Once protection comes into effect, European and Australian geographical names will only be used to indicate the true place of origin of the wine. In fact, the bill creates several new offences, including the false or misleading use of geographical names and traditional expressions for wine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also establishes a Geographical Indications Committee to determine Australian boundaries for geographical identification purposes. For example, if a wine is labelled Hunter River wine, the grapes must come from the Hunter River region. The committee will compromise nominees of the Winemakers Federation of Australia, the Wine Grape Growers Council of Australia and the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support this legislation on behalf of the Australian Democrats. The Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Amendment Bill 1993 implements the December 1992 wine agreement reached between Australia and the European Community. Most importantly, the agreement delivers European acknowledgment of the winemaking practices of the Australian wine industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wine industry believes this is a very significant occasion as it confirms Australia's status as a quality wine producer of international standard. The agreement and the legislation will also give Australian winemakers a significant head start on many of their major competitors, as many other winemaking nations appear to be a long way off reaching similar agreements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation hopes the European Community agreement can be finalised before Christmas. It must go before the parliaments of the individual European nations for ratification. However, the corporation believes this is just a formality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When ratified, the agreement will do the following: improve European access for Australian wine; provide mutual recognition by Australia and the EC of each other's winemaking practices and standards; restrict the use of geographical names and indicators; phase out the Australian use of European geographical indications; allow the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation to set up a Geographical Indications Committee, which will define the names and boundaries of the Australian wine regions; and establish a register of geographical indications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Improved access to European markets is a vital part of the Australian wine industry's strategy to reach its billion dollar export target by the year 2000. The Wine and Brandy Corporation believes that as long as Australian winemakers conform to the new regulations and standards, there is no reason to believe that Australians will be denied access to European markets. With the agreement providing official confirmation of our winemaking status, exports to Europe should be significantly boosted from the 1992-93 level of about $150 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The restrictions on the use of geographical names and indications and the phasing out of Australia's use of European names is scheduled to begin by 31 December this year for some infrequently used names, such as beaujolais and frascati. Other groups of names, including chianti and madeira, are due to be phased out by 31 December 1997. The phasing out of more frequently used names, such as chablis, champagne, claret, port, sherry and white burgundy, is still to be negotiated. Australian winemakers have retained the right to use the terms hermitage, lambrusco and riesling, pending the determination of the phase-out period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Wine and Brandy Corporation believes that some sections of the media have sensationalised the European names element of this agreement by suggesting that Australian winemakers must stop using European names and indications altogether by 1997. The proposal states that agreement on a phasing out period must be reached by 1997, possibly giving Australian winemakers many years to come up with alternatives to those frequently used European names. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In some cases, particularly with products such as port and sherry, finding suitable alternative names could well be difficult. However, winemakers realise they cannot afford to paint themselves into a corner and are prepared to search for alternatives. My discussions with winemakers in the Coonawarra region of South Australia suggest the process of phasing out European names is already well under way. No doubt this applies to other winemaking regions as well. With proper marketing, it will not take Australian consumers of wine and port long to learn that their favourite beverage is now sold under a new name.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In return for the phasing out of European names and indications, the EC has offered Australian winemakers a number of important concessions. These concessions cover issues as varied as sparkling wines, show awards and blending. Perhaps the most important concession relates to certificate requirements. Australian wines will now undergo only three alcohol and acidity analyses instead of the current eight. The EC has also promised to register expanded lists of grape varieties and geographical indications, while there will be annual consultations to resolve issues affecting the wine trade between Australia and the EC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have some concerns over the boundaries aspect of this bill. The bill gives the Wine and Brandy Corporation the authority, through a new geographical indications committee, to define the names and boundaries of Australia's wine making regions. The corporation says it has fully consulted the industry and individual regions about this matter, and there is certainly no reason to doubt that. Winemakers have expressed to me that they support the definition of boundaries as it protects the high prices that they often paid for their land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, to again use the Coonawarra as an example, there is already one challenge to the boundary that has been drawn around this region. Clearly the drawing of boundaries is a very difficult task and there will be winners and losers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation provides a mechanism for hearing grievances. Once the initial determination of the geographical indications committee is published, those affected will have one month to make a submission to the committee. The committee's final determination will then be published, and if there are still objections, the affected parties have the right to appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The tribunal's rulings will be final. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Wine and Brandy Corporation Amendment Bill provides enormous advantages for the rapidly expanding Australian wine industry. The bill is widely supported, certainly by the winemakers I have spoken to, along with the Winemakers Federation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill is central to the bilateral wine agreement with the European Community, and puts Australia at the forefront of wine trade with Europe.

Under these circumstances the Democrats are pleased to support this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Amendment Bill. Coming from the Hunter, Australia's premier wine growing region, I naturally feel that this bill before the Senate tonight is very important. The purpose of the bill is to provide for the protection of Australian and foreign country wine names and descriptions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed amendments before the Senate are intended to give effect to a recent agreement between Australia and the European union aimed at developing and promoting the trade in wine, and this is welcomed. Because these amendments are supported by the industry and will assist the industry to increase its trade, the coalition will be supporting the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The agreement which this bill implements is a result of negotiations between the European union and Australia which began in 1988. The agreement provides for the mutual recognition of each other's winemaking practices and standards, affords mutual protection for each party's geographic names, allows Australian winemakers greater market access with respect to different varieties, specific regional wine blends and certain sweet wines, and the gradual phase out of the Australian use of European union geographical names. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wine agreement has the support of the Winemakers Federation of Australia and the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation. Both of these organisations consider the agreement to be a platform from which Australia can expand its wine exports into the EC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is with this point in mind that one expresses some surprise at the government's position on the bill because everything else it has done in recent times in this industry seems aimed at destroying its export potential. I refer to the appalling proposal in the budget to increase the wine sales tax to 31 per cent. This is a measure described by the Chief Executive of the Orlando Wyndham Group as `cutting industry off at the knees'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current ALP government certainly did not consider the export potential of the Australian wine industry as significant enough to propose that idiotic measure. Fortunately, due to the firm stance taken by the coalition, the government's tax measure was not able to go ahead and the government was forced into a compromise. It had to lower the tax rate. The gradual changes that it has been forced into gives this industry, with its tremendous export potential, some hope of surviving and prospering. Any increase in tax we felt was unwarranted and something for which the government had absolutely no mandate. Fortunately, due to the actions of this parliament, it was forced to compromise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note the speech given by the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) in the other place. Contrary to the evidence of the last budget, Mr Fitzgibbon actually tried to claim that the Labor government had been working to help the industry to increase its profit margins. He quoted Mr Brian Croser, the President of the Winemakers Federation of Australia, who stated last year:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian wine industry can only be judged as an outstanding success in all but its profit margins, and there it is turning a corner.</PARA>
<PARA>The extraordinary irony of this is that Mr Fitzgibbon acknowledged that the only problem with the wine industry is its low profit margin. He then supported an increase in wine sales tax which will reduce sales and cut the profit margins even further. One would wonder about the logic of an honourable member who advocates that. It is absolutely extraordinary when he comes from a major wine growing area. There was a need for him and the government to realise that the tax impost they were proposing would damage the industry. It would do that by undermining the domestic sales base. We cannot build the expertise and the profit reserves necessary to continue our work in the export market unless we have that domestic base. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unlike the government, the coalition understands the needs of the wine industry and has shown throughout its opposition to increase tax imposts on this industry.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak briefly on the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Amendment Bill 1993. This bill gives effect to the EC-Australia wine agreement reached back in December last year after more than five years of negotiations. I am particularly concerned to put on the record, because some honourable senators may not know, that we have a small but very important wine industry in Queensland. It is based in Stanthorpe and Roma.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that the European Community is currently our largest wine export market, with a massive 44 million litres of wine worth over $140 million exported to that continent in the last financial year, the importance of this agreement ought to be obvious. This is particularly true given the wine industry's stated desire to see the value of wine exports reach an annual target of $750 million by 1996-97 and a billion dollars by the year 2000. The great thing about those figures is that they are achievable and probably will be reached. We certainly give three cheers for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This agreement will greatly enhance access to the European Community for Australian wines, firstly, by reducing the paperwork and the number of analyses the Europeans require our wines to be subjected to and, secondly, by allowing the export of our sweet wines to the European market for the first time. The agreement also provides for a mutual acceptance of the wine making practices and standards of each of the parties and does so without compromising the health or labelling standards applicable in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the most visible aspect of this agreement from a consumer's point of view will be that it provides for the restriction of the use of geographical names and indications in the wine industry. Other speakers have also mentioned this fact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We agree with the commitment given by Australia to move towards the phasing out of the use of various European regional names to describe our wines. It is certainly a sign of our maturity. The fact that we are getting over our cultural cringe means that we are able to affirm this strongly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The speed of this phase-out will be based on the commercial importance of the individual name being used and will allow time for consumers to become accustomed to the new names. Clearly, given that the use of the European names has gone on for over a century and our wines are now so readily identified by those names, the readjustment to new varietal and brand names will take some time and, I suspect, a fairly concerted marketing effort on the part of the wine industry. But it will be achieved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the replacement of the European names with names representative of Australian varieties and brands is an important part of Australian winemakers differentiating our wines on world markets as the superior quality and distinctive wines that they are. Given the quality and purity of our wines, I am confident that the new names will establish themselves quickly. I would like to predict that Queensland names will be there. I would suggest that some imaginative names might be `Roma Red', `Warwick White' and `Stanthorpe Sweetener'. We look forward to what the industry will come up with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To follow up this phasing out of geographical names the bill provides for the establishment of the geographical indications committee to the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation and a register of clearly defined geographical indications. Finally, and most importantly, the agreement ensures that the Europeans will not impose additional certification requirements on our exported wines and, of course, the converse is also true. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill has the full support of the Winemakers Federation of Australia and in my home state it also has the support of the Wine Industry Council of Queensland. The overall thrust of the bill will be to facilitate the wine trade between Australia and the European Community. I, for one, certainly hope that this piece of legislation and the agreement that it enacts plays a part in ensuring that our wine industry reaches the export targets it has set itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, as my colleague Senator Lees has said, a further measure that the Democrats have called for for many years now, and one that will be essential if the industry is to reach these targets, is the establishment of a specific industry plan for our wine industry. As with any industry, the changes governments impose need to be framed within an overall strategy for that industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was one of the reasons the Democrats were so strongly opposed to the 55 per cent increase in sales tax as it was originally proposed within this year's budget. The move was a revenue raiser pure and simple and it was made in isolation of any specific separate wine industry policy. The absence of such a policy was a factor in our consistent opposition to the sales tax increases on wine back in 1984 and again in 1986. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When talking of providing assistance to the wine industry it is instructive for us to look at page 17 of the recently released annual report of the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation, which shows that over the past four years the level of wine exports from Australia has more than doubled from 41,654 kilolitres in 1989-90 to over 100,000 kilolitres in 1992-93. At the same time, however, the figures also show that our wine imports have gradually decreased year after year over that same period. This is exactly the sort of industry we ought to be protecting and encouraging, one with rapidly increasing exports and declining imports. Would it not be great if we could describe every Australian industry in that way!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that the sales tax increase of 55 per cent, as proposed, would have had a severely negative impact on all sections of the wine industry, including the export sector. In particular, the sudden effect that such an increase would have had on those wineries and vineyards in the smaller wine regions such as Stanthorpe in my home state would have been devastating. And let us not forget that wine is predominantly produced by small local businesses, from the grape grower right through to the winery. While the size of the crush in Queensland is not as great as that in other states, as Senator Lees has reminded me, the potential of the Queensland industry is enormous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we are looking at the Stanthorpe region, as with other wine producing areas, we do not only see the wineries themselves but also the level of tourism those wineries and vineyards generate and the many hotels, motels, restaurants and other facilities the area provides to service those tourists. To have imposed a huge taxation increase would have not only put at risk the livelihoods of those involved in the production of wine in the region but also put at risk many associated industries and, ultimately, the very existence of that great region itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is these sorts of factors that need to be considered before imposing a change of the magnitude proposed in the budget, and it is these sorts of factors that a specific industry plan would be able to take into account. Such a plan, combined with the agreement enacted by the legislation before us today, will be essential ingredients for our wine industry to increase its exports into the huge European market and to reach its target of $1 billion worth of exports by the year 2000. I commend the bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I was recently in Europe I had the opportunity to talk with people involved in trade and I found the success of Australian wines is much commented on. Indeed, Australia is now the fourth biggest exporter of wines to the United Kingdom following France, Germany and Italy, and we have already displaced Spain. Australian wine sales in Britain have increased by 80 per cent to 100 per cent each year since the late 1980s. In 1989, Britons were buying 7.3 million litres and that has now jumped to 36.2 million litres. I would definitely say that the Poms are getting right into our wines and enjoying them. We are doing a great job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Might I add a rider to that? My experience in the United Kingdom just recently was that the New Zealanders are starting to get under our neck. And we should not forget South Africa and other countries which are competing with our wines in that market. So we cannot rest on our laurels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The French are particularly nervous because Australia produces high quality wines in the mid-price range, just like France. The export of wines into Germany is still in its infancy with only exported one million litres to Germany, but we are improving there as well. We might be exporting coals to Newcastle, but we are doing very well in that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only a few weeks ago, I was in the Young, Cowra and Wagga districts talking with winegrowers. At the Charles Sturt University winery, I was told&mdash;and it was confirmed by local winemaker Ken Helm&mdash;that Australia is a world leader in wine technology. Indeed, staff from the Charles Sturt University are in Portugal teaching the Portuguese how to process their grapes. I have a personal reservation about exporting our expertise and technology, but that is another issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are ahead of the areas that Senator Calvert recently studied in that in Australia we have a completely automated industry. Harvesting of the grape is done very quickly by commercial harvesters. The grape is put into bins very quickly and crushed so there is no fermentation at the bottom of the baskets, which happens in France. We are leading the world in quality. I take my hat off to the Australian industry for doing that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only trouble is that we are exporting that technology. It will not be easy for winemakers in Europe to change because they have small vineyards and they do not have such long runs for their harvesters, and that sort of thing. Exporting our winemaking ability will obviously create a bit more competition for us, but I suppose that if we did not export it, somebody else would work out what was happening, anyway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry is essentially in two or three parts. We have the big and medium wineries and myriad smaller wineries, which I call the petite boutique wineries. They are the ones that add to tourism. They produce special quality wines. They might not even do the crushing in their own winery, but they do the growing of the grapes and they make a big contribution to the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The big four players in the export drive will be responsible for some $1 billion worth of exports by the year 2000, which Senator Woodley alluded to just a moment ago. The 600 small wineries might produce only 10 per cent of the Australian wine production, but they play an important part in the industry, and also in the tourist industry. Last year, wineries were voted one of the most visited tourist places in Australia. It is interesting that at the trade export awards, which I attended last week as the guest of Senator Cook, Orlando, selling its Jacobs Creek wines, received the award for the top exporter from Australia. I take my hat off to Orlando because it has done a fantastic job competing in the European market with other wines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal government recently demonstrated its total lack of understanding of the industry with the proposed imposition of a 55 per cent increase in wine tax. Why the hell it was trying to do that&mdash;kill the goose that lays the golden egg, or crush the grape that produces the enjoyment, pleasure and export income for Australia&mdash;I would not know, but it tried to do it. That would have hurt the industry a great deal. Why this government tries to tax people who start to make money for Australia, heaven knows, but it tried to do it. Of course, that failed&mdash;and the government failed to appreciate the unique structure of this industry which, as I have explained, is divided into two or three distinct categories. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The smaller wineries will play no part in Australia's export drive, but the success of Australia on the export scene has quite significant implications for them as well. If we do not keep up our export sales, the wine produced by the big companies will flow back onto the domestic market. This will adversely affect prices, and smaller and boutique wineries will be forced to close. I do not think we all realise the problems associated with this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This wonderful country of ours is almost unique in its diversity of grape growing regions. From Queensland, which Senator Woodley mentioned earlier, through to Tasmania, where my colleague Senator Calvert comes from&mdash;and he is a connoisseur and a great supporter of the wine industry in Tasmania&mdash;on the east coast, and right across Australia to the west coast, Australia produces an enormously diverse range of quality wines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that the slopes of the Canobolas, in the central west of New South Wales, and Cowra, Young and those areas, will be the top areas of winegrowing in the future.

The French have realised our potential and have now invested in our industry. That is exactly what I would say Senator Calvert will talk about in his speech tonight, as well as how we have invested in the wine industry in France. It has long ceased to be a small industry&mdash;when we talk about the $1 billion export drive, it is an important export earner. In 1992-93 we exported almost $300 million worth, with almost half going to the EC countries.

I believe the wine industry in Australia is dynamic. It is conscious of developing a quality product and it is aggressive in its marketing, both here and overseas. Whether our wines are labelled bordeaux, chardonnay, champagne or Australian white will matter little; it is the drinking of it and the enjoyment of it that will count. It is what is in the bottle that matters. Increasingly, the world is learning that with our wine, as with our beef, Australia means a quality product anywhere it is sold in the world. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Because of the haste with which the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Amendment Bill was brought on, I had not prepared myself to make a speech of any length, and I will not. But because of the invitations given to me, by Senator Brownhill in particular, I thought it may be advisable to say at least a few words about my experiences recently in France.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I took the opportunity to visit two Australian winemakers who are pioneering our technology in France, each for entirely different reasons. James Herrick and his company, Global Vineyards, sponsored by Robert Hesketh in South Australia, are using Australian technology to make wine in the southern part of France to export, particularly into the UK. They are concentrating on white wines&mdash;chardonnays&mdash;and they are doing a great job at the moment using Australian technology. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bill Hardy, Sir James's brother, is using the French grapes available in the Languedoc-Roussillon area to produce red wines&mdash;merlots, cabernets and blends&mdash;and also white wines, and is exporting into the English market, or so he thought at the time. Because of the quality of the wines his company is making and the contacts they have here in Australia, they are finding&mdash;in the initial stages, anyway&mdash;that a fair amount of their wine is coming back to Australia. Both wine producers are having a very significant impact on the wine scene in France. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill we are debating tonight seeks to rationalise the naming of wines. As Senator Brownhill said, it does not really matter what you call it; it is the quality and the effect that it has on the market that counts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">James Herrick and Bill Hardy have placed advertisements in the local French press. One that comes to mind is, `Try French chardonnay made the Australian way'. That is the kind of impact these two Australian winemakers are having on the winemaking industry in France. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The southern part of France, the `Doc' area as it is called, is not looked upon as one of the best wine producing areas in France, probably because the winemaking abilities of the people have not moved with the times. It is a very old area. In fact, the place in which we were staying, owned by a Tasmanian friend of mine, was a 16th century house with an 11th century barn. I think that is typical of the area. Things have not changed much&mdash;the wine technology certainly has not&mdash;and the advent of Australians with their technology has had an effect. I must admit that all the stainless steel tanks, the filters and most of the machinery that is being used in the wineries is all of French and Italian origin; nevertheless, the techniques are Australian. I foresee, given the changes that will come to pass with the GATT agreements, somewhat of a change in winemaking in southern France. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Scorn has been poured upon `Doc' wines, not because of the quality of the grapes but because of the quality of the winemaking. Bill Hardy has used local grapes to produce top quality wines that have won prizes right across France.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">James Herrick is producing chardonnay wines. One can drive past stunted vineyards that have existed for hundreds of years and then suddenly come across a vineyard with trellises and grapes being grown the Australian way. One knows that one is looking at an Australian vineyard. Unfortunately, the restrictions placed on these Australian winemakers by French authorities limit the amount of grapes grown per hectare. I see this as a problem because up until now the French have not wanted to see efficiencies in the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was very interested to hear Senator Woodley's comments about the wine industry. He mentioned Stanthorpe. I have a very good friend in Stanthorpe who was involved in the apple industry, not the wine industry. It is interesting that wine is being produced from as far north as Darwin in Senator Tambling's area, to Alice Springs and south of where I am in Tasmania. In fact, just the other night I was watching a program which showed wines being produced at Lake Barrington, which, as Senator Sherry would know, is our world-class rowing area. Wines are being produced even in very cold areas such as Mt Roland and Mt Barrington. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is fair to say that all types of wines are being produced in Australia. But at the present time, not enough is being produced. The other day I attended a wine show in Canberra. Representatives of the wine industry told me that they were importing wine juice from Tasmania. Who would have thought five or 10 years ago that manufacturers such as Penfolds would be importing wine juice from Tasmania? I think that shows how big our industry is growing and how desperate the industry is for grapes. If there is going to be any problem for the wine industry, it will be the supply of raw materials to satisfy the world demand for Australian wines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most popular wine in the UK is Jacobs Creek, which sells for about #8 a bottle. Tonight we were talking about Orlando wines. The French are very quick off the mark. They realise the potential of the wine industry in Australia and it is no surprise that Pernod Richard has purchased the Orlando and Wyndham vineyards in Australia. It is no surprise that Moet et Chandon has established one of the largest sparkling wine vineyards in Tasmania because of that state's cool climate. And it is no surprise that sparkling white produced in Tasmania has won international acclaim. That is what we are talking about tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was surprised at one remark made by Senator Woodley during his contribution to this debate. The wine industry is a small industry in Tasmania and, I presume, that is also the case in Queensland. After hearing the Democrats' contribution today to the debate on the industrial relations legislation, I wonder what Senator Woodley is going to say to his winegrowers about the way his party will vote. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without getting too flustered, I must say that Australian technology is leading the world. We have all heard about good vintages and bad vintages. The point is that, by using Australian technology&mdash;cooling the juice before it is fermented, cutting down the risks by being hygienic, using modern techniques with stainless steel and whatever&mdash;we never really get a bad vintage. We might get bad grapes, but we can always produce a good wine. That is why Australia is in the forefront. I take my hat off to our winegrowing industry for its wonderful innovation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to see that we have moved in the direction we have for international reasons. France has decided that its famous names, such as champagne and whatever, cannot be used. I do not think it matters a fig what a wine is called. It is in the drinking that counts. Australia can hold its head high in the world because of the wine we are producing. As Senator Woodley has pointed out, we will be exporting $1 billion worth of wine by the year 2000&mdash;this will occur as long as the government does not overtax the industry. Australian technology is making a marvellous contribution to the world. I fully support my colleagues who have spoken on this bill tonight. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Surprisingly enough, perhaps for the first time ever, I also agree with something Senator Woodley has said&mdash;and that, of course, is the very fulsome praise he gave to the Queensland wine industry. It is only a very young industry by wine industry standards, but it is certainly growing, carving a niche for itself in the market and will become an even better wine producing area as it goes ahead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If that was all I intended to say, I might as well not have wasted the time of the Senate in rising to speak.

Then it occurred to me&mdash;the absolute hypocrisy yet again of the arguments of the Australian Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was not too long ago that in this chamber we spent a long time debating the sales tax on wine. Initially, the Democrats&mdash;and I suspect it was more because the state election was coming up in South Australia and they needed a few votes, and they needed them fairly desperately, as I understand, from the way the polls are going at the moment in South Australia&mdash;took this position&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YW4">Senator IAN MACDONALD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I take Senator O'Chee's interjection. We had the Democrats posturing on how they would save the Australian wine industry; they would oppose this increase to the tax on the wine industry from 20 per cent to 30 and 31 per cent. So it looked like we could defeat this iniquitous tax of the Labor Party, the big taxing party. For once we would win in the Senate. We, the majority party in the Senate, would join together with the minor parties and, with their help, would stop that very regressive and damaging tax on one of Australia's most progressive industries. So things were looking good.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what happened? We went through the same scene that we have seen so often in this chamber where the Democrats and the Labor Party get together in a huddle. Why they do not sit together to save the carpet from all the government's walking back and forth when proposing different things to them, I do not know. But we had the government and the Democrats getting together with this new deal coming out&mdash;or supposedly it was a new deal. I suspect that the parts of this bill that are favourable to the industry were always intended to be enacted by the Labor Party in any case. But, for some reason, the Democrats rolled over yet again&mdash;yet again. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Murphy says that the industry agreed. He knows that as well as I do&mdash;I have given up on those on the other side&mdash;but what disturbs me more is that the Democrats also knew that the government was holding the wine industry to ransom. It had a gun at the head of the wine industry and the Democrats knew it. Mr Keating and Mr Dawkins, the great bullyboys of politics, knew that; they knew that the wine industry could not put up with the uncertainty. We got the same sort of calls that everyone else got: the wine industry merchants saying to us, `For goodness sake, get some certainty into this because this tax and the uncertainty over it are causing an enormous problem to our sales and our immediate revenue'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But we had promised those in the industry all along that we would not agree to that tax because it was detrimental to that very progressive industry&mdash;and the Democrats had initially agreed with us. Then the deals were done and the Democrats again rolled over. We did not get the 31 per cent but we got a 26 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All that is now past history. But it disturbs me greatly to sit in this chamber or in my office watching the monitor and hear the sanctimonious claptrap and humbug from the Australian Democrats promoting the wine industry and pretending they are the saviours of yet another rural industry. As my colleague Senator Calvert said, how can the Australian Democrats pretend that they are the farmer's friend and the wine industry's friend when not only did they agree to that sales tax, which will have long-term repercussions on the wine industry but also, as Senator Calvert says, today they will cave in on industrial relations. See what that does to small business. See the enormous effect that will have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If that is not bad enough, the Democrats then want to put on a jobs levy. Great, sounds beaut, a jobs levy! But who pays the jobs levy? It is little business, small business, businesses like the winegrowers of Stanthorpe. I hope, when Senator Woodley sends out his speech to the winegrowers of Stanthorpe, he will also send out mine, which will remind them of the enormous impact that his party's policies are having on them when they have to pay more for a jobs levy. That is what the Democrats want to put on the winegrowers of Stanthorpe, the winegrowers of Roma and the winegrowers of Warwick. Wherever there are winegrowers in Queensland, they will have to pay the jobs levy. Those winegrowers are now paying the increased sales tax on fuel, which I think Senator Woodley's party not only agreed to but also criticised as being too small; they wanted it to be more than that. </PARA>

I want to respond to an issue that was raised by Senator Lees concerning the Geographical Indications Committee and the process that that committee will follow when determining the boundaries for names. She raised some concerns on this issue. The provisions within the legislation provide for the committee to publish some interim determinations on the boundaries issue. There will then be 28 days for people who do not agree with the determinations to complain to the committee. The committee will further consider the complaints, if there are any, and then publish its final determination.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to thank the rest of the members of the opposition, with the exception of Senator Ian Macdonald, for their contribution to the debate. While their speeches did range far and wide they were generally relevant to the future of the wine industry. It was good to hear their contributions. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Calvert informed us about his experiences in the French wine industry and the contribution that the Australian industry is making to that industry. He quite rightly drew our attention to the fact that whilst we are leading the world in many areas of technology in the wine industry, we have to pay  significant regard to the competition that we face from such countries as South Africa, New Zealand and Chile. We need to ensure that we keep that competitive edge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Calvert touched on a critical issue, not just in wine industry policy but in agricultural policy in general, when he quite rightly criticised not only the attitude of the French and the way in which they operate and control their wine industry. He quite aptly drew the Senate's attention to the fact that the winery he visited was centred in a 16th century house and a 11th century barn. That typifies the French agricultural industry and all it represents. If the French cannot modernise and adapt to modern techniques, they are about adopting high tariff walls to keep the rest of the world out, and in particular Australian producers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation, as other senators have indicated, is  significant because it indicates the maturity of the Australian wine industry. It will be able to stand on its own two feet. It will be able to enter into Europe under its own name brands, which will be a very significant advance, with a minimum of bureaucratic restraint by the Europeans, and particularly the French. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of dates are contained in this legislation. By 31 December this year the bill provides for the phasing out of some names such as beaujolais, cava, frascati, sancerre, St Emilion and a number of others. By 31 December 1997 it provides for the phasing out of chianti, hock, madeira and malaga. If I may make a correction to a comment that I think Senator Brownhill made, there are no agreed dates to this point in time for the phasing out of the use of a number of other names such as burgundy, chablis, and champagne. We do not have agreed dates on the phase-out of those particular names. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In concluding the debate, I thank the opposition, the Democrats and, I assume, the Greens for their support.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill 1993 makes housekeeping amendments to 13 acts within the primary industries and energy portfolio. The first relates to the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Act 1988. The National Registration Authority will be required to release a summary of its evaluation of a chemical product before making a determination to allow public involvement. The authority will be able to conduct public and private hearings to obtain comment on chemical products and will be required to publicise those hearings in daily newspapers throughout Australia. Such a move is important to rural Australia, particularly in light of the access our overseas competitors have to newer types of chemicals.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The authority can also seek the advice of particular organisations or persons by releasing confidential commercial information to assist in its evaluation of applications. Precautions will be taken to safeguard trade secrets and information subject to possible commercial exploitation. The authority's directors and staff are exempt from being sued for refusal to grant a clearance of a chemical product and the amendments will extend this exemption to the authority itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next part of the legislation relates to the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals (Administration) Act 1992. These amendments allow the authority to progressively determine conditions of service for staff transferred from the Public Service. Other initiatives include removing the age limit of 65 and introducing a more efficient system of issuing receipts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to amendments to the Australian Horticultural Corporation Act 1987 and the Horticultural Research and Development Corporation Act 1987. The federal government wants to incorporate ecologically sustainable development principles and priorities into government decision making and administration. Such objectives mean that expertise in ecosystems management and conservation as well as economic and social factors will be essential when selecting people for research and development corporation boards. The boards will be required to consider ESD principles when determining priorities for allocation of funds. Annual reports will detail ESD related research as well as report on progress in achieving corporation objectives. Again, the maximum age for board members is removed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similar amendments are to be incorporated in the Australian Meat and Live-stock Industry Selection Committee Act 1984, the Horticultural Research and Development Corporation Act 1987, the Meat Research Corporation Act 1985 and the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Dairy Produce Act 1986 will also be amended. The major amendments remove uncertainty about the arrangements under which manufacturers of exported dairy products receive market support payments financed by a milk levy, that is, a levy raised by the industry on its own people on the production of all milk. This market support scheme, administered by the Australian Dairy Corporation on behalf of the Commonwealth, assists exporters to compete in world markets, some of which are highly corrupted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to note that this is not a protection scheme. There are no tariffs on dairy exports coming into Australia and there is no anti-dumping protection from New Zealand product. Under the guidelines for the payment of money from the fund, exporters must deduct the amount they import of a like product from what they export. They are then supported on the net export amount. This is to prevent dairy companies receiving market support payments on export product which would otherwise be sold on the domestic market and then importing the same type of product for domestic sale. If this arrangement is not enforceable, the Australian Dairy Corporation will be required to make back payments on the gap between net and total exports. In recent years this would have reduced the effectiveness of the scheme by some $2 million a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The scheme has operated since 1987 and every year since then the Australian Dairy Corporation has sent forms to all manufacturers seeking the amount of product exported and the amount imported. The market support payment has then been paid on the balance. Normally, the Dairy Corporation would have paid out on the 1991-92 year in August of this year, but has not done so because of uncertainty about the 1986 legislation. This amendment removes the uncertainty and allows the corporation to apply the arrangement from 1991-92 and 1992-93 until the scheme ceases in 1999. The Australian Dairy Industry Council, the policy body which represents dairy farmers and manufacturers, and the Australian Dairy Products Federation, which represents manufacturers, both support these changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the Fisheries Legislation (Consequential Provisions) Act 1991. When the 1991 fisheries legislation was passed, it was anticipated that arrangements with the states and the Northern Territory on the offshore constitutional settlement would be completed by 3 February 1994. The timetable has been delayed, so a further 12 months will be granted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Fisheries Management Act 1991 is to be amended to reflect the original intention that seasonal and other closures may be authorised under a management plan. Basically, the amendments allow greater flexibility and will permit a fisherman to hold a number of statutory fishing rights as a discrete package of rights authorising a particular fishing activity. An example might be a combination of quotas to take various species of fish or specified combinations of fishing gear or boat characteristics, such as size of engines and characteristics of nets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989 and the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Act 1991 will be amended in a way consequential to the establishment of the Forest and Wood Products Research and Development Corporation. They reflect a changed funding arrangement, with the Commonwealth providing $1 for every $2 spent by industry, rather than dollar for dollar with the other rural industries. This is because half of the forest and wood industry is deemed to be a manufacturing industry rather than a primary industry. The amendments propose that moneys raised from charges under the Forest Industry Research Import Charge Act 1993 be directed to research and development relevant to the timber importing industry. Amendments to the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Act 1991 will allow for the collection of the levies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, amendments to the Wheat Marketing Act 1989 will correct an anomaly in the act. The aim is to provide the constitutional power for the states to allow the Wheat Board to conduct intrastate trade in grain and grain products. While the states have passed legislation to allow the Wheat Board to trade intrastate in grain and grain products, there is doubt as to whether Commonwealth legislation gives this power for grains other than wheat. In order to validate the board's operations, these amendments will operate retrospectively. Other amendments will allow the board more flexibility in pool return payments to allow adjustments for variety, quality, transport, storage and handling costs, et cetera, to ensure that growers within the pool are treated fairly. The federal coalition will not stand in the way of these amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I note that it is almost 20 past 10 and that the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill proceeded to the second reading stage after 10 o'clock this evening. That is frequently the case with primary industry legislation. We on this side of the chamber have become used to that sort of thing. It is quite a shame that the decisions that were made by both parties in relation to this bill were made some months ago and that the bill has been held up and seems to have been considered unimportant.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that the government understands that we are not opposing the bill, but I think that, perhaps in the scheduling of the legislation for consideration by this Senate chamber, we should not, as a matter of routine, get into the habit of scheduling primary industry legislation for the end of the session in the belief that nobody cares about it. Primary industry legislation is very important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These amendments are not just inconsequential amendments to the people who are affected by them. They are important amendments. In a number of cases&mdash;I wish to discuss some of those cases&mdash;they cause a certain degree of heartache. It is not satisfactory for this parliament to say, `Because it is primary industry legislation, we will slot it in at the end of the session. It doesn't matter when it gets passed; it doesn't matter when it takes effect'. These matters have to be dealt with more expeditiously. The Senate ought to have that in mind when it looks at the legislative program during the next session.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Tambling has very adequately laid out on behalf of the coalition&mdash;both the National Party and the Liberal Party&mdash;our attitude to each of the amendments to the legislation. I support Senator Tambling in saying that we will not oppose them. I wish to address three principal matters. The first relates to the amendments made in relation to the market support payments for the export of dairy produce. The coalition supports those amendments. This caused a lot of heartache in my area of North Queensland. I want to make a few comments so that people understand the basis on which the coalition is making this decision to support this part of the bill, lest there be any misunderstanding. I make these comments as somebody who worked almost non-stop for two days on the particular concerns of the Atherton Tableland Cooperative Dairy Corporation. The amendments in relation to the market support payments, which are funded out of the all milk levy, were aimed principally at that dairy cooperative. I do not want anybody to think that the coalition disregarded the concerns of the people at Malanda, because that is certainly not the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem with the market support payment arose because the legislation was defective in the first place. The legislation had a hole in it. The dairy cooperative in question took the view that it would utilise those provisions to claim all of the market support payment for the gross amount that it exported, not the net amount when account is taken of the countervailing imports. As a result, it has been in dispute in relation to the amount of market support payment to which it is entitled. This bill deals with that and eliminates the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the legislation had been dealt with in the proper fashion in the first place, it would not have been necessary to make this amendment. The amendment was made several years after the defect in the legislation became apparent. At the time it was dealt with by means of a number of guidelines that were issued annually. The then minister for primary industries should have had the legislation rectified at that point. That would have eliminated any possibility of people getting false expectations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The basis on which those of us in the coalition support this bill&mdash;we are unanimously supporting this; every single member of the National and Liberal parties is supporting it&mdash;is that at the end of the day the Australian dairy industry said to us that this bill had to pass. I remember distinctly discussing it on the telephone with Mr Pat Rowley, the head of the dairy industry in this country. He said, `Irrespective of the concerns that individuals may have, we do have to get this rectified and the dairy industry as a whole is of the view that this amendment should be allowed to pass, notwithstanding the fact that there made be particular local concerns'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I look at my responsibilities as a senator&mdash;one who lives in Cairns and who is very close to the producers who make up the Atherton Tableland Cooperative Dairy Corporation&mdash;it is incumbent on me to look at the big picture; to look at my responsibilities to the local producers but also to recognise that I have responsibilities to every other dairy farmer in the state of Queensland and every other dairy cooperative, and there are many others. I think that those obligations, particularly in view of the comments that have been made by the head of the dairy industry in Australia&mdash;who is a Queenslander&mdash;force me to support this amendment contained in this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the support for that amendment is unanimous in the coalition. I wanted to make that particular comment in relation to that amendment, lest anybody thought there was any division in the coalition or lest anybody misconstrued the basis upon which we support the amendment. We believe that in primary industry matters it is best if the industry can work as a whole, move as a whole and speak as a whole. That has been the great strength of Australian primary industries over a long period&mdash;that primary industry generally and primary producers individually have recognised the need at times to accommodate the rest of the industry so that we as a whole in Australia can work together to maximise our opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, these amendments have caused a certain degree of heartache. At the end of the day, the particular primary producers in question on the Atherton Tableland will become even better exporters than they are at the moment. They will overcome any particular problems that may arise from this bill. They have already made substantial headway in terms of exporting to markets in South-East Asia and I am sure they will continue to do that. That is the basis upon which the coalition supports the measure. As I said, our support is unanimous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I move to two other amendments that are made in this bill. The first is the consequential amendments to the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Act to permit the collection of charges which follow changes made by this parliament earlier to the forest industry research levy. As I said before, it is important that we have a degree of research into the forest industries in this country so that we can maximise the opportunities for a sustainable resource. One of the concerns that I have is that, when we get this sort of legislation and these consequential amendments are held up for long periods, it raises doubts about the government's commitment to following it through. There is always a concern on the part of those who are affected that until all of the legislation gets through they really cannot count on anything. Everybody in the chamber would have to recognise that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we get amendments like this which are designed to support other changes in government policy that have been made, the amendments should be made expeditiously. The enabling legislation should not be delayed. Whilst we in this parliament say, `We passed legislation to give effect to this forest industry research levy', out there in the community where the people are affected they say, `Until the legislation gets through, it doesn't matter whether you have made the in-principle decision; unless the mechanics are in place, we cannot take benefit from it'. We have to improve our act in that respect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I support the changes that we are making to the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Act. One of the difficulties for Australian primary industry is that chemicals have been very expensive in this country and remain very expensive compared to our neighbours overseas. Nothing in this bill will change the cost of chemicals. It will improve access to chemicals and it will therefore assist in the development of better agricultural practices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Too many times we have heard primary industry saying, `We can do a better job, but we need to have access to the latest technology'&mdash;not that I am saying that primary industry is not doing a good job at the moment. Perhaps 20 or 30 years ago the attitude of some primary producers was different. It was, `Look, we will continue going in the fashion in which we have gone before'. Now the attitude of primary producers is very simple: `We want to be on the cutting edge of technology and on the cutting edge of changes in agriculture so that we can get a better return for ourselves and for the country'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I was saying, primary industry wants to be on the cutting edge of technology. It wants to be able to improve yields as much as possible, and that requires the ability to source chemicals as soon as they are available, or as soon as practical after they are available&mdash;after they have been tested and examined. This will make that possible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the government has to address the main problem, which is why chemicals are so expensive in this country compared with the cost of chemicals in other countries. When we consider the cost of a drum of `Round Up' or any of the other commonly used chemicals in Australia, Australian primary producers have the raw end of the deal because they are being asked to pay so much more. They do not get the subsidies that apply in other countries. As a consequence, primary producers are faced with two options: either they have to fork out large amounts of money for chemicals and therefore suffer a disadvantage in terms of the cost of production, or they have to be willing to forgo those chemicals and suffer lower yields, and I do not think that is satisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We support this measure, but the government should be placed on notice that there is much more that needs to be done.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">The Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill 1993 is an omnibus bill amending a total of something like 13 different acts. I wish to make a few comments on the amendments relating to the Australian Horticultural Corporation Act 1987, the Dairy Produce Act 1986, and the Wheat Marketing Act 1989. Other sections of this bill, in our opinion, are not contentious, and I will not comment on these sections.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill proposes to amend the Australian Horticultural Corporation Act 1987 to remove the 65-year age limit on both the managing director and members of the corporation, as well as on members of the corporation selection committee. It has been part of the Australian Democrats employment policy for many years to remove any age discrimination and to ensure against the compulsory retirement of persons because of their age. As such, the Democrats support this amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first amendment to the Dairy Produce Act 1986 is non-contentious in that it simply provides the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) with the power to release funds from the dairy industry fund to be used to cover the cost of hosting the International Dairy Federation's world congress in Australia next year. I am informed that there has been an agreement between the government and the industry for some time now that this money would be made available and, indeed, it is expected that the money released from the fund will be recouped from income gained through the congress. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A second amendment to the Dairy Produce Act seeks to clarify the legislative framework under which the import offset arrangement of the Australian Dairy Corporation operates. At present, the ADC provides market support payments to manufacturers of exported dairy products. These payments are financed by a levy on all milk production and are designed to make returns to Australian manufacturers from exporting somewhat greater in the face of large government subsidies by other countries. This has the dual benefit of increasing our exports and reducing the amount of dairy product that is available on our domestic market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As honourable senators will be aware, since 1987 the corporation has operated an import offset arrangement to ensure that these market support payments are reduced when a firm imports and exports the same type of product. This arrangement is designed to prevent companies from receiving a market support payment on an exported product, then importing the same product for sale on the domestic market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the recent past there has been some dispute over the operation of this arrangement, and there have been some allegations of abuse of the scheme. This bill seeks to close off that possibility by ensuring that market support payments are reduced by the amount payable on dairy produce of the same kind which has been imported by the manufacturer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of the uncertainty surrounding payments to be made under the offset scheme, the ADC has not sought offset payments since 1991-92 until there is some clarification of the legislation. These amendments provide that clarification and will allow the ADC to apply the arrangements to payments going back to 1 July 1991. There is a certain retrospective aspect to the amendment. However, I think we all accept that this situation needs to be addressed&mdash;at least I believe that that is what Senator O'Chee was saying&mdash;and that these amendments are the best way to achieve this. The Democrats therefore support the amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, amendments to the Wheat Marketing Act are also non-contentious. As the minister said in his second reading speech, firstly, they will ensure the constitutional power of the states to confer functions and powers on the Australian Wheat Board to allow it to conduct intrastate trade in grain and grain products. Secondly, they will allow the AWB to conduct research into grain and grain products. We certainly support further research in the primary industry area and would want to see further funds allocated for this purpose in the next budget. Thirdly, they will allow the chairperson or the managing director to delegate their powers to an employee of the AWB. Therefore, these amendments are supported by the Democrats. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight we are debating the government's attempt to impose an administration fee on the diesel fuel rebate scheme through this package of customs and excise bills. Under this scheme, off-road users of diesel fuel, such as miners, primary producers, hospitals, and nursing homes in some cases, receive a full or partial rebate of the excise they pay on diesel fuel because diesel fuel excise is supposed to be collected specifically for the purpose of road funding and maintenance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has long been recognised that, for example, nursing homes using diesel fuel for heating should not have to contribute to road funding and maintenance; and farmers using diesel fuel in farm machinery which never travels on our roads should not have to contribute to road funding and maintenance. Therefore, they can claim a rebate for some or all of the excise they pay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have outlined several times in this chamber, it has now been established during the Senate estimates process that this administration fee is not a true user pays fee which reflects only the administrative costs of the diesel fuel rebate scheme. Instead, it is a tax which has been introduced into this chamber in two bills: the Diesel Fuel (Excise Duty Rebate) Administration Charge Bill 1993 and the Diesel Fuel (Customs Duty Rebate) Administration Charge Bill 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This tax will equal one per cent of the total amount rebated to miners, farmers, hospitals and other off-road users. In 1993-94, the total amount to be rebated is estimated to be about $1 billion. Therefore, this new tax will equal about $10 million a year in income to the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These rebates are paid mainly to the mining industry and the primary industries sector; 54 per cent of total rebates paid go to the mining sector and 44 per cent go to the rural sector. By introducing a tax of one per cent, the government will effectively be reducing the rebate to miners and farmers by one per cent. For instance, farmers who are entitled to a full 100 per cent rebate will effectively only get 99 per cent of it. This is a sneaky, back-door way of reducing the rebate. It is something that the government well knows that the rural and mining sectors are completely opposed to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Diesel fuel excise is collected to contribute to road maintenance. People in businesses which use diesel fuel for off-road purposes such as running farm machinery, mining equipment and heaters in hospitals should not have to pay the excise or contribute to road maintenance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, this is not the only reason the tax should be rejected. Just as importantly, it is completely wrong to set a precedent where people pay a tax to get a rebate. Imagine what would happen if people were charged a one per cent tax on their personal income tax rebates. First they pay thousands of dollars a year in income tax and at the end of the financial year, if they work out that they have paid too much income tax, the tax office owes them a refund, but the tax office says, `If you want to get your refund, you have to pay another tax to get it back.'. Quite frankly, I cannot imagine that the tax office is too enamoured of the concept of people paying taxes to get their rebates. Imagine how popular it would be if it started charging taxes on all the other refunds that it hands back to people. In fact, I have heard along the grapevine that the tax office is opposed to this one per cent tax on the diesel fuel rebate scheme for precisely the reasons I have outlined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the introduction of this tax would take the user pays principle too far. If the government owes a person or a business a refund because too much tax has been paid in the first place, a further tax should not under any circumstances be deducted from that refund. It is not the fault of the miners, the farmers, the nursing homes and the hospitals that they have to pay the diesel fuel excise when they buy their diesel. It is not by choice that these people pay too much for diesel and then have to seek a refund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Surely it is manifestly evident that they are only claiming a rebate of moneys they should not have paid to the government in the first place. Speaking on behalf of primary producers who are entitled to a 100 per cent rebate, I am sure they would all prefer to return to the system where they quoted their exemption certificate number and simply did not pay the excise in the first place. After all, this is a system that currently applies to sales tax. If it is good enough for sales tax, I am not sure why it is not good enough for diesel excise. Then the inland revenue division of customs would have far less work to do because farmers who make 44 per cent of all the claims for diesel fuel rebates would not have to make claims any more. I guess that there are people in customs who would not want to be talking themselves out of jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other strong argument against this tax is that the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins), through Senator McMullan, admitted on 30 September, in an answer to my question without notice, that the amount of tax paid will be deductible for income tax purposes to the extent that the tax is paid on diesel fuel used for producing assessable income. In other words, primary producers can claim a tax deduction for this one per cent tax. If we were just looking at farmers and primary producers who claim 44 per cent of the refund, even if only half of them pay tax&mdash;and in today's climate it is quite possible that only half of them do&mdash;and can claim a deduction, this would amount to a collective tax deduction of some $2.2 million. That is not counting the deductions claimed by mining companies, nursing homes, private hospitals and other users of off-road diesel. It does not make sense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Does the government really want the Australian Customs Service to go to all the trouble of collecting the $10 million in tax on diesel fuel rebates off road users, only for a significant proportion of it to be claimed as a legitimate tax deduction? How much paperwork, time and extra effort is wasted on this?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree with Senator Boswell that it is only the thin edge of the wedge, but it is the start and it is the principle that counts. How much paperwork and time and effort would be wasted on administering this rebate? I wonder whether the tax office thinks it is worth it. I do not think that it would be too happy with the idea nor do I think the Australian taxpayers would be too happy with the idea.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After all, we are not talking about a true user-pays charge. Despite what has been said&mdash;and will be said&mdash;in the Senate estimates process, this tax is not a user-pays charge or fee or any other name the government uses to avoid using the word tax. If it were a user-pays charge, as the government claims, it would not have to be introduced as a tax. It is as simple as that. If the government thought it could get away with introducing this as a charge or fee, it would. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Boswell" NAMEID="YE4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YE4">Senator Boswell</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It tried that.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EP5">Senator FERGUSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It tried that and it was found out. I am sure that is what the government tried to do. Perhaps unluckily for the government the Australian Customs Service realised that this one per cent fee is a tax. As everybody knows, the real difference between a tax and a fee is that an administration fee recovers actual administration costs, whereas a tax does not have to bear any relationship to those administration costs, either because the tax is more than the cost or because it is set as a percentage and cannot move to reflect the actual cost.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As honourable senators may be aware, right from the beginning, when I read about this so-called administration fee in the 1993-94 budget papers, I suspected that it did not relate to the actual costs of administration and therefore it was unconstitutional. I asked questions in the estimates committee hearings on 26 August, 2 September and 4 November on this basis. I also asked two questions without notice on this issue, on 31 August and 29 September. All of these questions were designed not only to ascertain whether this fee was really a tax, but also to discover when exactly it was decided to introduce this tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During all the questioning that took place on this issue, including when Estimates Committee E was especially reopened on 2 September so Senator Schacht could correct some answers he had given at the initial hearing on 31 August, the government tried to justify charging a $10 million administration fee. It is funny how the government can reopen an estimates committee when it wants to, when one of its ministers gives some incorrect information to the committee that he wants to correct, but when the opposition wants that same committee reopened to examine an issue like sports rorts, that is not possible. I digress. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This administration fee, which Senator Schacht repeatedly argued was a true user-pays fee, included one-off and establishment items like plant and equipment, furniture and fittings, personal computers and uniforms. Even if these items could be included in the first year, once they have been paid for by the users of this diesel fuel, what happens the second year the tax is charged? I noticed there was no suggestion from the government that the fee be reduced in the second year. Presumably, then, the miners and farmers keep paying customs for these one-off costs, which is a very nice little windfall for the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also note with some astonishment that performance based pay is included as one of the administration costs of the rebate scheme. Being an ex-farmer, I think every Australian farmer would be absolutely horrified&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will debate that with Senator Burns at a later stage. Every Australian farmer would be sickened to think that public servants earning more than $43,000 a year not only get several thousand dollars a year in performance based pay but that farmers have to cover this cost through their one per cent tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If anyone deserves performance based pay it is our farmers and miners. In particular, I refer to some farmers who work incredibly long hours in very trying conditions for very little or no reward. How can the government justify to these farmers earning negative incomes and who are struggling to pay for food and clothes for their children that they should pay the performance based bonuses of staff in the Australian Customs Service?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How moral is that? Personally, I would like to send someone from Customs out to the Eyre Peninsula or to far west Queensland&mdash;which Senator Burns ought to know something about&mdash;or to Western Australia where my colleagues Senator Panizza and Senator Crane come from, or any area affected by drought, and explain to farmers who are just about to lose their farms why farmers have to pay for performance based bonuses for Customs officers who would earn what would seem like an absolute fortune to farming families. I would be very interested to hear what the Democrats and the Green senators have to say. I would also like to hear what some Labor senators might have to say about this because there is no social justice in some of Australia's poorest families having to pay a user-pays fee which goes towards performance based pay for highly paid bureaucrats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Mr Prosser, one of my colleagues in the other house, pointed out, the government does not have a mandate to introduce this tax. It was not mentioned in the One Nation statement and the Treasurer did not mention it in his budget speech. The only mention came in the budget papers which obliquely referred to an administration fee as such. No mention was made that it was not related to the actual cost of administering the scheme. There was no mention that, because of this, it will have to be introduced as a tax. There was no mention that this could be the thin end of the wedge providing an easy means whereby the rebate can gradually be eroded to nothing or the percentage increased. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In one breath the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is saying that we will help business and we must improve exports while, on the other hand, he wants to collect more tax from those sectors which cannot afford it. I would like the Prime Minister or the Treasurer to explain how charging a tax on the diesel excise rebate will help farmers or miners or any other businesses to become more competitive. Of course, it cannot explain it because taxes are a cost not a boost to business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My guess is that the government thought it could sneak this one through without much protest and without much media attention because after all it is only the miners and farmers and very few others who are getting upset about it. They are upset about it, and I have 2,000 signatures from South Australia to prove it. I also have a letter from the South East Local Government Association which relates to the diesel fuel rebate tax. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your recent media release dated 25 November, concerning diesel fuel rebate tax which proved to be the subject of considerable discussion at a recent meeting of the South East Local Government Association.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The meeting wholeheartedly supported your opposition to the proposal which is considered to be a further unfair impost on those that currently cannot afford such a tax, particularly in the rural areas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would therefore be pleased if you would lodge the strongest possible objection to the proposal in the Senate, on behalf of Local Government Authorities and the Communities that they represent in this region.</PARA>
<PARA>In closing, I welcome the decision of the Democrats; I understand that the Democrats will be supporting our decision to oppose this tax. It is the only logical decision they could have arrived at. To support this tax is to harm our rural and mining sectors and give the government a mandate to deduct taxes from rebates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would certainly welcome the attendance of the Democrats at estimates committee hearings such as this where a lot of these departments can be questioned and some of these things can be brought to light which otherwise may not have been. To the best of my knowledge, not one Democrat senator attended any of the estimates committee hearings that I attended. This tax must be rejected, not only because of the burden it places on two of our most productive sectors but also because the principle of taxing rebates is anathema<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">and should be rejected on behalf of the Australian people as immoral. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TF4">Senator COULTER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, Senator Ferguson did not pick up some of our earlier announcements then. That is his fault, not ours. The situation is quite simply that one has in place a diesel rebate scheme which, I would agree with Senator Ferguson, would be much easier if, like sales tax, one did not pay the amount rebated in the first place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recall that a few years ago when I had a small farm that was exactly the situation. I had a certificate of which I quoted a number when I got my diesel for the tractor and that was it. The government has seen fit to operate a complex scheme&mdash;and, if this bill were passed, it would become even more complex&mdash;in which the tax would be paid, a rebate would be paid back, a charge would then be levied on the rebate and then the farmer could further claim that as a tax deduction. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TF4">Senator COULTER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is really like ping-pong, as Senator Boswell has said. It really is a crazy scheme with money passing back and forth about four times. The other quite iniquitous and quite dangerous thing about this is the precedent it creates. I believe that, once this principle were to be adopted, one might well see charges made by the tax office for normal income tax refunds and that sort of thing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we are opposed to this proposal to impose the rebate charge. It is something which should not be imposed and the mechanism, if anything, should be simplified rather than made more complex. While the amounts are not extremely large at this stage, we accept the argument that it may well be the thin end of the wedge. The amounts could easily be increased. The way in which the charge is made up could be disguised quite easily, false claims could be made for excessive charges and it could simply become a revenue raiser. But even though the amount over the whole community at this time might not be large, it is still a very considerable impost for particular individuals. So we will be opposing that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of our other concerns&mdash;and something that I mentioned before in debate on various aspects of this budget&mdash;is that we want to press the government very strongly toward implementing a scheme in which the fuel price paid by country people is no more than the fuel price paid by city people. I think in Canberra just in recent days one has seen the introduction of price wars which certainly will not be extended to country areas. We will see a continuation of a very substantial differential in the price paid by country people&mdash;and we are now talking about on-road use of both petrol and diesel. In our view that, in itself, is also iniquitous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The inquiries which we understand are under way should lead to, and we will press for, the imposition of legislation which will guarantee to country people that they will not be paying a higher price for their fuel than city people because it is quite unfair and particularly hard on country people at this time when so many rural prices are so low. So we want to take this opportunity to repeat that undertaking to country people. That is our intention; that is what we will be pressing for. We know that the National Party and the opposition are also keen on that course of events. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleague Senator Woodley will be speaking on one other aspect of these two bills in relation to the diesel fuel customs duty rebate administration charge. I will leave him to deal with those other aspects. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak to the collection of customs bills. I apologise for the fact that I have not had the opportunity to speak with Senator Spindler from the Australian Democrats, the Greens or Senator Harradine on the amendments due to the kafuffles of arrangements that have been going on tonight. It just was not possible, but we will not be proceeding with this legislation beyond the second reading stage and I can discuss the amendments with them as necessary. But I apologise for my inability to observe the usual niceties of the situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bills cover a combination of housekeeping matters and a couple of other substantial issues as well, as announced in the budget. Of the former, an important amendment concerns blended petroleum and crude oil products. At present, such blending takes place on licensed premises under customs control. The duty is paid on the full blend at a rate equal to either the diesel or the leaded petrol rate. The customs department is aware of blending that goes on by unlicensed operators such as service stations. They do not operate at the normal recognised standard, there is a level of safety risk and illegal blending leads to a loss of excise revenue as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment that is being put forward requires that all blending occur on licensed premises; hence duty will be paid on the full value of blended substance at diesel or leaded petrol rate. The coalition supports this amendment as a necessary development, but there is an area where further clarification is necessary, and that is the responsibility question in relation to fuels that are blended&mdash;whether this falls back to the oil companies directly, the distributor, the service station proprietors or people even further on. It does not appear clear as to where the liability for this still rests. That will need to be tidied up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other adjustment to this legislation concerns the shale mined in Australia. One amendment removes the outdated provision giving gasoline and mineral turpentine produced from shale mined in Australia an exemption from duty. This was a World War II measure which is long since redundant. No shale is mined for gasoline, nor is any derivative produced from it in Australia today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other amendment involving shale oil is a new measure. It is designed to assist a joint venture planning to mine shale and produce naphtha in Gladstone, and it is based on new Canadian technology. It is a research and development project and, given the huge quantities of shale oil reserves that are known to exist in Australia, it does merit support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To encourage this venture, the government has agreed to pay amounts in respect of the shale oil produced. This is based on the excise duty payable on the amount of unleaded petrol that can be obtained from the shale oil. Payments would be in the form of a bounty upon the production of naphtha from shale mined. This is not expected to have any financial impact before about 1996-97 and will terminate in 2005. The aim is that the payments be limited to 600,000 barrels of unleaded gasoline per year. The coalition supports these amendments relating to the shale oil. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The two issues in the legislation which concern the coalition relate to the diesel fuel rebate scheme and to micro-breweries. The amendment to the diesel fuel rebate scheme requires claims for diesel fuel rebate to be lodged within three years of purchase of the diesel fuel, introduces a new formula for indexation of the rebate and introduces an administrative charge for processing rebate applications&mdash;a charge of one per cent of the value of the rebate payable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rebate scheme commenced in 1982. Prior to that, all off-road users of diesel fuel could hold certificates of exemption from payment of excise on diesel fuel. There was no need for users to pay excise and then seek a rebate. The Commonwealth collected $2.65 billion in excise on diesel fuel in 1992-93 and estimates that it will collect $3.1 billion this financial year. Nearly $1 billion is expected to be rebated in 1993-94. The purpose of the rebate scheme and the prior exemption arrangement was to remove wholly, or largely, the requirement on off-road users such as primary producers, miners and certain other claimants&mdash;hospitals, nursing homes, residential and aged persons homes, et cetera&mdash;to pay the excise duty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The aim of fully rebating duty for primary industry was a recognition of the need to avoid unnecessary costs on an efficient export oriented industry. Nobody on this side of the Senate can understand why the government sees fit now to try to slug yet again an industry that is not only export oriented but struggling for its very survival. The reason may be perfectly clear to somebody on the other side. If it is, I would like that person to explain it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These new proposals are quite inconsistent with the intention of the scheme. They are clearly a new tax on these industries and organisations. While the requirement to lodge claims within three years will not affect most claimants, it could cause hardship in those cases where, for genuine reasons, claims are not or cannot be made within this time limit. No scope will exist for the minister to grant claims, even in those situations where he considers that the representations before him merit such action. It is an over-bureaucratic approach&mdash;an approach which, incidentally, the government considers will result in worthwhile savings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The annual adjustment of rebate rates to reflect indexation, replacing the current six months moving average, will likewise disadvantage the rebate participants. Together with the proposal to limit the period of rebate applications to three years, the saving to the government&mdash;in other words, the loss to the recipients&mdash;is expected to be $3.9 million in 1993-94, $15.8 million in 1994-95 and $16.9 million in 1995-96. These are in addition to the savings, or the losses to the recipients, involved in the administration fee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposal for an administration fee is quite outrageous. Apart from being inconsistent with the whole concept of the rebate scheme, it is a tax for which the government has no mandate. It is simply another unnecessary cost on business and another obstacle to higher employment levels. It is anomalous in that the business which will pay this one per cent administration fee receives an exemption for sales tax on business inputs without having to pay an administration fee. Will such a fee for sales tax be the next tax on business? It certainly opens the door for a new tax regime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amount collected by this fee will be around $10 million but, according to Senate Estimates Committee E, the scheme costs around $6 million to administer. If that turns out to be the case, it will be a ridiculous tax and certainly not worth the trouble that is involved, nor the cost that will be borne by the productive sector. Also, the imposition of a fee places no onus on the Australian Customs Service to improve its efficiency and to contain its costs. Quite clearly, all three measures in this legislation relating to the diesel fuel rebate scheme are inconsistent with the policy involved in the scheme, damaging to industry and grossly unfair to the others affected. They are, therefore, opposed by the coalition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The remaining proposal of concern to the coalition in this legislation relates to micro-breweries or brew-on-premises shops. These shops provide a service to do-it-yourself home brewers. Customers purchase the ingredients, which are subject to sales tax, choose a recipe, rent the equipment and then make their own beer. Customers mix the ingredients, leave it for two weeks, come back and bottle the beer and take it home. This hobby-style activity was developed in Canada where, incidentally, brewing beer at home is not permitted. In Australia it is likely that much of the support for these shops will come from the home brewers, who in many cases are lower income earners and migrants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition does not believe that there are any grounds yet for distinguishing between beer brewed at home and beer produced at BOP shops. Nevertheless, the government has announced in the budget that BOP shops must be licensed and that the beer produced on their premises be subject to the payment of excise. It is likely that this action will kill these fledgling small businesses and that customers will simply brew their beer at home, as usual. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to address briefly the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No.2) 1993. This bill works in conjunction with the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill 1993 to effect amendments to the excise payable on the following products: firstly, the beer produced in brew-on-premises shops; secondly, blended petroleum products; and, thirdly, gasoline and mineral turpentine produced from oil shale mined in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 6(a) of this bill redefines the definition of beer in order to catch beer produced using commercial facilities and equipment&mdash;that is, beer produced in brew-on-premises shops. In these shops, the customer arrives, buys the products, mixes the brew in kettles and equipment provided by the shop, and goes away. The proprietors of the shop store the beer and stir it possibly once during the intervening two weeks. The customer comes back, bottles the beer and walks away with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In regard to the definition of this process, the Australian Customs Service advised the entrepreneurs intent on establishing such shops, which are similar to shops established in Canada, that no excise would be payable. However, the government has now decided that the process that has been observed in Canada, where up to almost four per cent of beer produced is actually brewed in these shops, will in years to come heavily detract from the revenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While we share the government's concern about the loss of revenue from beer produced in these shops, we also are concerned about the fact that these people were advised by the government that, as long as they followed the formula that they had placed before customs, they would not be subject to excise. I believe that people in that position are entitled to rely on the government's undertaking and should not now be put out of business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's amendments to this particular bill would ensure that beer produced in these brew-on-premises shops would attract the same excise as beer produced in large breweries. The imposition of the full excise and the flow-on taxes, the wholesale sales tax and state licence fees, would add $12.49 to the current shop price of $16 for 24 stubbies, amounting to $28.49. This compares with a price of $22 for 24 stubbies, purchased in a liquor shop, of beer brewed by breweries. Very clearly, the government's action would put these shops out of business after they have established their businesses relying on the government's undertaking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time, however, the Democrats are concerned about the possible drain to revenue and I foreshadow an amendment which proposes to apply excise at the rate of 15 per cent of that which would be applicable under the government's amendments. This rate has been calculated to enable brew-on-premises shops to offer a viable alternative to commercial beer at approximately the same cost that is now available in liquor shops. In effect, it would be a shot across the bows of these shops to indicate that the government and, I confirm, the Democrats would be concerned about the drain to revenue amounting to millions of dollars, some $30 million or so, if the brew-on-premises industry advances in the same way as the one in Canada did. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that this is not sound public policy. There are other areas that we need to be concerned about and they are that the age limit in these shops is clearly enforced, that people under 18 are not admitted and also that health regulations are observed. We believe that these shops should be licensed under state law. Clearly, the main strategy to contain the growth of this particular industry in the way in which it has happened in Canada, and the resulting drain on government revenue, is in the level of excise which would be levied; hence, the amendment I foreshadow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also deals with blended petroleum products. Clause 5 of the bill stipulates the formulae for calculating the excise duty payable on various blended petroleum products; namely, those containing petrol or gasoline, those not containing petrol or gasoline which are payable at the diesel rate, those containing a blend of gasoline and ethanol where no duty is payable, and those said to be fuel oil at the fuel oil rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third area of the bill relates to gasoline and mineral turpentine produced from Australian oil shale. Clauses 6(c) and 6(d) remove the excise exemption which was applicable to gasoline and mineral turpentine produced from Australian oil shale as a result of the new arrangements proposed by clause 16 of the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill 1993, which provides payments to certain producers of naphtha-derived oil shale. The Australian Democrats will support these amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Diesel Fuel (Excise Duty Rebate) Administration Charge Bill, the Diesel Fuel (Customs Duty Rebate) Administration Charge Bill and the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill introduce changes to the diesel fuel rebate scheme, announced in the government's August budget. The major changes are an imposition of a one per cent administration charge or tax based on the value of the rebate due to off-road users of diesel fuel, and that the rebate is to be adjusted annually although the excise is adjusted every six months.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These bills represent another attempt by the government to rake in revenue from rural producers. I include in that the fishing industry, which would feel this imposition probably more than any other industry. This time, the government with its new scheme is attempting to charge a one per cent fee for administering a rebate on an excise which off-road users of diesel fuel are not required to pay in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This one per cent administration charge can only be described as a desperate money grab from primary producers by the government. I would say that it is one of the government's darkest deeds. It also applies to defenceless users of road diesel fuel in residential, nursing and aged persons homes. That should concern Senator Crowley, who is at the table. Accordingly, the opposition will be opposing these bills and will be proposing amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1957, a diesel fuel excise was introduced. The excise was levied for the purpose of paying for federal government roadworks. It followed then, and still follows, that off-road users of the diesel fuel should be exempt from paying the excise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The system of rebate has changed over the years. In 1983, when the Hawke Labor government indexed diesel excise at six-monthly intervals, the non-indexing of the rebate meant that by 1985 the rebate was short by 2.388c per litre. Fortunately, the government moved to fully exempt primary producers from diesel excise for off-road use and it explains why the mining industry now has to pay 2.388c a litre before the rebate becomes operative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This anomaly, which still requires the mining industry in its off-road use of fuel to pay 2.388c per litre, should be corrected immediately by the government. The mining industry should also be fully exempted from the excise on off-road use. Also, the other eligible recipients should be fully rebated; that is, the hospitals, nursing homes, residential and aged persons homes, which have a liability of 6.34c a litre. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For all road use of diesel, the diesel excise paid was 26.573c a litre before it was raised to 29.573c a litre in this year's budget. The one per cent administration charge introduced by these bills has been structured so that the charge is tied to the amount of the diesel used. Changes in the budget not only impose a one per cent administration charge, but also introduce other costs for off-road users which will also be to the disadvantage of primary producers by imposing more costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Costs will also rise as a result of the excise being adjusted every six months and the rebate lagging behind the excise increases, because it will be only adjusted annually. I believe that the amendments cover that and I am gratified to know that the Democrats will be supporting the amendments. This means that those receiving the rebate will miss out because there are two indexation increases in February and August before the rebate catches up in January, only to lag behind again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By this means the government will gain more revenue at the expense of farmers, fishermen, miners, hospitals and nursing homes. This government really has no shame. It takes advantage of people such as hospitals, nursing homes, fishermen and farmers. It really is disgraceful. The opposition is proposing amendments to negate these new measures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This year, rebates to the mining and primary industries amounted to approximately $1 billion, with rebates to the domestic users of hospitals, nursing and aged care amounting to $16,000. Yet the government has decided to tax these recipients simply because they do not have to contribute by means of petrol excise to the cost of maintaining roads. This year, for this privilege of using diesel in a way that puts no wear and tear on roads, the domestic, hospital and aged home user will have to pay $500,000 for the administration cost of the rebate, with primary producers and mining industries having to pay $19.6 million, rising to $29.1 million in three years time. The government does not seem to appreciate that, for any farming enterprise, diesel is an essential cost of normal business activity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition voted against the rises in the petrol tax introduced by the government in this year's budget; they were a cruel blow to our productive rural industries, our rural communities and our future economic competitiveness. Rural producers lose out from all angles. The road transport industry has calculated that the higher fuel costs, which become even higher in rural areas, will increase charges to farmers and industry by $175 million a year. Rural communities will also be hit by way of higher prices for food and other necessities of life arising from extra transport costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At a time when a lot of rural producers are in a desperate plight&mdash;particularly those in the wool industry and in western New South Wales and Queensland&mdash;and are finding it difficult to even put food on the table and provide for the ordinary, everyday things in life, suddenly the government says, `It will cost you 3c a litre more to drive your children to school or to the country bus stop, just as it will cost more to travel long distances to receive medical care or do business in country towns'. The government, not content with imposing these extra costs on our innocent, suffering rural industries, now wants to charge them an administration fee to return a rebate for an impost they are not required to pay. As I said to one of the Democrat senators, I think it was Senator Woodley, it is like ping-pong&mdash;you get money, you give it back and you get it back. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my opinion, this tax of one per cent, which is expected to return $4 million net after the cost of its collection, could only be put forward by a government that had the intention of increasing it next year. When the government granted a rebate to low income earners in the last budget, it did not also demand that the same people pay an administration fee to receive it, so why should it be any different for primary producers, hospitals and nursing homes? The administration fee, although only set at one per cent, will add almost half a cent a litre to farm costs which for some farmers will mean extra thousands of dollars. But, as I said earlier in my contribution, one of the main areas that gets hit the hardest is the fishing industry which consumes large amounts of fuel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many reasons not to like the new administration charge. There is always the distinct possibility that any new tax will hold the great attraction that the government can increase it as time passes and the government wants more. The tax may only be one per cent this year, but who knows? Next year it could be five per cent, the year after 10 per cent, and the government may want more, and eventually, when the government has worn the industry down, there could be the abolition of the fuel diesel rebate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is exactly the path the petrol excise has taken. The petrol and diesel fuel excise was introduced to contribute to the Commonwealth's road funding program. Yet, although the coalition government in 1981-82 was able to spend 70 per cent of excise on road funding, the Labor government has milked the petrol excise until this year only 12.1 per cent of the excise collected is estimated to be spent on roads. The amount of excise estimated to be spent on roads in three years time is forecast to fall to only 8.7 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were many tricks and games played in the lead-up to the budget with the diesel fuel rebate. The very strong rumour was put around by the government that the rebate was to be removed completely. That rumour was floated, and I think all senators would have been aware of it. The rumour was strong and it was taken very seriously in that the NFF lobbied the government to keep the rebate. But it seems this may have been just a softening up process, at least as far as this year is concerned, so that the government could introduce this administration levy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has undermined the value of the diesel fuel rebate by a process of stealth. There are other forms of stealth contained within the administration charge, on top of the fact that it was introduced at all. Firstly, there is the lag of the rebate assessment six months behind the excise increase. By creative mathematics and careful timing of the budget, excise increases and the CPI increases, the Labor government by this bill is attempting to make sure that farmers, fishermen and others will never receive the same amount as they pay out in excise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is just a bit more and a bit more for the government. In fact, the gap will continue to widen and the greater the rate of inflation, the greater the gap will become. This rebate creep will take an extra $15 million in the next five or six years, even at low rates of inflation. Already the rebate is behind and cannot catch up. The excise at budget time was 29.57c per litre, thanks to the government's increase in excise&mdash;and the Democrats can take no pride in allowing that to go through&mdash;but the rebate was stuck at 26.57c per litre, with the next adjustment not due till next February. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there was the debacle of the minister, Senator Schacht, telling estimates that the administration fee was directly related to the actual cost of administering the scheme and was, therefore, not a tax and that the government could impose it without the necessity of legislation. Thanks to Senator Ferguson's vigilance, this was picked up. This administration charge was called an administration fee in the budget papers; we now find it is a tax. Senator Ferguson was able to ascertain at estimates that the total cost of administration and salaries relating to the diesel fuel rebate scheme was between $5 million and $6 million. However, the amount raised from the one per cent administration fee was more like $10 million&mdash;and that is a nice little bonus for the government, a 100 per cent goal it kicked for itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is very clear evidence that the administration fee is a revenue raising exercise and not related in any shape or form to the actual cost of administering the scheme. Where it really hurts is that it is a revenue raising exercise against the embattled and struggling primary industry. In Queensland, the one per cent administration charge will take $80 million from the state's farmers. Once again, they just get hit with a one per cent tax and have no say on the efficiency of the department administering it. When will this government give this productive, efficient export earning sector a fair go? The answer is that it has not done it in the last 11 years and it is not likely to do it in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the western part of my state of Queensland, people are suffering from drought; almost half the state of Queensland is drought declared. The Labor government has removed drought from the category of natural disaster, leaving farmers to delve into inadequate funding under RAS to contend with years and years of drought. The budget not only hit them with an extra $175 million in fuel costs, but also cut rural adjustment funding. The budget continued its assault on rural families to make matters even harder by attempting to take Austudy away from 16-year-olds&mdash;a move that hurts rural students who have to meet a much harsher assets test and one which is no longer halved in consideration of their special circumstances. There was no mention of attacks on rural 16-year-olds in the government's election campaign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> When one adds it all up, the government must stop hitting our rural producers and treating them like a milch cow. In these times, our export producing primary industry producers do not need any further government imposed cost increases that can only lessen their international competitiveness and threaten their long-term survival. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very appreciative of the coalition's position in voting down this one per cent diesel levy and all the other trickery and chicanery that the government has employed in this bill to increase the charges. I was also pleased when I read a couple of weeks ago a press release from Senator Woodley, which was widely reported, saying that he, on behalf of the Democrats, would not endorse these charges and therefore this one per cent administration charge and all the other adjustments that the government has made to increase the charges will fail. I am very gratified that these charges will not occur now. I do not know why the government put it forward. The only thing that I can suspect is that it was a foot in the door with a view to gradually opening the door wider and wider by increasing the administration charges by one per cent this year, five per cent the next year and 10 per cent the next year and abolishing the fuel rebate in the future. That is the only reason that the government has put forward this bill. I am glad that the majority of the Senate has joined together to defeat this iniquitous bill. I am pleased that when the amendments are carried the one per cent levy will not be in place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am a farmer. This comes out of a package because the government is worried about the escalating costs of the scheme. As has already been pointed out, the government brought this scheme upon itself because we previously had a diesel fuel rebate scheme whereby one simply quoted a number. I am not going to quote my number from the past but I could almost remember it now. What is more, it was the number of our wheat delivery schedule back to front. I do not know how I worked that out; I suppose it was just my being an observant person.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government was worried about the scheme and so it decided to introduce this administration charge. The government is talking about handing back as a rebate roughly $1 billion of funds that it gathers through the scheme in the first place. It is totally unnecessary to charge the farmers, miners and others who use off-road vehicles and then pass it back. I believe the last scheme worked. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government reckoned that the last scheme was open to abuse but I believe that this one will be just as open to abuse. I cannot see the difference between one scheme and another when one is talking about abuse. I believe that the government brought in the scheme when it did as a sinking fund or a revolving fund in that for at least three months of the year the money is locked in there. Of course, these moneys are loans that the government is getting from operators without paying interest on them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By the government's own admission it has $1 billion in there for the year. On average, it is probably there for only two to three months. With simple interest rates or overdraft rates at about eight per cent these days, it works out to be a handsome package of money that the government makes on the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government should not be worried too much about the administration of this scheme because, as former senator Peter Walsh admitted in this chamber when he was Minister for Finance, there was a loss to us and a gain to the government because of the fact that not all those who were eligible for the rebate actually claimed it. He admitted that that was a fact but he could not put figure on it. All he said was, `How would you ever know?'. The government must pick up money there as well, so it should not be too worried about the administration charge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I compare this sort of system with provisional tax in that one has to put up provisional tax on the basis that one will earn the same next year as this year, with the addition of, say, eight per cent as the uplift factor. The government takes that and then adjusts it the following year. Of course, no interest is paid on money that is sitting there for 12 months. It is very simple. I just wonder whether next year the government might look at the idea of having an administration charge on provisional tax, given the amount of provisional tax that sits in the government coffers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, we will have the amendment imposing a charge of one per cent of the value of the rebate, and adjustment of the rebate for indexation will occur only once a year. That means there is a rebate lag. In other words, one pays a higher levy when that levy comes in but the rebate comes in much later. So the increased one will not be rebated and, once again, the money will go into government coffers. I do not think the government has allowed for that in its financial impact statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point is that this bill establishes a limit of three years after the purchase of fuel to claim one's rebate. I have no problem with that. I do not think one is running one's business properly if one has not claimed within three years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government estimates that this charge will raise approximately $11 million; in other words, slightly in excess of one per cent. I would like to know how the government arrived at this figure of one per cent. To the best of my knowledge, about 33,000 claims are submitted per year&mdash;they are the figures that I have got and I do not know whether anyone will dispute that. If one divides $11 million by that figure one gets some $330 per claim. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I am wrong and there are 330,000 claims per year, that would come down to $33. But I am sure that I read some time ago&mdash;I tried to get some information tonight but unfortunately we could not find it in such a hurry&mdash;that there are some 33,000 claims a year. That works out to $320-odd per claim. I would like to know how the government can justify that amount because one simply fills in a form, with about 12 invoices, and those invoices are added up and the rebate is calculated. A lot of claims may be for less than $300. I would like the minister to tell me at some time or another how the government arrived at that one per cent figure. Was the figure just plucked out of the air to raise extra revenue or was it calculated properly? I reckon it is excessive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another point to make is that we have a flat rate of one per cent. So who is subsidising whom?  I would not know what the average farmer claims in one year and how many claims he makes. But I would guess that the average is probably three to four claims a year and that the average farmer would claim back about 40,000 litres at 25c&mdash;that is $10,000&mdash;and so it costs him roughly $120 for that sort of claim. But, according to my figures, on average the government charges $320-odd a claim. Off the top of my head I believe that is what the average farmer claims. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We then come to the miner who is probably claiming a rebate on one million litres of diesel fuel. The rebate on that would be $260,000, give or take a few dollars. But the cost of processing that miner's claim would be no different because one gets only one claim form every time one claims. One can do only about 10 invoices on each form. The only difference is that, instead of there being invoices for 3,000 litres or 5,000 litres, probably with a miner it would be 100,000 litres per invoice. In other words, they take 100,000 litres per delivery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Are those opposite telling me that just because the figures are five times larger than the number of litres used by a farmer, it costs five times as much to administer? I do not agree with that. So other than for the sake of simplicity, I do not see why the government should use a flat one per cent figure. Someone has to be subsidising someone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thought that this government had adopted the user-pays principle. After tonight there will not be an administration fee, but I believe that the user should pay, regardless of whether he is a miner, who is claiming roughly about quarter of a million dollars in one claim, or the average farmer who is claiming $1,200 per claim. I just do not understand the position and I hope that sooner or later the government will answer my concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another point which has already been raised is that this administration fee happens to be tax deductible as a cost to producing income. I am getting a signal from Senator Foreman to wind up. If I am to get a wind-up signal in a debate, that surely should be up to my whip rather than the government whip. Coming back to the point, my view is that the government probably did not regard it at the time as a deductible item. It is deductible because it is used to produce income. The final analysis is that if one charges for the service, if it is called a service, then it can be claimed as a tax deduction. I would like to know what the final outcome will be because I do not believe that it is taken account of in the financial impact statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the government went into this one without thinking. I believe that it is immoral because this involves money created by fuel users&mdash;money that is sitting there and getting no interest. We were going to be charged&mdash;it will be defeated tonight, of course&mdash;for use of our own money when the government is getting interest on it.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The diesel fuel rebate scheme currently provides a rebate to users in primary industry, mining, hospitals and nursing homes. In the case of primary industry, users receive a 100 per cent rebate. For the mining industry, the excise it pays on the diesel is limited to about 2.4c per litre, and in the case of hospitals and nursing homes it is about 6c per litre. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rebates paid through the scheme last financial year totalled some $898 million. The government claims that the administration cost of distributing that money amounted to some $9 million. The forecast for 1993-94 is slightly over $1 billion to be refunded. This higher figure is the result of the increase in the diesel excise payable, together with some anticipated increase in the consumption of diesel fuel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes to the diesel fuel rebate scheme contained in the bills before us are as follows. The first is the introduction of an administration charge of one per cent of the value of the rebate; secondly, the rebate is to be adjusted annually, while the excise is to be indexed six-monthly; finally, a three-year limit on retrospective claims is to be applied. These changes are expected to save around $20 million this year, rising to $30 million a year by 1996-97. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I start with the least contentious of these changes, and that is the three-year limit on retrospective claims. It is my understanding that the cost of interest and the cash flow situation of users generally encourages them to submit their claims promptly. So we believe that the limit is primarily an administrative move and the Australian Democrats support that particular change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to the more contentious administration charge. I note that the media release put out by the Department of Industry, Technology and Regional Development when this decision was announced in the budget stated that the government's justification for introducing this change was to clarify the costs involved in administering the scheme, and that it should be on a percentage basis rather than a flat fee basis because this more fairly reflects the costs of administering various size claims. I believe that since then the administration charge is being introduced in an attempt to rein in the cost of the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me, however, a curious proposition that the government can introduce an excise and determine that certain people should not have to pay the excise, but then expect them to pay a fee to claim their exemption from it. As was mentioned earlier in the debate, what if it were decided that the cost of providing refunds on personal income tax was getting too great? Surely that cost must be enormous. Are we to charge people to claim their taxation refund? I do not think politically any government would be game to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The position of the Democrats is that if certain categories of users have been deemed to be eligible for rebate, then it is unreasonable to expect these people to pay an administration charge to claim that rebate. The government cannot turn around and say, `Yes, you're entitled to a rebate, but because the cost of the scheme is becoming too high, we're going to have to charge you to claim your rebate'. So we intend to support the opposition amendment to strike down the one per cent charge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another proposition is the indexation of the rebate. We also believe that this causes many problems and we would support the opposition's amendment in this regard. In the interests of time, I will not go through an extensive argument as to why we are going to do this, except to say that, in simple terms, the increase on the rebate paid to claimants will always be a year behind the excise increases. In simple terms, the rebate will be adjusted upwards around 31 January, but then the excise rate will be increased almost immediately afterwards. Of course, the excise will be increased in August, which will mean two excise increases since the last rebate increase. The cycle then starts again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an almost unbelievable example of the government's cost cutting measures which are being proposed in an attempt to fund the government's tax cuts&mdash;cuts which the coalition also voted for. This indexation system is clearly unfair. The Democrats are opposed to it, just as we are opposed to the imposition of an administration charge. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Allegation 5</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Evans states that "it is important that people in an employment situation be clear about the attitude of their employer towards them, that they are not caught by surprise as it were, in a situation and not given an opportunity to lift their game or improve their performance. All of that, I am advised, was followed in this particular case."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The housekeepers state that the attitude of their employer to them was one of appreciation for the work that they did which went beyond their formal duties and included child care responsibilities.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator Bolkus</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Attorney-General has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The Attorney-General has been advised that the ASC operational debt management policy, formulated in consultation with the Australian National Audit Office (ANAO), directs that invoices for amounts less than a set minimum not be issued. Clearly, the dollar amount of that set minimum is commercially sensitive information. The ASC's processing system (ASCOT) has been programmed to withhold invoices for amounts less than that minimum. However, an operator may override the system in the normal course of processing actual payments received as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) multiple invoices of $1 (or multiples of $1 and other amounts) may be sent back to the lodging party for payment of the aggregate debt. For example, where there have been 50 applications from one lodging party each of which has been deficient by $1 or more. Multiple invoices of $1 will also be sent back to the lodging party where that lodging party would appear to be engaging in a continuing practice of short payment;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) invoices of $1 will also be given where the transaction is an over-the-counter transaction that has been short-paid. This does not involve the postage of an invoice;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(c) under section 1355 of the Corporations Law, where full payment has not been received for documents requiring service transactions, as distinct from register up-dating (eg, annual returns), an invoice is raised for the balance regardless of the amount owing and has to be paid prior to completion of the transaction. This is a requirement of the Law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The Attorney-General has been advised by the ASC that in 1992/93 there were 1,260 occasions where invoices with a balance owing of $1 were printed. Of those invoices, 756 were issued across-the-counter at ASC Business Centres and were generally for service transactions, covered under (c) in the answer to question (1), and for short paid company annual returns. The balance of 504 invoices were printed by the ASC Information Processing Centre at Traralgon and were generally for multiple lodgments of annual returns which were short paid as covered in (a) in the answer to question (1). A small number were printed in error but were not issued.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The Attorney-General has been advised that most instances of $1 owing on document lodgments occurred immediately after the last general companies fees review in 1992, when the maximum late fee for lodgment of a company annual return was increased from $80 to $81. The Attorney-General has been advised that the Information Division of the ASC is presently reviewing the option of accumulating small amounts due by debtors and subsequently issuing a single invoice for the total sum owing. The ASC also has operating procedures specifying that invoices for small amounts only be sent out in the circumstances listed in the answer to question (1).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) The cost of sending out an invoice is estimated at approximately $2 including postage, operators time and system time. This amount drops significantly where multiple invoices are sent out to the same lodging party. This amount is also less where the invoice is issued in the context of an over-the-counter transaction which has been short-paid.</PARA>
