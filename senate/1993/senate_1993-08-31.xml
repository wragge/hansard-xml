<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. I refer to the government's budget of betrayal which is rapidly becoming a budget of humiliation. Is it not a fact that, as far as low income earners are concerned, by the time they get that miserable $3 a week rebate they will be being slugged an extra $3.50 a week for petrol for the average car, at least $3 a week for the average family as a result of sales tax increases and an extra $5 a week for cigarettes?  What is fair about the continuing savage impact of this viciously regressive budget on those who are least able to afford it?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I make the point at the outset that if Senator Alston or anyone else on the other side believes that there has been some betrayal in the steps that the government has taken, they always have the opportunity and the option of voting for the budget, which any decent minded or responsible opposition might be expected to do.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Those opposite cannot have it both ways. They cannot express their hostility and distaste for everything in the budget and then think they can have the luxury of voting against it and creating an opportunity for others to do their work.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the subject of equity issues, we have made it perfectly clear that this is not a regressive budget and never has been. The measures that have been taken in the last 24 hours have the effect of ensuring that any conceivable doubts that there might be on this subject have been well and truly alleviated. I refer to the increase from $100 to $150 so far as the low income earners rebate is concerned; so far as the modification of the petrol excise is concerned; and so far as the impact of the optometry and other measures are concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It needs to be understood, as has often been said, that throughout the 1980s the government has improved the equity of the tax system through a number of measures which have been taken to broaden the tax base and to reduce tax avoidance. That equity has been very important so far as lower income earners are concerned. There will be 4.2 million taxpayers with incomes below $24,450 who will benefit from the introduction of the new tax rebate. This will mean that 130,000 taxpayers will have their tax liability eliminated altogether.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tax cuts are just one element of a package of continuing reforms to assist Australian families. The package includes adjustments which have had less attention than they should have had because they are a very important contribution to the equity of this whole package. For example, adjustments to the family assistance system, including the introduction of the home child care allowance from September 1994, have made it a simpler system of greater benefit to low income earners. We have an age pension which over the course of the past 10 years has increased from 22.7 per cent of average weekly earnings to 25.5 per cent at present. These are the measures which we believe fully allow us to keep our heads held up so far as the equity of the budget is concerned in its impact on lower income earners.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. I know that arithmetic has never been the minister's long suit, but he does not seem to have disputed the figures that I have put to him. Does it therefore follow that he takes the view that an additional $12 a week in imposts on low income earners, as a result of what is left of all the nasties to be compensated for by a rebate of $3 a week, is fair and reasonable and that these people should sleep soundly in their beds? Is one in four the minister's definition of equity?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not take anything that Senator Alston says at face value, let alone the figures that he has just put to me today. I will examine the implications of what he says and get a response in more detail from the Treasurer about that. But our clear understanding is that the overall impact of the budget was not regressive, except perhaps in a very marginal way at some levels in its formulation. Certainly any lingering concerns there may have been of that kind have been well and truly eliminated as a result of the further changes that have been made.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PF4">Senator COLSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Transport and Communications. I refer to the recent report on the progress of aviation reform published by the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics. Can the minister advise the Senate what some of the major findings of this report were, especially in regard to better outcomes for the travelling public? In addition to the bureau's findings, can the minister advise whether there have been recent changes in the use of larger aircraft to service some long haul Australian domestic airline sectors?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As to the last part of Senator Colston's question, the answer is yes. The bureau's report is very timely in a public policy sense in that it has provided a very comprehensive analysis of the results of the very significant changes in aviation policy that the government has brought about in the last few years. The bureau report noted that these reforms have been far reaching and it made the comment that they will still be felt by the industry at the turn of this century.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the impact of deregulation, the bureau found that greater freedom now exists in market entry; there is far more competition between incumbent domestic operators; the travelling public now has the benefit of lower than average air fares; domestic operators have improved their efficiency; and within the domestic market annualised net welfare gains of around $100 million per annum have been realised. More Australians and overseas tourists are flying in Australia today than ever before&mdash;around 18.6 million passengers a year to be precise. A small example of the significance of aviation reform was recently shown by the first departure of a Qantas Boeing 747 jumbo jet from the domestic terminal at Sydney airport. This month will see the inaugural international flight of Ansett from Australia to Bali, which is staging through my home city of Darwin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's aviation policy is delivering major benefits to the travelling public, tourism and trade. I believe that the conclusion of the report is worth noting. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There may still be a long haul before anyone is completely satisfied with the efficiency of our airline system or its contribution to Australia's competitiveness but, so far, we can judge that we are on target and on the right track.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator McMullan. I refer the minister to the government's budget of betrayal. Is it not the case that despite yesterday's backdown the budget still results in a situation where in excess of $3 billion in extra taxes will be levied?  Could the minister explain to the Senate how this is fair and how these tax increases will complete the main objective of the budget, which was supposed to be the creation of new jobs?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The question is no more accurate in its subject matter than in the person to whom it was directed. It is wrong in its fundamental foundations and mis-conceived. First of all, tax as a percentage of GDP was not, in any event, going to go up as a result of this budget.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want, principally, to talk about jobs. I refer Senator Tierney mainly to the excellent contribution made by the Minister for Finance in the House of Representatives yesterday about the jobs issue. It said, quite clearly&mdash;and everybody but an economic illiterate would know&mdash;that the most important thing one can do in a budget with regard to jobs relates to the overall rate of economic growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This budget is designed to give an economic stimulus this year by increasing the deficit in a way that is responsible. It is providing a stimulus, which is what the country needs, while those opposite are proposing cuts. They are proposing to reduce the deficit, to reduce the fiscal stimulus and to reduce economic growth, which will inevitably reduce employment and increase unemployment&mdash;a consequence that everybody but an economic illiterate would know.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is absolutely irresponsible to pretend that those opposite come in here concerned about equity, when they have two priorities. Their priorities are to slash spending, when everybody knows that the most significant redistributive action a government takes is how it spends money not how it raises money, and to make major cuts in outlays, which would be fundamentally regressive and unfair. They are also proposing to withdraw fiscal stimulus, which will slow the rate of economic growth and, as an inevitable consequence, increase unemployment.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. I note that the minister admits that stimulus has been created by a deficit increase. One wonders why it is going to be called the deficit reduction bill. I ask the minister again: how, really, is the government increasing taxes? I refer him again to the wine industry. He made an appalling mess of the answer the last time we questioned him about it. How can increased taxes such as this create new jobs, which was supposed to be an objective of the government's budget?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Over four years you can do more than one thing. We will try to get the budget written in smaller words and bigger letters next year. The other thing is that, with regard to the wine tax, nobody is suggesting that the overall level of outlays is going to go down. If Senator Tierney's wild misconception that there is going to be a loss of jobs in the wine industry should in any event be correct, it would only be because there was increased expenditure in another area of outlays, whether it be beer, soft drink, mineral water or whatever, so the net effect on jobs would be nil.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. The minister would be aware of press reports of direct talks between the government of Israel and the PLO and that Israel and the PLO are close to an agreement. What is the Australian government's assessment of the prospect for progress in the Middle East peace process?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="629" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government very warmly welcomes the reports that the Israelis and the Palestinians may be very close to agreement on a declaration of principles which would provide for the early transfer of power to Palestinian authority in much of the territory of the West Bank as well as the whole of Gaza.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> While the agreement is yet to be formalised and a number of further details obviously are going to need to be elaborated, we do understand that the arrangements for the transfer of power may include, firstly, the transfer of authority from the Israeli civil administration to Palestinian control in Gaza and the West Bank town of Jericho; secondly, redeployment of the Israeli defence forces away from Palestinian population centres; thirdly, the principle of early empowerment being applied to most of the area of the West Bank, not just Jericho, providing initially for transfer of authority in the fields of health, education, welfare, tourism and culture; and, finally, elections for a Palestinian council to administer self-rule to be held at least nine months after the declaration of principles is implemented.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of Jerusalem is expected to be placed on the agenda explicitly for negotiations on permanent status of the occupied territories, which will commence between two and three years after the signing of the declaration of principles. That is, of course, in accordance with the understandings reached at Madrid in 1991. According to these reports, there is also an expectation that Israel may announce its recognition of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, the PLO, which is a rather breathtaking breakthrough.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear that there are now prospects for substantial movement in this forthcoming 11th round of bilateral negotiations commencing in Washington this week. A breakthrough in the Israel-Palestinian track of this order may also, of course, prove extremely useful in stimulating progress in the other bilateral tracks involving Lebanon, Syria and Jordan. We recognise that there are many groups in Israel, among the Palestinians and elsewhere, who are opposed to the kind of agreement that now appears in prospect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is obviously a long road ahead before a just and lasting peace can be secured in the Middle East, but certainly these reports suggest that the peace process is at last producing the seeds of a broadly acceptable agreement. I hope those groups on both sides of the argument who are opposed to or indicating hostility to this are large minded enough and large spirited enough to appreciate the historical opportunity that is now before people in the region, for the first time, really, to secure a lasting peace.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The greatest issue facing our nation is how to provide jobs for our fellow Australians.</PARA>
<PARA>In light of that statement, I ask the minister: will the government seriously consider the suggestion raised today by the ACTU to impose a surtax on those earning more than $75,000 a year or, alternatively, consider the Democrats' suggestion of a Medicare style levy to create a $1 billion fund to provide jobs for our fellow Australians?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sure the government will look very carefully at all options that are suggested for job creation programs of one kind or another and the means to fund them. That remains, of course, an issue that is very much on the agenda and which we are going to have to confront when we get the report that has been commissioned by Mr Beazley on this whole issue.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The way in which it contributes to it is by creating a macro-economic environment which will be stable and perceived to be as such into the medium term through to 1996-97: an environment which will, in fact, guarantee the maintenance of a low inflation environment; above all, an environment which will maintain the existence of a low interest rate environment; and an economic environment which rides the growth that we are expecting to be injected back into the economy over that period in a way that will generate a very confident environment for investment and for the kinds of new economic activity&mdash;in particular export oriented activity&mdash;that are, at the end of the day, more than anything else absolutely crucial if we are to get unemployment back to reasonable and acceptable levels in this country.</PARA>

But is the minister really saying that, after 10 years, the government has no specific ideas or specific plans and that we are, in fact, going to wait another six to 12 months&mdash;or, indeed, a million Australians are going to wait another six to 12 months&mdash;before anything specific is done?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know where Senator Lees was for most of the last decade, but she may recall that we had hugely effective job creation&mdash;job growth&mdash;throughout most of that period, and it is only in the recessionary environment of the much more recent years that that situation has turned around. It is a situation that, as she ought to well know, is being experienced in common with every other developed economy in the world. We have to approach the solution to it not in a way that resorts to gimmicks or short-term solutions which may have some superficial appeal; we have to get the fundamentals of the Australian economy right.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course there are specific programs that one can contemplate. Of course, the training and skill programs that we are talking about&mdash;the education programs&mdash;are all in their own way designed to achieve a better working environment, a better job opportunity environment for the future. Similarly, the infrastructure spending that we have been injecting through One Nation and related programs has that effect. But, ultimately, at the end of the day, if we want to make a fundamental inroad into the employment and unemployment situation in this country, we have to do it through creating a sustainable growth environment marked by low inflation, low interest rates and an attractive environment for investment. That is exactly what we are creating; that is exactly why this budget remains the very responsible document that it is.</PARA>

They are not interested in any practical applications that can help small business. It is this government that has done more to help small business in a practical way. That is why the eighth National Small Business Forum&mdash;a forum initiated by this government&mdash;was very well attended by all the major national small business organisations.

Now that the government proposes to raise the sales tax from 20 per cent to 31 per cent&mdash;an increase of 55 per cent&mdash;does the minister concede that this will have a devastating effect on employment rates for men and women in rural and regional areas in the vicinity of vineyards?

Once the A and B licensees have agreed on a digital standard&mdash;which is important in terms of the consumer protection involved in that measure to ensure that people are not having to choose between more than one set of technology&mdash;the specific industry conditions can then be set, because the manufacturers will then know precisely what type of equipment it is that they have to manufacture.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Prime Minister. I refer Senator Gareth Evans to yesterday's outrageous attack on Australian business by the ACTU President, Mr Martin Ferguson, when he described Australian business as being characterised by laziness, negativity and cowardice. He said that the performance of Australian business has been truly regrettable. He described the lack of export initiatives as a national disgrace. He then went on to say that `Australia's future could well be the horror stories of Los Angeles, with alienated kids murdering each other in their hundreds, with drive-by shootings, with a vast criminal subculture turning the streets into battle zones'. Does the government support the president of its accord partner?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not sure that I would employ quite the same language as Martin Ferguson did in describing Australian business. But, equally, I think it is a fair comment that Australian business has not yet fully risen to the opportunities that are now presented by the present domestic economic environment and the external export environment that are available to it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a change in business culture in this country since the mid-1980s onward, and that is reflected in a very considerable increase in focus on export potential and export performance. It has been reflected in the very encouraging figures that we continue to read each month in the balance of payments with regard to continuing export manufactures performance, particularly on the side of elaborately transformed manufactures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the case that a number of small to medium sized businesses, the so-called McKinsey 700, have demonstrated the kind of flair and positive outlook&mdash;not the negativism and conservatism&mdash;that are necessary if this country is to prosper. Equally, it is the case, both for a number of much larger businesses and for the remainder of the 6,000 businesses that are referred to in that same McKinsey report, that there has not yet been a grasping of that export potential; there has not yet been an assimilation and absorption of that as export culture; there has not yet been a full enough willingness to grasp the opportunities that are available to business through things like the export market development grants scheme, the international trade enhancement scheme and other things of that kind which are designed to help Australian companies that want to get out there and compete with the rest of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the case that a heck of a lot more change needs to be inculcated into management practices, into training and into awareness about the scope and potential for getting out there and producing much better returns than Australian business is producing at the moment. That is a very fair criticism that is made of much of Australian business. Incidentally, it is a fair criticism that is made of a number of business organisations, and I am not persuaded that they have, between them, contributed a great deal of value in terms of themselves changing this particular culture and producing this new environment in the business community that we all so badly want.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was busy in my office last night. I do not know where Senator Alston was. Mr President, I would have thought that tobacco advertising was a serious issue in Australia and when Senator Childs asks a question he is at least entitled to an answer. The question was about the number of companies which have sought to continue to advertise after this year and, indeed, up until 1996. If the conditions of section 21 of the act are met, it amounts to quite a few companies. So far, 155 section 21 defences have been lodged, which is actually a very large number of organisations. It shows the reason why some of these defences were put in in the first place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After the end of 1995 some advertising can continue. Under section 18 the Minister for Health can exempt certain Australian sporting and cultural events that have international significance. So far, four applications of that kind have been received and, so far, I have approved three of them. These were: the Telecom Rally Australia which took place in Western Australia a couple of months ago; the Australian Ladies Masters Golf Tournament in Queensland&mdash;I might say, I am still getting arguments on that because the decisions are so detailed and so strict as to limit the size of advertising on the bibs that the caddies wear in the tournament, but that decision has been made nonetheless&mdash;and the Adelaide Grand Prix, which I signed an exemption for last week and which I think is now well and truly established on the international scene.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other application that I have received is under consideration, and in accordance with that legislation is therefore confidential. I cannot as yet reveal any details of it. Discreet acknowledgments of assistance or support are permitted, provided they comply with the regulations made under the act.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to say that the opposition's points of view are very much consistent with this government's policies. In relation to the approach we have had of a national view about domestic violence, the government has put this matter on the political agenda, has brought this issue out in public and has worked very closely with the states through the relevant ministers' meetings, particularly the Attorneys-General, to see that we have now got in place&mdash;and I believe in all states, but there may be still one or two not on board&mdash;legislation for the portability of protection orders. That is an issue of grave concern and indeed has been raised by senators in this place from time to time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have also seen the change of legislation that allows police to seize guns from any person against whom a protection order has been issued. We know that those require the states' cooperation and, as I understand the opposition's policy, it is entirely in support of the government's policies on this issue. So I can see that we will have a very strong voice from this Senate to continue the campaign of working with the states to see the necessary changes, because most of the changes that are needed are at state level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome very much the opposition's changes in this area. All of us know that, despite these changes, there still is not an assurance in this community that women who go in fear of violent partners can be guaranteed that protection. Although we have dealt with some issues&mdash;for example, the portability of orders&mdash;we know that women are not guaranteed that protection and I sincerely hope we will continue to take the steps we need to take.</PARA>

The document makes clear that the bill in the form in which it is now before the Senate is constitutional in accordance with principles which not only have been long applied by parliamentary counsel but also have clear High Court authority. It is not possible to summarise in short compass the detail of this advice and I do not seek to do so, except to make these two points. First of all, it is a bill properly characterised as one `dealing with taxation' and it is also a bill properly characterised as one `dealing with the imposition of taxation'. What it is not is a bill `imposing taxation'. These distinctions are familiar ones in the High Court case law and those points are made clearly by Mr Rose.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point as to the content of the advice is the question as to whether the bill, if passed, would be `a law dealing with more than one subject of taxation'. This question is also addressed in a way that makes it clear that there would be no adverse consequences to flow constitutionally if the bill were to be passed in its present form. The advice must speak for itself, and it does so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The advice was prepared in anticipation of the Senate committee inquiry proceeding, but it does reflect in its content the nature of the principles that were applied throughout the drafting exercise by parliamentary counsel and advice given by the Attorney-General's Department during that drafting process. </PARA>

While I respect the advice and integrity of Mr Rose, I think it must be remembered that he was asked to do a job defending the government in its handling of this particular issue. So we would hardly expect a decision from the Attorney-General's office contrary to what the government has put forward. What the government now proposes is to treat these sorts of issues as issues in a non-taxing bill.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real point at issue is that the government is trying to treat this as a non-tax raising bill to enable it to add a string of issues associated with this particular feature. I put it to the Senate that this is contrary to the constitution. The government is seeking to avoid some very fundamental constitutional issues through a very unsatisfactory device called tacking. I think this is deplorable. The government cannot have it both ways. It can produce either a bill which basically relates to administrative issues and, as such, can be amended, or a bill involving the raising of revenue. I think it is a very shabby exercise; it is a very devious means of getting around what are justifiable constitutional restraints.

<PARA>While I will concede that the question I put today to the minister representing the Treasurer is a matter for customs, I find it absolutely amazing that he had no idea as to whether a new taxation bill was being drafted or had been drafted and put into circulation. The one thing that Senator McMullan did not say in his answer was when the decision was taken to draft this bill. I find the conclusion of question time to be a pretty unusual time for the government to announce that it is introducing a new tax measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I asked when it was decided to draft this new tax bill because of what was said at estimates last Thursday night about the implementation of this new so-called administrative fee to pay for the administrative costs of the diesel fuel rebate scheme. It was established by the officers and by Senator Schacht from the program performance statements for the inland revenue that the administrative and salary expenses totalled $16.5 million in 1992-93. The inland revenue officers estimated that one-quarter to one-third of this related to the diesel fuel rebate scheme; that is, somewhere between $4.1 million and $5.5 million could be attributed to the administration of that scheme. It was also determined that, because an expected amount of just over $1 billion is to be rebated to eligible diesel fuel users, the income from this fee would be just in excess of $10 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the estimates Senator Schacht argued that not all the expenses may have been included in the program performance statements. Our advice is that any other significant expenditure would have to appear as a separate line in the budget papers. There was no other line in the budget papers. Therefore, we could assume that all administrative expenses are included in the program performance statements, especially as at that estimates committee hearing Senator Schacht specifically stated that there are no costs incurred in administering the scheme outside of the inland revenue program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If it were the case that this fee had to be put into place by the implementation of a new tax, I would like to know why at that time on this important matter&mdash;and, remember, it is a line in the budget, so surely some legal advice should have been sought prior to the estimates hearing; long before the hearing last Thursday when I asked these questions as to whether the fee would be constitutionally legal&mdash;Senator Schacht, in his answer to my questions and also to questions from Senator Hill, said:</PARA>

<PARA>I believe that until that time it was decided that this would be a backdoor tax that nobody knew of. The Government would be able to implement a new tax which would bring in increased revenue to the government without the introduction of any legislation. It was not until it was pointed out that the matter would be unconstitutional if it brought more revenue in to the government than was to be expended in administration and salaries, that this government then decided that it had better do something about it. It hastily sought to draft a new tax bill in order that this fee could be brought into place to bring in the expected $10 million of revenue for this government. </PARA>

I promised Senator Ferguson that by the time the estimates committee met the following Thursday I would get a more detailed breakdown. The issues he raised about the administration costs I conceded were quite relevant and to the point, as was the question about how we get the $9 million to $10 million figure when he and I were estimating on the back of a envelope the division of the inland revenue section.

If there is to be any argument&mdash;and I do not think there will be&mdash;I am told the figures which are being prepared but which have not been completed will show that the administration fee of one per cent is equivalent to the administrative cost, which is $9 million to $10 million. Irrespective of allowing for any variation from time to time, I think it is absolutely correct that legislation be put to the parliament so that it is beyond doubt.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This administration fee of between $9 million and $10 million per annum relates to the diesel rebate scheme. For 1993-94 the pay-out under the scheme is estimated at over $1 billion to people in Australia in all the eligible areas. We are not talking about a massive charge at one per cent raising $9 million or $10 million on a pay-out to eligible people of over $1 billion. When this was introduced by the Fraser government, the estimated cost was around $200 million. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to address the very same answer that Senator Ferguson moved to take note of, to which Senator Schacht responded. I will not go deeply into the eligibility issue. However, even Senator Schacht will admit that when this diesel fuel rebate came in in 1957 exemption certificates applied for diesel used off-road. Unfortunately, he has to accept that this rebate of $1 billion to the mining and rural industries, et cetera, is no help to industry; it is simply a rebate for fuel that is used off-road.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I tend to agree with Senator Schacht that it might not seem right that a highly paid public servant, in Canberra especially, gets a refund on diesel fuel that he uses on heating, but unfortunately we have to accept that it is used off-road. Unless that criterion is changed, I am afraid that the rebate has to be given to him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Schacht gave us figures about the cost of administration behind the introduction of the one per cent administration fee. Of course, we could go back to the old system&mdash;I know that the Fraser Government changed it&mdash;of bringing in the levy and taking it out again. There might have been a few dodgers, but a lot of claims come in that are eligible to go out. They do not go out because a lot of farmers and other operators forget to claim. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Senator Schacht gives us this information on how he arrived at the one per cent administration fee, I want him to tell us whether the government or the Treasury has allowed for the interest that accumulates on the global figure that is kept in Treasury for roughly two months. From my experience, the turnaround time for rebate claims is, on average, two months. That is what I believe, and I might be wrong. Working on the basis that that amount is held by Treasury for two months and using the present interest rate of about six per cent per annum, interest of one per cent would accrue for that time. Is Treasury allowing for that one per cent increase per two months&mdash;or six per cent per year&mdash;for which that global figure belonging to the eligible users is held in Treasury? If it is not making allowance for that, it is really costing the user two per cent. I would like Senator Schacht to answer that question in time. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Maybe Senator Schacht should get some of his history right while he is on the job, because the diesel fuel rebate scheme, in fact, started back in 1957.

<PARA>I will not accept the minister's attempt at myth making or rewriting history which her government seems to be turning into a fine art. The minister tried in her answer to suggest that bipartisan support from the opposition for action on domestic violence is new.

Dr Hewson and Dr Wooldridge made excellent speeches at the conference, both of them demonstrating great sensitivity to this serious matter and to the concern of the opposition about this canker in our society. It was quite obvious from the minister's demeanour during question time that she had not read either of the speeches; she has staff to read things for her.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.most homicides and assaults are committed by persons known to the victim;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.Aboriginal Australians face a much greater risk of becoming the victims of violence than do other Australians;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the financial costs of violence to the community are huge&mdash;the Institute of Criminology estimates them as involving hundreds of millions of dollars;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the most striking feature of violence against women is that it is overwhelmingly perpetrated by men.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The data on domestic violence is hard to come by because of the conspiracy of silence&mdash;the "scream quietly or the neighbourhood might hear you" syndrome:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">-this conspiracy is being broken down but it is being broken down very slowly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The available statistics do, however, verify that much of the violence we hear and read about is perpetrated in the home&mdash;domestic violence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fact is that women and children are the prime casualties of thousands of domestic battles fought out in homes in every city, town and region in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A Saulwick poll, conducted in Victoria earlier this year, produced some startling results:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.an estimated 322,000 Victorians are direct victims of domestic violence and more than half a million said they knew someone in their immediate family who was a victim;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.1.3 million said they knew someone outside their family who was a victim of domestic violence; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.more than a quarter of a million women or one in eight in Victoria alone had been victims of sexual assault.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Quite frankly I find these figures alarming and staggering.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In NSW, the victims of domestic violence are conservatively estimated to total nearly 100,000 per year.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Violence against women, young and old,  and children in particular, be it physical, sexual, psychological or emotional is a social evil that is simply intolerable.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The economic pressure on ordinary Australians has been enormous&mdash;and in many cases, that pressure has translated into violence&mdash;domestic violence against women and children.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A recent Saulwick poll asking people about the main causes of domestic violence saw financial problems, alcohol and unemployment identified as the three main causes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">More than 40 percent of respondents blamed domestic violence on financial problems while 33 percent blamed alcohol.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But domestic violence is part of a broader pattern and the underlying causes of violence against women affect their everyday lives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The psychological impact of violence on women is, in many ways, as destructive as actual physical violence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fear of violence and assault means that many women will not even go out at night or even with other women.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result they are often denied the amenities that are an essential part of our quality of life&mdash;cinemas; theatres; restaurants; or even strolling along the beach on a balmy summer's evening.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And for those who work on a night shift or take school or university lessons at night, there is constant apprehension about  safety.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Last year, in recognition of women's fear of violence, the Coalition sent messages of support to thousands of women across the country who marched to "Reclaim the Night".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I should also say, in the context of violence against women, the type of conduct which can be properly regarded as violent, and is certainly seen by many women as violence, in the sense of violating their rights, making them feel insecure and subordinated, is far broader.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It includes the manner in which women are regarded more generally&mdash;the way they are looked at, or whistled at, or are made the object of sexual remarks.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These principles provide all levels of Government with a base from which to address the problem of violence and child abuse.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I said earlier, domestic violence does not have a single cause. It manifests itself in a variety of ways. Therefore there must be multiple policy responses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We must deal with symptoms while putting into place long term strategies and awaiting their benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If we are serious about saying that domestic violence must stop, we have to face up to the fact that this depends on action on the part of both governments and the community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Government policies that aren't supported by community values, that aren't consistent with the way individuals behave, are likely to be of very limited effect.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Government can preach against violence through the most sophisticated multi-media campaigns, but the impact of the message depends upon the willingness of members of the community to play their part as well:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.to educate their children to respect the right of every person to live without fear;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.to confront their own behaviour;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.to challenge the violence of others and clearly indicate that such conduct is unacceptable;  and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.to support the victims of violence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Corporate citizens also have a responsibility to actively promote a culture of mutual respect between their employees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer here to the widespread problem of sexual harassment, a pattern of conduct which can include violence.  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If managers do not find the moral argument for dealing with sexual harassment compelling, then they may be persuaded by the fact that it also makes economic good sense&mdash;sexual harassment is disruptive, adversely affects productivity, and forces good employees to leave.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All spheres of government have a role to play.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the case of local government, for instance, while only a small proportion of sexual and other violence against women is committed by strangers in public places&mdash;the streets, parks, shopping centres, it does impact fundamentally on women's behaviour and enjoyment of life.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Therefore local government has a key role to play in the provision of lighting and other town planning aspects that deter offenders because of the likelihood of detection, and thereby encourage women and others to make use of public places in the evening as well as during the day.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">State governments have primary responsibility for the criminal and related laws, particularly those dealing with domestic violence, and the systems set up to administer them&mdash;the police and the courts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe that the provision of adequate and appropriate legal protection to women either threatened with, or victimised by, acts of domestic violence is crucial to a national response to violence against women.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Different laws on domestic violence apply within different States.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Within the last seven years all Australian jurisdictions have passed legislation with the objective of providing more adequate statutory responses to domestic violence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, while the main features of various State legislation are the same, problems are caused, for example, by the fact that restraint orders do not operate across jurisdictional boundaries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While police have gained increased powers in the area of domestic violence, the effectiveness of restraint orders, particularly their power to protect women who have been "stalked", is constantly under the microscope.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In NSW alone, it is estimated that every week, over 150 women report breaches of restraint orders.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And a very recent and shocking case in NSW has heightened the need for greater powers to be given to the police to ensure safety for women who are clearly in danger and at risk.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our laws must be strong enough to protect those in our community when they need effective protection against violence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I call on all governments, Commonwealth, State and Territory, to work together with a renewed sense of urgency to ensure that everything is done to provide maximum security and protection to the community, particularly to women and to children.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I pledge the Federal Opposition's support for a bipartisan commitment to achieve these goals and I welcome and endorse yesterday's announcement by NSW Premier Fahey of the introduction of tougher restraint laws and arrest provisions in crimes of domestic violence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We cannot accept a situation where some women and children in our community are reduced to living in absolute fear of their lives with pitch forks and knives under their beds&mdash;and they are as seen on television earlier this week&mdash;because of their fear of violent men.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If our system cannot protect them from violent men who have perpetrated a series of shocking crimes against them, then we must seriously question who the "system" is serving.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recent controversial comments by some judges in sexual assault cases have raised the issue of whether the legal process, including the role of the judiciary, should be put under scrutiny.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe these issues are entirely legitimate and should be pursued.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We should ensure that the views of victims and other members of the community are heard: and that necessary reforms are made.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is also important that the views of a small number of individuals, sometimes taken out of context, not be used to stereotype all judges everywhere.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We cannot accept complacency and indifference on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But we should not respond with knee-jerk reactions and flavour-of-the-month responses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To that end, my colleague, the Shadow Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs, Senator Amanda Vanstone, recently put a motion before the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee to investigate:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"whether recent publicity surrounding judicial comment in sexual offence cases is a proper reflection of a failure to understand gender issues by the judiciary; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the appropriate response to any such failure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe there is no question that our laws can be better, that our courts can be more effective and that governments, working with the community, can do more in addressing violence against women and children.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the same time we cannot ignore the economic dimension. We need economic policies which can create jobs and reduce unemployment and thereby significantly reduce the social pressures that result in domestic violence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.We need jobs for women, so that they are not forced to stay with violent men because of economic dependence, nor forced to go from refuge to refuge due to the lack of affordable public housing; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.we need jobs for men, to reduce the anger and stress created by poverty and loss of self-esteem which often triggers violence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I do not believe, given that violence against women and children is on the rise, that we are doing enough as a society.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not enough to leave it to the professionals, the counsellors, the police and the social worker.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We all have to be involved.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fact is that if we are to move forward in solving this problem, there must be a full partnership between governments, community groups and ourselves as individuals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the end of the day, if we as individuals and as a society do not also change our attitudes towards women and violence then the situation will not change.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We must commit ourselves to ending sexism and prejudice in our society.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They breed the contempt, the arrogance, the domination and the disrespect&mdash;which all too often give way to domestic violence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To stop domestic violence, these things must be stopped.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Can I congratulate Joan Hall and members of the Federal Women's Council for their initiative and formally open this conference.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to support the remarks made by my colleague Senator Newman. I happened to attend the women's conference on domestic violence which was held last Thursday here in Canberra. It was an excellent occasion. The women representatives of the Liberal Party, who are formally coming together in this way once a year, along with a number of parliamentary observers from both the Senate and the House of Representatives made contributions which were well based, sound, well informed and sensitive on domestic violence, in particular, male dominance of women in Australia and other societies. There were also two outstanding speeches given by parliamentarians, those of our colleagues Dr Hewson and Dr Wooldridge.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear from the whole tenor of the smart remarks of the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women (Senator Crowley) that she is thumbing the nose at what the public of Australia wants to see in this country; that is, bipartisan cooperation between parliamentarians on both sides of the chamber on matters of such importance as getting a solution to domestic violence. Instead of that, the minister takes the question of bipartisanship and tries to throw it back as something which is new, and it is not; as something where we have caught up with her, yet she has never understood the plot. This is disgraceful speechifying in this chamber by a minister who ought to know better and who ought to show the proper respect for bipartisanship which has always been offered on this important matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In an excellent speech about this important social problem in this country by the Leader of the Opposition, Dr Hewson&mdash;and Dr Michael Wooldridge's speech, which was totally complementary and totally integrated with the remarks of John Hewson&mdash;we have the clearest statement that has been made this year by any male member of parliament. The minister ought to be applauding that and underlining the bipartisanship which has been offered by this side of the chamber for some time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to speak briefly on this matter of violence against women. Senator Crowley's performance today, particularly in relation to her answer on domestic violence, was not satisfactory from a minister. I can understand that Senator Crowley feels under pressure. After all, media reporting of her competence in the first session of this parliament in May was that she probably was not up to scratch. People on this side of the chamber were under attack from some people in the media. They said, `Give Rose a go. Be</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate will notice that in the first couple of days the minister had an easy ride. What did she choose to do with it? She has chosen to come in and get a dorothy dixer on something that is two months old, pretending it is new. That is how desperate this government is to have something to say about women; it had to drag up something that it had a hand in two months ago. That is the paucity of innovative thinking on that side of the chamber in relation to the status of women.

<TITLE>Medicare Benefits for Optometric Examinations</TITLE>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To the Honourable President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully shows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.Optometry has been covered by Medicare since its inception in 1975, and currently provides eye care to over 2.4 million people each year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.Removal of optometric benefits from Medicare will increase Government expenditure on eye care, as people will instead obtain their care from a more expensive source.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.The cost to the public of eye care will increase, both through the removal of benefits for optometric consultations and the shift to ophthalmologists who generally charge well over the scheduled fee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.The visual welfare of the community will suffer as people are discouraged from seeking eye care. Many eye diseases, such as glaucoma, do not produce symptoms until they are in an advanced stage. Any discouragement from seeking regular eye care will increase suffering from these diseases.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5.The removal of benefits for optometric examinations will disadvantage children, as undetected visual disorders will adversely affect their development and school performance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6.Access to eye care will be reduced, particularly in rural areas, as part-time and visiting optometric practices will no longer be economically viable, and alternate care is not available.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We therefore request that the Parliament take steps to ensure that Medicare continues to be a universal health insurance system and that all eye examinations by optometrists are covered.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1). One of the most critical issues to the Vietnamese people today is the persecution of their freedom of religion and expression, which has been carried out by the Government of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam (GOSRV) since 1945. World media reports have shown consistently that this persecution has increased greatly since 1992, when Buddhists, despite violent repression by the GOSRV's armed forces, started asking for `real' freedom of religion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2). The continuation of the GOSRV's centralised and corrupt structure, as well it's failed and disorderly `economic renovation' and it's declared loyalty to the atheistic socialism, has seriously degraded the moral, cultural, family, economic and spiritual life of most Vietnamese people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3). The GOSRV's policy of oppressing religions has, since 1945, applied equally to Catholics, Protestants, Caodaists, Hoa Hao Buddhist members and, most seriously to the Unified Vietnamese Buddhist Church (UBCV) which represents the faith and spiritual life of 80% of 72 million Vietnamese.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4). As the rightful heir of the 2000-year old Buddhist tradition in Vietnam, the UBCV was formally formed in 1951 by all Buddhist sects, lineages and regional congregations. It is the sole legitimate umbrella Buddhist body in Vietnam despite the GOSRV's unsuccessful attempt, in 1981, to disband and forcibly replace it with the State-run Vietnam Buddhist Church (VBC), and instrument for the GOSRV's propaganda purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5). Despite being held under strict house arrest since February 1982 simply because of his opposition to the GOSRV's attempted disbandment to the UBCV and its formation of the State-controlled VBC, the Patriarch Thich Huyen Quang, a nominee for 1979 Nobel Peace Prize, has been repeatedly and patiently appealing to leaders of the Communist Party and the GOSRV to ask for:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">a) the urgent restoration and legal recognition of the UBCV's independent status,</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">b) the separation of Church and State and the withdrawal of the GOSRV's control over, and politicisation of, the Buddhist church.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">c) the release of all arrested clergy, including the Patriarch, along with thousands of other prisoners of conscience,</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">d) the return of, and compensation for, all confiscated and misused Church properties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">e) open negotiations, free of pre-conditions, between the leaders of the UBCV and the GOSRV to establish mutually agreed solutions to the current conflicts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6). In replying to these reasonable requests, the GOSRV has, in the last few months, ordered stricter surveillance of the Patriarch's place of confinement and placed bans on all of his external communications. Whoever tries to contact, visit, help or offer gifts to him are stopped, threatened, interrogated, bodily searched (and in some cases strip searched), etc. The Patriarch's straightforward appeals have not only been ignored by the Hanoi leaders, but have also been vilified as `anti-state', `reactionary', `creating division amongst Buddhist community', etc. by the GOSRV's mass media and it's nation-wide agencies, including it's own VBC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7). All of the UBCV's brave clergy and lay members who openly declare their support for the UBCV's appeals and who have worked sincerely for the reconciliation between the State and the UBCV, also between the VBC and the UBCV, have been inhumanely and violently attacked by the GOSRV. In the last 12 months, hundred of monks, nuns and lay persons have been arrested and/or tortured, harshly interrogated, searched, investigated and threatened. Amongst them are the Venerables Thich Nhat Lien, Thich Tri Luc and Thich Khong Tanh (Oct&mdash;Nov 1992), Thich Thien An (Oct. 1992, tortured to death few days after arrested), Thich Hai Tang, Thich Tri Tuu, Thich Hai Thinh and about 50 lay members (5/6/93), Thich Hanh Duc, 17 other monks and about one hundred of lay followers (9/7/93) etc.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(8). The GOSRV's violent attack and mass media campaign against Buddhists' appeal for Church independent have caused suffering to many thousands of people, resulting in increased instability for the whole country. Despite the GOSRV's current campaign to illogically calumniate them and to deceive the world, these monks and lay Buddhists are arrested, solely because of their aspiration to be involved and support their chosen church, the UBCV.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(9). To politicise the traditional Buddhist community in Vietnam, the GOSRV has publicly been, and is:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">a) recruiting members for the VBC by forcibly converting the UBCV's moderate clergy to join it, and arresting or exiling other leaders who refuse to do so. (The GOSRV's view of `religious freedom' is not in accord with natural human dignity and heritage, but a rare favour given reluctantly on the terms of the State),</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">b) forcing the VBC to include, in it's Charter, `Socialism' as it's third aim of service&mdash;the other two, which originated from UBCV Charter, are People and Buddhism,</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">c) creating mutual distrust and conflicts between the lay Buddhist community and their clergy or amongst the clergy themselves by appointing VBC senior leaders to artificial political positions, and by closely controlling and intervening in the limited activities it is permitted to perform training programs such as ordination procedures, seniority promotions, etc.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">d) requiring the VBC to make frequent political statements supporting the GOSRV's inconsistent policies, with the consequence of eroding the VBC's religious identity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">e) directing the VBC to start a nation-wide campaign to accusing the UBCV of having political ambitions, and forcing it to declare the VBC as the `only legitimate Buddhist authority' and its `everlasting loyalty' to the GOSRV. This is whilst the GOSRV is facing huge pressure and condemnation from the international community about it's oppressive attitude to the Buddhists and it's systematic violation to all human rights of all non-party-cadre citizens in the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(10). The GOSRV's exclusively economic renovation has not, and can not, lead to democratisation or potentials which will allow long-overdue human rights to it's citizens, such as freedom to select their own political aspirations, ways of expressions, religions, education, employment, place of resident, etc. The greater it's economic strength, the more determined and confident the GOSRV is in it's opposition to such a democratisation process and the worse it's treatment of it's citizens becomes. This causes ever greater social instability and a sense of total hopelessness for Vietnam's future, and more broadly, prevents the development of stability in the SE Asia region as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(11). As it's history has proved, if the UBCV is completely free and independent of political intervention, it would be a most beneficial part of, and the best spiritual force to contribute to, a humanitarian and ethically orientated redevelopment process for Vietnam.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Senate requests the Australian Government to:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">1. make conditional the release of currently approved financial assistance, and any future aid, to the GOSRV, on it's granting of all internationally accepted human and civil rights to it's people, without discrimination.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>It was important that this report be tabled today, and that is one of the reasons the opposition opposed the adjournment motion. The Attorney-General's Department has advised that this report contains material which could be regarded as defamatory and potentially defamatory. The officers concerned were shown the contents of the draft report where it referred to them and were invited to provide oral or written comment. The comments submitted have been taken into account in the report as considered appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report of the Auditor-General deals with the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service and its review of travel irregularities. The report provides the parliament with the results of an audit office examination of travel irregularities alleged in relation to senior executives of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service. The examination was carried out in response to a request from the Minister for Resources (Mr Lee) dated 19 March 1993 after an AQIS internal management review was leaked to the press in late February 1993 and tabled in the Queensland parliament on 3 March 1993. I gather that some of my National Party colleagues may have some knowledge of this matter and have been assiduous in pursuing it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The travel irregularities had previously been investigated by a departmental officer, who had concluded that no misconduct was involved, but the minister was concerned that unless an arm's length investigation was carried out allegations against officers would continue to be made. This report is a result of that investigation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to deal in substance with the many matters raised. Some of them are quite insubstantial in terms of money amounts and in any event there will be plenty of opportunity in Estimates Committee A to deal at length with the matter of primary industry expenditure. I imagine this matter will be taken up there. What I do want to put on the record in the Senate itself are a couple of general matters raised in the letter from the Auditor-General, Mr Taylor, to Mr Crean, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, dated 29 August 1993 and which appears as an attachment to this report. In it the Auditor-General says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The most important lesson arising from this audit concerns the ethical underpinning associated with the management of travel and related expenses. Senior executives are responsible for setting a good example within their organisations and to the public. This report shows there can be no presumption or assurance as to the economy and probity of travel and related expenditures while the approving officers do not themselves set and observe high standards. The ANAO considers that where officer payments and entitlements are concerned, the test of probity and propriety must predominate. The decisions and actions of officers in relation to this type of expenditure must be able to withstand full public scrutiny irrespective of the dollar value.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that is the key point. I do not think anyone will go over the edge about the size of the matters here, but it is the question of the principles involved. The letter goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some 330 individual matters were examined in the course of the review. The key findings are:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.thirty-nine percent were found to have no substance</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.forty-seven percent were breaches of regulations which indicated inadequacies in management practices</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.thirteen percent were breaches of regulations which warranted recovery action to the net value of $2000, and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.three instances may have involved misconduct in the terms of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Public Service Act 1922</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ANAO does not support the findings of the DPIE Authorised Officer that no misconduct had occurred in any of the cases examined.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a serious point. It is unfortunate that the authorised officer of the department had said that no misconduct had occurred. The audit office does not support that conclusion from the cases examined. It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the report shows, however, the Attorney-General's Department has advised that it considers it `improbable' that a court would agree to open the way for any action in these cases.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ANAO concluded that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.senior management of AQIS did not have systems and procedures in place for the management of risk in relation to travel; such systems should have provided the checks and balances necessary to prevent the matters disclosed by the Review Report from occurring</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.rules were not always appropriate in the circumstances </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.delegates authorised to approve travel often did not themselves set and observe high standards, and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.there were no procedures for risk-based post-action review of travel and related activity.</PARA>
<PARA>That is in the letter from Mr Taylor to the minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My final point is that the department has agreed with all but one of the recommendations, has recovered the moneys owing to it and has rewritten its secretary's instructions. This demonstrates once again the vital role played by the Auditor-General in the proceedings of this parliament and in the proper supervision of the expenditure of taxpayers' money. How unfortunate it is that this government is continuing to deprive the Auditor-General of the appropriate resources to ensure that taxpayers' money is saved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of this government's activity, the Auditor-General has, as I understand it, announced that 100 of his employees are to be removed from his employment in one way or another because resources are inadequate. That seems to me to be an extraordinary decision by the government. I commend the Auditor-General's report and I hope that, despite the reduction in his resources and the failure of the government to respond to repeated requests and recommendations from committees of this parliament, the Auditor-General will be able to continue the outstanding work he is doing. </PARA>

<PARA>I have stood up here and asked question after question about AQIS and its inadequacies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year we had an extraordinary action against AQIS. AQIS wrote a letter stating that the Danish genetic material and live pig imports had been discussed at prime ministerial level; over six weeks later AQIS wrote a second letter denying this. Then an AQIS officer stated that the importation of pig genetic material had been discussed at ministerial talks between the Australian and Danish minister; the executive director had to correct that months later. There was an AQIS cable from Brussels about higher authorities for live pig and pig semen imports because of links to a joint venture proposal between Australia and the Danish industry&mdash;I might mention that the Australian industry was half owned by the Australian Prime Minister (Mr Keating). Then we had an AQIS telex questioning why pigs from Denmark had a No. 1 priority.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In all these four instances, every time, we had AQIS officers standing up and denying what they had put in previous correspondence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not a department; it is a circus. What makes it worse is that it is a circus that is paid for by the farmers of Australia who are not getting any value for money. In fact, AQIS is an embarrassment to the government and an embarrassment to the Public Service, and it should be stamped on with both feet. I do not take kindly to being lied to at an estimates committee. We are receiving disinformation from AQIS&mdash;every time we find a letter that says something that involves someone and pig imports, or semen imports, or genetic material imports, someone from that organisation has to get up and deny that it was ever written, or state that it had a different intention or that it should never have been written. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now come to the conclusion that the Auditor-General's report has found indiscretions in AQIS. I want to know what this government is going to do about this. We cannot afford to have a quarantine inspection service that carries on like a three-ringed circus with a bunch of clowns at the top. I will take great delight in further questioning the AQIS officers at the next Senate estimates committee in a couple of days time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, it is a serious matter when the whole future of our exports is placed in the hands of these&mdash;I have to say&mdash;at the very least, incompetent and now dishonest officers. But it is even more embarrassing and even more questionable when farmers have to pay for services that they are not getting. Every time people use a telephone, charge a car expense, use taxis or go on a trip to Ireland when they should be in America, it is not the government which pays for it; it is the farmers who pay for it. I am not referring to the people down the line; I am referring to those in the highest echelons of this department who are giving absolutely no example to the people down the line. Throughout rural Australia now we see AQIS inspection officers getting about $35,000 a year, but abattoirs are being charged $70,000 or $80,000 to keep those people on. It is not a government charge; it is a charge that goes to the cattle producer, the exporter of our primary industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is time this government&mdash;I know the ministers are embarrassed, and they should be embarrassed&mdash;seized this problem of AQIS with both hands and did something about it because it has been going on in this place for up to two years.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will give Senator Ray a preview, all right. The first thing we need to recognise about AQIS is that it is the postage stamp for Australian agricultural exports. This is a very serious matter because, once again, its credibility has been significantly dented. The flow-on impact from that dented credibility has serious medium and long term ramifications for Australian producers and Australian produce. I certainly join with Senator Boswell and Senator Baume in urging the government to take immediate definitive action to clean out what has been going on in AQIS.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many examples one can refer to. The Danish letters are a classic example. The intent of those letters was continually changed or their wording was pronounced as incorrect. The important point about this&mdash;as made by Senator Boswell&mdash;is that, as well as the damage it does to our exports, it is the farmers who pay the bills for these inefficiencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My next point relates to the credibility of internal investigations, or the failure of internal investigations or, as Senator Boswell put it, Caesar judging Caesar. When these matters are raised in the future, I think it is absolutely imperative that they should be referred directly to the Auditor-General&mdash;and I congratulate him or his officers on this report and the recommendations contained within it. This report and, I think, the activities that have gone on in estimates over the last two or three years have proved quite conclusively that internal investigations, particularly in this area, just do not work and they whitewash the facts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ANAO did not support the findings of the Departmental officer that no misconduct had occurred in any of the cases examined.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say that it is improbable that a court would agree to any action being taken. I am not suggesting that this matter should necessarily go to a court&mdash;although it could well do so&mdash;but I do believe it is up to the minister, the government and the people involved to clean out these people who have abused the privileges which exist for those who are employed in that operation. I particularly note the recommendations regarding management systems and doing business in a proper and efficient way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by saying it is absolutely crucial that the government now takes the action that is required, and that those officers who have abused the system and the privileges that they enjoy are replaced by people who will not abuse those privileges. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not wish to hold up the Senate for too long or canvass the history leading up to this report. Suffice to say that the Auditor-General, after carrying out two earlier reviews, undertook an extensive review of some 330 individual matters. As the report says, in the Australian National Audit Office's opinion 39 per cent of the matters were found to have no substance, 47 per cent were found to be breaches of regulations of a minor nature and 13 per cent were found to be breaches involving the paying back of moneys. The office suggests that three could involve misconduct in terms of the Public Service Act. I think that is of concern. The office also said that it was doubtful whether a court would agree to open the way for any action in these cases.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are dealing with here is not whether someone filled out a travel form accurately, thoroughly or on time, or whether that person made a financial gain. Some who did do the wrong thing have paid back a sum of $2,000, so there is not a great sum of money involved. What concerns me more than what basically is in the report is the fact that such an inquiry was necessary at all. The inquiry involved senior executives of AQIS, some 11 or 12 people who are supposedly at the peak of their careers&mdash;the cream of the service. They appear to have not handled the system properly&mdash;to have rorted it, abused it or neglected it&mdash;but the fact remains that they are the management. What they have done is typical of the disease that has been rife throughout the whole service for quite some time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I first came into the Senate some eight years ago we discussed some of the problems of AQIS. I do not think the service is operating as well as it should be. As Senator Crane said a little while ago, AQIS is our postage stamp to the rest of the world in regard to getting our products out and, obviously, looking at some of the ones coming in. I have had heaps of complaints at different times about the cost&mdash;and the rising cost&mdash;of inspection services. This service, which is supposedly monitoring disease, is riddled with a disease of its own&mdash;a disease of slovenliness and carelessness. It comes out in the report that in most cases the service is just not being administered as well as it should. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the same service that employs meat inspectors&mdash;on full pay, of course&mdash;in towns where there are no meatworks. I heard a story just recently about an inspector who notified the local abattoir a week in advance that he was going to be sick. In fact, the inspector wanted the day off so that he could attend a local race meeting. An inspector was flown a great distance to work on that particular day. It so happened that it rained on the day the bloke was meant to be sick and the race meeting was cancelled. He then decided that he would go to work. So the abattoir ended up with two inspectors at great cost, not to the service, as Senator Boswell said, but to the user because the user pays under the cost recovery system of AQIS. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the same service that has instituted full cost recovery, yet it has a travel budget of its own which is not supervised correctly. There are principles involved here. It matters not whether the amounts involved are tuppence or $2,000 or $200,000. The service needs to develop a more professional approach, a cost conscious etiquette, and it needs to do so very soon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year the Auditor-General found inefficiencies and a lack of effectiveness in other parts of AQIS. This year it is the travel irregularities within the senior service. This sort of thing has to stop because AQIS is right at the forefront of our exports and imports. Although this report deals with matters of small consequence, the fact that it was necessary to have this inquiry is a much greater indictment of the service than anything that is disclosed in the pages of the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The inquiry relates to 1991-92 and the parameters set by the minister required that the Auditor-General look only at that period. I have been saying for some time that to get the matter cleared up in the minds of the people who use the system&mdash;the exporters and the importers&mdash;we should have a full parliamentary inquiry into AQIS. I will be moving that this matter be referred to the Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs. I do not want a witch-hunt or anything like that. At the end of such an inquiry I want everyone to be happy that everything has been fixed up&mdash;whether it be travel problems or the high cost of inspection charges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Inspection charges are escalating all the time and the person who is selling the product is not getting anything out of it. People even get charged for things that do not get inspected; things that supposedly have been inspected. I believe that the way to fix this up is not to have another Auditor-General's report&mdash;although I commend this report to the parliament&mdash;but to have a full parliamentary inquiry that every member of the parliament and all the users of AQIS will be happy with. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill contains a wide range of omnibus amendments to the various programs administered under the Social Security Act 1991. These amendments will refine the Government's carefully balanced income support policies to make sure that members of our community in need receive the social assistance vital to them in difficult economic times.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Child disability allowance (or CDA) is paid in recognition of people who care for disabled children at home. Several reforms in this Bill will improve the effectiveness of this important payment. First, it will become possible for CDA to be shared between two people who share the care and control of a disabled child but one or both of whom do not receive family payment for the child. People who receive family payment as well as CDA for a child can already have both payments split in this way and this amendment makes sure that the same treatment is given all round.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The payment of CDA during a child's "temporary" absence from home has proved difficult for administration of the payment. It is to be made clear for all new claimants of CDA that payment is to be made only while the child is being cared for in the family home and during specified respite or hospitalisation periods. Also, all current recipients of CDA will now continue to qualify for CDA while the child is in short-term hospital care. Lastly, a limit of 12 months is to be placed on the backdating of CDA to the date of another, similar claim. Earlier cases of backdating for 5 to 10 years had highlighted problems with collecting information about a child's disability or care requirements for such a long time in the past.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill allows parents who are granted prescribed education scheme payments for their children to be paid, in certain circumstances, arrears of family payment back to the effective date of grant of the education payment instead of just to the date on which the education payment was first made as provided now. This is a significant improvement for families in this situation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of our important responsibilities to the taxpayer is to get maximum value for every dollar of social security expenditure and the debt recovery provisions in the Social Security Act help us achieve this. A range of amendments builds on these provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Act will now specify how to calculate the amount of a debt that arises in some cases when a job search or newstart allowance recipient's circumstances change during a public holiday period such as Christmas or Easter for which he or she is prepaid. If the client fails to return the usual fortnightly income statement, there is currently no basis on which to calculate the debt. The debt will now clearly equal the amount of the prepayment in these circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is also being clarified that the debt that arises when family payment clients underestimate their taxable income by more than 25%, or fail to comply with the notification provisions, is the difference between what has already been paid and the amount due on recalculation. Furthermore, an overpayment of family payment following a reassessment of taxable income will become a clearly recoverable debt.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A redundant provision enabling the Department of Social Security to waive or write-off Department of Veterans' Affairs debts is being removed. The Department of Social Security will still recover these Veterans' Affairs debts when possible by deductions from current social security payments but the Department does not generally handle other agencies' debts. Also, overpayments under the child support scheme when there is no continuing entitlement to child support will become recoverable by deductions from social security payments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Each year, the Department sends over 2,500 cases of potential offences under the Social Security Act to the Director of Public Prosecutions. The penalty that applies to offences under Part 8.1 of the Act is imprisonment for 2 years, having been increased from 12 months in 1991. As a result, cases that had been dealt with summarily (by a magistrate) are often now handled as indictable offences by judge and jury.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has been decided to revert to the 12 month penalty so that the more appropriate means of dealing with offences may be consistently employed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unemployed people have access to a wide range of labour market programs. The interaction of these programs with the social security system is being refined in this Bill by making sure that people who are paid for participating in the Landcare and Environment Action Program administered by the Department of Employment, Education and Training or the ACT Government's Jobskills program cannot simultaneously receive payment under the social security system. When they have finished their training,  these people can immediately return to the social security payment they were receiving before.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">People who are serving a newly arrived resident's waiting period before being paid job search, newstart or sickness allowance will now be able to serve that waiting period concurrently with the ordinary waiting period that applies to most new grants of these allowances. This will reduce the overall waiting period by around 7 days.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The NSW Medically Acquired HIV Trust was established by the NSW Government to provide a package of financial assistance for people infected with medically acquired HIV in NSW. Through this Bill, the social security system will not be treating payments from the Trust as income under the ordinary income test. This is in line with the Government's intention for payments made by the similar Mark Fitzpatrick Trust that was established by the Commonwealth and covered by identical legislation last year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The rate of pension or benefit paid to someone whose partner is in gaol or psychiatric confinement following a criminal charge is to be clarified in this Bill in two respects. First, to recognise the financial realities of living apart from a partner who is confined, a person in this situation will now be paid the higher rate that applies to a person without a partner instead of the rate normally paid to a member of a couple. Secondly, it is being made clear that an additional amount is not to be added to a person's rate of benefit for a partner who is in gaol or psychiatric confinement and therefore being maintained by the State rather than by the beneficiary.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Last year, an amendment was made to the review of decisions provisions to channel applications for review by the Social Security Appeals Tribunal (the SSAT) through the internal Departmental review mechanism. This Bill makes a minor enhancement to that initiative to make sure that, if a person incorrectly applies for review to the SSAT instead of to the Department, he or she is taken to have applied to the Department for internal review on the same date. This preserves the person's rights to be paid arrears should the review eventually decide in his or her favour as if the correct application had been made in the first place.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The dual payment of mobility allowance under the Social Security Act and training allowance paid by the Department of Employment, Education and Training is being prevented by this Bill. This dual payment exclusion has applied so far only to people undertaking training as part of a Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service rehabilitation program but is now to apply to all cases of common entitlement to these two allowances. To further protect the integrity of Commonwealth payments, it is being made clear that, where a person receives a payment by the Department of Employment, Education and Training under the New Enterprise Incentive Scheme or the Aboriginal Employment  Incentive Scheme, the person's age or widow B pension will be reduced. If the person receives age pension, his or her partner's pension might also be affected. This is consistent with the approach taken with other social security pensions and benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill also makes some purely technical refinements not involving new policy in areas such as investment income, family payment, the employment entry payment for sole parent pensioners and the impairment assessment tables for disability support pension. There are also some minor technical amendments to the Act to ensure its integrity in terms of correct references and terminology, Notes to the text and similar matters.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Customs Tariff Act 1987 (the Act) to put beyond doubt the construction of item 41A of Schedule 4 to the Act. Item 41A is a key element of the legislative mechanism for implementing the Government's Passenger Motor Vehicle Manufacturing Plan (the Plan).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From its commencement, paragraph (a) of item 41A and the Customs by-laws made in respect of that item have always been intended by the Government to benefit only the 5 `plan producers' by allowing them duty free importation of certain passenger motor vehicles where they have earned export credits under the Export Facilitation Scheme in accordance with the Plan, and hold the appropriate determinations under that Scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In extending the Scheme with effect from January 1991, item 41A was amended by the addition of a paragraph (d) to allow non-plan producers such as component manufacturers to benefit directly from export credits they had earned under the Export Facilitation Scheme. Previously non-plan producers could only benefit through the sale of their credits to plan producers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has recently been contended that these provisions and the Customs administrative by-law could have allowed the duty free importation of such passenger motor vehicles by importers not holding such determinations under the Scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's automotive policy sets out a schedule for the gradual reduction of tariff levels through to the year 2000. The intent of this policy, announced as part of the 1991 Industry Statement, is absolutely clear. The policy reflects the Government's commitment to reducing assistance to the automotive industry, but at a rate that is manageable and sustainable by that industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Plan has provided Australia's motor vehicle and component manufacturers with a clear direction in meeting the challenges of motor vehicle and component manufacture in the 1990's. Under the Plan, motor vehicle and component exports have reached record levels, exceeding $1.2 billion per annum. Confidence in the industry's future is reflected in recent decisions to upgrade and extend manufacturing facilities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The possibility of uncertainty in the Plan's legislative mechanism could seriously undermine the benefits achieved to date. The industry has every right to expect that the plan will be maintained as previously announced by the Government. The Government is therefore acting to preserve the integrity of its automotive industry policy by expressly stating that for an importer to benefit under  paragraph 41A(a) of the Act, they must be the owner of a determination under the Export Facilitation Scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Financial Impact Statement</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments will remove a potential liability of the Commonwealth to refund duty paid in respect of motor vehicle importations since 1 January 1991. But for the amendments, the extent of that liability could be in the vicinity of $500 million.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">BOUNTY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1993</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill is an omnibus measure proposing amendments to four bounty Acts. In particular, the Bill proposes amendments to the Bounty (Books) Act 1986 to continue bounty assistance on Australian Book production until 31 December 1997 and to the Bounty (Computers) Act 1984 to introduce a new definition for "research and development" to limit eligibility of that factory cost, as well as to strengthen the ability of the Australian Customs Service to substantiate claims made under the scheme. It also proposes some minor technical amendments to the Bounty and Capitalisation Grants (Textile Yarns) Act 1981 and the Bounty (Machine Tools and Robots) Act 1985.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, I will address the proposed amendments to the Bounty (Books) Act 1986.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Bounties have been paid on the production in Australia of certain books covered by the Florence Agreement since 1969. As a signatory to the Florence Agreement, Australia cannot impose tariffs or other charges on the importation of books of scientific, cultural or educational value. Bounty is paid on the local production of such books in order to assist the Australian printing industry compete with overseas book printers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Amendments proposed in this Bill are the Government's response to the Industry Commission's recommendations contained in its report No. 27 of 15 October 1992 on book production. In that report the Industry Commission commented that productivity improvements in book production appears to have more than offset the effects of the gradual reduction of assistance and that continued reduction of the bounty rate and other assistance is likely to maintain pressure to improve efficiency. The Commission supported the continuation of the orderly reduction in assistance within the general program of tariff reductions announced by the Government in March 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to bounty assistance, the Commission's main recommendations were:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">that rates be reduced in four steps from the current 13.5 per cent to 4.5 per cent by 1997;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">that the present $500 minimum claim amount be replaced by a minimum publisher's production cost per production run of $3700 per title with effect from 1 January 1994; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">that the present arrangements, whereby either the publisher or a printer may claim bounty, remain  unchanged.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has accepted all the Commission's recommendations and this Bill implements those recommendations in relation to bounty assistance by extending the life of the bounty to 31 December 1997 and annually phasing down bounty rates from the current 13.5 per cent to 4.5 percent by January 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also proposes to extend bounty eligibility to directories other than Australian telephone directories and time tables on the condition that they contain less than 30% advertising and to specifically exclude company prospectuses from bounty eligibility as they are in a similar class of publications to annual reports and shareholders reports, which are already excluded as they are unlikely to be printed offshore because of time restraints.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I will now address the amendments proposed to the Bounty (Computers) Act 1984.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The computer bounty is an important element of the Government's policy for the computer industry, which for bounty purposes includes manufacturers of modems, multiplexers, microprocessors, computer sub-assemblies, electronic microcircuits and, since July 1991, printed circuit boards.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The decision in 1990 to continue the computer bounty scheme, which resulted in the extension of the scheme until 31 December 1995, reflects a commitment by this Government, and indeed this parliament, to encouraging increased development and use of computer equipment and microprocessor technology.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1992/93, the computer bounty program provided about $75 million of direct assistance to 927 registered manufacturing premises. The program is expected to provide $78 million to industry in 1993/94 and slightly lower levels in forward years with the adoption of the legislative changes proposed in this bill. On current trends, without either legislative or administrative changes, the budget outlays for this program are expected to be in the order of $88 million in 1993/94.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments in particular introduce a definition of "research and development" to clarify and limit the eligible expenditure which might be included under this phrase.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This proposed definition, together with the proposed amendment to the method of calculating value added by a manufacturer in section 6 of the Act, expressly requires that in order for expenditure on research and development to qualify for inclusion in a manufacturer's bountiable factory costs, the research and development must be likely to result in the manufacture of bountiable equipment  within the bounty period; that is, by 31 December 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are two other substantive amendments to the Bounty (Computers) Act contained in this Bill which are explained in greater detail in the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. One is designed to strengthen the ability under the Act to substantiate claims (clause 10 of the bill), by requiring bounty recipients to keep records and accounts which are relevant to claims for several years, in line with provisions in other bounty Acts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The other introduces an administrative reform to allow interstate manufacturing operations to lodge consolidated claims across state and territory borders thereby reducing administrative effort and costs for some claimants.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">FINANCIAL IMPACT STATEMENT</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The measures contained in this Bill which extend the operation of the Bounty (Books) Act 1986 until 31 December 1997 are expected to result in additional bounty payments as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">$10.2m in financial year 1993-94 (commencing 1 Jan 1994),</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">$5.4m in financial year 1997-98 (finishing on 31 Dec. 1997).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The measures contained in this Bill relating to the Bounty (Computers) Act 1986 which tighten the eligible bountiable costs definitions, and which strengthen the ability of the administrators of the scheme to substantiate claims made under it, are expected to result in Budget savings in 1992-93 dollars as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">$2.8m in financial year 1993-94, (commencing 1 Nov. 1993)</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rules of Origin</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendments to the rules of origin effected by Clause 10 of the Bill are a response to the Government's agreement to the outcome of the 1992 review of the Australia New Zealand Closer Economic  Relations  Trade Agreement (ANZCERTA). The proposed amendments also extend the administrative and technical aspects of that agreement to other preference arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Rules of origin are those rules which previously appeared in section 151 of the Customs Act 1901 (the Act), to determine whether particular goods imported into Australia are eligible for entry at preferential rates of duty.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 10 of the Bill inserts a new Division 1A of Part VIII into the Act to provide a better defined and more  predictable basis for calculating the origin of goods. The concept of "factory or works" cost of goods as calculated in accordance with rules set out in Gazette notices issued by the Comptroller, has been replaced by specific provisions contained in the Act (new sections 153C&mdash;153G refer). Furthermore, the Bill includes diagrams and explanatory notes in a new Schedule inserted in the Act as a means of illustrating the operation of the rules of origin in their application to New Zealand.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to New Zealand, it should be noted that there is some modification of the rules of origin in certain circumstances. New section 153K of the Act implements the agreement between Australia and New Zealand to allow a two percent margin of tolerance in meeting the usual fifty percent area content requirement, where an unforeseen circumstance (such as an adverse movement in exchange rates) would otherwise result in a shipment failing to qualify for preference. The amendment is intended to assist manufacturers in such unforeseen circumstances, whilst ensuring that the preferential trade benefits of ANZCERTA are not diverted away from Australian and New Zealand manufacturers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other amendments peculiar to New Zealand modify the treatment of materials of mixed origin to allow the area content of such materials to contribute to the area content of the final product in circumstances where otherwise they would not.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments will make the rules of origin more objective in their application and should overcome weaknesses in the previous provisions which had enabled some claimants for preference to circumvent the spirit of the rules.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Timor Gap</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments contained in Clause 5 of the Bill are a response to concerns that the Customs barrier controls (reporting of cargo, passengers and crew) don't presently cover the movement of persons and goods to and from Area A of the Zone of Cooperation (being that area in the Timor Sea in respect of which Australia and Indonesia have agreed to cooperate in the exploration for and exploitation of any petroleum resources). The proposed amendments to the current definition of "place outside Australia" therefore extend Customs barrier controls over movements to and from Area A of the Zone of Cooperation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Anti-Dumping Amendments</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has decided that section 28 of the Anti-Dumping Authority Act 1988 should be amended to allow the Authority to await the Minister's decisions on the recommendations contained in its reports before releasing those reports to the public. Earlier release could encourage parties to cooperate less than fully in  the public inquiry held by the Authority, reserving some arguments to put to the Minister once they knew what recommendations had been made by the Authority. Were this to occur, considerations of natural justice could mean that the Minister would have to seek the view of other parties on these arguments, leading in  effect to a second inquiry being undertaken personally by the Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendment in clause 23 of the Bill allows the Authority to delay the release of its reports until after the Minister has made a decision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Undeclared Possessions of Ship's Crew</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From an operational point of view, it is desirable for Customs officers to have the ability to require information as to the possessions of ship's crew and for there to be a sanction for not fully declaring those possessions which represents a real deterrent to non-compliance. If there is no penalty for non-compliance, there is no incentive for crew members to ensure they fully report their belongings to Customs and could encourage crew to secrete prohibited or dutiable goods with the intention of smuggling the goods ashore at some later time during the ship's stay in port.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 6 of the Bill proposes an amendment to section 64AA of the Customs Act to specifically include a report of the possessions of the ships crew in the ship's arrival report and create a statutory requirement for full disclosure of all crew belongings. If such belongings are not declared and are subsequently found secreted in a crew member's cabin, they can be regarded as forfeited goods under paragraph 229(1)(e) of the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition to the amendments outlined above, the Bill proposes a number of minor technical amendments which essentially correct cross-references between provisions and citation errors. These amendments are explained in greater detail in the Explanatory Memorandum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Financial Impact Statement</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendments in this Bill have no direct financial implications.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill amends the Migration Reform Act 1992 and other relevant legislation within the immigration portfolio, to defer to 1 September 1994 the introduction of those parts of the Reform Act which were due to come into effect on 1 November 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Migration Reform Act 1992 makes important changes to the Migration Act 1958. It simplifies the legal basis for administration of entry to and stay in Australia. It expands merits review by the Migration Internal Review Office and the Immigration Review Tribunal, establishes the Refugee Review Tribunal, and modifies appeal rights to the courts. It also establishes a detailed code of procedures for the processing of visa applications and reviews and clarifies the procedures in relation to cancellation of visas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government is concerned to ensure the smooth and trouble-free implementation of the Reform Act. Implementation involves far reaching changes to the administration of migration law and to administrative processes. The process of planning for implementation of these changes has been under constant review, and this review has highlighted the complexity of the task. To this end, when assuming office, I ordered a "stocktake" of the processes and laws to be implemented.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is clear that the Reform Act requires fine tuning and this is to be expected in legislation of this nature. At this stage, a number of minor amendments has been identified, predominantly of a technical nature, which still need to be made to the legislation to ensure that it operates smoothly. These further amendments will be introduced in the autumn sittings of the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Substantial drafting of subordinate legislation and consequential amendments to related legislation is necessary. Procedural instructions must be prepared. Major and complex changes are necessary to the computer systems and databases used to administer the migration program. Very significant training of migration officers is required, and a major information program to enable my Department's clients to understand the changes which will occur is essential.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In these circumstances, the government considers it preferable to defer the introduction of the Reform Act until all these issues can be adequately addressed. Deferment will ensure that the implementation of these complex and important changes will be smooth and trouble-free.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill also provides that the provisions of the Migration Act 1958 relating to the detention of unauthorised boat arrivals continue to apply to persons who arrive up until 1 September 1994. The existing provisions cover the detention of such persons who arrive up until 1 November 1993. Extension of this date will mean that arrivals between 1 November 1993 and the new commencement date of the Reform Act will come under the same detention provisions as those which apply at present.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The issue of detention of boat arrivals is being examined by the Joint Standing Committee on Migration and it would be pre-emptive to change the existing arrangements prior to consideration by the government of the Committee's report, due in December 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The establishment of the Refugee Review Tribunal will not be affected by deferral of the implementation of the major provisions of the Reform Act. The Tribunal commenced operation as originally planned on 1 July 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill introduces amendments which will put beyond doubt the power of the Refugee Review Tribunal to consider refugee status review applications made before 1 July 1993 to the former Refugee Status Review Committee and not considered by the Committee at that date.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These applications constitute a caseload of some 5,500 review applications and are considered as a priority. The provisions made by this Bill facilitate a smooth transfer of this caseload to the Refugee Review Tribunal and ensure that the Tribunal can get on with the work of clearing it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The provisions of this Bill will not impact on the costs of administering the migration program.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is rare in this place that we get enough time to speak in depth about the matters one wants to speak about. This is certainly one such occasion. I am very aware that the estimates committees were to have met an hour or so ago and I will not delay them for much longer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to refer to a matter that has been reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> this morning and which has been known to me for some considerable time. Now is the time to say something about it and to ask the RAAF what it is going to do for what it has done to Wing Commander Chris Kenyon. The article tells the story of the fact that Wing Commander Kenyon uncovered, in the course of his employment, a shortfall of $1.7 million in relation to funding. Being in charge of the section at the time, he set about trying to find out the story in relation to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has gone on since then is nothing short of shameful and needs to be explained by the RAAF. There has been a systematic persecution of Wing Commander Kenyon. He did not go to the papers, he did not publish it; he raised it in the proper way within the air force&mdash;I really am truncating this matter. Since then the air force has pursued a vendetta&mdash;the word used in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> this morning&mdash;against him, culminating in its preferring 49 counts of misconduct against him, mostly trumped up and none of them of any substance. Of the 49 counts, 48 were ruled out with no case to answer. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise on a point of order, Mr Acting Deputy President. I am not trying to stop Senator Reid at all but a lot of these matters will be heard in the civil court on 2 September. I know that this will not stop her raising the matter but I am sure she will be careful that she does not prejudice those civil proceedings.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VI4">Senator REID</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The proceedings indicate that he was found not guilty on that one charge. It is my view that someone or some group of people within the air force has a case to answer for the devastating persecution that has taken place against an officer once described as a brilliant officer, and a man who has had a good career in the air force. I wonder where the incompetence or the dishonesty really lies. It is a large amount of money and the reaction to it of those who have been involved would certainly indicate that they have been concerned about it. It would indicate to me that they have been attempting to get this man to leave the air force. They have been pursuing him in a number of ways, which perhaps will in the future come out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that in the estimates committees tonight the RAAF or the appropriate people will be able to explain exactly how much money has been spent on this already, and give an account of what they have been doing in attempting to drive this man out of the air force. It is certainly the time and the appropriate place for them to do it. I hesitate to think what the cost has been to taxpayers of what has gone on over the last few years. It is stated also in the newspaper that the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Senator Faulkner, is understood to be seriously concerned about the case and awaiting further correspondence. I can understand that he would be seriously concerned about what has gone on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tragedy of a case such as this is that those who have been involved in the matters I have referred to very likely feel that they have something to cover up and they have to try to save face, no matter the harm they do to another human being and another family in the process. I think there is a great deal that needs to be explained. I certainly know the sorts of things that I think need to be done and the explanations that need to be given. I know of a number of cases in the Public Service where people have come across something that they regard as seriously wrong. What happens? They are persecuted and hounded. I know of former public servants now out of the Public Service on matters such as this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Newman today gave notice of a motion about setting up an inquiry into what is referred to as whistleblower legislation and whistleblower issues. This is one such issue. People who read these articles scarcely fully understand the devastation to the person involved who, in the course of his employment and pursuing his job, uncovers something that he believes needs to be looked into and for his trouble suffers, as has happened in this case. I have more papers and more information. But as I said, the estimates committees need to meet today and I am sure that we will get other opportunities to discuss this issue. </PARA>

Senator Reid's expectation that she will get an answer to every question that she has raised will not be done at the estimates committee tonight. No doubt the matter probably can be pursued at greater length in the committee dealing with supplementary estimates. I have tried to give Senator Reid the hint that civil charges have been preferred and that the case will be considered in a Melbourne court on 2 September. I will not do anything to prejudice that person's case tonight or at any other time in this chamber.

Therefore, it is a matter of great concern that when it came to a major meeting at which the government was really forced to back down, apparently the issue of the wine tax was not pushed with any vigour, and indeed I do not know whether it was raised. That is the message which has come through to me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is my strong view that the government is in the process of desperately rewriting this budget. It is important that those Labor backbenchers in the winegrowing areas add their voices to the Liberal Party, the National Party and the Australian Democrats and vigorously and publicly oppose this tax. I believe there is no doubt that the mere sign that two or three of them were prepared to cross the floor on this issue would, given the current state of the government, lead to the overturning of this pernicious tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put it to the Senate and to those Labor backbenchers that it is simply no good pretending they are opposed to this tax and trying to win a few brownie points back in their electorate when they do not even raise it in the key caucus meeting where tax changes are being discussed. Even worse, the Mr Cleelands and Mrs Silvia Smiths of this world are still failing to stand up and indicate to their electorates that if the government proceeds with this tax, they will cross the floor. That is now the challenge that is before them to test their real sincerity on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have pointed out in this chamber before, these Labor backbenchers have a clear mandate from their electorates not to increase taxes such as the fuel tax or the wine tax. They are now being put to the test to see whether they, like their Prime Minister, hold their promises to their electorates so lightly. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMullan</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Reserve Bank has supplied the following information in answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) An internal Reserve Bank memorandum of 23 August 1990 listed these exposures of SBSA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The memorandum indicated that the Reserve Bank had been advised by SBSA that its group charge for bad and doubtful debts had risen from $71 million in the year to June 1989 to $218 million in the year to June 1990.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Yes; although the words the `parlous state of SBSA's portfolio' referred not to the Reserve Bank's opinion, but to market rumours which were beginning to surface about SBSA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) This question was answered fully in response to an earlier inquiry by Senator Hill. In essence, Reserve Bank officers began to believe around August 1990 that SBSA could record a possible loss for 1990/91, but the expectation was not for a loss anywhere near as large as the figure which subsequently emerged. It was not until January 1991, when SBSA's December half-yearly accounts were being compiled, that the likelihood of a very large loss became apparent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) No; the Reserve Bank Board met on 4 September 1990, 2 October 1990, 6 November 1990 and 4 December 1990.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) (a) The Reserve Bank Board was not aware of the 23 August paper. Senator Hill's reference to the Governor's comments on this paper is incomplete. The Governor minuted the need to pursue the issues raised in the paper at the Reserve Bank's 29 August 1990 consultation with SBSA, and said that, if after that meeting the Bank was not confident SBSA's management/Board was on top of its problems, "possible corrective action" would need to be considered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) The Reserve Bank Board was kept informed regularly of SBSA's financial results, including at its meeting on 4 September 1990. The Board was briefed on discussions with SBSA at its 4 December 1990 meeting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At its 5 February 1991 meeting, the Board was briefed on the large losses in SBSA which had emerged during January, and which were subsequently announced publicly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) See answers to question (6). The Board did not consult with the Federal Government about SBSA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(8) The Secretary to the Treasury was not aware of the Reserve Bank position paper of August 1990 nor of the extent of the financial difficulties of the SBSA. The Secretary was kept informed of SBSA's financial results by virtue of his membership of the Reserve Bank Board.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(9) The Secretary to the Treasury and the South Australian Under Treasurer had an informal discussion in early December 1990 regarding the State Bank. The purpose of this discussion was to ensure that the Under Treasurer was aware that the Reserve Bank had been having discussions with the State Bank of South Australia and that the Governor of the Reserve Bank was proposing to meet with the Chairman of the Bank.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(10) The figure of $5.5 billion represents the combined losses of Tricontinental and SBSA after additional provisions were raised to cover a deterioration in asset quality. The ultimate cost to South Australian and Victorian taxpayers will not be known until actions for recovery of possible loan losses have been concluded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(11) The Treasurer has not sought a full report from the Reserve Bank on these matters. The Reserve Bank did not have the legal power to compel either State Bank to comply with its prudential standards, over the relevant period. Under the Constitution State banking cannot be covered by the Banking Act 1959, unless the relevant State Government refers its banking powers in relation to its bank to the Commonwealth. The Treasurer does not intend to seek such a report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(12) These matters have been investigated by other bodies and a further report would add little. In this context, Volume VII of the Report of the Auditor-General on an Investigation into the State Bank of South Australia noted that:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"the State Bank actively resisted the Reserve Bank's prudential guidelines or advice", (p15-178);</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"Hindsight indicates that the consultative arrangements would have been more effective if the Reserve Bank had adopted a more vigorous approach to its relationship with the State Bank, and if the Reserve Bank had done more to compel the State Bank to respond to its concerns. It is not hard, however, to identify why the Reserve Bank did not do so; it did not have the legal power, it underestimated (along with everyone else) the magnitude of the problem, and it received appropriate assurances from senior State Bank managers, and eventually, from the State Bank's external auditors.", (p15-187);</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"The Reserve Bank encouraged and promoted the adoption of sound prudential practices at the State Bank, and did what it could to obtain State Bank undertakings in respect of Reserve Bank prudential guidelines, including using all means of leverage that were available to it.", (p15-187);</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"The fact remains, the Reserve Bank raised most of the important questions, including:</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMullan</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Taxation Laws Amendment Act (No.6) 1992 (Act No.227 of 1992) introduced section 51AL of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 which will tighten the conditions under which an employee can claim a deduction for costs incurred in relation to non-compulsory clothing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clothing worn to protect employees from injury, or their normal clothing from damage, is specifically exempted from the operation of section 51AL. However, protective clothing must still satisfy subsection 51(1) (i.e. the clothing must not be conventional or private in nature) if the costs associated  with  the  clothing  are  to  be deductible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recent Taxation Determination TD 92/157 dealing with heavy duty clothing is based on a 1986 Administrative Appeal Tribunal decision reported as Case T103 86 ATC 1182.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Tribunal in that case determined that jeans, drill trousers and drill shirts were `. . . ordinary conventional clothes which have no peculiar characteristics as protective clothing'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, if the wearing of such clothes is a condition of employment a deduction is still not available to an employee as the Senior Member of the Tribunal also decided that `on the whole of the  evidence I am not satisfied that these garments have a sufficiently distinctive characteristic to take them out of the character of "conventional clothing".'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These types of clothes therefore, fail to provide the necessary protective quality that would allow them to be considered as deductible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This can be contrasted with the wearing of overalls by a mechanic over his/her normal clothes. In these cases, the overalls provide protection for the mechanic's normal clothing from damage in the work environment. In such circumstances the cost of providing and maintaining the overalls is deductible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Clearly the Taxation Determination is not a contradiction of the statements made by Mr Baldwin during the debate on the Taxation Laws Amendment Act (No.6) 1992.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act does not "require" ATSIC (that is, it is not mandatory for ATSIC) to take recovery action in respect of grant monies where there has been non-compliance with grant conditions by a grantee organisation. ATSIC, nevertheless, has set stringent accountability requirements which surpass those in existence prior to the creation of ATSIC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In situations where serious breaches of grant conditions have occurred, ATSIC has ceased funding and issued notices, pursuant to Section 20 of the ATSIC Act, for the recovery of grant funds. This practice has resulted in organisations such as an Aboriginal Legal Service and an Aboriginal Resource Agency, amongst others, being denied further funding. Funding to a number of organisations receiving grants for a range of programs, including the Community Development Employment Projects (CDEP), has ceased as a result of non-compliance with grant conditions. Some of these organisations have since ceased to exist.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Board of Commissioners has maintained a policy which in effect means that organisations that fail to account for their grants satisfactorily may not receive further payments. Payments to organisations that have failed to acquit grants are made in exceptional "life and death" circumstances and only after remedial action has been instigated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ATSIC, in developing its accountability procedures (including Conditions of Grant) has liaised with Government departments delivering grant programs and consulted extensively with the Australian National Audit Office (ANAO), the Office of Evaluation and Audit, the Australian Government Solicitor and the Department of Finance. As a result of this interaction, the Commission has established a framework of grant procedures, including accountability requirements, that are considered at least equal to other government agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ATSIC is a strongly decentralised organisation with most grant decision-making occurring at Regional Office level. It does not keep consolidated records of each and every breach of grant conditions, however minor (such as organisations being a little late in providing a progress report). ATSIC, however, is satisfied that with regular audits of its operations being conducted by the Office of Evaluation and Audit and the Australian National Audit Office strong administrative controls are being exercised.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) One of the conditions of the approval given to Ausfern Pty Ltd in May 1992, under the controlled specimens provision of the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1982, was "initiation of a trial regeneration program". It is far too early to be able to provide any results of this trial program. Ausfern Pty Ltd hired the services of the University of Tasmania's Applied Biology Unit to conduct a five year study on tree fern regeneration, including propagation and tissue culture techniques. The program will trial direct sporing and tube stock replanting as methods of regenerating tree ferns in eucalypt plantations, as well as assessing natural regeneration on existing eucalypt plantation sites.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) There is no conclusive research which shows that natural regeneration is a viable method of achieving sustainability for tree fern harvesting in native forests. Natural regeneration probably would be a viable method if native forests where harvesting occurs, were not being clear-felled for eucalypt plantations. The lack of knowledge of tree fern biology and appropriate regeneration techniques for cleared areas was the reason for imposing the above condition on Ausfern Pty Ltd. Insistence on any one technique without such knowledge would be inadvisable. Regeneration methods must also take account of the possibility of introducing diseases, particularly Phytophthora, which could occur through replanting with tube stock.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question, based on information provided by the Federal Airports Corporation (FAC), is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Yes, whereas under previous financial arrangements with car rental companies, operators either had desk space within a terminal or the right to meet pre-booked customers. Under the FAC's new arrangements, operators can now choose between four options for their commercial arrangements with the Corporation. The arrangements were designed to give operators the flexibility to choose which option best suits their business needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of the implementation process, the FAC had envisaged a review of the fee structure after the new arrangements had been operative for a reasonable period. The FAC considers that review now timely, because of the comments received from various parties on the fee structure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The following comments apply to the fee structure and options currently applicable:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first option is for desk space within a terminal which gives operators access to both pre-booked and walk-up customers. In exchange for this level of access to airport business, operators are required to pay an airport access fee (which is higher than for the other options), a per square metre fee according to the size of the desk space (which goes to the operator of the terminal&mdash;either the FAC, Ansett or Australian) and 5 per cent of airport related turnover. This option is primarily designed for operators with 20 per cent or more of airport car rental business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second option is for the right to meet pre-booked customers within a terminal. In exchange for this level of access, operators are required to pay a lower airport access fee than for option one, </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">either a desk space fee or a designated meeting place fee (which goes to the operator of the terminal) and 7 per cent of airport related turnover. This option is primarily designed for operators with 10-19 per cent market share.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third option is for the same rights as the second option but offers operators a different mix of fixed and variable fees. Under this option, operators pay a lower still airport access fee but a higher 9 per cent of airport related turnover. This option is primarily designed for operators with 0-9 per cent market share.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth option (also known as Alternative A) is for the right to meet pre-booked customers at the airport (but not in a terminal). In exchange for this level of access, operators pay the same airport access fee as in the third option and a flat $5 per contract, regardless of the length of the contract.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The total turnover of car rental business at Hobart Airport in 1991/92 was around $6,300,000. To facilitate this example, assume Option 1 operator has 20 per cent share of this market ($1,260,000), Option 2 operator has 10 per cent share ($630,000), Option 3 operator has a 5 per cent share ($315,000) and Option 4 operator has a 1 per cent ($63,000) share. For the Option 4 operator, it is also necessary to calculate the number of contracts entered into to get its $63,000. On the basis of a $50 a day average car hire cost and an average hire period of 5 days (in other words, the average contract is for $250), the number of contracts entered into is 252. Only Option 1 operator seeks desk space. The average size allocated for desk space is 10 square metres. On this basis, it is possible to calculate some examples of payments to the Corporation.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) On 19 February 1993 the Chairperson of the Australian Broadcasting Authority forwarded a report to the Minister for Transport and Communications on long-term arrangements for the location of the ABA; the report outlined location options for the Minister's consideration; it did not relate to the proposed restructuring of the ABA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) The Chairperson's report did not examine the proposed location of State ABA offices; the future role of these offices was reviewed separately by a joint management/union committee as part of the restructuring process which the ABA had underway; the Chairperson's report of 19 February recommended that the Planning Division of the ABA, currently located in Canberra, be relocated to Sydney over the next two financial years, i.e. the move would be completed by 1 July 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) The ABA intends that reductions in staffing numbers to meet the Government's targets will be largely achieved through voluntary retrenchment of ABA staff.

The number of voluntary redundancies is likely to increase over time but depends on the preferences of individual staff members. There will be no involuntary retrenchments before April  1994, depending on the age of staff and their length of service both of which determine their entitlement to salary maintenance during redeployment for periods laid down in the Australian Public Service Redeployment and Retirement (Redundancy) Award 1987.</PARA>

Of the remainder 85 had key dates set for implementation. There were 12 dates set through the period 1 September 1991 to 1 July 1993. Most of the deadlines were met, but some were late due to special circumstances:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(i) In Recommendation 51 it was required that all applications for new chemical entities should contain draft patient information by 1 January 1992. This date was not met because agreement had not been reached between the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), the pharmaceutical industry and consumer organisations on what should be included as patient information.

This was on the basis of advice by the MRD that the small scale nature of the works, the heavy traffic volumes (over 50,000 vehicles per day), the need to provide ongoing access to commercial properties and complexities of relocating services made it difficult to specify in tender documents the exact nature of the works.
