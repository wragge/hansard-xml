<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">SUBJECT:ENQUIRY FROM THE SENATE STANDING COMMITTEE ON REGULATIONS AND ORDINANCES ABOUT THE APPLICATION FEES SET BY THE SUPERANNUATION FEES REGULATIONS (CSS AND PSS)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Purpose:To explain the basis upon which the level of fee was proposed to you</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Background:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Division 5 of Part IVA of the Superannuation Act 1976 and Part 11 of the Superannuation Act 1990 provide for the reconsideration of decisions made by the CSS and PSS Boards of Trustees respectively. These provisions also allow for the payment of a fee when a person applies for reconsideration of a Board decision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2. When the CSS and PSS review mechanisms were considered by Cabinet it was proposed that a fee should be set to limit vexatious applications and that the level of the fee should be based on the average cost of hearing appeals (a fee of $250 was mooted). It was also proposed that if an adverse decision was reversed by the Trustees, the fee should be refunded.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3. At their meetings held on 8 August 1991 the CSS and PSS Boards of Trustees considered whether fees should be prescribed in the circumstances outlined above. The Boards were advised that it would not be practicable to set a fee on a cost recovery basis as the cost of reconsidering an average invalidity retirement case would be at least $1500 and would prove prohibitive.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4. Both Boards decided, by a majority, that it would be appropriate to set a fee and that the appropriate level would be $150 (this was at that time the same as a reconsideration fee set under legislation administered by the then Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs and half the fee set by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal). The Boards considered it would be appropriate to index the fee for inflation and that the level of fee should be reviewed in 12 months. In addition, the Boards considered that the Regulations should provide for the fee to be refunded where it is decided not to proceed with a reconsideration decision or where the outcome of the reconsideration is to the applicant's advantage.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5. The Superannuation Fees Regulations (CSS and PSS) applied to persons requesting reconsideration of a decision on or after the date of gazettal of the Regulations (20 July 1993). To date the fees have not been reviewed.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Regulations provide for a number of discretions, some of which include criteria to limit and guide the exercise of the discretion.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of the regulations you have identified, rr. 20B, 21(1B) and 21(1C) provide the power to either revoke or suspend a permission in the specified circumstances. I am assured that these matters are covered under the review process outlined in subregulation 22 which includes provisions relating to appeals to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Regulation 20A in addition to allowing the Authority to suspend permissions also allows it to vary or impose additional conditions. The variation or imposition of new conditions is not presently covered by regulation 22. This appears to have been an oversight with this form of words being in the regulations since Statutory Rules 247 of 1987.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Regulation 21(1) provides a new power to vary a permission in circumstances where the permission holder has failed to comply with a condition of the permit. This is not presently a reviewable decision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Regulation 19E introduces a capacity to transfer permits. This was requested by tourist operators. Previously permits were not transferable. The exercise of the discretion under r. 19E is not reviewable under regulation 22.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I intend to have r. 20A, r. 21(1) and r. 19E amended so that they will be reviewable under regulation 22. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Regulation 51B does not give the Authority any discretion, since the amount of the charge payable in any quarter is determined by the regulations. Therefore any overpayment is simply the excess of what has been paid after subtracting the amount of liability. I am advised this is therefore not a matter which should be reviewable under regulation 22. A later amendment to this regulation (Statutory Rules 266 of 1993) allows the Authority to refund the amount of the overpayment directly to the permit holder.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In conclusion some of the discretionary powers which the Committee has identified are not reviewable under the provisions of regulation 22 and I agree that they should be. Where appropriate I intend to amend the regulations so that those discretions identified are properly reviewable.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Minister</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to the Guidelines under s. 18 of the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act 1922, considered by the Committee at its meeting of 30 September 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The instrument does not appear to include any citation or numbering, which may be confusing to users. The Committee would be grateful if any future such instruments could be numbered.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Among other things, the Guidelines provide criteria for deciding whether a sporting or cultural event is of international significance and whether Australia is likely to lose the event. The criteria generally appear appropriate, apart from the final criterion in each case, which is "any other information that the Minister believes is relevant". The Committee asks why it was necessary to include such a broad and subjective criterion, following specific and detailed criteria.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CANBERRA  ACT  2600</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator Colston</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you for your letter of 30 September 1993 concerning the Guidelines under section 18 of the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act 1992 (the Act). I apologise for the delay in responding to you.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Relevant sections of the Act</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 18(2) of the Act provides that I may specify a sporting or cultural event held, or to be held, in Australia if, and only if, I am satisfied, having regard to the guidelines in force under subsection 18(5) of the Act that:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the event is of international significance; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">failure to specify the event would be likely to result in the event not being held in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Purpose of the Guidelines</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of the Guidelines is, therefore, to ensure that I take into account factors relevant to determining whether an event qualifies for an exemption under section 18(2) of the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Current Guidelines</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the current Guidelines, there are six factors which I consider in determining `international significance' (under clause 2) and a further three factors in determining `lost to Australia' (under clause 3).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You have queried the appropriateness of the inclusion of the final factor in clauses 2 and 3 of the Guidelines, which is, "any other information that the Minister believes is relevant".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Act explores new areas of prohibition, that is, the prohibition of most remaining forms of tobacco sponsorship of sporting and cultural events.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the development of this new legislation, a great deal of consideration was given to the types of events to which this part of the Act was intended to apply. I was most concerned to ensure that the Guidelines were as clear and unambiguous as possible. In particular I wished to ensure that applicants fully appreciated the key factors against which my decision would be made.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I was concerned that, despite this consideration, it would not be possible to foresee:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the variety of events for which specification would be sought under Section 18(2); and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">therefore, all of the factors that should legitimately be considered as relevant in determining applications under this section.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The clauses you have questioned were, therefore, included to enable me to consider relevant factors which could not be addressed against any of the other criteria. The clauses have, to-date, proved appropriate. Following are some specific examples of factors which I considered to be directly relevant and which had not come to my attention during the development of the guidelines;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to the Fosters Australian Formula One Grand Prix the applicant advised that FISA (the international organising body) cancelled the French Grand Prix when the French Government refused to allow teams, sponsored by tobacco companies, to display tobacco adverting. This was directly relevant to determining whether the event was likely to be lost to Australia without a specification.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to the Australian Motor Cycle Grand Prix the applicant advised that it was a term of the promoter's contract that the organising body had the right to terminate the contract if any legislation prejudiced the event. The applicant further advised that failure to specify the event would result in triggering this right. This was directly relevant to determining whether the event would be lost to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Inclusion of the clause "any other information that the Minister believes is relevant", therefore, gives applicants the opportunity to submit:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">information specific to an event, which is relevant in assisting me to understand the nature of that particular event.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The examples I have included are not an exhaustive list of relevant factors which are not specifically reflected in the current Guidelines. This is because the legislation has been operative for less than 6 months and I am continuing to receive applications and hence learn about the cross-section of international events of significance to which this Section has application.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whilst the clause "any other information that the Minister believes is relevant" is useful at this time, I believe that it may be possible, with experience, to produce Guidelines which specifically detail all factors relevant to my decision making process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I undertake to review the Guidelines particularly the general provisions at Clause 2(f) and 3(c), in a little over 7 months. At that time, the Guidelines will have been operational for 12 months and the majority of events for which an exemption is necessary, will have been considered.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I will also ensure that future instruments of this type include a citation or number by which the instrument can be identified. I apologise that this was not included for the current Guidelines.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, should your Committee secretariat require additional information or clarification of points raised in this letter, Mr Tony Kingdon, Assistant Secretary, Drugs of Dependence Branch, of my Department would be pleased to assist you. Mr Kingdon can be contacted on telephone 289 7025.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Minister</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to the following five instruments under the National Health Act 1953, viz, Formulations of Principles under ss. 52B(1), 58A, 58C(l)(a), 58C(l)(b) and 58CD of the National Health Act 1953, considered by the Committee at its meeting of 30 September 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The instruments did not appear to be provided with a system of numbering or citation, which may be confusing to users. The Committee would be grateful if future such instruments could be numbered.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Also, the instrument under s. 58CD provides for $27,513, "or such larger amount as determined by the Minister from time to time". The Committee asks whether such apparent sub-delegation is a valid exercise of the s. 58CD power. It may be worthwhile obtaining advice on this from the Attorney-General's Department.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you for your letter of 30 September 1993, addressed to Senator the Hon Graham Richardson, concerning the formulation of Principles under the National Health Act 1953 (NHA). Your letter was referred to me as the matters raised are within my portfolio responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Principles were not numbered in this case as it was felt that reference to the Section or Sub-section of the NHA was sufficient. However, your suggestion of numbering the Principles to reduce confusion for users is noted and future Principles will be numbered.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You also raised the concern of the use of the term ". . . .. or such larger amount as determined by the Minister from time to time". The phrase was inserted to provide the Minister responsible for the provision of additional recurrent funding for upgrading of nursing homes the power to determine rates of subsidy consistent with movements in costs and is used only for that purpose. However, given the concerns you raise, I am prepared to amend the Principles to remove the possibility of sub-delegation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, I should point out that the whole of the Commonwealth legislation on aged care is currently being reviewed by the Australian Law Reform Commission. The Commission will be specifically looking at the role played by subordinate legislation, the issue of sub-delegation and the issue of appeal provisions on funding decisions where resources are limited.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have pleasure in presenting the report of the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training on aspects of the Industrial Relations Amendment Bill 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This report addresses some key themes of the Government's proposed reforms as provided for in that Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the short time available for its inquiry into aspects of the Bill, the Committee has considered a substantial volume of both written and oral evidence from a representative range of interested parties. The report is not a close analysis of the technical detail of the Bill, but rather an assessment of the main features of the proposed reforms.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is clear to the Committee that the need for industrial relations reform is a pressing one. It is equally clear that the system of enterprise bargaining which the Government wishes to encourage with this Bill is one which provides both optimal flexibility and adequate protection.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am confident that the reforms proposed in this Bill will serve Australia well as the basis for an industrial relations system that is open to all. The legislation also serves to ensure that the standards operating in Australian workplaces are commensurate with those required of Australia by international treaty.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Time did not permit us to make a comprehensive response to the Bill, but the report indicates the Committee's support for the broad thrust of the legislative reforms. There are some particular aspects of the Bill which the Committee has chosen to draw to the attention of the Government. These are matters which emerged during the course of the inquiry, and the Committee hopes that they will prove a useful contribution to the general debate. The report contains a dissent from Senators Crane and Chapman.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee wishes to thank all those who gave evidence to the Committee, and in particular, the Department of Industrial Relations whose cooperation and frequent appearances at public hearings were of substantial assistance to the Committee.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak to this motion to take note of the report of the inquiry of the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training into the Industrial Relations Bill 1993 in view of the fact that Senator Chapman and I, the Liberal members of the committee, have put in a dissenting report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We say in that dissenting report that, looking at the evidence given to the committee, the lack of consultation on and understanding of this bill, the rigidity and complexity of it&mdash;and for a whole range of other reasons which I will deal with in a moment&mdash;the minister should withdraw the bill, consult properly with everybody involved in industrial relations, and come back with legislation which reflects the speech of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to the Institute of Directors on 21 April 1993. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Let me describe the model of industrial relations we are working towards . . . It is a model under which compulsorily arbitrated awards and arbitrated wage increases would be there only as a safety net . . . Over time the safety net would inevitably become simpler. We would have fewer awards, with fewer clauses.</PARA>
<PARA>An examination of this bill shows that the exact opposite has happened. That process of destruction started the very next day when, on ABC <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daybreak</EMPHASIS>, the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, of course, what the Prime Minister said, yesterday, was that the next four months are going to be exclusively devoted to widespread consultation with the union movement. And John (Halfpenny) and all of his colleagues will have ample opportunity, over the coming weeks and months, to make all of the points that they wish to in developing the Government's policy package. I would hope to go to the Cabinet by August of this year, with a full range of the views of the trade union movement . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The only thing about that statement that is not accurate is that we are dealing with the matter now and I understand that we will get the bill this afternoon or tomorrow morning. So the minister is just a couple of months late. He has carried out all those promises and we have legislation which will not enhance flexibility or get rid of the rigidity in our current industrial relations system; in fact, it will enhance it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Employers' anger, disappointment and frustration at this bill are best summed up in the key points made by the Australian Wool Selling Brokers. Those key points are that the commitments made to the Australian business community by both the Prime Minister and the Minister for Industrial Relations earlier this year are not reflected in the context of the Industrial Relations Reform Bill 1993; and the processes through which this bill was developed do not reflect the International Labour Organisation's principles on general consultation with the parties affected. The result is a bill which is seen to be unbalanced and which ignores the needs of the Australian business community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The convoluted, complex nature of the bill will do little to assist the implementation of more flexible appropriate labour arrangements in the Australian workplace. The proposed reforms in the non-union sector are such that they will not be utilised and, therefore, will deny 70 per cent of persons employed in the private sector access to determining their working conditions. The bill encourages industrial action by unions and their members by condoning its use as a tool to obtain wage improvements. The removal of protections from boycotts will not assist in the creation of business confidence so as to ensure Australia's economic future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Witness after witness, and submission after submission&mdash;with the exception of the ACTU, although even the ACTU was not totally satisfied&mdash;consistently criticised the Industrial Relations Reform Bill 1993. They consistently criticised the government for its approach to consultation. In fact, it would appear that the major part of the consultation&mdash;probably more aptly described as an audience&mdash;took place after the government and the ACTU had set down the principles of the bill. Witnesses were frustrated at the complexity of this bill; the additional power given to the union movement; and the fact that the award system is being made more rigid, and that the number of tests with regard to the establishment of certified agreements has been significantly increased. They highlighted that the no disadvantage test was a real impediment to the development of genuine flexibility in the workplace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They said that enterprise flexibility agreements would not happen because of the necessity for unions either to be involved in the negotiating process, if there are unions in the workplace, or to have the power to vet agreements before the Australian Industrial Relations Commission when they are not present in the workplace. Witnesses could not understand the need for an industrial court because they believed that the industrial division of the Federal Court had the necessary expertise and was independent. Last, but certainly not least, they were angry at the decimation of the boycott provisions of sections 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to bring out a couple of points. The first is the minimum wage provisions as they pertain to the bill and the necessity that they be set by an independent arbitrator or by an arbitration commission. We have the potentially ridiculous situation where the Commonwealth sets its minimum wage at $300, plus various other conditions; Western Australia sets its at $250, plus various other conditions; and Queensland sets its at $200&mdash;$50 less than Western Australia. Because Western Australia's minimum wage is set by the minister on a recommendation from the Industrial Relations Commission, it would not be void under this bill, but Queensland's would be. If anyone on the other side of the chamber can explain the commonsense of that, I would be very interested to hear it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other aspect is that this is not conclusive, even though we were given evidence from the department that the Western Australian position will not stand. The message that we got from this inquiry is that, in terms of industrial relations, the states should be allowed to get on and govern and carry out their mandates. This is what is happening in Western Australia. We have seen the selective use of the external affairs powers, ILO conventions and international conventions. One rule is being applied in some areas but other rules are not being applied as far as freedom of association is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were told about the lack of consultation and the lack of understanding in respect of this legislation. We were also informed that confusion exists in so many people's minds because of the complexity of this matter. Mr Robert Bastian, a representative of COSBOA, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I say over and over again that we do not understand the full ramifications of this bill. Nobody does. That is point one. I stress again that the smaller end of things is where employment is really occurring and where this bill seems, in my view, to land most harshly. Quite frankly, the government is not much further advanced than I am in terms of approaching the back of a TV set with a screwdriver. I just do not think we know what we are playing with here. My strongest counsel would be to say not to ram this thing through in the next couple of weeks, let the debate run for as long as it takes to get a clearer picture.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Bastian spelt out quite clearly the degree of confusion which exists in the community in relation to this legislation. He highlighted, as others have, how unsatisfactory the consultative process has been. These people highlighted very succinctly their views about moving towards enterprise flexibility agreements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The processes that have been put in place with regard to enterprise flexibility agreements will ensure that not many, if any, agreements will get off the ground. One of the concerns raised in relation to enterprise flexibility agreements is that changes have not been made to the no disadvantage test. Evidence was consistently given to us on how the no disadvantage test would interfere with the development of certified agreements. It was put to us, `Why would we bother going through that process when we know full well that any agreement reached with our employees would be overridden when we get to the commission?'. The government must ask itself why it wants to go past just having minimum standards which protect the position of the people involved in the enterprise flexibility agreements. It should also ask itself why it wants to continue to indulge in this no disadvantage test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Representatives of small businesses such as COSBOA&mdash;70 per cent of the people they employ are outside the union system&mdash;asked why they should bother going through a process in which a union had to be involved in the total negotiations if one or more employees were unionists, or the union had to be notified if employees did not belong to a union. It was consistently put to us that if an employer and its employees reached an agreement approved by a secret ballot&mdash;some suggested a 65 per cent agreement and some suggested a 51 per cent agreement&mdash;then that agreement ought to be able to be registered. That to me seems to be a commonsense approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But this government will not do that. Earlier in my speech I quoted what had been said by the minister, Mr Brereton. He made it quite clear who would be running the agenda. Evidence was given to us that the 10 additional tests that have been put in this legislation will make it almost impossible for enterprise flexibility agreements to get off the ground and certified agreements to be expanded. Some of these tests are not very onerous but others are extremely onerous, and they will stand in the way of people moving towards a more flexible wage fixing system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will briefly comment on the removal of sections 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act. We have already had one report on this matter. This proposal highlights the extent to which this government is prepared to allow Australia's exports to be put in jeopardy. The removal of sections 45D and 45E would severely curtail legal action in regard to boycotts of a political nature involving the movement over the wharfs of our live sheep, coal, wheat, wool and meat, and other export products.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposition was put to the committee that the common law could be used. But we were told by departmental officers that if ships were tied up in one, two, three or four ports around the Commonwealth, one would have to take action under common law in each Supreme Court. Practitioners&mdash;the people working on the ground&mdash;explained to the committee that even though there were a lot of complaints about the expense of 45D and 45E actions, common law actions would be of the order of 40 per cent more expensive than the 45D and 45E actions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should make a point about the industrial relations court. The opposition will certainly be moving to amend this part of the legislation. These responsibilities should be left with the industrial division of the Federal Court. The best reasons for the appropriateness of this arrangement were given to us by the Law Council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also worth looking at what Lionel Bowen said in 1978 when the Industrial Court was taken away and the industrial division of the Federal Court was put in place. It is also interesting to note the reasons that Mr Ralph Willis gave in 1988 for the federal government not moving to bring in an industrial court. The reasons Ralph Willis gave at that time are just as valid today as they were then. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude my remarks on this report by repeating that it is disappointing that this government has brought down legislation which in fact gives more power to the unions. This legislation will not `do the trick' in terms of taking the rigidity out of the labour market. It will not bring about the flexibility that this country desperately needs. I have outlined the hostility to this legislation. Honourable senators would have had to be at the committee hearings to see the real frustration, anger and disappointment at the fact that, although the Prime Minister promised so much on 21 April, he and Mr Brereton have delivered so little. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The inquiry in relation to the Industrial Relations Reform Bill 1993 that has been conducted by the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training shows very clearly that never has a government promised so much but delivered so little. The speech of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) following the March election which he delivered to the Institute of Directors on 21 April 1993 heralded a new world, a new era, of industrial relations for Australia. In this new world that was promised by the Prime Minister, awards were to become only a safety net and eventually would fade away. However, as the close examination which has been directed towards this bill by the committee shows, the legislation that was before the committee and which will be shortly before this house does not meet the criteria set down by the Prime Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is another broken promise.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, we all know that Mr Noakes is the epitome of courtesy and respect; therefore, Mr Noakes replied:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would not put it in that way, but certainly expectations were created by the speech of 21 April.</PARA>
<PARA>Certainly, the Prime Minister created expectations of a new era in industrial relations which this bill simply does not deliver. When one considers the balance of the evidence that has been presented to this committee over three very exhausting and detailed days of hearings the only conclusion that one can reach is that that is the correct view&mdash;the legislation does not deliver what the Prime Minister promised and it will not deliver the needed reforms in industrial and employee relations in Australia. We will not get better productivity in our firms. We will not get more competitive firms to build our export markets and thereby overcome the enormous foreign debt under which Australia continues to languish as a result of this particular legislation. That is why, regrettably, Senator Crane and I have found it absolutely necessary to prepare and present a dissenting report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a few minutes I will direct attention to some of the conclusions which were reached by the majority of the committee&mdash;the Labor members of that committee and the Australian Democrat who agreed with their conclusions and general statements. In doing so, I have to say that, while the report presented by the majority members of the committee certainly presents a range of evidence relating to the bill, Senator Crane and I believe that it fails to assess that evidence in a balanced way. The majority report gives undue credence to the submissions and evidence from the ACTU and the Department of Industrial Relations and gives inadequate weighting to the submissions and evidence presented from a wide range of business representatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We certainly cannot support the view of the majority members of the committee that the evidence sustains the conclusions which they have reached. Our objections to those conclusions begin with paragraph 3 of their foreword to the report. The majority members of the committee claim:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the system of enterprise bargaining which the government wishes to encourage with this Bill is one which provides both optimal flexibility and adequate protection.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee is confident that the reforms proposed in this Bill will serve Australia well as the basis for an industrial relations system that is open to all. The legislation also serves to ensure that the standards operating in Australian workplaces are commensurate with those required of Australia by international treaty.</PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph 5 of the foreword also indicates the committee's support for the broad thrust of the legislative reforms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, if one considers the evidence in a balanced way, there is absolutely no way in which that conclusion can be validly reached. We believe that the legislation itself does not provide the opportunity for optimal flexibility and will not begin a system and a structure of industrial relations that will serve Australia well. But it is not only the specifics of the legislation and what it lacks which are important; it is also the perception about the legislation. Time and time again, the employer and business witnesses that came before this committee stated their view that this legislation would not provide the desperately needed flexibility that Australian industrial relations requires, providing the opportunity for the development of enterprise agreements based on enterprise bargaining. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite simply, if that is the belief of those witnesses&mdash;those major parties to industrial agreements and employee relations&mdash;then they will not achieve the opening up of the system that Australia desperately needs, irrespective of whether in detailed argument it might be asserted by the majority members of the committee that the legislation does allow that. The simple fact is that the employers do not believe that it does. There are some 16 tests now required, for example, to achieve certified agreements&mdash;16 hurdles that have to be jumped before those certified agreements can be achieved. They believe that that is simply too difficult to achieve within their enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, that will mean that small businesses in particular will seek to remain outside the industrial relations structure and perhaps not observe the law as is required of them, as we know happens on many occasions already. That is not a healthy situation that ought to be provided by new legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The employers were particularly concerned that under this legislation enterprise agreements would continue to be nothing more than over-award payments. Again, the majority of the committee rejected this view of the employers, but all of the evidence that has been presented to us and the perceptions of the employers suggest that this is the case. Again, it would appear that in reality that is the way the system will operate&mdash;that enterprise flexibility agreements and certified agreements will simply become another name for over-award arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was also great concern on the part of employers about the legislation requiring the obligatory participation of trade unions in the development of certified agreements and enterprise flexibility agreements. Nevertheless, the majority of the committee accepted that obligatory participation. Senator Crane and I cannot accept that obligatory participation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Concern was also expressed by a number of witnesses, including employers and state government representatives, about the capacity of this legislation to override state legislation and the likelihood that it would do so. Again, the majority report, in effect, approves this overriding circumstance. The committee debated this. The federal government was recently re-elected to government in March. Therefore, it might like to claim a mandate for this legislation. However, an examination of the last election campaign shows that absolutely no forewarning was given by the present government of the type of legislation that it proposed with respect to industrial relations reform. As I have already said, immediately after the election the Prime Minister made certain promises which have not been fulfilled in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only reference to industrial relations in the last federal election campaign was the lies and the misrepresentation that we continually heard from the federal Labor government about the proposals in the coalition's industrial relations policy. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from the concern that I have already expressed about the federal government intruding into state jurisdictions contrary to a mandate which a recently elected state government might have, there is also great concern about the intrusion which the federal government is achieving by using the foreign affairs power and, therefore, by implementing through this legislation ILO conventions and recommendations.

They are just some of the objections that we have to the report agreed by the majority of the committee. That is why Senator Crane and I have produced, in a very detailed way, a substantial minority report. Among the conclusions of that minority report we highlight the anger, disappointment and frustration which a number of witnesses have expressed about this bill and to which my colleague Senator Crane referred in his earlier remarks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a number of specific recommendations in relation to the legislation which we believe are based on a balanced consideration of the evidence presented to the committee in its hearings. Of course, our major overarching recommendation is that this bill ought to be withdrawn and the government ought to enter into fair dinkum consultation with all of the parties to industrial and employee relations&mdash;employers, in the form of small and large businesses, as well as the ACTU and others who have an interest in this field&mdash;to achieve legislation and a system of industrial relations which will provide for the productivity gains that this country desperately needs to reduce the excessive levels of unemployment and the massive foreign debt that we have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only way we will achieve a reduction in foreign debt and an increase in the number of jobs is by increasing our export earnings and, of course, as a consequence of that, being more successful at import replacement. This legislation will do absolutely nothing for productivity and competitiveness on the part of Australian business to ensure that that occurs. So that is the overarching conclusion that has to be drawn from a balanced assessment of the evidence that was presented to our committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also want to see clause 6 of the bill deleted to ensure that sections 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act remain there. Despite what the government claims, a number of witnesses provided specific evidence that under the proposed changes whereby sections 45D and 45E will be incorporated in the industrial relations legislation rather than the Trade Practices Act, as is currently the case, they will not have access to that legislation to prevent secondary boycotts, which of course have the potential to do so much damage to businesses in an unjustified way. That clause ought to be repealed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also recommend that all provisions for discrimination on the basis of membership or non-membership of a trade union be removed from both the existing act and this bill. This legislation provides for a ban on a number of areas of discrimination. We cannot discriminate on the basis of age, on the basis of sex or on the basis of a whole range of other criteria, but we can still discriminate on the basis of membership or otherwise of an industrial organisation&mdash;a trade union. Of course, that is entirely unreasonable and it ought to be removed from the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We express our opposition to the use of the external affairs power, which I have already mentioned in dealing with the recommendations of the majority report. We also recommend that the procedures for striking enterprise flexibility agreements should be modified, firstly, to remove any requirement that a dispute exists. Of course, this is a complete nonsense. Under the legislation, employers cannot get together with their employees and say, `Let's reach a deal that is suitable for our business. Let's reach an enterprise agreement between me, the employer, and you, the employees. Let's do this all voluntarily'. No, they have to prove that there is an industrial dispute&mdash;whether that is a real dispute or a manufactured paper dispute&mdash;between the employer and the employee before they can even get to that stage. The government claims that this legislation will introduce greater flexibility, yet all it does is tie us back to the old, outmoded 19th century structure of industrial relations where before we can get any new arrangements in place we have to have an industrial dispute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to enterprise flexibility agreements&mdash;and I referred to this when dealing with the majority report&mdash;we also reject the automatic right of a trade union to participate in that approval process whether the employees of the enterprise want the union involved or not. It ought to be the right of those employees to decide whether they want a trade union to represent them in negotiations, or whether they believe they can undertake the negotiations themselves, or whether they want to hire someone else to undertake the negotiations on their behalf. That is a significant shortcoming in the legislation which ought to be amended. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also recommend that part 7 and part 9 of the legislation be removed. Part 7 deals with the establishment of an industrial relations court. We believe that is entirely unnecessary. The existing industrial division of the Federal Court is quite capable of dealing with legal matters in relation to industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are also concerned with regard to the effect of the legislation on the National Labour Consultative Council, and in particular the reduction of the representation of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry from six representatives on the existing National Labour Consultative Council to but one representative on the restructured council under this legislation. It is obviously a payback to the Chamber of Commerce and Industry for the support that it gave for the coalition's industrial relations policies at the last election. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Aviation Fuel Revenues (Special Appropriation) Amendment Bill 1993 amends the Aviation Fuel Revenues (Special Appropriation) Act 1988 to enable duty on aviation kerosene, avtur, to be appropriated to the Civil Aviation Authority. At present, the act enables the assessment only of aviation gasoline, avgas, with duty. The appropriation of duties paid on avtur, along with the increase in duty paid on avgas to the CAA, is part of the government's aviation cost recovery agenda for safety regulation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question of who should fund the cost of safety regulation, the government or the industry, has been quite a controversial one. The argument for government funding of air safety regulation rests on the belief that it is the government's responsibility to provide safety for the public from an industry which operates in public airspace. The argument in favour of industry funding rests on the belief that, if it were not for the existence of the industry, there would not be any need for safety regulations and that, therefore, these regulations should be the industry's responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is certainly a case for considerable general revenue funding of aviation safety. The need for prevention of accidents which might occur in the airspace&mdash;in which debris might fall on people's houses or property or on people themselves, and these people may have no connection at all with the aviation industry&mdash;certainly makes it a matter for general funding rather than industry specific funding. I guess it is a question of degree. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, search and rescue operations, which have cost an enormous amount of money and which are paid for out of the general purse, need to be taken into account. Any accidents we can prevent, of course, would prevent spending of general funds on those search and rescue operations. I highlight the information that I was given at the estimates committee that the search and rescue operations arising out of the recent tragedy of the aircraft which was lost in the Blue Mountains last month entailed a cost of $599,000 for the hire of the search aircraft alone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the establishment of the CAA, the government's position on aviation safety funding has reflected the controversy about who should pay, shifting back and forth between government funding and industry funding, to the most recent position of 50 per cent joint funding. At the time the CAA was established, the government agreed to fully fund aviation safety. This position changed in the 1991 budget when it was announced that there would be full cost recovery from the aviation industry for aviation safety regulation, to be phased in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 1992-93 budget, however, after intense lobbying by the industry, the government changed its position again when it agreed to meet 50 per cent of safety costs to a limit of $22.8 million. This arrangement is to be phased in over a two-year period starting on 1 July. Discussions thus far with regard to this newest government safety regulation agenda have consisted primarily of the CAA proposal for some sort of licensing fee system. This proposal, when announced, failed to gain the support of the industry and the matter has therefore been placed under yet another review to determine what should be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While this review continues, the government has gone ahead with three interim measures which are consistent with the 1992-93 proposal to phase in cost recovery from the industry. The first of these measures is a fee to be imposed upon the international operations of Australian aircraft. This fee is to be collected directly by the CAA and the fee is being imposed because fuel used by Australian airlines on international services is exempt from the duty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second measure has been to increase the duty paid on avgas by 0.264c per litre. This increase in duty will raise about $250,000 for the year 1993-94 and is to be collected by the Commonwealth and appropriated to the Civil Aviation Authority. Prior to this increase, the government collected 22.735c per litre from avgas users which was appropriated to the CAA. It is estimated that for 1993-94, $21.8 million will be gained. This duty is not for safety regulation alone, but is for the normal services provided to avgas users by the CAA. Although the duty on avgas has increased to 22.999c per litre, only 0.264c per litre of this will be used for safety regulation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final measure has been to restart the collection of a duty on avtur of 0.264c per litre. This duty is expected to raise $3.35 million for the year and will also be collected by the Commonwealth and appropriated to the CAA. The collection of this duty on avtur was stopped in July 1988. Unlike the other two measures, this measure is not provided for by existing legislation, hence the need for this bill. The purpose of this bill is to allow for the appropriation of avtur duty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has stated that the three measures together will reduce the government's outlays by around $4.5 million. There is some suggestion that this estimate is an incorrect guess and an overstatement for a couple of reasons, one of which is that there is really no correct estimate of the amount which will be raised from the avtur duty because the charge has not been in existence since it was last abolished in 1988. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The financial consequences of this bill represent a definite move towards recovering some of the cost of aviation safety regulation from the aviation industry. The importance of this bill is that it represents a move towards yet another government position for funding aviation safety regulations. My concern is that, in the process, aviation safety will be compromised. I urge caution on just how much funding should be recovered from the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am worried that the government's constantly changing position on aviation safety funding will result in a reduction in safety funding, closely followed by a reduction in safety standards. Too often we see this Labor government skip from one unresearched policy to another without studying the effects of these policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because general aviation in Australia has had such a difficult last few years&mdash;with 14 per cent and 16 per cent per annum declines respectively in activity&mdash;it is necessary for the government to be very careful when implementing policies which affect the industry's pocket. The government must remember that safety and economic stability go hand in hand in the aviation industry and any policy which has the potential to jeopardise the balance between these two must be watched very closely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since I raised in the Senate estimates committees the recent crash of the Piper aircraft of Monarch Airlines at Young on 11 June this year, I have had many approaches from people in the industry who have told me that that particular aircraft never should have been flying.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My concerns in relation to the CAA's administration of air safety were heightened when I learned that last Wednesday week an Eastern Airlines aircraft operating out of Tamworth was told&mdash;at about 6,000 feet out of Tamworth&mdash;to reduce speed. The air crew retarded the power levers to reduce speed. When the power levers were retarded, the ground spoilers activated. These are lift up devices on the top of wings that destroy the ability of the wings to produce lift. They are designed to operate only with aircraft on the ground to provide assistance to the brakes. The aircraft then suffered considerable loss of altitude at a rapid rate and the air speed decreased by 100 knots. Fortunately, recovery was achieved by the air crew. But had this malfunction occurred during a landing approach phase, the outcome could have been quite disastrous, as could have been the case had the aircraft been in a holding pattern over Sydney at the time when, with that sudden drop, it could have fallen on other aircraft in the holding pattern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that the incident occurred as a result of faulty maintenance due to replacement of torque links on the main undercarriage assemblies at the Tamworth maintenance facility of Eastern Airlines. How could such a potentially serious incident occur? I believe this to be yet further evidence of a growing picture of declining standards of air safety in Australia. The root cause in this particular case was the lack of maintenance control. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since I have become involved in this matter through many approaches prior to the estimates committee, the number of people who approach me with real concerns about air safety in Australia are growing. The minister does nothing to assist. The minister was a failure as Leader of the Opposition in the Northern Territory. He failed in waterfront reform. He was an absolute joke&mdash;a complete and abject failure&mdash;on pay TV matters. In regard to the tax control system, which he was not quite involved with, he said subsequently that he would not have let the investigation go ahead. He is an abject failure, and that is because he cannot listen. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I was saying, while it is not Senator Collins's fault per se, his trouble is that when people come to him and say, `These are the problems with airline safety regulations.

He knows everything about everything; he is the ultimate know-all. He then goes on and tells us about his wife and his children. It happens every time in estimates committees. That is what happens to people who come to him with concerns about safety regulations. </PARA>

But all the minister does is say, `Yes, I understand. This is my experience. This is what I know about it. I've flown planes. I've done this'. And so it goes on.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I found the speech of Senator Ian Macdonald quite interesting but he really cannot be taken seriously. The essence of what he is saying is that a system which is driven and guided by profit will cut corners with respect to safety. I just wish that he would carry that general principle over into so much of his other thinking, because in so many other respects he believes that the free market should reign and the profit system should be dominant, and that questions of safety, health, social justice and everything else should be totally ignored.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For Senator Ian Macdonald to come in here and protest in a very hollow way that somehow safety will be compromised by a profit-driven system is simply quite inconsistent with what he says in so many other respects at other times. While I would have to agree philosophically with the substance of what Senator Macdonald has said, I simply cannot accept it because he does not consistently take that same line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Aviation Fuel Revenues (Special Appropriation) Amendment Bill 1993 will be supported by the Australian Democrats. In essence, this legislation concerns the use of market forces. In our opinion, it is an appropriate use of market forces in that the revenue from aviation fuel will be given to CAA as part of the payment for the safety services which CAA provides. It seems to us entirely appropriate that those who use the aviation services with respect to safety and other matters should pay. Clearly, a levy on fuel is a reasonable measure of the intensity of the use of those services. Therefore, this measure essentially lines up with the user pays principle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are concerned that the government is not carrying over this principle into other areas. I would remind the Senate that last year, in our <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Getting to Work</EMPHASIS> document, we made a recommendation in relation to road transport&mdash;which is exactly comparable to air transport. We recommended that the fixed costs of car ownership&mdash;registration and third party insurance&mdash;should also be shifted as a tax on fuel. Nobody is providing a service to those people who buy a vehicle and leave it in the garage. People are, however, providing a service in relation to the use of the roads with respect to safety, policing and health costs in relation to both air pollution and accidents and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The general principle which the government has adopted here&mdash;the principle which we accept&mdash;should be extended more widely. We would certainly accept the view that the market system, the internalisation of what economists call externalities, is not a complete answer to the problems of covering all aspects of safety, health or anything else. But it is at least a move in the right direction and that is</PARA>
<PARA>fundamentally the reason why we are supporting this legislation. But, in doing so, we would enjoin the government to take that principle and apply it more widely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last night we saw the rejection of that principle when we were considering the privatisation of the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories. In numerous other instances the government has not accepted the application of the principle which lies fundamentally at the basis of this legislation. We simply say to the government that it should more widely accept the principle in this area and get on with the job. In doing so, it should recognise that, as I think Senator Ian Macdonald said, while it is a necessary condition, it is not a sufficient condition to take into account all aspects of safety, health and everything else which a complex society needs to take into consideration. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With the greatest of respect, I thought Senator Coulter would have taken some time to enlarge on those themes. I would like to deal very briefly with the argument that Senator Coulter put up. Apparently, Senator Coulter and the Australian Democrats cannot recognise a public interest component in any part of the government's operation. I do not have any difficulty in seeing that governments have a place in looking after a broad section of interests of the community which are best defined as public interest.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of things that only governments can do and that cannot be put out to private industry. To argue, as Senator Coulter did, that it was a matter of this being either black or white, that it was one thing or the other, that people should pay for everything while governments pay for nothing and, therefore, it was quite wrong for Senator Ian Macdonald to talk about a public interest in relation to aviation safety, is to take a rather extreme and totally illogical position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wonder whether Senator Coulter would like to pass some legislation in this parliament to provide for people to pay for the protection they get from the police forces. Does he really want every Australian citizen to pay a special levy for the defence forces? If his imagination or intellect cannot cope with that, I would ask him to deny that there is not a public interest in things like public health. Surely there is such an interest in the control of disease by general health and hygiene standards and in the provision of clean drinking water so that we do not have cholera here. Where would we be with inoculation programs if they were dependent on the individual to pay for them? Are Senator Coulter and the Democrats saying that the government has no obligation to provide education for the children of our poor and needy? Senator Coulter surely is not saying that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only interpretation and conclusion that can be put on Senator Coulter's line of argument is that, if we are going to the user pays doctrine&mdash;which he is embracing so enthusiastically this morning&mdash;good, let us get rid of personal income tax. One of the objections I have to the hybrid system is that we are taxed so heavily to provide for services, and that this government slips off the hook and gets into user-pays doctrines but still maintains the previous taxation levels. But enough of that nonsense; it is hardly worth spending my time on it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Aviation Fuel Revenues (Special Appropriation) Amendment Bill, which is before us this morning, increases the rate of duty on avgas, imposes a rate of duty on avtur and passes the money from these measures to the Civil Aviation Authority with respect to its regulatory safety functions. Liquid fuel has been a great milch cow for governments of all persuasions, but the Nobel Prize winner for milking the public purse with respect to fuels has to be the Hawke-Keating junta. Its record is without parallel in Australia's history. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at where we were when the Liberal Party was in government in 1983. At that time, excise on motor fuel and diesel was 5.15c per litre plus a short-term 2c per litre bicentenary levy. Today, out there on the footpaths of Canberra and in every other outlet in Australia, it is 29.7c per litre. There has been a lift in 10 years from 7.155c per litre to 29.7c per litre. Pretty well everything we do in Australia has a transport component in it; every transport action reflects that staggering and rapacious level of taxation on an essential commodity&mdash;a commodity as essential as food&mdash;namely, motor fuel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When this government came to power, aviation fuel was only 6.55c per litre; it is now 22.735c per litre; and we are being asked to impose a levy of 0.264c per litre on it, which will take it to 22.999c, effectively 23c, per litre for aviation gasoline. Admittedly, that is less than the 29.7c, effectively 30c, for motor spirit. But the point we have to remember about aviation gasoline is that its price is always very much higher than motor fuel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think fuel in Canberra today is about 71.5c per litre. As recently as two weekends ago, I was paying 95c to 96c per litre for avgas in country areas of New South Wales. The best price I know of is 81.7c at Archerfield in Brisbane. But even at that level, I think the Brisbane price of motor fuel today, without having a state tax on it, is about 58c a litre. So the retail price for avgas is always considerably higher than it is for motor spirit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This levy will be paid so that the Civil Aviation Authority can discharge its regulatory function. This is in direct contrast to the findings of the Bosch inquiry, which was set up by this government to look at the whole matter of funding the Civil Aviation Authority. It is well known to every member of the Senate chamber that the Bosch inquiry reported that the government should move to 100 per cent cost recovery in aviation over 10 years; the government, in its wisdom, moved to do it in about three years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, on this matter of the supervisory or safety functions of the authority, Bosch argued that there was an unequivocal case for that to be classed as the public interest and that it should be funded out of consolidated revenue. The government agreed with that; there was no ambiguity about it. It said, `Yes, we accept the findings of the Bosch committee'. A couple of years later, when the financial irresponsibility and deficits were mounting, the government said, `We are going to walk away from that'. The proposition we have at the moment is that there will be a recovery of 50 per cent of the regulatory costs this financial year and 100 per cent in the next financial year, 1994-95. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next point is that there is a great deal of rubberiness about what it actually costs the Civil Aviation Authority to provide this function. That is not surprising, given the managerial skills within the CAA. But the figure that comes up is around $50 million. I do not know whether that figure of $50 million is true or not; it seems very high to me. But we have no way of determining that so, for the moment, it has to rest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I want to talk about is where this money will go and relate it to the practical matters of one of the safety functions of the department. The particular matter I want to talk about this morning is the matter of flight plans. A flight plan is really a prospective guide to where an aeroplane is going to fly. It lists the track and certain reporting points to make along that track. It analyses the time intervals, the winds, the fuel loads; it should have listed on it the safety and navigational equipment and the number of people on board. It therefore provides a guide that enables air traffic to be managed and coordinated, and it also has a very important safety function in so far as it is a record of what the aircraft was meant to do. It is a rather detailed record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason I speak on this is that on Monday, 15 November a Senate estimates committee meeting was held and several contentious points were raised in evidence. The particular point I am concerned about is evidence by Mr Brooksbank, who is described as the General Manager, Air Traffic Services; he is responsible basically for air traffic control procedures and the systems that apply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The evidence that Mr Brooksbank gave on page E574 of the Senate <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of 15 November is literally quite misleading. He was asked a question by Senator Ian Macdonald in relation to an aircraft which crashed in the Blue Mountains. The gist of Senator Macdonald's question was whether or not, if the aircraft had had a flight plan filed in respect of its activities, the two survivors would have been found in time. I was not at the inquiry, unfortunately, but I came into my office when this was being held and saw Mr Brooksbank on the internal TV. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Brooksbank, with quite a degree of emotion, dealt with this question&mdash;and it may have been his emotion that carried him away and confused his judgment. But it is not for me to reflect on his motives; all I can do is reflect on the facts as stated by him. I will make a statement about his evidence because it was really quite misleading to the parliament and to the Australian public. Mr Brooksbank in his reply said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The facts are very simple. Firstly, they did in fact give us radio notification as they taxied at Bankstown so we knew the track and that was taped. Secondly, the parents were advised and the parents are a `responsible person'.</PARA>
<PARA>He then went on and finished up with a great thespian flourish of flinging his glasses down on the table and denying that anything more could have been done to save the lives of these two unfortunate people. Mr Brooksbank is quite wrong when he says, `We did know where the aircraft was going'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will take honourable senators through what happens at airports when an aircraft departs. It is a matter of fact that when one enters an aircraft, the first thing one does is switch on to the frequency for the ATIS, the automatic terminal information service. This gives us the active runways, the weather reports and a few other relevant points. The next call is made to ground control, and in this case the call would have been, `Bankstown ground, this is Alpha-Bravo-Charlie', and whatever the aircraft type was; `Received Delta', or whatever the call sign was for the ATIS that was current, `Taxiing for Parkes'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The facts of life are that you cannot move off an airfield without saying what you are going to do&mdash;either going into the circuit for take-offs and landings, the training area or somewhere else. That is mandatory. The fact that this pilot called up and said he was taxiing for Parkes does not allow Mr Brooksbank to make the claim, as he emphatically did, that therefore they could draw a straight line between whatever the departure point was nominated from Bankstown and Parkes and pursue that with confidence, with a search party, as the aircraft's path. They could have flown anywhere. If I call up at Canberra this morning and say that I am taxiing for Mudgee, they do not know whether I am going out west to some place, or through Wagga, or whether I am going to track east; I could be on any path at all to get there. </PARA>

It is a hopelessly inefficient position to be in. It is a hopelessly inefficient position for the Civil Aviation Authority to support. It is also quite wrong to say that we can get over the requirements of filing a flight plan by lodging a note with a responsible person who will then advise that if the aircraft does not arrive we have to go and look for it. That is not the way to save lives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Time is crucial in this. If you know the track of the aircraft, the probabilities are that you will find the survivors, if there are any, more quickly. We know very well from our military experience in Korea and in Vietnam that the quicker you Medivac people out the better. In this case we had plenty of helicopters. Had they been able to find the people, the possibility of survival as a general proposition depends very much on the rapidity with which you find them and the rapidity with which you find them turns on having an accurate flight plan. That principle is an absolutely solid one in aviation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another aspect to this tragic accident in the Blue Mountains which I will not develop this morning, and that is the fact that almost certainly they were flying under conditions which did not permit visual flight under the visual flight rules. That leads to another large area which I do not want to argue about this morning&mdash;the all or nothing rule of the CAA that you have to have a first-class instrument rating to cope with non-VFR conditions. But that is a separate argument. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to come back to this information of Brooksbank that departure notification is, in effect, a flight plan. If a pilot puts a plan in, it puts discipline on that pilot to look at what he is going to do, to work out his fuel loads and his wind and to find out whether he can actually fly the operation. It certainly helps the search and rescue enormously.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, I draw your attention to a point of order that was raised in this chamber last week, when Senator McMullan made some remarks at which Senator Patterson distinctly said she took offence. The original view of the President, who was in the chair at the time&mdash;this was during question time&mdash;was that it was just a debating point. Senator Patterson stood up and said, `It may be a debating point but I personally take offence at it'. I understand that in the past the rulings have occasionally been that if a senator on the other side or whoever it is takes offence at a remark, the appropriate thing is for it to be withdrawn.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would personally like, therefore, to support your ruling. I just ask you to consider, and perhaps give some indication of, whether the President was right last week in saying that it is bad luck if someone has taken offence; that does not apply. Senator McMullan was not made to withdraw that remark. I support the position that if a senator is offended, even if he or she is a bit thin-skinned, the polite and courteous thing to do is to withdraw it. I invite you to comment on that matter. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YH4">Senator MacGIBBON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On that basis and on the basis that that applies in the future on all occasions when I am speaking, I will withdraw. I want to get back to this business of the $599,000 that was spent on the search. Arguably, had there been an accurate flight plan and had the department known the track of the aircraft, it would not have been necessary to spend anywhere near that amount of money, which comes from the taxpayers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A few weeks ago I made a very good speech in this place on flight plans. It was very well received by the aviation community. I had people ringing me up from all around Australia, thanking me for saying it. I do not resile from anything I said at the time. I want to expand on that slightly. It was the subject of a rather bitter and ill-informed attack by the minister, but I will let that pass. It is important that people plan a flight. I do not want to see a situation where flight plans are made mandatory; it should be left to the discretion of the pilot in command. But there are a number of circumstances where it is very good policy to plan. We have to get away from the business of the department not encouraging people to plan, of telling them that it costs $150 to put a plan in at the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a system which works, but it is an awkward system. Two weekends ago I flew 17 1/2 hours, mainly around western New South Wales. I used the facilities. I say that I had no difficulty with them in any way at all, but I do recognise that it is an awkward system. Essentially, the only way you can get weather information and the only way one can file a plan is to use a fax or to use a phone and dial a 008 number. I said in my previous speech that sometimes one cannot get through. A commercial pilot of great experience phoned me up after I made that last speech and said, `I have been held on occasions for an hour and a half trying to get through'. There are only two outlets, one in Brisbane and one in Melbourne, that answer these calls. But that is a minor deficiency. I am happy with the present system but it needs supplementation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We get to the business of getting weather briefings. We have a system known as Dectalk, where there is a synthesised voice from a computer that makes the answers. That voice is in an American accent and it is a slurred, drunken voice at times. At times it is quite indistinct. For Australians who have not lived in the United States and who are not familiar with the American intonations and inflection, it can be misleading. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have lived in America for quite a bit of my life. Last weekend I was going to go to Rockhampton. I did not go in the end, but I made a number of calls getting weather reports on this Dectalk system. The announcer, in this slurred diction, was saying what sounded like `north of a line from Gympie to Tiaro'. It was only after I replayed it for the third or fourth time that I realised he was saying `Tara'. Tara is west of Gympie, and that is in zone 4D. I do not see why Dectalk cannot be the same as the ATIS. Why cannot the staff of the CAA do the automatic recording every time a fresh forecast comes in, because there are not that many regions in Australia?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difficulty is that a pilot really needs to have a fax if the system is going to be accessed properly. It is all very well for Senator Collins to say that a second-hand fax costs only $300, but a lot of pilots do not have them. His comparison of $300 against $50,000 for an aircraft is quite meaningless because, for every pilot who owns an aircraft, probably 50 or 100 pilots do not own aeroplanes; the majority of pilots do not own them. I cannot lug around a fax if I am touring western New South Wales in my little aeroplane; it is just not practical. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another element to this matter. One of the most experienced instructors in Australia, who does a lot of long distance flying with his students and who holds all licences as an ATO&mdash;a testing officer&mdash;et cetera, phoned me after my speech and said, `I often go to Coolangatta. With students, I want the hard copy of weather reports and NOTAMs. I want to be able to lodge a plan. I cannot do that at Coolangatta because there is no public terminal facility there'. We need to put in a supplementary system. We need something like the automatic tellers in the banking system. We need a system where a dollar can be put in and a NOTAM or a weather report dispensed or a plan filed. That could exist at the larger airports around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other huge deficiency in the present system is the absence of any position reporting system. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS> The essential thing about the flight plans at the moment is that position reporting cannot be done. The old system of full radio has been abandoned. In bygone times, there were two ways of filing a flight plan: either full radio or position reporting. Full radio was similar to what the airlines used. There were designated reporting points and a pilot had to call up within a minute or two minutes of reaching a point. For a private pilot without the sophisticated navaids of the airlines, that involved a fair bit of strain; it is fair enough for the airlines, but it imposed difficulties for others. I have no difficulty with the abolition of full radio reporting for private VFR traffic. I have done a fair bit of it in the past, but I do not regret its passing. The present system whereby a pilot does not have to report&mdash;a SAR time is nominated&mdash;is really quite meaningless. I cannot understand how any experienced airman in the Civil Aviation Authority agreed to its implementation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I return to my experiences of two weekends ago. I flew from Archerfield to the western part of the Victorian-New South Wales border. I put a lot of time into planning it beforehand, with charts and ERSA. I spent quite a bit of time preparing the aircraft and making sure that everything was quite right. When I had done all that, I spent over an hour going to a very good flying instructor, paying money and going meticulously through all my air traffic control procedures. The whole weekend went without a moment's hesitation, difficulty or embarrassment anywhere along the line. The system worked. It reflected the work that was put in beforehand. But that is just normal airmanship; one should do things like that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The track I flew followed Archerfield, Armidale, Dubbo, Griffith to the Victorian border. I came back from the Victorian border through Canberra, Mudgee, Armidale and Archerfield. If I had gone missing and not reported on SAR time, I could have been anywhere on that leg between Archerfield and the Victorian border. There is now no provision to make a position report in flight. To state it as baldly as that demonstrates the stupidity of the system we have. It really is quite inexcusable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A subterfuge has to be used. There are different radio frequencies for different areas. I called over Gibraltar, which is a navaid in the northern part of the New England tablelands area. I reported to Sydney: `Sydney, this is Alpha Kilo Whiskey'. The air traffic controller said, `Alpha Kilo Whisky, go ahead. This is Sydney'. I said, `Sydney, this is Alpha Kilo Whisky overhead Gibraltar this time, tracking Armidale. Request area QNH'. That goes on the tape. There is no acknowledgment of it as a position report. The controllers are obliged to give me the area QNH, which is the altimeter setting for that region. It is by using subterfuges like that that pilots now record their position around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I do not report in at SAR time, they will go back and listen to all the tapes for the regions through which I was flying. They will find these entries sequentially along the track and be able to derive from them where I got to. But that is wrong. It may not be necessary to designate a staff member to plot every individual flight in Australia, but surely it should be possible for us to say, `This is Alpha Bravo Charlie overhead Gunnedah this time, estimating Coonabarabran 26, operations normal', or something like that. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We will address that now. Despite the false assertions of Senator Macdonald, I have before drawn attention to the fact that I am not a professional pilot or engineer. I have described myself&mdash;Senator Macdonald knows this&mdash;as a professional passenger. I do respect the fact that Senator MacGibbon is not only a pilot but an experienced pilot of many years standing. On every occasion that someone in the industry&mdash;Senator MacGibbon is in the industry; that is acknowledged by people in it&mdash;be it Dick Smith, Senator MacGibbon or anyone else, has raised a concern about air safety, I have followed it up with the relevant authorities, which is usually both the CAA and the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason I make that point is that Senator Macdonald again made a number of totally unsubstantiated assertions in his address this morning and provided absolutely no detail whatsoever. It was a dreadful exercise in unspecific scaremongering. As I have advised the Senate estimates committee before, as a member of parliament, not as a minister, I have never failed to go to the authorities when any individuals&mdash;passengers, pilots or anyone else&mdash;have brought a matter to me. As Senator Macdonald knows, the CAIR system has been established for that very purpose by the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation. It guarantees the anonymity of an informant. In fact, officers from BASI gave Senator Macdonald direct evidence on it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I told that committee, and I will tell this Senate, of one occasion concerning an operator in the Northern Territory which involved multiple engine failure that turned out to be through crankshafts being incorrectly ground at an uncertified works. I have received complaints from passengers on board flights where there has been an engine failure. On three occasions I have been on aircraft that have had engine failures. It is disconcerting for the passengers. The officer who had followed it up was at the table at that estimates committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On each occasion, I can attest that the CAA has scrupulously investigated every claim to the point&mdash;this is what annoys me about these things; I gave evidence to the committee on this basis&mdash;that complaints are then made against the CAA about harassment when it follows up these complaints. In the case of this operator in the Northern Territory that is precisely what happened, to the point where I got a letter from a Northern Territory government minister making representations to me about the unfair harassment by the CAA of this operator who had had two engine failures in aircraft in his fleet, both caused by crankshaft failure. The CAA is hiding nothing in this area. It is accused of failure to provide sufficient scrutiny. When it provides that scrutiny&mdash;in my experience, from the complaints I have taken to it, it always has provided it&mdash;it is hounded for harassing people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my portfolio I take safety more seriously than any other matter, whether maritime safety, road safety or air safety. I have personally followed up with the authorities every complaint I have ever got about poor maintenance or about incidents in the air, as is the case with what recently happened near Groote Eylandt in the Northern Territory. I am going to take the trouble today to contact the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation and to check whether Senator Macdonald has taken any of the concerns&mdash;as non-specific as they were&mdash;to the CARE service, which he knows exist. I was present in the room when he was told about it weeks ago. I will not be at all surprised to find that he has not been near BASI or the CAA with any of these complaints. That is why I consider his behaviour to be irresponsible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to a matter which Senator Coulter might be interested in hearing about. I was fascinated to hear both Senator Ian Macdonald and Senator MacGibbon on the question of why the government should pay rather than the industry. I thought I must have been campaigning in a different election. I refer to the coalition's policy on aviation which Senator Macdonald and Senator MacGibbon took to the people at the last election. To the best of my knowledge&mdash;I am sure that I am not wrong&mdash;it is the coalition's current, published policy, still in print and unchanged, with respect to the Civil Aviation Authority. I ask honourable senators to compare what Senator Macdonald and Senator MacGibbon have said during this debate with this policy:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The coalition in government will move to privatise or contract out those functions&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>of the CAA&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that can be best undertaken by the industry itself or by private enterprise.</PARA>
<PARA>On the question of cost recovery, I refer to the astonishing contributions made this morning by both of those honourable senators and to the policy they both supported and took to the last election&mdash;it is only a short time ago&mdash;which is contained in the Fightback document. As well as the coalition not agreeing with the staged process of gradual cost recovery that we envisaged over a number of years, Fightback states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government announced in the 1990-91 Budget its intention to phase in full cost recovery for air safety activity from 1 November 1992. In the 1991-92 Budget this decision was reversed&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>which it was&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">so that cost recovery would only start to phase in from 1 November 1992.</PARA>
<PARA>Since then we have progressed it a bit further and clawed 50 per cent of it back, of which the industry is extremely appreciative. The Fightback document goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition will implement full recovery for air safety activities forthwith, saving $20 million.</PARA>
<PARA>The coalition parties went to the last election wanting to privatise the CAA and fully cost recover&mdash;with no staging&mdash;the total cost of safety regulation. The coalition came in here this morning and said what a terrible thing it is that the government is going to get 50 per cent of it back and that we should be paying the whole lot. That kind of credibility gap has to be exposed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the appalling statements that were made about the accident involving the tragic loss of life of two young men. The careless and inaccurate statements that Senator MacGibbon made in relation to this matter really do need to be addressed. Senator MacGibbon implied that the CAA was responsible for the loss of the two lives in this accident because of the lack of flight plans. He has just reasserted&mdash;and I agree with him&mdash;that it should not be compulsory to lodge flight plans. That compulsion was removed in 1978. That is how long the existing arrangements have been in place. As Senator MacGibbon knows, the industry wanted that arrangement. This is what Senator MacGibbon said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe it is a reasonable proposition that . . . they might well have been alive today if they had been found promptly.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator MacGibbon then linked this comment with a question as to why there was no flight plan. I said at the time, and I say again, that it was a disgraceful implication by Senator MacGibbon which cannot be allowed to stand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The CAA search was based on the information which the pilot left which indicated the track on which the aircraft would be flying. Senator MacGibbon knows that. The extensive search involved over 50 helicopters and fixed wing aircraft&mdash;and that will always be laid on, regardless of cost. As Senator MacGibbon also knows, as a result of flying on each side of that track, search aircraft actually went directly above the aircraft, but because it crashed through a dense canopy&mdash;it was a light aircraft, a small aircraft&mdash;it could not be seen from the air. It was found in a ground search for that reason. Senator MacGibbon knows that too. So in respect of this particular accident, it is outrageous to say that if a flight plan had been lodged, these two lives could have been saved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further to that, Senator MacGibbon also knows that the plane was carrying an emergency beacon which, unfortunately, was destroyed on impact. That even happens, I am afraid to say, with a percentage of the highly engineered black boxes in big jet aircraft. Some years ago the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation spent several hours briefing me on the engineering of those boxes. I examined them and saw some damage to the foil strips inside those boxes. It was explained to me that it is almost impossible to engineer them to the stage where they can survive every impact. That is even more the case with what needs to be a reasonably small and reasonably light beacon and, I might add, an affordable beacon, in a light aircraft. Unfortunately, although the aircraft involved in this accident was carrying one, it was destroyed on impact. Senator MacGibbon knows all of that too. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator MacGibbon would do well to stop making these allegations without having some regard to the facts and without awaiting the results of the investigation of the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation. Unfortunately, these assertions were made again recently at a Senate estimates committee hearing. They were rightly corrected by the officers present. I do not blame Mr Brooksbank, who was involved in that search, for getting a bit emotional about these totally irresponsible statements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the matter of flight plans. I agree with most of what Senator MacGibbon says most of the time&mdash;and I certainly agree with his final statement this morning about flight plans. I think people can distil, from the comments he made to me about air traffic controllers telling people to stop the chatter, that he has confirmed what the CAA has said. His original assertion that a pilot has to rely on subterfuge to lodge a position report is not correct. I am advised by the CAA that it is not correct. Dick Smith told me&mdash;and he is right, because I checked it, not being a pilot&mdash;that Senator MacGibbon's assertion in here a few weeks ago that one has to use a fax to lodge a flight plan is complete nonsense. I notice that Senator MacGibbon has withdrawn from that today, but look at the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. A 008 number can be used, and one can also radio in a flight plan at any time&mdash;to quote Dick Smith&mdash;by pushing a button in the aircraft. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I respect Dick Smith's experience in the air equally with Senator MacGibbon's. Dick Smith said to me that it was a shame that, on that particular occasion, when they were faced with that decision, the pilots did not make a flight plan. I do not think Senator MacGibbon would disagree with me when I say that, from my experience as a professional passenger sitting in that right-hand seat, you cannot depend on the air traffic controllers or the CAA on the ground 500 kilometres behind in Darwin when you are running into storm conditions across Arnhem Land. You have to depend on the professional judgment of that person sitting in the left-hand seat. It is that person's judgment as to whether to continue in weather conditions that you should not be flying in or whether to turn back, which has happened on many occasions, and I am always happy to leave that decision in the hands of the pilot; or, and Dick Smith made this point to me, if a flight plan has not been lodged, one can be lodged immediately as a precautionary measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If pilots decide to fly on into bad weather and they think they might get into a bit of trouble, Dick said to me, `They can turn back'&mdash;which is what they should do&mdash;`or they can fly on if they wish. But if they fly on, they can pick up the radio and lodge a flight plan at that point in flight'. In other words, they can record their position with the CAA. They can do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am advised by the CAA&mdash;and that is why I accessed the system myself&mdash;that it is easier now by a country mile to lodge flight plans and get flight information than it ever was in the past. Senator MacGibbon talked about tracking around in the back blocks of New South Wales as if there was, under previous arrangements, a briefing office at every airport around Australia. Of course there was not. As has just been pointed out to me by my adviser, if one was wondering around in the back blocks of New South Wales 20 years ago, one would had to have lodged a flight plan by telephone, as is the case now; or, as is usually the case, and I would like Senator MacGibbon to tell me that I am wrong, at least with the pilots I fly with in those isolated areas, they lodge their flight plans from the aircraft over the radio. I have sat next to them and listened to them enough to know that that is the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the information Senator MacGibbon provided to the Senate with this air of authority, as is often the case, was flatly wrong again. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> will show that Senator MacGibbon protested when I corrected him and said I had checked the facts. He told us that there were only two operators operating this system and that there were huge delays. I said that I had checked the situation and had found that there were 16 operators, not two. Senator MacGibbon then said, `Oh, I didn't say two operators; I said two centres.' I tabled the extract from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> immediately after that debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> showed correctly that Senator MacGibbon had said two operators, not two centres. That is the problem with the information Senator MacGibbon gives the Senate time and again with this air of authority. When one checks out the facts, his facts turn out to be wrong. The facts are that all pilots, including private pilots, are able to file a flight plan, it is easy to do so, and the CAA regulations encourage them to do so. Senator MacGibbon knows that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was one point Senator MacGibbon made this morning that deserves to be highlighted and emphasised. Senator MacGibbon said that pilots should plan their flights. So they should. Any responsible pilot should do that. It would assist air safety enormously. The problem is that there are too many occasions when young, particularly inexperienced, pilots treat the aircraft like a Holden ute and jump in and go. They do not sit down and plan their flights. I agree with Senator MacGibbon in that regard. I agree with him that we should not go back to making it mandatory to lodge flight plans because that would clog the system to death and take us back to where we were prior to 1978. The industry does not want that, as Senator MacGibbon said correctly. But, at the same time, pilots should plan their flights. A lot of these problems would be alleviated if they did. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These services are operated by 16 operators rather than two, as suggested by Senator MacGibbon. I tried the service out myself. Senator MacGibbon asserted that two people had to cover the whole of Australia and that people had to wait for hours. I accessed the system in five seconds and in under five minutes I had a complete hard copy print-out of all the information I needed to plan my flight. When I accessed the 008 number, I was told by the operator that pilots love the system. This operator, who has been with the CAA for 20 years, told me that under the old system, even when the CAA had briefing centres, 80 per cent of pilots got their flight information over the phone. I am sure Senator MacGibbon knows that is correct. This operator said that what the CAA does now with this automatic system is provide a hard copy of the information whenever the pilots want it. It can be provided hours before the flight if they want it and this is without going near a briefing office. He said, `They love the new system.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The operator said that he personally had only one regret about the new system. I asked him what that was and he said, `I am operating a system'&mdash;in other words looking after a computer bank&mdash;`that formerly 200 people were employed to operate under the previous system.' Again, as Senator MacGibbon knows, because of these chiefly technologically driven changes the CAA&mdash;this incompetent management referred to by Senator MacGibbon&mdash;in the current restructuring passed on to the aviation industry in Australia, because of cost reductions in the last two years, which is a very rare event these days, some $200 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of flight plans, the pilot has a number of options to comply with the regulations. As Senator MacGibbon knows, those regulations require all pilots to obtain all necessary meteorological and operational information and to plan the flight prior to making the flight. That is what the regulations impose on pilots. The pilot can submit full flight details. The CAA's aeronautical information publication provides clear guidance that `pilots not formally required to submit flight notification are nevertheless encouraged to leave a flight note.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator MacGibbon bemoaned the loss of the briefing services previously provided at airfields. What he failed to mention was that the majority of the briefing services&mdash;and I have been advised by the people who provide them&mdash;were still provided by telephone without the benefit of being able to follow the information through to the pilot with a hard copy, as can now be provided by fax. The pilot has the information in front of him without having to write it down over the phone. The CAA has two central briefing offices. Each has a number of staff to provide briefings by telephone and to accept flight details. The pilot can choose to put it over the radio from his aircraft if he wants to. I would like honourable senators to compare those facts with the alleged facts put to the Senate by Senator MacGibbon. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> will show those facts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator MacGibbon also complained about the CAA getting rid of the visual flight guides. What he forgot to tell the Senate was that it was the aviation industry that asked the CAA to do that. That was a reasonable piece of information that Senator MacGibbon could have provided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last thing I would like to address is Senator MacGibbon's assertion that `the CAA will take people to court at the drop of a hat.' I would like to provide Senator MacGibbon with the information that was available over the last 12 months, because I chased it up. There are 36,000 active pilots in Australia. In the 12 months ending September 1993, there were 28 prosecutions. That is hardly evidence of an organisation that will take people to court at the drop of a hat. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I mentioned three incidents in my speech all relating to past incidents. The first matter that I mentioned related to Monarch Airlines, which is now out of business. I am not quite sure what I can report to BASI about that. I simply said that airworthiness investigators wanted to remove Monarch's air operator certificates some months ago.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are far too many errors of fact there to deal with all of them this afternoon, so I will confine my comments to three broad areas. The allegation that somehow or other I am blaming the CAA for the death of those two people in the Blue Mountains is quite incorrect. In the speech I made on 28 October, I said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe it is a reasonable proposition that, since they survived the crash, they might well have been alive today if they had been found promptly. I stress that I do not know their condition after the crash&mdash;how badly injured they were&mdash;and it may well have been so bad that, even if they had been picked up by a helicopter immediately afterwards, they would not have survived.</PARA>
<PARA>Today I was trying to argue the obvious case that the sooner one is found the higher one's chances of survival. If I inadvertently created the impression in the Senate, through all the uproar of interjections, that I was attributing a direct cause and effect to the Blue Mountain incident, I apologise for that and I unreservedly withdraw it. But I do not resile from the general proposition that the sooner we find survivors the better their chance of survival. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also had a great diatribe about briefing officers. I have had a look at my speech of 28 October where I referred to briefing officers. In both the briefing officer case and the VFG, I did not say that I wanted those re-established. I was establishing the situation out there in the real world where these services have been withdrawn and there is no compensatory service put in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is deplorable that there is no reference document that is meaningful for the average pilot. I never knew that it was the industry's request that the VFG be withdrawn. I am disappointed at that but then in regard to the GA sector&mdash;the broad group of pilots who form the majority of pilots in Australia&mdash;it has no effective voice at all in negotiating with government. Its representation is presumably through AOPA and diluted through the membership of much wider committees, so I am not surprised that these things happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not arguing for the return of briefing officers. I am arguing for the return of VFGs because there simply is no other way of a pilot's knowing. The two documents that we have at present&mdash;the AIP and the RACOPS books&mdash;are very inadequate and very incomplete. The reality is that the average pilot finds them quite incomprehensible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final point that I want to make is about filing plans. We have the very difficult situation now where the CAA is believed by the industry to be at war with it. I think that is a deplorable and totally unnecessary situation, but it is something that has occurred. Pilots&mdash;inexperienced pilots in particular&mdash;are not ready to ask air traffic controllers for advice because they are figures of great authority to them. Such pilots do not want to attract attention to themselves. It is very understandable that an inexperienced pilot will not call up and put in a flight plan in the air after he has already made the decision, on the ground presumably, not to put in a plan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As for all this business that the great majority of plans were always put in by telephone to briefing officers, I do not know about that. All I know is that in my home field of Archerfield there are between 11 and 14 briefing officers in the briefing office at the weekends&mdash;which I always thought was excessive, but they were certainly going flat out. I would have often rung up and got a weather forecast before I went to the field so that I could do my flight planning in the comfort of my own desk at home and save time at the airport. I would be interested in the statistics. If he has hard copy statistics of those who phone in, that is fine. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Childcare Rebate Bill seeks to provide for the payment of rebate for expenses incurred for work-related child care. Over the last 10 years the provision of suitable child care has become an increasingly important issue for Australians. To a large extent, this growing importance can be attributed to the growth in female employment and particularly to the growth in employment amongst married women.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A recently released report on women's employment stated that between June 1983 and June 1993 the total number of employed females increased by over 925,000, or by around 40 per cent. It also confirms that, until recently, the participation rate for married females was lower than the rate for unmarried females. However, with the significant growth in the number of married women in the labour force in the last decade, the participation rate for married females began to exceed the rate for not married females for the first time in 1990.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Currently the federal government subsidises around 208,000 child-care places in Australia and has promised to meet all demand for work-related child care by the year 2001. Given the ALP's track record in relation to child care, I have grave doubts that this promise will be delivered. In the last ABS child-care survey, completed in 1990, unmet demand for formal child care in Australia had grown by over 112 per cent in just over three years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the years I have seen many of this Labor government's promises either dumped after the heat of an election or simply never realised. In the 1988 election campaign Labor promised to create 30,000 child-care places by mid-1992. The target was not met. I can recall that in 1990 the Labor government, in a last minute vote grabbing promise, stated that it would create 50,000 new child-care places by mid-1995. Three years after the promise was made not one of those places has been created. Almost every Australian will remember the now famous, or infamous, promise that Bob Hawke made in 1987 that `no child would live in poverty by 1990'. I suppose it is no wonder that I am sceptical about the promises that this government makes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the last election the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) announced that the ALP would be spending $626.7 million over four years on a package of child-care measures. One of the key measures of this package announced by the Prime Minister was the introduction of a child-care cash rebate. As one journalist noted at the time of its announcement back in February of this year, the measure was carefully designed to ferret out 145,000 upper middle class women who received no government assistance or tax relief for child care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> It was a blatant and obvious measure designed to buy votes. It had nothing to do with equity or genuine concern by the Labor government to extend child-care places and services to those most in need. It was simply another slick election promise, presumably penned by Dr Anne Summers, brought out at great expense to the Australian public, and mouthed by Mr Paul Keating for the purposes of the election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Childcare Rebate Bill 1993 is evidence of the wooing of the women's vote. The government bought women's votes like it bought the pensioner vote. It claimed pensioners would be taken out of the tax system and then, after the election, they were dumped. It was just another way of fooling the Australian public about what it was going to do, and it did not do it with pensioners. This is another attempt to woo the women's vote. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the bill the child-care cash rebate will be available from July 1994 for parents using child-care while in employment, training, studying or looking for work. It will be paid fortnightly through Medicare offices in person or by mail and, unfortunately, as far as we are concerned, it will not be means tested. The child-care cash rebate will allow families to claim up to 30 per cent of child-care costs after the first $16, up to a ceiling of $110 per week for one child in care or $220 per week for two or more children in care. The maximum rebate will be $28.20 per week for one child and $61.20 per week for two or more children. Availability for the rebate will extend to both formal and informal care and it will be paid for child-care expenses for children up to 12 years of age. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the past the federal government has opposed tax rebates for child-care expenses for working families, claiming that they benefit those on higher incomes more than lower paid workers or those looking for work. Ironically, under this bill, those families currently receiving little or no child-care assistance will benefit from the system. In particular, two income families enjoying relatively high incomes will benefit the most. Accordingly, the coalition has very real concerns about the fairness of the new rebate. In our current economic climate, it is simply irresponsible for this Labor government to assist high income earners at the expense of those who are not so well off. While the coalition recognises that child care is a legitimate work related expense, for reasons of equity and fairness we would like to see a capped rebate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under our child-care policy at the last election we proposed that, for families with combined incomes of $50,000 or $60,000, our child-care cash rebate would be progressively withdrawn so that no rebate would be payable to families with incomes exceeding $60,000 per annum. In this way we would have directed limited government resources to those in most need instead of pursuing this ridiculous child care for millionaires scheme. In view of this we are proposing an amendment to the bill to cap the payment of the rebate to the level provided for in our election policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that our concern about the equity of the scheme was not lost on all members of the Labor government. Prior to the budget, it was reported that the federal Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) wanted to ditch the cash rebate to higher income earners. However, the issue of equity is not the only concern the coalition has regarding the introduction of the child-care cash rebate. We have also expressed grave reservations about the privacy implications of the rebate scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable senators will recall that the coalition expressed its concerns about the privacy implications when the Health Insurance Commission Amendment Bill 1993 was debated in this place in May of this year. The coalition was concerned that, while providing the machinery to enable payments of the cash rebate through direct payments from Medicare offices, the bill left it open as to what administrative system the HIC would develop for the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were particularly concerned that tax file numbers could be required by the HIC and passed on to the Australian Taxation Office for checking purposes. This would have meant that, for the first time, a government agency would hold both Medicare and tax information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were reminded of another promise by Paul Keating that was broken when he introduced the tax file number. He said it would never be used or extended for any other purpose. We then saw the slippery slope where it was extended for the use of checking for overpayments in the social security system. It is yet another promise that the government chose to break: people did not like the Australia Card, so the government brought in a tax file number and just extended it a bit further; it slimily introduced something that it told the public it was not going to introduce.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is typical of this government. Australians should have learnt by now that what the Labor Party says before an election is not really what it means. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the assurances before and after the election that tax file numbers would not be linked to the child-care cash rebate scheme, in May the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley) would not categorically rule out the prospect that they would be used in the new scheme. She was asked this over and over again. Instead, she said that the coalition's views would be taken into consideration and that various options for the implementation of the scheme were being explored by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Both Senator Newman and I were concerned by this statement. It is significant that we were not alone in our concerns. Both the Privacy Commissioner and the Australian  Privacy Foundation expressed concerns about the possibility of tax file numbers being used in the administration of the system. Again I remind honourable senators and other people that, when Paul Keating was Treasurer, he said that the tax file number would not be extended for any purpose other than that of the Australian Taxation Office. We know that that is not true because it was extended to social security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to see that in designing the new child-care cash rebate scheme, the minister and the government have actually listened to the concerns of the coalition, the Privacy Commissioner and the privacy lobby. The Childcare Rebate Bill requires neither child-care providers nor child-care users to supply their tax file numbers to the Health Insurance Commission. The bill requires child-care providers to register with the Health Insurance Commission as registered carers and to state that they have a tax file number. In turn, the Health Insurance Commission will provide a carer with a child-care provider number, which will appear on child-care receipts. Under the scheme, the Health Insurance Commission may ask the Commissioner of Taxation whether a carer has a tax file number. However, it is not allowed to know what the number is, nor may it provide the child-care provider number to the Commissioner of Taxation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> While the coalition's concerns have been largely addressed, we note that the Office of the Privacy Commissioner has expressed some reservations about the further extension of the use of the tax file number and about the fact that the bill moves away from the voluntary disclosure of tax file numbers. As I say, we note these concerns and we will be  monitoring the operation of the scheme very closely in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Although the government's child-care accreditation scheme will be debated in this place at a later date, I would also like to raise it in the context of debate on this bill. I am extremely concerned that the introduction of the government's accreditation system will increase the price of child care in long-day care centres. This will drive some low income families into the informal sector where they will lose their child-care assistance. At the same time, as a result of the introduction of the child-care cash rebate, high income families will be able to claim a child-care cash rebate in the same way as the low income family which has been pushed out of the formal sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Apart from being inequitable, this raises an obvious inconsistency. While the government is promoting the ideal of high quality child care through its accreditation scheme, it is forcing more families into the informal sector. It is also significant that peak organisations representing around 60 per cent of the long-day care sector have voted to boycott the government's accreditation system. If this happens, and they refuse to join the system, it will cause chaos in the child-care industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another concern of the coalition is the possibility of double dipping under the scheme proposed in the bill. A loophole appears to exist whereby it might be possible, in the situation where a child is a dependant of more than one family, for two families to split child-care expenses, resulting in a total benefit for one child in excess of the maximum rebate. While it is not envisaged that this will occur to any great extent, it is possible under the provisions of the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills further raised concerns with the provisions in the bill dealing with false or misleading statements used in connection with a claim for a rebate. It was alarmed that there had been an inappropriate onus of proof standard used in the bill. The government has now addressed those concerns in the amendment the minister will be moving to clause 60 of the bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As honourable senators would have seen, there was a story in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> this morning that the US Department of Treasury has frozen $US18,000, or $A27,300, from the Fred Hollows Foundation because it says the company from which the foundation bought intra-ocular lenses broke the US trade embargo with Vietnam. This is a fairly extraordinary state of affairs. We are urgently looking into it through our embassy in Washington in the hope of quickly being able to correct this situation in the event that the story is accurate. We would of course be extremely concerned if the enormously valuable work of the Hollows Foundation were being undermined in this way.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make the further point that it is particularly incongruous that the Vietnam embargo should be applied in this way, if indeed it was, not only because of the obvious humanitarian context in which we are talking in this instance, but also because of course that embargo itself is manifestly on the way out, as it should have been some time ago, in the context of the very changed environment that exists in Vietnam. It is ironic indeed that, at a time when the United States itself is winding back the previous barriers that it has placed on its relationship with Vietnam, one of the remaining barriers should apparently be capable of application in this way. It is just another demonstration of the extent to which barriers of this kind in this day and age simply have no place and I hope the United States will make a policy judgment accordingly.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The reason why the government has resisted this matter being taken forward in this place in the way that was proposed is simply that there is no logical or rational substance to the call for an inquiry; it is a political trawling expedition of the kind we have seen so often.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The particular circumstances that were involved in this case were clearly spelt out in the full estimates committee hearing. The two housekeepers' contracts were terminated on 5 October. Changes were made because the household was not running properly, staff were not working well together and the housekeepers concerned had been refusing to take directions from the department.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only one of the housekeepers had an official credit card. She had failed on a number of occasions to follow departmental directions to advise the department in advance of major spending. The department's concern had, I am advised, been drawn to her attention a number of times. The other housekeeper had also failed to follow non-financial departmental directions and had been advised, I am advised, of the department's concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also of concern was the fact that the household staff were not working together as a team. At meetings with staff on at least four occasions staff were asked to improve their working relationships with each other. When the situation had not improved, the department recommended that the contracts be terminated in order to ensure that the household operated properly.</PARA>

It is obviously a matter of extreme disappointment to them.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister for Trade. I refer to the government's post-APEC and post-NAFTA euphoria, and ask: is the minister aware of the concessions that President Clinton is reported to have made to get support for NAFTA from congressmen with farming electorates? Will these concessions oblige the United States President to continue subsidy schemes which are now sending Australian farmers to the wall? What action is the government taking to ensure that we do not sacrifice Australian farmers, in addition to the labour intensive manufacturing industries, which are doomed by the rush into free trade areas with low wage countries?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have closely monitored the lobbying that has gone on to negotiate the passage of the NAFTA legislation in the US Congress. Of course, one cannot be sure that one knows the details of all of the lobbying arrangements which have been made to ensure passage of that bill. That is the very nature of politics. One is never quite sure, for example, what some of the minor parties and the opposition decide between themselves in this chamber by way of deal making.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But we know that some of the reports that have come out of the United States as to the nature of those deals have been exaggerated. Some of them have been quite lurid in their content and, indeed, many of them are untrue. That does not mean to say there is not a worry here; it means that we should not be stampeded at the first sign of a newspaper headline. We should be careful and examine the situation. I do know that in at least one case an undertaking that was given was in the words, `We'll use our best endeavours'; and that did not accord with what the newspapers said on this subject, which sort of suggested an open-ended commitment. So one has to be careful about those things when one looks at what might have happened.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our view on all of this is that, of course, the draft final act, the framework that we are negotiating the Uruguay Round within and, indeed, the Blair House accord, which affects the interests of our rural producers as well, constrain the United States in the sense that it is not possible, given the commitments it has made, to do deals which break that framework. That framework is the formula for how trade and agricultural products will be regulated; and that framework has often been characterised as the recipe for how that trade in agricultural products will be regulated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it is a reasonable concern that Senator Spindler has raised, and we are keeping our eye on it. It must be said that the US reaffirmed its positions on both Blair House and the draft final act at the APEC conference itself. The resolution of the conference was quite strong on that point. President Clinton, Mickey Kantor, the US Trade Representative, Commerce and Industry Secretary Brown, and the Secretary of State, Warren Christopher, all committed themselves in support of that as well. They made it very clear that they are determined to put pressure on the European Community about this as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, we are continuing to monitor the developments coming out of the NAFTA debate. We will make sure that trade deals are examined in their implementation if they have been made with adverse effects to our people, which at this stage we do not believe has been the case. If necessary, within the multilateral rules of the GATT we will deal with it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thought the last part of Senator Spindler's question was a cheap shot. This country is transforming itself into a very efficient producer of high quality manufactured goods which pay high wages.

The trend line will be to turn around those account figures. The honourable senator knows that as well as I do.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have received advice from the Commonwealth's legal counsel in the Mok case. That advice strongly recommends that an appeal be lodged to the Federal Court. In light of this advice I have determined that the decision of Justice Keely will be appealed. Counsel has accordingly been instructed to prepare the notice of appeal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senators may be aware that Mr Justice Keely found for the applicant, Ms Mok Gek Bouy, in her challenge against the decision taken by a delegate of the then minister for immigration refusing her refugee application. His Honour set aside that decision and remitted Miss Mok's application to me as the relevant minister for reconsideration. Under the terms of the Migration Act, as amended, any such review decision would be made by the Refugee Review Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">His Honour's decision was based on a number of grounds which are at odds with the contemporary decision of Mr Justice Wilcox, also in the Federal Court, in what is known as the Lek case, which takes its name from the principal applicant, Dr Lek Kim Sroun. In that case, Justice Wilcox upheld 45 out of 48 departmental decisions, also refusing refugee status. The refused applicants in that case have already lodged an appeal which has, following an application for expedition made on my behalf, been listed for the first sitting period of the Full Court in the new year. I am advised that the Federal Court has indicated a preference for the same bench of the Full Court to hear both the Lek and Mok appeals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth bearing in mind that a decision in these cases is not likely to be received before the second quarter of next year and, were the Full Court to find for the asylum seekers, they will receive a new hearing only before the Refugee Review Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The finalisation of other associated cases which have yet to be heard in the Federal Court is unlikely before June next year. I point this out not because I believe the court will uphold the appeal of the Cambodians, as my advice is that the Commonwealth's case is strong, but to make the point that the Cambodian boat people have another option available to them. If they choose to return to Cambodia before next June, they will be eligible to apply for the special assistance category I announced last month. However, they and their advisers should not believe that they can necessarily pursue both options.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be no extension to the life of the SAC in so far as it applies to those currently detained beyond the next SAC program year. This effectively means that they must return, at the latest, before the end of this program year to qualify for the 12 months residency in Cambodia. Some supporters of the group have recently suggested that the alternative to returning and taking up the SAC is, or should be, the granting of permanent residence on humanitarian grounds. I have made both my and the government's position on this proposal clear in the past. It is not an option that the government will agree to. Nothing has occurred to change that view. Moreover, a more realistic appraisal of the options available to the asylum seekers should not be forgotten. If, at the conclusion of the legal process, they remain screened out of the refugee process, the Migration Act requires their departure from Australia.</PARA>

The fact that that is contested by the employees in question is just one of those things that happens. One has to make one's own judgment. Ms Tinney was giving her advice under the conditions of a parliamentary inquiry and, in my judgment, it is inconceivable that she would have misled the parliament on this matter, particularly since it is one in which she was personally involved&mdash;she was not simply working from files or matters of that kind.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take the serious part of that question to go to the costs. First of all, let me say that Senator Boswell betrays a complete lack of understanding of this process because he is referring to departmental supervision of the program. It will not be supervised by the department; it is to be supervised by the National Child Care Accreditation Council, which I established earlier this year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first process of accreditation is a self-assessment done by the centres themselves against these guidelines. If they judge that they have reached a satisfactory standard, they will apply for accreditation and they will get it. If they judge that they themselves are below standard and seek assistance to develop a program to bring themselves up to standard, then they will continue to receive fee relief. The prospect of losing fee relief with the accreditation is a very long process. Parents need be assured that child-care assistance will not be cut off from centres, provided they show any enthusiasm or interest in the accreditation process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can tell the Senate that the costs at this stage are, first of all, a $100 registration fee per centre per year&mdash;a very small cost per child. Private consultants assessed the cost of the review process and their estimate is about 80c per child per week at the most. Centres that reach accreditation early will not have to meet anywhere near that sort of cost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the failure of the opposition to understand this program that is most concerning. The program will not be policed or supervised by departmental people. This will be done by the accreditation council and peers&mdash;that is, other providers of child care. It is done and designed that way by the child-care industry to meet its needs and to keep the costs very low. These standards, I can only say again, are not designed by government. They are designed by the child-care industry as its description of best practice in child care.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am indebted to Senator Childs for this opportunity to express the Australian government's very serious concern over the military takeover which occurred in Nigeria some days ago on 18 November. The coup, led by General Abacha, is especially untimely, given moves towards democracy and multi-party government in many other African countries. By its actions in removing the interim government and its wholesale dismantling of government and democratic institutions, the Nigerian military really has dealt a very severe blow to any prospects for democracy in that country in the foreseeable future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of particular concern is the fact that the military has dissolved the Senate, the House of Representatives and national and state assemblies, and has dismissed state governors and civilian administrators. General Abacha has also dissolved the National Electoral Commission, outlawed political parties and revoked democratic rights, including the holding of political gatherings and demonstrations. It will be remembered that the Nigerian people voted freely in presidential elections on 12 June this year; the then military regime later annulled those elections and installed an interim government of its own choosing, further delaying the introduction of democracy. Those interim government arrangements were declared unconstitutional by the Nigerian High Court on 10 November.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On Monday Senator Ferguson asked me a series of related questions regarding air traffic controllers in the Royal Australian Air Force. I will now answer those questions in sequence. Senator Ferguson asked:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">How many air traffic controllers have left the RAAF under the recent redundancy program?</PARA>
<PARA>Thirteen controllers were made redundant. He asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">How many are currently in Somalia?</PARA>
<PARA>I indicated on Monday that there were 10 or 11. I can confirm that there are currently 10 controllers serving with UNOSOM. He asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Has this left the RAAF with a critical shortage of air traffic controllers?</PARA>
<PARA>The answer to that is no. There are minor staffing shortfalls at a number of units because of the UNOSOM commitment, but these are manageable. Unit staffing of all officer categories, including air traffic controllers, varies for a number of reasons including resignations, exercise commitments, the UNOSOM contribution, officers proceeding on maternity leave, training failures and long service leave. He also asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the event of this shortage, have any air traffic controllers who left the air force under the redundancy program joined or been asked to join the RAAF reserve to fill their old positions or other air traffic positions which were declared to be redundant and, therefore, excess to air force requirements?</PARA>
<PARA>The answer to that part of Senator Ferguson's question is that there is no critical staffing shortage. One air traffic controller who left the RAAF under a redundancy program applied to transfer from the general reserve to the active reserve. His application for transfer has been approved to fill a vacancy in reserve squadron. One other officer's application is currently being processed. These requests for transfer were initiated by the officers concerned and not by the air force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Officers on the active reserve do not fill permanent air force positions. They are employed for a limited number of days, normally 32 days per year, to enable their skills&mdash;in this case as air traffic controllers&mdash;to be maintained. Members of RAAF reserve squadron supplement permanent air force staffing in contingency or exercise operations. Senator Ferguson also asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Have any officers taken up this offer?</PARA>
<PARA>The RAAF has made no offers. The two officers concerned initiated their applications for transfer. He asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Have they been required to repay their redundancy payments?</PARA>
<PARA>Should an officer who accepted a redundancy payment apply to rejoin the permanent air force, ministerial approval is necessary and repayment of the redundancy payment may be required. But, an officer who has transferred to the active reserve and is employed on a limited part-time basis has no such obligation. He asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If not, is this with your knowledge or with the knowledge of the Chief of the Air Staff?</PARA>
<PARA>In that case I would refer the honourable senator to my previous answer. Finally, he asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . if there is a shortage, whose decision was it to declare these positions redundant and excess to air force requirements?</PARA>
<PARA>No air traffic control positions were declared redundant and excess to air force requirements</PARA>
<PARA>directly as a result of the redundancy program. Rather, the redundancy program enabled air force to adjust structural distortions in staff profiles arising from both the reduction in establishment due to the force structure review and reduced wastage rates. Air force selected individual officers from volunteers for redundancy according to a number of criteria.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Ferguson also asked the following supplementary question:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When the minister is making those investigations, will he confirm that all air traffic controllers who recently accepted redundancy will not be returning to the RAAF to fill their old positions, or other air traffic positions, which were declared redundant and in excess of air force requirements, and that they will not return as members of the RAAF reserve, working under better conditions and better pay than their permanent, full-time counterparts, including being able to name the hours they are available and being paid somewhere in the vicinity of $100 a day tax free?</PARA>
<PARA>The answer to that part of Senator Ferguson's question, as I said previously, is that air traffic controller positions were not declared excess to requirements as a result of the recent redundancy program. Air traffic controllers who are made redundant may be subsequently accepted for employment on the active reserve, but they do not fill permanent air force air traffic controller positions and are employed on a strictly limited number of training days per year to maintain their proficiency. They are paid at an appropriate daily rate according to their rank and experience; and that payment, as for normal reserve pay, is tax free.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> article, which I previously referred to, Dr Grey and the National President of the Returned Services League, Major General Digger James, both indicate that the claims should be treated very cautiously and that, if any Australians had been enslaved in Russia, the numbers would be very low.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The statistics and anecdotal evidence lead to the very high improbability of what the writer has suggested. The probability is that no Australians became prisoners of the Russians, but I cannot say that, obviously, with complete certainty.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;This matter arises because of a notice of motion by Senator Patterson seeking that certain documents relating to Australian Artists' Creative Fellowships be tabled.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand the information purpose for which they are being sought, notwithstanding any subsidiary political purposes. In a document I have made available to Senator Patterson I have sought to outline my concern about the nature of the request and how I think I might be able to satisfy her search for information without transgressing some of the privacy and other concerns I have about the nature of her request. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem that Senator Patterson had in judging whether my response was reasonable, as I understand it, was that she wanted to see the documents which I proposed to table, some of which she has asked for and some in lieu of those for which she has asked which serve the same purpose. I am content to table those documents which I indicated to her I would table, but I wanted the opportunity to put in context why I am not proceeding directly in response to her request but hope to comply with the legitimate aspects of that request. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this instance we do not have a circumstance in which the conflict over a return to order, some of which we have had before in other circumstances, relates to a conflict between the executive and the parliament. There are not issues of concern about executive privilege, the nature of documents being disclosed, such as confidential government cabinet documents, or any of those issues that have arisen with regard to some controversy concerning previous returns to order. It is a concern that I have about the balance between the rights of citizens to privacy of documents which they consider they have provided in that context and the integrity and respect of the arm's length peer review process in the assessment of arts funding matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt, notwithstanding that arm's length peer review process, that the parliament has undoubted rights to ensure that proper processes exist, that they have been followed, that the money has been accounted for, and that those involved have acted in accordance with reasonable expectations of standards of public behaviour. I believe that with the explanatory document which I have previously given to Senator Patterson and these documents which I am now about to table, all those issues can adequately be pursued by opposition members. They may come back and be very concerned about what is shown up in the documents; that is a legitimate matter of public debate&mdash;although I think they all indicate that the process has been entirely proper. The opportunity for interested senators to pursue the undoubted rights of the parliament is covered in these documents that are being tabled and in the tabling statement that has already been provided to Senator Patterson. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To go beyond it is to move from accountability to a bit of a witch-hunt. A number of people sincerely believe that their reputation has been damaged in this process and that their integrity as members of the committee has been reflected upon. I do not want to start that debate as to whether that is right or not; those people are citizens and can speak for themselves. Some of them have written letters to the newspapers, et cetera about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that, while we do acknowledge the undoubted right of the parliament to seek information, we balance that with our responsibility to be concerned about the rights of individuals, and the credibility and independence of the arm's length peer review process, which I regard as very important. I think the balance of public interest is met by the compromise which I have developed and which I think will make all the information available that will enable people to make a considered judgment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I table the documents as I indicated I would in my previous response to Senator Patterson. I suppose for the sake of completeness I should table that document as well, although Senator Patterson already has it. I table the statement from me to Senator Patterson headed, `Return to Order' in response to her resolution and the documents to which that statement refers. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the documents.</PARA>
<PARA>It is not with great pleasure that I have embarked on the task of addressing the issue of the awarding of the creative fellowships. I know that it has caused some people concern. But if the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) had done the right thing in the beginning and not been so involved in appointing people to the original committee, we most probably would not have reached this point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some feel that the fact this issue is being raised in this way is in some way casting aspersions on their professional ability and integrity. I regret most sincerely if this has meant that some people feel that their integrity has been questioned. It would never have come to this if Mr Keating had not appointed the advisory panel to be at arm's length from the Australia Council because, as Mr Keating said, the Australia Council was stale. That is why he did it. The arts community is rightfully concerned that that committee was appointed by Mr Keating when he was Treasurer, which is not a normal procedure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very telling that the Minister for the Arts and Administrative Services (Senator McMullan) claims that the meeting of the advisory panel at which the first round of fellowships was considered was not formally minuted. Is the minister saying that no minutes were taken at a meeting at which it was decided to grant the recipients $1.4 million of taxpayers' money? If so, that is very disturbing. If they are informal minutes, then in the best interests of accountability they should be tabled in the Senate. That is the sort of thing that the arts community is concerned about, not the integrity of the people who are on the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a fact that the committee was appointed by Mr Keating himself. The minister will correct me if there are no minutes of the meeting at which the first scholarships were awarded. The decision should be seen to be clear-cut and one that was made publicly available to especially those of us who are charged with the responsibility of looking at how taxpayers' money is spent. An amount of $1.4 million was being spent in this case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the request for the tabling of all the documents pertaining to the appointment of the members of the original advisory panel, the minister has provided a letter from the then Treasurer, Mr Keating, to the then Minister for the Arts, Mr Holding, proposing seven people for appointment to the panel. A letter from Mr Holding to the Prime Minister proposed the appointment of the original panel. So Mr Keating wrote to Mr Holding proposing seven people, and Mr Holding wrote to Mr Hawke proposing those seven people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is the minister saying that these are the only documents pertaining to the original appointments? If so, it confirms my concern and the concern of many in the arts community that the panel was hand-picked by Mr Keating, not by the responsible minister or by the arts community, therefore letting it feel that it had a say in this peer assessment of what were to be very prestigious awards. The committee was picked by Mr Keating, not the responsible minister or, as I said, the arts community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my amendment to this return to order, I stipulated that the names and addresses of the members of the original panel be made available to senators upon request rather than be tabled. Using this alternative means, this information will not be put in the public domain unless the senator who requests this information makes a decision to reveal it in the public domain. That senator would then be subjected to the force of law. Senator McMullan may like to answer whether he will be making this information available to me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In regard to my request for Mr Tozer's application, the minister claims that the tabling of this information would be a breach of the information privacy principles. I remind the minister of the resolution of a committee of the whole that was adopted by the Senate on 21 May 1990 which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">that the principle, espoused by the Senate in 1971 and 1974, that there are no areas of expenditure of public funds where Statutory Authorities have a discretion to withhold details or explanations from Parliament or its Committees unless the Parliament has expressly provided otherwise, be re-affirmed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(ii) the affirmation, in accordance with this principle, that the right to privacy of individual counsel accepting a brief on behalf of the Commonwealth for which money is appropriated by Parliament is supervened by such acceptance, subject to the reasons for the information being clearly defined and to the proviso that injudicious or unwarranted invasion of privacy is not the intention of the Parliament or its Committees;</PARA>
<PARA>This precedent is directly relevant in this instance. The Senate has the undeniable right to scrutinise the expenditure of public funds, especially given the unusual nature&mdash;I think most honourable senators would agree&mdash;of the appointment of this committee. The Senate has a duty and a responsibility to ensure the accountability of moneys that it has appropriated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government has amazing double standards in the area of privacy. We have been called upon to extend the tax file number. At the same time that public servants are matching the most intimate details of millions of welfare recipients&mdash;many of whom receive less than $1,000 a year&mdash;on the basis of protecting the public purse, is Senator McMullan implying that he will not provide the Senate with the information that it requires to decide whether all due processes have been followed in the allocation of over half a million dollars to a single person? It seems as though there are different rules for different people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the minister tables the document in the Senate, he is covered by parliamentary privilege. Of course, any document that is tabled in this place is also in the public domain. Hence, if it contains identifiable personal information and is given to senators on a privacy basis, the publishing of that information would be a breach of the responsibility we have as senators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that the two objectives of individual privacy and public accountability do not inherently conflict. It would be possible to obtain a ruling on whether the claims made by Senator McMullan in his correspondence to me this morning, which he has tabled, actually do prevent him from tabling the applications. </PARA>

After reading the letter that Senator McMullan sent to me, I anticipated that that information would not be available in those documents. I therefore was anticipating that I would move my motion. The most appropriate thing for me to do would be to look at those tabled documents and to come back to the Senate at a later hour this day, and re-examine what we will do with the notice of motion that is standing in my name.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This matter relates to the awarding of one of the most prestigious awards to&mdash;we all would admit&mdash;one of Australia's gifted artists. It is in the interests of Mr Tozer, the Prime Minister, the minister, and also those who served on that committee, that it is shown and demonstrated to the arts community and to the Australian public that all due processes were followed in the awarding of these two fellowships.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If those processes were followed and if the minister can demonstrate that, nobody should take offence at the fact that we need to look at these things closely. An amazing amount of concern about the process has been expressed to me not from applicants who did not get the scholarship&mdash;we would understand when people do not get a scholarship that they may feel aggrieved&mdash;but from senior people in the artistic field. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have some disquiet given the very clear revelation that the advisory committee was set up by Mr Keating. One of the documents tabled by Senator McMullan actually talks about it being an independent committee. The document states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The grant of a Fellowship is made by the Australia Council on the recommendation of an Advisory Panel to the Australia Council</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australia Council enjoys statutory independence from the Government of the day</PARA>
<PARA>That is very difficult to justify when the original committee was apparently handpicked by Mr Keating.

I think the arts community needs to know about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One person in the arts community said to me, `I was staggered; I thought that was an Australia Council committee.'

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will look at those documents because obviously the minister, from his interjections, appears to be suggesting that there is more available in those documents than I would have thought from the letter that he sent me.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the guidelines, a child-care centre reaches basic standards only when both boys and girls are allowed to make mudpies in the sandpit. They say that a centre is deemed to be of good quality when staff realise that the need for lack of sex bias need not extend to minor areas such as expecting boys to dress up in female clothing if this conflicts with a family's expectation. It is ridiculous that we have to go through this, and it is even more ridiculous that a well-founded fear in the community should be promoted by this government. I know that various ministers have been embarrassed by these guidelines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the guidelines, it is unsatisfactory for staff to use the words `no' and `naughty' often, and it is unsatisfactory for staff to interrupt children's activities and expect them to conform immediately to staff demands.

The parents have the right to determine the quality of child care.

The only division we have on this side of the chamber is that we cannot work out whether to laugh or cry. Let us look at principle No. 3&mdash;this is wonderful stuff. The principle states that it is unsatisfactory for staff at a child-care centre not to encourage children to enter into activities that are traditionally regarded as more appropriate to the other sex; and that it is unsatisfactory for staff to provide stereotype toys such as trains, tip trucks and bulldozers for boys and dolls and tea sets for girls. Well, Senator Crowley, boys like playing with trains. Boys like playing with tip trucks and girls like dolls.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I guess I am pretty typical of many parents on Senator Crowley's side of the chamber. What does she think average Australians think when they read that it is unsatisfactory to provide toys such as trains, tip trucks and bulldozers for boys? Senator Crowley and the Australian Labor Party should get real. Most parents have actually given trains, tip trucks and bulldozers to their sons and have not suffered any embarrassment. Indeed, they have seen their children grow up, hopefully, in good health and with strong values as proud Australians. Equally, I confess&mdash;I say this on the public record&mdash;that I have given some dolls to my daughter in the past. I would not like any of Senator Crowley's Gestapo coming around, checking out my house and saying, `Senator Kemp is giving trucks to his son and dolls to his daughter'. This is what these silly guidelines say. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 550 guidelines that Senator Crowley has laid down there may well be some 500 which are perfectly satisfactory. I have not had time to read all of them carefully. There are a number there which are just plain damn stupid. They trample on ordinary Australian values. If only she could see the faces of her colleagues behind her when she attempted to explain her position in these matters. I have no query with the statement that staff should consistently provide equal opportunities for boys and girls to participate in all activities. But then the minister goes on to say that the staff recognise that this need not extend to minor areas, such as expecting boys to dress up in female clothes `if this conflicts with family expectations'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most Australian fathers are really happy to have their boys dressed as boys. It is no big deal. I suggest that to put something so profoundly silly and idiotic in the guidelines shows a total lack of balance and understanding of ordinary Australian families. On a number of occasions I have said that the Labor Party is so out of touch with ordinary Australians. This is not the Labor Party of old. This is the Keating Labor party of regency furniture, John Gould prints and trouble with the domestics at the palace.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Arising out of the first hearing of the estimates committee, there were certainly suggestions that the committee had been misled. In relation to the staff at the Lodge, the allegation is that they were misled on two matters. Firstly, there was an implication that the two housekeepers had credit cards and that they had failed to account for use of those credit cards in a way that was required by the department. The second issue is that they had been warned by the department that they would have to change their ways in relation to certain difficulties that were occurring in staff matters. Both of those issues were put on the record by Ms Tinney of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet in the Estimates Committee A hearing on 8 November 1993.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Subsequent to that, a statement was issued by solicitors for the two housekeepers which made clear that one of them did not even have a credit card to use on behalf of the department. Also, they both alleged that they received no warning of any dissatisfaction or any allegation of wrongdoing in relation to their work by the department. The situation is totally unsatisfactory in that the allegations made by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet are refuted by the housekeepers. Therefore, either the estimates committee was misled or the housekeepers are, in fact, incorrectly misleading the community at large. Obviously, that matter should be clarified and obviously the estimates committee should be reconvened in order that it be clarified. As I said, on the face of it at the moment, it would suggest that the parliament has been misled and it cannot be allowed to lie in that condition. </PARA>

The second matter concerned Mrs Betteridge who found that it was in her best interests to retire from the department after a telephone call from the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). Of course, the Prime Minister had gone public and said that it was Mrs Betteridge who had found the famous Thai teak table, when evidence put before the estimates committee&mdash;actually, it was not put before the estimates committee, it had to come out in subsequent papers that were tabled&mdash;was to the effect that she had been directed to the Prime Minister's friend, Mr Kenny, by the Prime Minister, and that was where the table was to be sourced. Again, there is contradictory evidence on the record of the estimates committee that needs to be clarified.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In normal circumstances, when this occurs the chairman recalls the estimates committee and the matter is settled. But in this instance, the chairman refused to do so, and it was necessary for members on our side to write to the chairman and request that he reconvene the committee.

More importantly, how does the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) deal with these people?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us take the case of the housekeepers. Let me get this clear: the housekeepers themselves have asked for an independent inquiry into this matter; the housekeepers themselves would support a reconvening of the Senate estimates committee so that additional questions can be asked. As I have pointed out, there are serious conflicts which have emerged between the evidence given at the committee by public servants and ministers and the information that has been given out since. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me list three key areas of conflict which have occurred. Were the staff members given fair warning? The answer is they were not. Although assurances were given by Senator Gareth Evans both today and in the estimates committee, they were not given a fair warning. Secondly, the issue of the use of credit cards has emerged. The housekeepers themselves have denied on a number of occasions that there was any issue in relation to this matter, but Senator Evans chose again to make this particular allegation against these people. The third issue which has emerged is: what were the reasons for these two housekeepers, who had given loyal service to the Prime Minister, being dismissed? According to what was told to the housekeepers, it was staff restructuring;  according to the evidence given at Senate Estimates Committee A, it was difficult interpersonal relations. Clear conflicts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put it to the Senate that these two individuals themselves want to have the chance to make sure that the record is put straight. We have had the reputations and names of these two workers traduced both in the Senate estimates committee and before this parliament today. In fairness to them, I believe it is important that the estimates committee be reconvened. I certainly put it to Senator Harradine, the Australian Democrats and the Greens that this is a motion which deserves their strongest possible support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the other matter, I can understand the sensitivity of the Labor Party. I would be sensitive if a Liberal Prime Minister was concerned about Regency furniture in the Lodge and the need to import a Thai teak table. I would be concerned if a Liberal Prime Minister decided to spend $100,000 on Gould prints for the cabinet room. I put it to the Senate that in the evidence that was given to the committee on this particular matter there was an attempt to convey the impression that it was the decision of the Public Service to purchase this Thai teak table. The evidence which has come out since shows that, indeed, the Prime Minister was the driving force behind it. </PARA>

He chose the latter course. He used and abused the American congressional system over the ensuing half-decade or more.

It has no powers of arbitration; it has no powers of intervention; it has no powers of redress. It cannot order that the housekeepers be reinstated, for example; it cannot make an appropriate award in terms of recompense; and, what is more, it sets an appalling precedent for other industrial circumstances within the Commonwealth's jurisdiction for the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For those reasons alone, this proposition of Senator Hill's ought to be rejected outright. We are again seeing a simple exercise in political frustration. Some elements of the coalition are determined, by any means available to them, to denigrate the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). Mr Acting Deputy President, no-one suggests that the Prime Minister or his family had anything to do with the determination in respect of the housekeepers. But some members of the opposition believe it is a way in which the Prime Minister might be damaged in passage.

The simple fact of the matter is that within the ACT framework or within the federal framework there are appropriate industrial tribunals open to the two former housekeepers to take their case.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. I support Senator Hill's call for the reconvening of Estimates Committee A to consider what I think most people on both sides of the chamber would now accept was inconsistent evidence at the estimates hearings about the dismissal of the two staff from the Lodge and the clear conflict of evidence that has been presented. With due respect to Senator Loosley opposite, I doubt that I have heard five minutes of more misleading, pious sophistry in my whole life than he put forward in defence of the government's approach to this matter. I do not know what the government is going to do. The bunch of Pontius Pilates opposite are all attempting to wash their hands of what has quite clearly been a miscarriage of the proper process of employer-staff relations. Indeed, in doing what they are doing, they are in conflict with the bill that they have just circulated in the Senate today&mdash;their Industrial Relations Reform Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know those opposite have not got an argument but what about listening to one. Section 170DB of the bill that the government is presenting today says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An employer must not terminate an employee's employment unless</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) the employee has been given either the period of notice required by subsection (2), or compensation instead of notice; or</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) the employee is guilty of serious misconduct, that is, misconduct of a kind such that it would be unreasonable to require the employer to continue the employment during the notice period.</PARA>
<PARA>Subsection 2 goes on to give the required period of notice under the government's bill, its policy and its industrial relations approach, which is worked out on the basis of the employee's period of continuous service with the employer. The period of notice, depending on that, ranges between at least one week and at least four weeks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know from the evidence given in Estimates Committee A that not only were those periods of notice prescribed in the present bill not given, but no notice was given at all. I quote from Estimates Committee A <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of 8 November, page 277, where the representative of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, Mrs Tinney, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They were not warned that they would be sacked.</PARA>
<PARA>Quite clearly, the fundamental point of an essential part of the Labor Party's own policy has been brutally breached. In the process of doing that, we have had the greatest filibustering and shibboleths mounted in this parliament in recent days, the worst of which was from Senator Evans today where there was a massive impugning of the reputation of those two employees. That performance by Senator Evans today was an absolute disgrace. Now the government is going to compound the felony by preventing a properly constituted committee of this Senate investigating the circumstances and the conflicting evidence that have already been given. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a classic case here of hypocrisy and double standards on the part of this government. But, more importantly, if we in this Senate are going to allow conflicting, misleading evidence to be given to the Senate through estimates committees or in whatever form, then we are doing a great disservice to the Senate generally and, in this particular case, we are doing a great disservice to two employees, who one would have thought deserved better from the person who purports to be the leader of this nation, but whose actions over a long time now and increasingly over recent weeks and months should deny any thought that he is truly the leader of this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the proposition that this matter should not go to Estimates Committee A. I do so on the basis not of going to the heart or the moral of the issue but because I am quite convinced as a result of chairing estimates committee meetings over time that this will only give an opportunity for senators on the opposite side to go in for point scoring. The last thing in their minds will be the interests of or justice for the two employees concerned. For approximately 32 of the last 44 years we have had Liberal-National Party governments in this place. I first began my career or my role in industrial relations in 1957.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On many occasions I worked as a boilermaker and as a part-time official of a union, as well. Continuously during that time we were told by the government of the day, that is, the Liberal-National party government, that the arbitration commission was the place to go to settle disputes. The government continually said, `Go to the umpire. Accept the umpire's decision'. There were times when we did that. The organisation I belonged to did that and so did many other unions. On some occasions we were able to get what we thought was a favourable result; we would have called it justice. On other occasions we did not. But one thing was certain&mdash;we did understand that the people in the commission had some expertise in making a decision or making recommendations to the parties about, for instance, unfair dismissals. Because of that experience they were able to make fairly objective decisions in many cases. It is true that the trade union movement has not always abided by this idea of going to the umpire; it always tries to kick a couple of goals before it calls the umpire on to the field.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the facts here are clear: two people have been dismissed and there is an argument about the correctness of it. I know a situation like this is different from, for example, someone being dismissed in a fairly large organisation because of the closeness of the interrelationship between people who are employed in a household. However, it is not beyond the capacity of the Industrial Relations Commission to consider it and, I believe, come down with a reasonable proposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For 32 years the trade unions have been subdued with fines. Now the opposition says, `Don't go to the commission and abide by the umpire'. Those opposite should stop being hypocrites. I suggest that people go through the arbitration system. If they are not members of the relevant union, they can become members of it, be represented and their case can be made. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the first report of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commission which was established in January this year. Commissioner Michael Dodson took up his appointment on 26 April, and this report covers the period from January to 30 June. It is a very significant and important report because the commission itself is also significant and important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report is comprehensive. It is very detailed and, given that it effectively covers an operational period of about three months, I am quite surprised by the extent of the issues canvassed and the detail. Obviously, Commissioner Dodson and others have a background of very detailed and comprehensive work in this arena over a long period. No doubt, this enabled them, in the first three months, to address such a quick build up of issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that chapter 1 of the report is addressed `Native Title'; chapter 2, `Self Determination'; chapter 3, `Education: Awareness'; chapter 4, `International Issues'; and, chapter 5, `Powers, Functions, Responsibilities, Resources'. As native title legislation is currently before the House of Representatives and will come before the Senate, it would be inopportune at this stage to comment on the section of the report relating to native title, other than to say that Commissioner Dodson obviously takes a very different viewpoint from that of the government. The agenda which he addresses in this report would, in effect, take many of the principles of native title much further than the government has done. I certainly draw the attention of honourable senators and other people to that very important aspect in respect of compensation or other issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The areas that are addressed with regard to self-determination, education and international issues require a considerable amount of very early attention. We would want to ensure that the proposals being put forward by Commissioner Dodson do not, in effect, try to lead the Labor Party or the federal government into any new agenda that relates to international and very special issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From my cursory reading of this report&mdash;it has been tabled only today&mdash;I draw attention to those parts of the report that almost imply that many Australian systems and institutions ought to be bypassed and that we should go directly to international agreements and arrangements of the United Nations in respect of areas that relate to Aborigines and indigenous people. I draw attention to the quite significant section of the report that relates to those issues. They certainly need to be canvassed and it is important that they be debated. I would hope that, at some future stage, there will be opportunities in the Senate for us to address these very important issues, particularly on behalf of Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole issue of self-determination, particularly&mdash;as Senator Boswell has said in this place&mdash;relating to the Torres Strait Islands, needs very special attention. There are areas in the report that pick up the principles of self-government for Aborigines. Again, these are new concepts that I think tend to march the agenda much further than native title. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new structure of the commission is set out towards the end of the report. I note that the commission will comprise some 24 staff personnel. That will obviously be a very expensive and very well resourced area of structural arrangement for government, and it will be important to look at a number of the issues that were addressed last year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Commissioner Dodson's own appointment has not been without controversy. As honourable senators will see from the rear of the report, his background is one of a Public Service career; he has not worked in the private sector. Commissioner Dodson has been closely associated with Aboriginal interests. In recent years, he has been the Director of the Northern Land Council and he has been integrally involved with the Aboriginal Benefits Trust Account in the Northern Territory. The administration over the last few years of these two organisations is under very severe criticism and will be the subject of an important Auditor-General's report to this parliament in several weeks time. Commissioner Dodson's performance needs to be judged in light of that report which will be tabled here shortly. Then, in the future, we must assess the work that he does in respect of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commission.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In this, the International Year of Indigenous People, it is more than appropriate that the first Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commission report be tabled in the Senate today. The issues raised in the report and the legal and historical context in which they are developed reflect both the major issues of profound concern to indigenous communities and also challenges which other Australians have faced in the past and will have to face in the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The importance of the report might not be immediately apparent to many readers, but the issues raised in terms of rights of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples will no doubt become important agenda items in this place and in other forums concerned with the rights of indigenous people. We have seen in the press in recent times new arguments and actions being taken by Australia's indigenous people. This report gives some of the intellectual and legal analyses on which these actions are being taken. On this I congratulate the commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The capacity of the commissioner to fully understand his task is clearly shown in a number of areas. Senator Tambling referred to the way in which the report is set out. Attention is given to issues which are listed under various headings. Commissioner Dodson quotes what was said by Michael Duffy, the then Attorney-General, when speaking on the creation of the position of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner. Mr Duffy said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But there continues to exist a need for us as a nation to regularly focus on the extent to which Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are able to exercise the basic human rights that the rest of the nation take for granted.</PARA>
<PARA>He then said that the creation of this office would provide this focus. One could have considered that it would have been appropriate to fill that position with someone of the Caucasian race with background knowledge and understanding and sympathy towards the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cause. The government did not do that. It appointed an Aboriginal, Michael Dodson. The commissioner states in the report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Criticism of the Commonwealth by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner may be seen as `biting the hand that feeds you'. . .</PARA>
<PARA>That is not the way it was set up. The government was quite prepared to give a person that responsibility within a certain framework and expect him to undertake the task in an objective and proper manner. He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There must necessarily exist a certain structural tension between the performance of my functions and the Commonwealth Government.</PARA>
<PARA>That is an acceptable situation as far as I am concerned. People do have certain biases and they may have a certain emphasis on issues that others do not. They may have been affected by matters personally and thus have a deep feeling about a particular issue. He further states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is my strong belief that the criterion for selection should be amended to require any future Commissioner to be an indigenous person.</PARA>
<PARA>I accept that that is a reasonable proposition. However, I would prefer to see a situation where that was not so but where people took that into consideration and were wise enough to appoint somebody of that race and from that particular background. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commissioner then goes on to recognise that there might be people who have an attitude towards him. He states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . to be identified as an `Aboriginal leader' and appointed by the Commonwealth to a position of influence may be viewed by some Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders as being co-opted by government.</PARA>
<PARA>For instance, this could refer to selling out. I think this report dispels any thought that anyone might have in that direction. He certainly did not do that and he states that he is not of that view. He then goes on to say in the report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is of critical importance, if I am to genuinely fulfil my Commission, that I accurately reflect the experience and aspirations of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples throughout Australia. To this end, I will not only consult, as I am obliged to, with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission but will also consult with community organisations and individual communities as much as possible.</PARA>
<PARA>Again that shows his appreciation that his view is not the only one and that he is there to look after the interests of a wide group of people and races in the community and he says he is prepared to do so. He must be commended for that. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commission report. I have not had time to fully read this document, but I was particularly interested to turn to the chapter entitled `International issues'. I suggest that honourable senators would be interested to read that chapter. It outlines in a very comprehensive way the international obligations that Australia has acquired through the signing of a wide variety of UN treaties, covenants and so on. There is an explanation of the particular articles which are relevant to the commission and it goes through in some detail the impact that these particular covenants will have on Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have not had time to closely read the material. It does raise some interesting issues for the nation. The obligations are acquired through the treaty arrangement, not because the treaties have passed through the Australian parliament but because they have been signed by the executive government. Often many of the rights which are specified are rights that most Australians in principle would subscribe to. We have to understand that, where obligations are acquired by the nation in a domestic sense, the way democracies do that is through parliament. I have a qualification there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report draws our attention to the importance of a recent government decision to allow domestic cases to be ultimately appealed to United Nations committees. I do not think that is disputed at all in the community. In doing this, the government has taken a very significant and important decision. It is a decision which overturned the philosophy of the Australia Act, and honourable senators will remember that that act severed links with the Privy Council. Five years later Mr Keating, Mr Hawke and Senator Evans, with their love affair with the UN, decided to ratify the first optional protocol which allowed Australian domestic disputes relating to human rights to ultimately be appealed to the United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think most Australians knew the importance of this decision. The government made a brief press release on this matter, but it has not puffed its chest out about it&mdash;no wonder. In a period of growing Australian nationalism, I think most Australians would be a little surprised that we have decided to involve UN committees in the Australian legal system. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is a third aspect of this report which Senator Reynolds, who is shaking her head, might care to look at. If we accept that we should overturn the philosophy of the Australia Act and we decide that it is appropriate that the UN does have a role in a range of domestic disputes, then we have to ask what the quality of these committees is like. Are these committees appropriately structured to deal with Australian cases which go to them? I have pointed out in this chamber on a number of occasions that these committees do not meet Australian standards of independence, judicial process and the normal standards of conduct of a court which we would expect of our own courts and bodies dealing with important cases such as these.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some members on these committees are nominated by governments which frankly are a disgrace on the human rights front. To think that these people would be making rules on human rights issues in Australia is offensive to Australians. I would see this as a growing issue. I certainly recognise that if one does not believe in the Australia Act and one overturns the philosophy and one believes that UN committees should become involved in Australian cases, then at least those people have a role to ensure that those committees are appropriately structured. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the report illustrates what I have been saying. These are important decisions and we should not hide from them. The report states that it expects many of the cases to go to these UN committees and quotes another report which mentions that a significant proportion of all Australian cases are anticipated to come from indigenous peoples. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take this opportunity to congratulate Commissioner Dodson on his first report. Senator Burns has indicated that it is a very important and significant occasion for the commissioner to report in this International Year of Indigenous People. I am disappointed that Senator Tambling and Senator Kemp seem a little more preoccupied with other agendas, instead of focusing on the significance of the social justice report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that Commissioner Dodson has been very honest in his assessment of the necessary tension in his role. I would like to read from his speech delivered at the launch of the report. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So delivering this first report is both a satisfying and a disturbing task. Satisfying in that it marks a commitment from the Commonwealth to confronting the issues honestly; disturbing because of the truth of those issues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In fact, as the first Commissioner, I find myself in a role fraught with tensions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">     . . .            . . .           . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nevertheless, I believe that in establishing my commission the government has acknowledged that constructive criticism is necessary for a vital democracy. It is my earnest hope that any tension between my commission and the commonwealth government will be creative and constructive.</PARA>
<PARA>That brings me to some of the references that have been made in this place and others about social justice issues. The whole question of the native title legislation creates tension certainly in the parliament and in the community. Australians have moved to a new place in history where we do have to view indigenous people from a totally different perspective than we have historically done so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that Commissioner Dodson has been quite critical of the welfare based model of government policies in a number of areas. As someone who has worked to ensure that governments around Australia do focus on the needs of Aboriginal and Islander people, I was a little concerned when I first read of that criticism. But I read further and saw that Commissioner Dodson was saying that governments have to look beyond the welfare based dependency that we have in some ways created for indigenous people. We have to be brave enough to ensure that, while those fundamental service provisions have to be there, we look beyond those services to self-determination and genuine self-government. </PARA>

<PARA>The 1992-93 annual report of the Members of Parliament (Staff) Act relating to consultants engaged under section 4 of the act once again makes very interesting reading. Section 4 of the act details the reasons for the possible engagement of a consultant by a minister. The report lists the details of 57 consultants who were employed by ministers of this government during the financial year 1992-93. There are in fact more than 57 engagements because a continuous period of engagement by the same minister is counted as one engagement even though in technical sense it could well be regarded as more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the deficiencies of the report that is tabled here annually is that, whilst it gives details of the names of the consultants, the period for which they are engaged, the minister by whom they are engaged and the duties of their consultancy position, it does not give the costs. We have to get around that by asking questions of the departments at estimates committee hearings and by other sources. The results for 1992-93 show that the cost of ministerial consultants has continued to rise, seemingly without a ceiling, despite the lower inflation figures and government claims that it cannot make expenditure cuts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1992-93 the cost of salaries and travelling entitlements for consultants employed under the Members of Parliament (Staff) Act ballooned by nine per cent to $3.14 million. That is a staggering figure. It compares with about $300,000 spent in 1983, the first year of this Labor government. In other words, over the 10-year period we have had something like a 10-fold increase in the annual cost of ministerial consultants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cumulative cost of ministerial consultants for the past nine years, from 1984-85 to 1992-93, has been $18.1 million. As I say, that cost has continued to escalate from year to year with seemingly no regard at all for the economic circumstances and requirements and the hardships being imposed on each and every other Australian as a result of the policies of the Hawke and now Keating governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that that is a disgraceful situation because it is an amount over and above the already extremely large costs to service the extremely large numbers of staff that all the ministers have anyway. It is the icing on the cake so far as ministers are concerned. It is being used, and I believe abused, in the most improper fashion to simply provide another resource to the ministerial office without really making use of consultants in the way that was envisaged in the act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These consultants are not consultants in the sense of being employed to complete a specific project and then go on and do other things or, more importantly, to end the consultancy; most of these people are employed on a continuing full-time basis. Virtually all of the 57 consultancies are ongoing positions. The salaries for these positions range widely&mdash;from about $68,000 or $70,000&mdash;to the top consultancy, which is paid by the Prime Minister to his chief scientist, of $120,000 a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that this matter would be of concern to all Australian taxpayers, who are increasingly seeing this government being unable to distinguish between the national interest, the interests of government, the interests of the people and the interests of a narrow political party for the use of taxpayers' money.

And that is what we really need&mdash;an Austrade and an export culture that will really make a difference in getting our products offshore. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report says that Austrade helps to win business overseas and bring investment to Australia. Having just been through Europe and central Europe in July, I believe that Austrade is doing a fantastic job in bringing trade to the fore. It is a difficult job because at the moment trade is having to suffer the imposts involved in getting our products offshore. These include increased costs of transport, brought about by increased fuel taxes in the budget, and the costs associated with the slow reform of the waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will allude to a few of the areas that are mentioned in the report. One is Austrade's responsibility to serve Australia's export community, including thousands of small and medium sized enterprises that currently export or may do so. Some of the areas are innovative, some are new and some are old. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Export centres, for example, which Austrade is now operating with the chambers of commerce, are helping people to understand more about what can be offered. The market analysis unit organises detailed research of overseas markets on behalf of exporters and makes sure that people in Australia know a little bit about them. I think that in the past Austrade has not done quite as well in that area&mdash;although maybe it will in the future&mdash;as it has in the overseas postings. The people over there do a fantastic job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The market opportunities unit distributes opportunities spotted overseas amongst the Australian exporters via the export intelligence unit. The network support unit arranges visits to Australia by foreign business people so they can learn what we have to offer them. Then there is the national export hotline. If people dial 132878 during business hours anywhere in Australia, they are connected to the hotline and told what services are provided by Austrade. About 30 or 40 calls a day go to those areas. </PARA>

Austrade is not perfect but it is the front line of our trade in foreign countries. If it can improve a little bit more in helping those prospective companies in Australia, I believe that it will give an even better report next year of the job that it is doing for Australia's export industries. </PARA>

<PARA>This very interesting report has only become available in the last hour. I think it indicates yet again the enormous inefficiency and the incompetence of the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation&mdash;ANSTO&mdash;which, as one sees if one goes back to the formation of the old Australian Atomic Energy Commission, is simply a continuation of the expensive, irrelevant and misguided direction that those two organisations have taken over many years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this report it is stated that ANSTO does not agree with the Australian National Audit Office's findings, which of course is not surprising, but the report is extremely damning. It says that the ANSTO went ahead with making arrangements with respect to this supercomputing facility without properly addressing all the issues, without competent assessment of the needs of ANSTO for supercomputing facilities, and indeed also without looking at the alternatives which were available to ANSTO. This all adds up to what I think the Minister for Science and Small Business (Senator Schacht) has already discovered&mdash;namely, that the ANSTO board is not particularly satisfactory. I understand that the minister has taken steps to get rid of the ANSTO board, and in my view it is about time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moving on from this report, one needs to recognise that something more needs to be done than simply changing the ANSTO board. What we have put to the minister, and what I would like to put into the record here in the Senate chamber, is that the Australian Democrats believe that ANSTO as a separate organisation really needs to be broken up and the various parts of ANSTO need to be dispersed, never to see the light of day again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have here a body which has consistently taken a very strong pro-nuclear line in a very political way. It has engaged in much of the public debate on nuclear issues and has taken a very partisan line&mdash;not a disinterested line, as it might have done. I believe that, given its pressure for a new nuclear reactor, and seeing that desire in the light of the Auditor-General's report in relation to supercomputing, one would say that ANSTO is not to be trusted with the notion of buying another nuclear reactor. What we would very much like to see happen is that ANSTO would be split up and that a decision would be made quickly that we are not going to buy a new nuclear reactor. Certainly that decision should not be left with ANSTO. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should quite deliberately go down the road of using cyclotron technology for the preparation of medical isotopes. That is one aspect of ANSTO's work which could be quite rightly and correctly split away and put into some sort of a medical setting. It might, for instance, come under the portfolio of the Minister for Health. The cyclotrons might be sited not within ANSTO but in association with one of the hospitals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that, in relation to ANSTO's participation in the regulatory functions and in the international obligations functions that Australia carries out with respect to things such as the International Atomic Energy Agency, ANSTO should be split away from those functions and quite correctly be put independently in, say, Senator Gareth Evans's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. That would leave quite a small part of nuclear research, which probably could be put with CSIRO. I understand that if that were done, CSIRO would not be particularly unhappy with that arrangement. It certainly does not want to have a very aging and ineffective nuclear unit&mdash;the unit at Lucas Heights&mdash;put within its control, with the enormous costs and inefficiencies associated with that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am drawing on this report&mdash;a report which indicates the incompetence and the lack of clear direction of ANSTO, the making of yet another major decision which was wrong, and the wasting of money&mdash;to urge the minister to go further with his actions on ANSTO, to split up ANSTO, and to put the various sections with other bodies so that ANSTO simply ceases to exist. I think the Auditor-General's report underlines the fact that that split is now urgently required and that he should not simply stop with dispensing with the old ANSTO board but should go a great deal further. </PARA>

I announced two weeks ago that, on the decision of cabinet, the present ANSTO board would be asked to resign and a new board would be constituted, with some members of the CSIRO board serving on the ANSTO board, to get better integration of the science arrangements and the science research programs where there is a natural synergy between many of the programs of ANSTO and CSIRO. In fact, CSIRO has facilities at Lucas Heights already. It should be noted that the present chairman of the ANSTO board, Professor Collins, who did the review for the government back in the mid-1980s to establish ANSTO out of the old atomic energy agency, said quite clearly&mdash;he repeated it in ANSTO's 1991 annual report&mdash;that there was no scientific reason why ANSTO should not be merged with CSIRO.

If, scientifically, there are good reasons to put it with CSIRO&mdash;for efficiency reasons or a better outcome for science&mdash;then I do not think they can be dismissed. If the non-scientific areas can be addressed, all the better. So cabinet agreed that we would constitute a new board. I have been told that all the members of the existing board have agreed to resign and that letters of resignation have been lodged with the government to take effect in the next few weeks so that a new board can be established. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the first jobs the new board will take on will be to respond to the recommendations and criticisms in this report about the supercomputer. I believe it is a matter of some urgency that the new ANSTO board prepare a response to this audit report for the government to be put back to parliament as is required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The existing ANSTO management in this present report has responded to and rejected most of the criticisms that have been made. However, I think one has to accept that there is considerable strength in the criticisms raised. I have had to raise those matters myself with the ANSTO board and management, since I have been minister. The concern I have, in particular, is that, on the financial side, the supercomputer is losing taxpayers' money. It was a substantial purchase and its operating costs have been high and its commercial viability has not been successful. I think the criticism&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Coulter" NAMEID="TF4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, and the criticism in the report is that there was a lack of real planning in the commercial sense as to who outside of ANSTO's own area would use the supercomputer. So I look forward to the new board of ANSTO dealing with this report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will make a couple of comments about the remarks made by Senator Coulter. I was, in general, pleased to hear Senator Coulter's remarks about the fact that there is a case for restructuring in nuclear science. I may not agree with some of his outcomes or suggestions, but I think he does make a good comment about where we are going with nuclear science and whether ANSTO as a stand-alone organisation should continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason for the government's decision to proceed to an administrative arrangement rather than with legislation&mdash;and I will be quite frank about this; it is in my statement of two weeks ago&mdash;was that cabinet was concerned that, with its present make-up, trying to negotiate a majority through the Senate on nuclear matters would not be easy. The main reason for that is that there is every indication that the opposition would just say, `No', full stop, and trying to put together a combination of the government, the Democrats, the Greens and the Independent to get a majority would not be easy and in the end we may fail. So the cabinet's view was: can we achieve most of these objectives by having an integrated board with CSIRO and working with a plan to get efficiencies in that area? I think we can get most of what we are about in improvement and a future for nuclear science at a level that is appropriate for Australia's needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cabinet's decision said that, after two years, cabinet would review the progress made by these present arrangements and if those arrangements were not successful we would then have another look at the structural arrangements. The new board will have a two-and-a-half-year life. I hope to be able to make an announcement in the next few days about the membership of that board. I think people will see that, if everything goes as I expect, we will have a board of vigour, enthusiasm, skill and competence to deal with the issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Coulter also raised wider issues about nuclear matters; in particular, whether or not we should have a new research reactor in Australia. The cabinet decision of over two weeks ago also dealt with the McKinnon review on this issue. The cabinet accepted the major recommendation that there is no need to make a decision as to whether we need a new reactor for at least five years. The existing reactor has about another 10 years of life and it would take five years to build a new one if we wanted to, so we have to make that decision in about five years time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also point out to Senator Coulter that that decision will not be made by ANSTO; it will be made by the government as part of public policy process. The main reason is that, if nothing else, it is a big, expensive item. There is a dispute about this, but some people estimate that the cost may well be $300 million to build a new research reactor in Australia. If it was not built at Lucas Heights it would be even more expensive because the existing infrastructure at Lucas Heights would have to be shifted somewhere else and that would be an additional expense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of McKinnon's recommendations also pointed out that developments in nuclear technology, cyclotrons and so on, may mean that in five years time we will have a better grip on whether the production of isotopes can be achieved by non-nuclear reactor means, and that major justification for a new reactor may no longer be there. So all of those issues will have to be weighed up. It will be a controversial debate&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The science section of my department, separate from ANSTO, will be asked to monitor the developments and keep a brief of what those developments are so that when the decision has to be made in five years time, the government has available to it a range of scientific evidence to be debated and assessed at that time. I imagine there will be plenty of people who will be raising these issues off their own bat. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Professor McKinnon raised the issue of the new reactor, saying that it cannot be justified purely on scientific or commercial grounds. It has to be considered in the broader sense of `what is the national interest'. Again, the national interest and Australia's having some capacity in and access to nuclear science is part of a wider debate. We should remember that the national interest will have a price tag on it. If we want to build a new nuclear reactor, there will be a price tag of $300 million plus, spent over five years. We are not talking about a small amount of money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tabling of this audit report is timely, in view of the recent discussions and debate about nuclear matters. It shows at the very least that there are issues that the government and the new ANSTO board will have to address about management of the super computer. They cannot be ignored. I will wait for the report from the new board about the matters it raises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As minister responsible for a number of statutory authorities, even though they operate under acts of parliament, with their own independent boards and their own duties to perform as statutory authorities, in the end I accept the responsibility to report to parliament on the expenditures of public moneys, because it is taxpayers' money that is being expended by these statutory authorities. In the end, for good or for bad, a minister has to stand up in this place or in an estimates committee and answer the questions that quite legitimately can be raised, such as: are we getting value for the public's money which is being spent in any of these statutory authorities? That is a fundamental issue of parliamentary democracy and I accept it, even though it means at times having to accept criticisms that are not necessarily of my own making, but I have to be responsible for them. I look forward to hearing the response from the new board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I think that the new arrangements that we are introducing for most of the staff at ANSTO&mdash;the scientific and research staff&mdash;will give them a better environment in the long-term future for the work which they conscientiously carry out in nuclear research and engineering. I look forward to a new era beginning at ANSTO. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS REFORM BILL 1993</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industrial relations debate since the March Federal election has served to contrast the markedly different approaches of the Government and the Opposition. Fortunately for Australia, the approach endorsed by the people in March this year was that of Labor, and it is Labor policies that will be implemented.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Fundamental to the Labor approach are both flexibility and fairness. This bill incorporates both. It marks the most significant step yet, in the Government's process of labour market reform, which is transferring the centre of gravity in industrial relations to the enterprise.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It does so in a manner consistent with the Australian tradition of a fair go. Strong protections for workers are integral. If we are to foster constructive partnerships in industry, such protections are essential. Workers must have security if they are to take part in achieving more productive businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Already, under this Government, Australia's industrial relations have been transformed. We have moved the system from the old adversarial model of `them and us' to a far more co-operative approach, where all sides recognise the need for improved productivity and competitiveness. A generation ago such change would have been unthinkable; today it is an accepted part of the environment, an environment created by the Accord partnership.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the Accord, there has been an orderly and effective transition to a more decentralised system, with close to 40% of employees in the Federal jurisdiction now under enterprise level agreements. Simultaneously, we have seen awards modernised and union coverage rationalised.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For over a decade, the system has consistently delivered responsible overall wage outcomes. Indeed, that decade has featured significant wage restraint, with real unit labour costs falling almost 7.8 per cent. The profit share has improved to the level of the early 1960s and the annual inflation rate is now 2.2 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All this has been achieved without divisiveness and with a dramatic reduction in industrial disputation. Indeed, the level of industrial disputes over the life of the Accord is 62 per cent lower than during the Opposition's last period in office.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Through this bill, Australia can move further along the reform path, consolidating what has been achieved while providing the springboard for further progress.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Opposition, in contrast, would have put Australia in reverse thrust. They would have cast aside the valuable gains made so far and destroyed the co-operation of recent years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Theirs is essentially a "back to the future" approach. Back to the sterility of social divisiveness&mdash;them and us. Back to the "good old days" of Victorian England when their version of flexibility was in vogue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We may all agree on the broad goal of increasing labour market flexibility. But it is the definition `flexibility'  that divides us&mdash;and on this there are crucial and fundamental differences.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Opposition's vision of flexibility is ideologically inspired. Yet that very ideology is the antithesis of any acceptable and effective flexibility. Under it there is simply the flexibility to cut wages and conditions and to treat workers not only as robots but also as a cost to be minimised.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In contrast, our approach focuses on achieving fair and constructive workplace flexibility and dynamic productivity growth. This approach encourages an effective  partnership at work and a highly skilled, adaptable and committed workforce. This is the flexibility that modern Australia is looking for.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In moving enterprise bargaining from adolescence to maturity, our new arrangements provide that flexibility. They put the onus on the industrial parties to take responsibility for their own industrial relations. In short employers, employees and their unions are encouraged to negotiate their own agreements&mdash;with less reliance placed on third party intervention by the Industrial Relations Commission. This is underlined by the establishment of a more effective framework for the promotion of direct bargaining.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unprecedented access to formal enterprise bargaining is provided through either certified agreements or enterprise flexibility agreements. The new stream of enterprise flexibility agreements is particularly significant, as they open the way for employers to make agreements directly with employees. It will </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">be an opportunity lightly unionised or non-unionised businesses should not miss.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The scope for innovation is already being exhibited through certified agreements that are generating an impressive range of productivity measures. With this form of agreements now supplemented by enterprise flexibility agreements, our industrial relations system can truly be said to provide employers with a multiplicity of opportunities to enact workplace change.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is especially so when one considers that the bill includes proposals aimed at making awards more streamlined and modern regulatory instruments. Awards will become simpler, easier to understand, up to date and have greater flexibility in their application.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The protections which are an integral part of our approach are also essential to fostering a more productive and cooperative workplace culture. They mean that workers will support and want to be involved in workplace reform.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Fairness is woven throughout this bill, ensuring its strength and viability. The bill:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">maintains an effective award safety net, extended through the guarantee of key minimum entitlements for all workers;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">continues the no disadvantage test as a basis for enterprise bargaining;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">provides a framework for fair and effective bargaining; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">protects workers against discrimination.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposals strike the right balance between enhancing flexibility and ensuring an adequate safety net of employee protection.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill has been framed following an extensive consultation process. The views of business, unions, State and Territory governments, community organisations and academics have been taken into account in its development.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This consultation process continued after the bills introduction into Parliament by the Minister for Industrial Relations on 28 October.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The views put by employers, unions and state and territory governments have been reflected in a number of the amendments made in the House of Representatives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reforms are richer for that process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I now turn to the detail of the Legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">New Objects and Restructuring of the Industrial Relations Act 1988</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under a broad aim of securing the economic prosperity and welfare of the people of Australia, these new objects will focus on:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the facilitation of enterprise bargaining;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the protection of wages and conditions of workers through awards and by ensuring that labour standards meet Australia's international obligations; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the provision of a framework of rights and responsibilities consistent with the move towards a more decentralised system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A new anti-discrimination object will help to prevent and eliminate discrimination on the basis of race, colour, sex, marital status, family responsibilities, pregnancy, religion, political opinion, national extraction or social origin.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Act will also be restructured to reflect the revised framework, with distinct Parts dealing with the award system; minimum entitlements; and the promotion of bargaining and agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The Safety Net</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill contains a number of amendments aimed at maintaining and strengthening the award system, with the Commission given responsibility to ensure secure, relevant and consistent wages and conditions of employment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The award framework will be maintained so that it provides an effective safety net underpinning direct bargaining, while having proper regard to the interests of the parties and the wider community. In determining safety net increases in wages and conditions, through test cases for example, public interest considerations will continue to be of particular importance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the emphasis is on a consistent framework of minimum award rates, provision is made for paid rates awards to continue and be maintained in areas where employees have customarily had access to them. However, if the integrity of such awards is not maintained, they will be able to be cancelled or varied appropriately. The Government expects that many presently covered by paid rates awards will progressively move to comprehensive certified agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments are also directed at making awards more streamlined and modern, with detailed prescription about the organisation of work increasingly being a matter for agreements. The Commission will have an important responsibility to keep awards up to date and easy to understand.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The more widespread insertion of enterprise flexibility clauses into awards will be encouraged. This will allow agreements to be reached at individual enterprises or workplaces to vary award provisions in line with their particular needs, subject to the employees concerned not being disadvantaged.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commission will also be required to have regard to internationally recognised principles under the ILO standards concerning workers with family responsibilities.  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Minimum entitlements</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The award safety net will be extended by guaranteeing to all workers without adequate protection access to minimum entitlements relating to minimum wages, equal pay for work of equal value, termination of employment, and unpaid parental leave.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the case of minimum wages, the Commission, on application, will be able to establish minimum wages for groups of employees, where they do not have access to adequate protection based on compulsory arbitration. These provisions give effect to Australia's obligations under the ILO Convention on minimum wages.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For equal pay, the Commission will be able to make orders to ensure that equal remuneration, including overaward payments, is established without discrimination directly or indirectly based on sex. This does not prevent differential rates of pay based on genuine job related grounds. The Commission must defer to other jurisdictions which give an adequate alternative remedy. These provisions give effect to Australia's obligations under the ILO Convention on Equal Remuneration and certain other international treaties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The termination provisions will apply where necessary for employees who have no protection that adequately meets our international obligations. For some, this exists, for example, under the job protection standards established by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission in the 1980s. The new Industrial Relations Court will be able to order reinstatement or other appropriate relief, including compensation, for employees dismissed in breach of the legal obligations placed on employers as required by our treaty obligations. Conciliation before the Commission will be available prior to Court determination. The Commission will also be able to make orders regarding severance allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Provision is made for cases of termination for economic, technological or structural reasons. Where an employer decides to make redundant 15 or more employees, the Commission will be able to order consultation with relevant unions. There will also be a statutory obligation to notify the Commonwealth Employment Service. These provisions give effect to Australia's obligations under the ILO Convention on Termination of Employment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There will be a legislative entitlement to unpaid parental leave along the lines of the existing parental leave test case standards. All workers will be guaranteed twelve months unpaid parental leave which can be shared between the parents of a child. The regulations will provide for such leave to also be available to adoptive parents. These provisions give effect to Australia's obligations under the ILO Convention on Workers with Family Responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Taken as a whole, the measures will ensure that all workers have access to basic protections. In States where the standards, as outlined in the legislation, are adequately met, the federal provisions will not apply.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The package of reforms will accelerate the spread of enterprise agreements and make formal workplace bargaining more widely accessible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A separate Part of the Industrial Relations Act will deal with direct bargaining. The use of agreements at the workplace or enterprise level will be encouraged.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A new Division of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission is to be established to deal with the promotion of bargaining and agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Appointments to this Division will be made directly by the Governor-General. There will, however, be full consultation with the President of the Commission before any recommendations are made to the Governor-General.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Two forms of agreements are provided for: certified agreements and enterprise flexibility agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both types of agreements must not disadvantage employees in relation to their terms and conditions of employment considered as a whole. To gain access to these agreements, employees' terms and conditions of employment must be covered by an award, providing the benchmark for the no disadvantage test.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The no disadvantage test has been an important innovation. Applying as it does to the overall package of employee entitlements, it allows for a wide range of variations to award conditions. It also allows for agreed reductions if these are judged not to be against the public interest, for example, as part of a strategy for dealing with a short term business crisis and revival.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, as the Government has consistently stressed, the provision is intended to protect well established and accepted standards which apply across the community, standards such as maternity leave, hours of work, parental leave, minimum rates of pay, termination change and redundancy provisions and superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Neither type of agreement will be able to be certified or approved if it contains discriminatory provisions, or is inconsistent with an order under the minimum entitlements arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Parties will be able to include a provision in their certified agreement that in some circumstances, enables them to vary it in a manner set out in the agreement. This will encourage longer term agreements. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On their expiry, agreements continue to apply indefinitely as awards, unless replaced by another award or agreement. The legislation provides new procedures for the variation of agreements after expiry, in order to increase certainty and provide an incentive for the parties to negotiate further workplace agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To provide access, particularly for the non-union sector, enterprise flexibility agreements will operate for employers who are incorporated and their employees at the enterprise who are subject to federal award coverage. The agreement will be able to cover any matters pertaining to the employment relationship. It will not be restricted to matters under the award or awards concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Such agreements should be for a specified term, and be closed and non-variable during their term unless the parties specify otherwise in the agreement. As is the case for certified agreements, their provisions would not be able to flow automatically into awards.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The operation of enterprise flexibility agreements will be based on the use of the corporations power. This removes the requirement for an interstate dispute and makes the arrangements more accessible. However, we are not seeking to intrude on areas of State jurisdiction by this mechanism. Enterprises will have access to such agreements where they are already covered by one or more Federal awards to ensure that there is an appropriate benchmark for the `no disadvantage' test and to avoid intrusion into state jurisdictions. Only employees under those awards will be able to be covered by such an agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There will be strong protections for employees, including the same `no disadvantage' test included in certified agreements provisions; the right to union representation for union members; a requirement for consent by a majority of employees; the protection of unionists from discrimination in an agreement's negotiation; and rights for relevant unions to be given the opportunity to be party to an agreement and to be heard on whether an agreement should be ratified. Unions will not be able to veto an enterprise flexibility agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislation recognises that non-unionised employees require further protection. Accordingly the Commission may refuse on public interest grounds to approve an enterprise flexibility agreement because of exceptional circumstances. Agreements are not to be taken to be contrary to the public interest merely because they are inconsistent with general principles established by the Commission in relation to awards.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To promote efficient bargaining, the new Bargaining Division of the Commission will be given the power to make orders that a party take actions consistent with its bargaining in good faith. There is guidance in the legislation as to what constitutes good faith. This includes attendance at agreed meetings; disclosure of relevant information; compliance with agreed bargaining commitments; not withdrawing or adding bargaining items capriciously; and not refusing to bargain with an organisation entitled to negotiate on behalf of employees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The promotion of good faith bargaining is a development of the Commission's conciliation responsibilities and is intended to be applied in a manner which is non-legalistic and facilitates the speedy resolution of disputes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Industrial Action </EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The development of a better framework for bargaining emphasises the need for a fairer and more effective regime to regulate industrial action and sanctions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A right to take action in the negotiation of agreements, and a distinction between the negotiation phase and the period when the agreement is in force, is the norm in most OECD countries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Industrial action&mdash;including strikes and lockouts&mdash;which take place during a bargaining period for a proposed, single business certified agreement will be immune from sanctions. Action involving personal injury, wilful or reckless damage or the unlawful taking of property, or defamation, will, however, not be immune. This aspect of the legislation will give effect to Australia's international obligations in respect of the rights of workers to engage in industrial action, subject to reasonable restrictions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For access to the bargaining period, a party must give notice to the other party of an intention to seek an agreement and must comply with directions from the Commission regarding bargaining in good faith. The parties must attempt to reach an agreement by negotiation before industrial action is taken in the bargaining period.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commission will be able to terminate a bargaining period on application if it considers a party is not genuinely trying to reach an agreement or is not complying with directions related to bargaining in good faith. The Commission may also end the bargaining period if the industrial action is threatening to endanger the safety, health or welfare of the public or cause significant damage to the Australian economy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In such cases, the Commission will be required to make a paid rates award, with it to operate for a fixed term, be `closed' and subject to higher monetary penalties which are to apply to breaches of agreements. This requirement will not apply if the parties agree otherwise, preferring to fall back to the award safety net and its provisions relating to consistent, minimum rates.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recognising the importance of parties abiding by the terms of their agreements, maximum penalties for breaches in this area will be significantly increased to $5000, and $2500 for each subsequent day on which a breach occurs. The parties will be able to vary the daily penalty by agreement.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sections 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act 1974 will be transferred in their industrial relations application to the Industrial Relations Act. This new equivalent to section 45D will apply to secondary not primary boycotts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The defences currently available under section 45D will be clarified and made more effective. Remedies of injunctions and damages arising from prohibited industrial secondary boycotts will remain. The pecuniary penalty of $250,000 now applying under the Trade Practices Act will, however, not apply to industrial boycotts covered by the Industrial Relations Act. This penalty has never been applied in the industrial relations context since its inclusion in the Trade Practices Act in 1977.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The prohibition on anti-competitive boycotts currently in the Trade Practices Act will remain in that Act, but will be reframed so that it does not apply to boycotts which do not have the purpose and the effect of lessening competition. This prohibition, the form of which was developed after consultation with the minor parties in the Senate, will not apply to genuine environmental or other protest action which, does not have the purpose and effect of lessening competition. The concerns of environmental and civil liberties groups about the application of section 45D to genuine environmental and other protests has been met.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There will be a requirement for pre-litigation conciliation by the Commission where, in relation to an industrial dispute, there is a contravention of the secondary boycott prohibition by a federally registered union or its members, officers or employees. This will be for a maximum of 72 hours, before legal action may be taken before the new Industrial Relations Court. It will be available once only in respect of a particular boycott, but will be cumulative for repeated boycotts. Access to the Court must be allowed before the expiry of that period in cases where the Commission cannot resolve the dispute or stop the boycott or if the Commission decides that substantial injustice would be caused by delaying that access. Any award of damages arising from the application of the legislation will be calculated from the time the harm commences.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These provisions are intended to meet a number of objectives. An effective remedy is to be available to deal with secondary boycotts. It is efficient and desirable to have industrial problems addressed in the first instance by industrial tribunals. Furthermore, the legislation has taken account of the ILO's Committee of Experts concerns that section 45D has been too wide in its application to primary boycotts and sympathy action.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has also sought to address the views of the majority in the Senate Standing Committee of Employment, Education and Training about the scope and operation of sections 45D and 45E.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Democrats have raised issues relating to the coal industry in this area. After the Minister has finished consulting with those concerned, he will be giving careful consideration to the appropriate institutional framework for this industry and the question of integrating the Coal Industry Tribunal with the Commission. The Australian Democrats can be assured that the coal industry is not intended to be treated any differently from other sectors in relation to secondary boycotts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is also to be a 72 hour pre-litigation period where tort actions are proposed to be taken against federally registered unions or their officers, members or employees for matters arising in relation to an industrial dispute.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">New Industrial Relations Court</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill provides for a new specialist federal court, the Industrial Relations Court of Australia. As a result, the industrial relations jurisdiction of the Federal Court of Australia will be absorbed into the new Court. This will include:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition to the establishment of a new court, the bill makes some other changes to existing institutional arrangements. The Commission will be required to encourage the establishment and use of Industry Consultative Councils, which are already provided for in the existing Industrial Relations Act, but seldom used. These Councils will provide a forum for parties in an industry to develop measures to improve efficiency and address barriers to workplace reform.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In line with the findings of the International Labour Organisation in relation to our current registration requirements for unions, the bill provides that the 10 000 minimum membership requirement for federally registered unions will be repealed and replaced with a 100 member requirement.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Conclusion</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In essence, Mr President, this bill will create an effective framework for enterprise bargaining and build on the reforms of the last decade. By tailoring those reforms to the needs of 21st century Australian workplaces, it will give our firms the ability to compete with the best companies in the world, many of whom are located in the Asia-Pacific region, the region we have only recently begun to call our own.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislation treats as sacred the principle that flexibility should not compromise employee entitlements. The challenges and ever increasing demands of modern economies leave us all a little insecure. If we deny employees protection, that insecurity can easily translate into fear, and into poor performance. Those are not the sorts of workplaces we want to create.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In a decentralised system, the role of the Government is necessarily small, necessarily facilitative. With the enactment of this bill, the onus will be on the industrial relations players&mdash;it is their opportunity.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In finishing, Mr President, I should make clear that the proposals in the bill could result in an increased workload for the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. Running cost supplementation may therefore be sought, if required. The resource implications of establishing the Industrial Relations Court of Australia have not yet been fully assessed. It is proposed that the Industrial Relations Court share Registry and other facilities of the Federal Court, wherever possible. Such an arrangement would help to minimise the establishment and recurrent costs of the new Court.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have much pleasure in speaking to the second reading of this Childcare Rebate Bill 1993. I wish to declare an interest in this matter, given that I am a consumer of child-care services and have an interest in quality child care for my two-year-old son. In saying that, I would like to put on the record my concern about the totally inadequate provision for child care in this Parliament House for staff, visitors and members of parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The facilities of Parliament House are generally excellent and a great deal of thought and expense has gone into them. But on the question of providing for children of those people who work in the building, it is an appalling criticism that the facilities are so lacking, even to the point of not providing a play area or facilities for children to be amused when they are in this place. Some would suggest that the recent accreditation debate would have given them quite large amusement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to make a few general comments and then discuss a couple of the major issues that have been raised in this debate and in the public discussion around the bill. The bill widens government assistance to families in paying for child care for work and study related purposes. The cash rebate will expand the children's services program objectives to include, first, recognition that the costs of all child-care arrangements are a legitimate work-related expense; second, to provide assistance to families using informal care as well as formal care; and, third, to provide assistance to families not benefiting from targeted child-care assistance, as well as providing some additional assistance to some families who already benefit from that assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not wish to go into great detail about the rebate scheme but I think it is important to note its basic features. After the first $16 of weekly child-care costs, families can claim 30 per cent of their costs up to a ceiling of $110 per week for one child in care and $220 per week for two or more children in care. The maximum weekly rebate will be $28.20 per week for one child and $61.20 per week for two or more children and will be paid over and above child-care assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rebate will not be income tested&mdash;I will return to this issue a little later in my speech&mdash;and will be available to parents who are employed, studying, training or looking for work. It will be paid for any work-related, formal or informal, child-care expenses for children up to and including 12 years of age. The rebate will be payable through the Health Insurance Commission with effect from 1 July 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The central thrust of the government's approach to child care has been to try to make child care more available and more affordable for Australian families. The philosophical underpinning of our approach on this bill is to recognise child care as an economic issue, not as a welfare issue. Affordable child care for workers and for those undertaking study and training is central to developing a highly skilled and competent work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the current unemployment problem leads some people to believe that that is not such a priority at the moment, we believe it is a priority that people are able to maintain and improve their skills and to utilise those skills in the work force. In order to do that, they must have access to good quality, affordable child care. This bill will extend the government's assistance to make sure that families have access to that child care and to assist them in meeting the costs of that care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some criticisms of the bill have been raised by the opposition and others, although I think it is often more at the margins than at its central thrust. The major debate seems to have turned around the issue of the universality of the rebate scheme. The government has rejected what is a superficially attractive option of means testing the rebate. I think that is a very hard decision for the government to come to in some senses. It is one that we have looked at very closely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unlike the opposition which claims that this is child care for millionaires and so on, we have not been persuaded by the easy rhetoric or the easy option on this. We have to look at what the rebate means in practice and examine the issue quite closely. There seem to be two central issues to this debate. The first is the principle of work-related expenses. The second is the question of progressivity of the impact of these measures. I would like to address some remarks on both issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal government has in recent years targeted welfare assistance. Some people would have expected us to target the assistance, as the opposition is suggesting, in terms of child care. But we rejected that approach because we reject the concept that the child-care rebate is welfare. We say that the child-care rebate seeks to recognise child care as a work-related expense for parents in earning an income, studying or looking for work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government intends to treat work-related child-care expenses in the same manner as other work-related expenses incurred in earning an income&mdash;that is, that they not be means tested. If one does not means test all those other deductions that apply to people in earning an income, whatever the size of their income, why should one treat child care any differently? We think that this is an important principle at the heart of the bill. Child care is a legitimate work expense and should be treated as such. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rather than approach it as a tax deduction, as has been suggested, we have gone for a cash rebate approach, and I will come to that issue a little later. In the bill the government is committed to recognising the principle that child-care assistance be recognised as a work-related expense; that we must give legislative effect to that principle; and that we must apply the same principle that we apply to other work-related expenses. It is not welfare; it is a legitimate work, training or searching for work related expense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second aspect of the debate that I wish to discuss is the question of progressivity in terms of the impact of the rebate. Much has been made of claims that it is providing child care for millionaires and that it is the poor subsidising the rich. Quite frankly, they are very hard issues to respond to. When one says that people on any income will receive a rebate, no matter how high their income, it is obviously a difficult issue to deal with in the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the issue more closely we will see that that is just not the case. The opposition is proposing amendments to means test the rebate at around the $50,000 to $60,000 mark and suggests that this will in some way solve this problem of the progressivity of the rebate. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a very piecemeal answer to the issue and misses the main point. We think one has to look at this rebate in the context of the whole children's services programs. If one does that, and looks at the impact of all the measures that this government is taking in providing child-care assistance, one sees that the impact of the rebate is far more progressive than has been suggested. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two things that people have to look at in coming to terms with that debate: the first is the question of the rebate being capped, and the second is the impact of the child-care assistance program as it relates to the rebate. Firstly, in terms of the capping, families are unable to claim a rebate of fees above capped rates of $110 a week for one child or $220 a week for two children. This capping ensures that the rebate is not supporting the use of overly expensive or one-on-one type child-care arrangements. We have set a cap at what is a reasonable rate for child-care expenses for an ordinary family. It has an important economic impact, because the maximum rebate entitlement for one child, whatever the outlay on child care, is $28.20 per week and, for two children or more, $61.20 per week. The capping has an important impact on this whole issue, whatever the family's child-care costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second aspect I want to address is the interaction of the child-care assistance program with the rebate. The interaction of the two programs results in assistance to families having a progressive rather than a regressive impact, as has been claimed. It is important that the Senate and the community come to terms with this issue because if one examines it closely one can see that it is quite a progressive measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to assist in the debate, I have been provided by the minister's office&mdash;and I thank the minister for that&mdash;with examples of how this will impact on families in Australia. It is worth reading into the record an analysis of what this means. I am using an example based on an average long day care centre fee of $124 a week. If the centre charges that fee of $124 for one child in care, we can then look at the impact of the child-care assistance scheme and the rebate scheme on families at different levels of income.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the purposes of the example I have chosen a family on less than $24,000 per annum, which would be entitled to the maximum child-care assistance; a middle-income family on an income of about $800 a week; and a higher income family on the minimum at which it would become ineligible for child-care assistance of $1,137 per week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one examines the impact of the two systems on each of those families with one child, the evidence is this: the low income family ends up receiving total assistance from the government in terms of child-care assistance and the rebate of $98.20 per week. The family pays $25.80. That is the family's contribution to the care for that child. A middle-income family under the same conditions receives total assistance of $65 per week but its contribution is $58.70 a week, so its assistance is lower and its contribution is higher. The same principle applies to a higher income family which is not entitled to child-care assistance; its rebate and, therefore, its total capped assistance, is in the order of $28.20 per week, but the family pays $95.80. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The interaction of the two schemes results in a progressive impact. Assistance is greater for those at the lower income levels and less for those at the higher income levels. The cost to the families is progressive in that the higher income families pay much more and the lower income families pay a minimal amount. That is very important particularly when dealing with the opposition's amendments. They have this superficial appeal and encourage the easy rhetoric, but do not really go to the examination of the total impact of the children's services programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will address the issue of why the government has chosen to provide the assistance in the form of a rebate rather than a tax deduction concession, as has been done with other work related expenses. It is fair to point out and explain, as we follow the philosophy of establishing child care as a work related expense and with the arguments being mainly economically based, why we have gone for the rebate rather than the tax deduction. This approach has been adopted by the government for a number of very good reasons which really make a convincing case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, the rebate is fundamentally fairer than a tax concession. Lower income earners get relatively little benefit from a tax deduction; higher income earners get a relatively larger benefit from the tax deductibility of an expense. So it is a fundamentally fairer proposition. Secondly, unlike tax concessions, the rebate will be able to be claimed as regularly as weekly. It will allow for immediate assistance for families who are struggling to meet those expenses, including child care, that they face on a weekly basis. If we went down the tax concession route, families could be waiting 12, 18 or 20 months for the advantage that comes with such assistance. So it is a much more immediate proposition. For those families particularly in need or struggling&mdash;and there are a great many of them at this point in our history&mdash;it is an important decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third important aspect is that the rebate will benefit persons who would otherwise not benefit from a tax concession. People on low incomes, with no income or who are studying would not benefit from the tax concession approach. The net we cast is wider and brings in a range of people who will benefit from the rebate who would not benefit from a tax concession. Fourthly, there is an advantage in this approach which is consistent with the approach we have adopted in the new home child-care allowance scheme, which replaces the dependent spouse rebate, in that that is also being paid regularly&mdash;I think on a fortnightly basis&mdash;to a non-earning parent. I think there is a very good case for the approach adopted for the rebate as compared to going down the tax concession route. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I would like to make some general comments on the Childcare Rebate Bill. I was going to make some mention of the bipartisan support for good quality child care that had existed. A couple of opposition members in the lower house in speaking to the bill did contribute usefully to the debate and Senator Patterson also made a useful contribution. But my enthusiasm for such a line has been sorely tested by the accreditation debate that occurred earlier today; it was deplorable. One of the things that saved me from it was that my son was watching <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Play School</EMPHASIS> at the time, and we had the Senate turned off for part of the debate. I think that was probably a good thing for those of us in the room. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a concern that the opposition seems to be backing away from support for good quality child care when so many young Australian children spend large amounts of time in child care. I think it only appropriate that we try to get a good quality system that has some measure of accountability so that people can rest assured that their children are properly cared for.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is unfortunate that in the debate on the rebate bill in the House of Representatives the honourable member for Cowan, Mr Evans, my namesake, showed that we have a long way to go in this child care debate and that, despite some more enlightened members on the opposition benches, there are still those who wish to cling to some outdated view of Australian society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Cowan referred to the feminist push which grossly undermines the role and importance of motherhood. This was part of the whole general nonsensical tenor that he adopted. This legislation is about a balance of initiatives for workers with family responsibilities, with recognition of the important social and economic contribution of women working in the home. This does not in any way undermine the contribution that men or women who choose to stay at home and care for their children make. We are addressing some of the concerns in relation to those people through the home child-care allowance and other measures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What really concerns me is that those members of the opposition and some members of the community seem to long for a distant past, sometimes I think an imaginary past, when women did not have to work and were not forced out into the work force. They wish that all people in Australian society share their longing for this golden era. What this government is trying to do in addressing child care is deal with the reality. The reality is that in many families both parents or the sole parent work. They therefore are required to utilise child-care services. This bill is about recognising that fact in Australian society and providing some assistance for them in doing that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is also about empowering women, because women still remain the primary caregivers for children in our society. So yes, it is about that, and we make no apology. It is about justice and equity for those persons as well as economics, as I have explained earlier. But it is not a purely feminist issue. Child care is an issue for all parents, and certainly for all families where both partners or the sole parent work. It is an issue which men are very concerned about, as well. If honourable senators opposite were to look at some of the surveys about attitudes to issues in Australia, they would find that child care is a big issue for men as well, as it should be for all parents. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mrs Kelly's reports, I presume is what we are talking about. This bill and the policy behind it reek of being driven by left wing feminists to enable middle and upper income women to have taxpayers pay for their child care. It is not just us saying that and it is not just the National Party, as Senator Evans says. A very prominent Labor person and identity has the same view. A former Labor minister, Senator Peter Walsh, said in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> recently:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For the past decade Labor has allowed its child-care policy to be determined by a self-serving symbiotic coalition of feminist networkers, non-market service providers and early childhood services educators. Consequently, it has been flawed by internal inconsistency, cost-ineffectiveness and a benefit distribution somewhere between random and regressive.</PARA>
<PARA>It is not just the coalition that has this view about the government's mishmash of child-care policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first point I want to make is about the cost of this policy, something that never seems to be mentioned by this government&mdash;the cost of what it is doing to this country. The government estimate is that this will be $151.8 million in 1994-95 and another $14.1 million in administration costs. So we are talking about nearly $170 million to start with. The administration costs in 1993-94, before the scheme even comes into effect, amount to nearly $6 million. I bet that when we see the final figure it will be a lot more than that. I understand that the parliamentary library estimate, an independent estimate, of this whole proposal is that the full year cost could be nearly $238 million. Like most government programs, the cost is bound to exceed that which the government estimates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget forecast for total expenditure on child care is that it is going to double over the next four years. In 1992-93 we spent $546.2 million. By 1996-97 that is going to be $1,023.6 million. So we are going to spend over $1,000 million on child care, when this government says to one and all that its overriding policy objective is to reduce the budget deficit. Yet here we plan to spend over a thousand million dollars on this particular scheme and, in this case, to benefit middle and higher income earners&mdash;from the party of the workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What appals me particularly, coming from South Australia, is that the government's proposal to attack the wine industry was only going to raise less than half the amount of money that it is going to spend on the child-care rebate. So the government is going to risk the future of the wine industry to raise less than half the money it was going to take to buy off this particular group of people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are several very significant problems that I see in this child-care rebate proposition. The fundamental problem is that it continues the government's bias against families in which the mother sacrifices her income to care for her own children at home. The policy is biased against them and towards those mothers who put their children into child care and go into the work force. There is a complete lack of equity, a lack of fairness, in the treatment of mothers with young children. The government seems to have no regard whatsoever for the role of mothers who choose to look after their children full-time at home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All we are seeking is that the government be fair in its treatment of mothers, that it treats them in a neutral way and that it does not bias policy one way or the other. The government's approach to assisting families with children is completely wrong. It has ignored the principles of fairness and choice. The policy in this area should be all about maximising the choice for mothers with young children, the choice between caring for their children themselves at home or the choice of entering the paid work force and putting their children into child care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not saying that the government should have a moral position one way or the other; we are saying that the government should be neutral in its treatment of mothers with young children, and it most avowedly is not. In my view&mdash;I have put this view before and I will keep putting the view&mdash;this whole extravagant mess should be replaced with a universal child tax credit or benefit so that we are putting the purchasing power in the hands of mothers who have young children and leaving them with the choice of whether they use that purchasing power to enable them, or make it more realistic for them, to choose to look after their children themselves or whether they choose to spend that money on child care. But give them the choice, put the choice in the hands of the consumers, instead of these producer-driven schemes which this government continues to thrust upon us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This child-care rebate provides very dubious incentives. The government is clearly using its taxpayers' funds to provide an incentive to women to put young children in child care and to enter the paid work force. We are not saying that women should not be free to choose to do that, but we do object to the government using taxpayers' money to put carrots in front of women to make that choice. The government is using taxpayers' money to embark on the most extraordinary experiment of the late 20th century. The government is providing incentives that will result, in its earnest hope, in the placing of a whole generation of young children in institutional child care. It has no idea what the consequences of that move will be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is increasing evidence in the United States, where this whole policy agenda has been much more advanced, that prolonged day care may well be very harmful to young children and lead to significant behavioural problems. But this government is disregarding all of that and using the money that it takes from taxpayers to embark upon this extraordinary experiment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is completely ignoring the considerable evidence that a majority of mothers of young children who are in the paid work force would rather be at home looking after their children. It disregards what popular opinion is all about. It is disregarding the public in relation to Mabo and so many other issues. It is disregarding the attitudes of mothers with young children who have been forced into the work force by economic circumstance due to the government's destruction of the economy. It is not giving them the realistic choice of staying at home and looking after their children, as so many of them clearly want to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why on earth should the government be actively using taxpayers' money to encourage mothers of young children to enter the work force? What is the rationale of that when there is 11 per cent unemployment&mdash;one million people cannot get a job as a result of this government's policies?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Peter Walsh who, as I said before, is stridently opposed to this proposal, said in the same article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But surely a time when unemployment is around 11%&mdash;the highest in 60 years&mdash;is not the time to provide further incentives&mdash;skewed in favour of those with high incomes&mdash;for married women with young kids to join the workforce.</PARA>
<PARA>All we are seeking is neutrality, but this government is providing taxpayers' money to give these people an incentive to go into the work force at a time of record unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The parliamentary library, an independent source on such issues, stated in its Bills Digest on this bill:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The scheme also seeks to promote greater labour market access at a time when there is clearly an oversupply of labour.</PARA>
<PARA>At a time when government policy should be focused on reducing unemployment, the government is about to spend over $170 million a year on a scheme which could increase unemployment. It is a most extraordinary proposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government seeks to justify this rebate on the grounds that `the cost of child care is a legitimate expense for parents earning an income'. This might sound very attractive, rational and logical, but where would that kind of principle really end? There is an endless list of what might be regarded as legitimate expenses which, if made rebatable, would totally destroy this government's budget. If that logic were adopted, all travel to and from work, work clothing, meals associated with work, home cleaning, gardening and every domestic service that could possibly be thought of should be  rebatable or tax deductible expenses. It is an absolute nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People have children by choice. It is not forced on them in relation to their employment. This legislation represents one of the worst kinds of window-dressing for a radical proposal and it is quite wrong. The government is very wrong to introduce it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of legitimising this proposition in relation to rebatable expenses, the government has ignored the fact that it should well know that the best tax system has as few rebates and tax deductions as possible. The reason the tax systems get so complicated, difficult and expensive to administer is that there is a system of deductions and rebates. A philosophy of keeping rebates and deductions to a minimum enables tax rates to be kept to the minimum level possible. Introducing rebates and tax deduction, by definition, increases the rate of tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even if we accept the government's argument, we really must wonder why there is a periodic cash rebate used in this case. Why do we not have a tax rebate at the end of the year? Why introduce this extraordinary complexity, the use of Medicare offices and all the other problems that are associated with the incredible expense of over $14 million in administering this scheme, to provide a cash rebate? It has never been done before and it is completely unjustified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I am extremely concerned about where this scheme will lead. It is not beyond any stretch of the imagination to postulate that the next step will be that this rebate will only become payable in respect of accredited child-care centres. The government's push on the accreditation of child-care centres and the compulsory nature of that in relation to fee relief strike terror into my heart in relation to the whole child-care rebate scheme. I lay a bet that, later down the track, we will see the government's advisers saying that the only way to ensure proper accreditation, et cetera, is to pay this rebate only in respect of accredited centres. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, this rebate scheme is completely wrong. It was dreamt up in the heat of a campaign by a government desperate to grab as many votes as it could. It is absolutely the parallel of the sports rorts of the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly). It is unfair and inequitable; it is grossly unfair to women who sacrifice an income to stay at home with their young children in order to bring them up in the manner they so choose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This scheme will be an inappropriate use of taxpayers' funds in the context of what the government says is this nation's overriding problem&mdash;a massive $16 billion government deficit.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As has been outlined by the previous speakers, the Childcare Rebate Bill 1993 introduces a cash rebate for work related child-care expenses. I will not spend time going over the details&mdash;particularly the financial details&mdash;of the scheme. The bill is aimed at providing direct financial assistance for child-care costs to those families that are presently not receiving in any way targeted child-care assistance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To qualify for the rebate, each parent has to be working, or the single parent has to be working. That means that they have to have recognised work-related commitments. This includes undertaking recognised study or training. It is defined as covering unemployed people who are registered with the CES and those who are receiving a carer's pension or a domiciliary nursing care benefit, as both of these last two commitments are seen as involving full-time work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have some problems with that definition. I will be speaking further on this when Senator Harradine moves some amendments. Families receiving maximum child-care assistance, or what is known as fee relief, will not be eligible for the rebate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Child-care providers will be registered with the Health Insurance Commission. The rebate can only be claimed if the expenses are paid to a registered child-care provider. Families will also register with the commission and lodge their claims through local Medicare offices. Contrary to earlier speculation, applicants will not have to provide their tax file numbers to the HIC, although providers will have to satisfy the commission that they have a tax file number before they can be registered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very pleased that this is the way in which it is being done. At one stage it certainly looked as though this scheme would be another extension of the tax file number. We recall the bombshell dropped in here by Senator Crowley in the autumn sittings when she said that the government was looking at requiring carers to provide their tax file numbers to a Medicare office. As I said at the time, that was completely unacceptable to the Australian Democrats. Looking back now, it seems as though the idea was run up the flagpole to see how far it would go. As it turns out, it did not go very far at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We made it very clear at that time&mdash;I know that Senator Newman also expressed concerns&mdash;that we would not support a situation where people were forced to give their tax file numbers in order to claim the rebate. The Democrats are pleased to see that another method has been found and that that idea was put in the rubbish bin where it belongs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me now deal with the scheme itself. The Democrats will be supporting this legislation, although we have some misgivings. For example, we wonder whether the money going into the scheme&mdash;which, as has already been said, is around $150 million a year&mdash;would not have been much better spent in improving access to child-care services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Cost is only one part of the problem for many parents who are looking for child care. There are major problems with access to more flexible types of care, such as emergency or relief care, out of school hours care, child-care options in rural areas, child care for children with special needs and so on. The $150 million would have bought quite a bit of additional care in these areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is narrowness in the scheme. The rebate will only be available for people who are in employment or who have recognised work-related commitments. As we have said many times before, the Democrats have problems with that. We really need to look at the value of unpaid work and formally recognise unpaid work, most of which is done by women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recognition of the value of unpaid work necessarily involves an acknowledgment of the importance of non-work related child care. From that perspective, this rebate scheme fails to address two critical matters. First, if we do not provide access to child care for carers at home, we are not only refusing to acknowledge their significant economic contribution, we are also denying them an opportunity to fully participate in society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Second, the Democrats think that it is time we looked at the idea of payment to carers who are choosing to stay at home and care for young children, whether those carers are men or women. That payment needs to go much further than the home child-care allowance which the government also promised at the last election. It really does need to provide choice; it needs to provide a sufficient level of funding so that there really is an option for those who do wish to stay at home. We have to find mechanisms that really give women the right to choose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is certainly a growing recognition of the tension between employment and family responsibilities. The 1991 OECD paper called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Shaping Structural Change: the role of women</EMPHASIS> pointed out:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most women are now forced to juggle household and family demands with involvement in paid work structures designed to fit male employment patterns. Men miss out on the emotional rewards of the care and development of children because they are similarly constrained by the gender-based division of household and employment responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA>In short, we basically need to make sure that both men and women really can make choices which suit their families, their employment situations, their caring needs, their careers, and, indeed, their personal desires&mdash;without incurring serious penalties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The challenge before us is to recognise the value of that unpaid work. We have to support those who do choose to spend a period of time at home caring for young children. I really do not see why we cannot meet that challenge. The Democrats urge the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to look beyond this child-care rebate scheme and beyond his proposed home child-care allowance and to begin to fully explore the issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the issue of means testing the rebate. This was not an easy decision for us. We spent a long time looking very hard at what exactly this government was doing, particularly considering the economic constraints that we are facing as a nation at the moment. There certainly are two sides to this debate. We looked very carefully at a wide range of concerns expressed to us about the regressive nature of the rebate scheme. But, in the end, we decided to come down on the side of moving child-care out of the welfare basket and into the community responsibility area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had to come down on the side of seeing child-care as a legitimate work related expense and we had to come down on the side of those 230,000 families and 358,000 children who will benefit from this rebate. The premise underpinning this scheme is one of equating child-care with other expenses&mdash;genuine expenses&mdash;incurred in earning an income. In other words, it is shifting the emphasis of the debate from being one about a women's issue or a welfare issue to one of it being a community issue or an industrial issue. I think that shift in emphasis is very important; it is long overdue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a shift which says that child-care is no longer the privilege of a few and that it has to be accessible, affordable, of a very high quality, and that it is a basic or essential service and not a welfare service. It is putting child-care on the same basic list of human rights as education and health. In my view, collective acceptance of those basic rights and entitlements is a measure of the maturity and the economic and social good sense of a society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats are strong in their belief that these services should be publicly funded through taxation to ensure that all Australians have access to an adequate standard of education, health and child-care. I found it very interesting to listen to coalition speakers who now want to means test this payment, and to look back at their policy of introducing tax deductibility with absolutely no cap, no limit whatsoever. Surely they have to acknowledge that the scheme we are looking at today is far less regressive than the tax deductibility they are actually planning. Their continuing push for non-means tested, non-capped tax deductibility really undermines their total argument and all their credibility in this debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have already indicated, the Democrats will support this legislation. But, because we do have some concerns about the operation of this scheme, I have asked the minister whether she will consider an evaluation of the scheme after the first two years of operation. Such an evaluation will provide us with an analysis of claims made under this scheme and will give us a chance to look at exactly who is able to access the system and who is missing out. Senator Crowley has provided me with a written undertaking to review the scheme at the end of 1995. I thank her for taking our concerns on board and I seek leave to table the letter. </PARA>

As Senator Lees spelt out very well, means testing the rebate is completely contrary to previous policy of the opposition. Not only was it not going to provide a rebate but, before that, it was going to provide a non-means tested tax deduction, which is particularly regressive. I would suggest that Senator Minchin might repair to his own party policy over the past few years and look at that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When women are finally provided with a rebate that recognises the cost of child care as a legitimate expense in earning an income, what does the opposition want to do? It wants to means test it. I have never heard those opposite come in here and propose to means test lawyers' libraries. I have never heard them come in here and propose to means test doctors' refrigerators. I have never heard them talk about means testing any of these rebates or tax deductions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Women have been fighting for this recognition for many years and&mdash;as the opposition policy intermittently has recognised&mdash;the first time this is provided to women the opposition want to means test it. The opposition is taking an extraordinary stand which is particularly anti-women, especially when those opposite say that they are in sympathy with women. This clearly shows that they are not. It is entirely consistent with the opposition's view on all other tax matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the amount of tax dollars that are forgone through tax deductions&mdash;around about $5 billion against all of those expenses legitimately claimed under the present tax laws by all sorts of people in the earning of their income&mdash;there is not a word of objection from the opposition about that. But the minute women get access to a vital tax rebate in an area that has been absolutely critical for them&mdash;one for which the opposition has argued&mdash;the opposition wants to means test it. The opposition is sending women voters a very contradictory message. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to reinforce the view of the government that by recognising child care through this rebate it moves it from being seen as a welfare payment to a recognition as a major economic issue and part of labour market considerations. It is the first time that we have been able to recognise child care as a legitimate cost of earning income. I do not understand at all the inconsistency and illogicality of the opposition's policy on this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will make a few comments about the privacy matter. Opposition senators seem to suggest that I and this government have no concerns about privacy. That is completely contrary to the facts. I am particularly concerned about privacy. I am not going to run in this place all the arguments that I have used in other places, particularly in discussions about this legislation. I have very serious concerns about privacy and I have had them since the earliest stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is important and interesting to note that those concerns are well met by the Democrats who have always been consistent on this matter and by the opposition which washes a bit hot and cold. We have a system that balances privacy and accountability considerations. As honourable senators have said, this is a large amount of money and it would be quite improper for me or the government to disregard the requirement for fair and proper accountability. At the same time, the government is particularly concerned that the privacy considerations also be taken into consideration. I believe the outcome that the government has provided is the best balance between those two considerations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A person's tax file number will not in any way be provided to the Health Insurance Commission. The Health Insurance Commission will not be able to record it, note it or in any way take account of it. The only thing the Health Insurance Commission will do is pass the names and dates of birth of the people who have registered as providers of child care to the tax office so that the tax office can confirm that those people do have tax file numbers as they claim on their reports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the matter of privacy ought to be laid to rest. It is a matter of major concern. The government has taken that into account and I have been very concerned to take it into account. I believe the government has struck a very good balance in terms of the outcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition trawled in the red herring of accreditation. Senator Minchin got quite carried away in his speech and suggested that in the end the government would be providing the cash rebate only to accredited centres. Senator Minchin is particularly mischievous to say that. This legislation spells out quite clearly that the cash rebate will apply to formal and informal child care. That is what the legislation says and that is the government's intention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We recognise that while we have a large supply of child-care places it is still well short of the demand. Many people are using informal care because they are unable to find a place in a formal child-care centre. There are also many people who chose informal child care. In recognition of the reasons that people choose informal care, the government has made it quite clear that this legislation covers the informal care area. Senator Minchin is wrong and mischievous in proposing that this will change that or that we are not serious about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accreditation and quality are matters of considerable concern to this government. Despite the absolutely ridiculous campaign being waged against accreditation, the government's commitment to quality is absolutely clear. I am very concerned to make sure that parents using child care are assured that their children will have care provided in quality child-care centres. I am also aware that when people apply to have their children enter a child-care centre they are not completely able to assess the quality of care provided and they do not necessarily meet all the child-care providers. They cannot be fully aware of all the things that will happen in a child-care centre. Even if they do make a very large effort to find out about the child-care centre&mdash;and I think many parents do&mdash;honourable senators should realise that they may not be able to satisfy themselves on all counts. In the informal area when parents make arrangements for their own children, they are very well placed to ensure that they are satisfied with the quality of care they are arranging. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the record, I note that Senator Patterson suggested that 60 per cent of child-care centres are private and all of those oppose accreditation. Those figures&mdash;like everything else the opposition is saying about accreditation&mdash;are quite incorrect. About 60 per cent of child-care places are private and a very large section of that private child-care area strongly supports the accreditation process. Those figures are way off as usual. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Chris Evans spelt out very well the way the cash rebate will be given on top of the fee relief for child-care assistance. This means that there has been considerable progress in this area. Our assistance to make child care affordable is very much targeted to people on low incomes. The cash rebate will be available to some parents receiving full fee relief if their fees are above the cut-off level. In other words, if there is an amount that the parents have to pay they may receive a cash rebate. A modest amount of cash rebate would be available to those parents. Some parents on full fee relief may be able to have a small amount of the cash rebate to contribute towards those fees that are above the capped level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one examines the figures&mdash;and I think Senator Evans has done it, so I will not do it again&mdash;it is quite clear that the maximum payment for one child using child care with no fee relief is $28.20. The sliding scale of perhaps less than a full cash rebate or even full cash rebate plus the assistance of fee relief means that there is considerable progress in the way we are assisting families with the question of affordability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition seems very confused in what it thinks about informal care. On the one hand, in the accreditation debate, the opposition was arguing that we are forcing people into informal care. In this debate it is arguing the importance of informal care. I think members of the opposition are not clear whether it is good or bad or which way they want to use it. I think that is another example of their confusion in this whole area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Minchin got a bit carried away and trawled across the old red herring of children reared in institutional care being ruined and how harmful it is. Yet he is a member of a party that has exactly the same policy apart from the means test. I do not quite understand what Senator Minchin is really trying to argue. However, I think this is a very good example of a confused opposition mind. Is Senator Minchin for or against child care? It is not at all clear to any of us listening what he actually stands for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very aware of what the women of Australia are saying. The government actually spent a very long time extensively consulting the women of Australia. They have put three points very high on their political agenda. The things they want the government to consider are child care, violence against women and women's health. The government has delivered in all of those areas. I can assure the opposition that in the child-care area it is in response to the concern in the community, particularly of women, that our child-care policies have been designed. The government's policies very much recognise the importance of choice for women. It is not fair to say, as Senator Minchin said, that the government has no regard at all for families at home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another promise made and kept and also forgotten by Senator Patterson and honourable senators opposite is the home child-care allowance. It will be introduced towards the end of September next year. While I can accept Senator Lees's point that one would like it to be larger, one has to recognise the important breakthrough in getting the dependent spouse rebate cashed out to the spouse at home. It recognises the importance of looking after children at home and it also provides a continuing income to the spouse who is providing that care. Certainly, one could argue about the amount, but I think the important point being made in that home child-care allowance is the recognition of the importance of women in the home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One also needs to recognise the payment of family allowance. There is also considerable funding under the child-care vote for occasional care. That is particularly designed to assist women at home who are not in the work force or defined as seeking work. We have also dramatically increased the money to play groups. In all of those ways we recognise the importance of women at home and the care that they provide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also recognise that the old war between women at home and women in the workplace is tired and destructive. It fails to recognise what women are telling government, telling me, that most adult women, particularly those who have children,  expect to spend some time of their adult lives in and out of the work force. Our policies recognise that. They recognise and support women in making that choice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Minchin also said that we should be castigated for introducing a policy that assists millionaires. He then spent a lot of time saying how ridiculous it was to design a system that allowed people to collect the rebate every two weeks. I suggest that Senator Minchin has really got a muddled brain. One of the reasons why we do not allow the rebate to be collected only at the end of the year is that only people on higher incomes can afford that. Cashing out the rebate this way clearly recognises the needs of families, particularly women on lower incomes. They are not able to wait for the whole year to draw a rebate. They appreciate that this policy gives them the ability to collect that money every two weeks. It is particularly obvious. I can not understand why Senator Minchin failed to appreciate that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Senator Lees was particularly concerned on behalf of the Democrats that there be an evaluation of the scheme after two years. As Senator Lees has noted in her comments, I think that is a very acceptable proposition. The government, of course, would be evaluating the program from the day it started. It is a proper and usual procedure in government that there be close evaluation and monitoring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also appreciate the point made by Senator Lees that a stepping back, if you like, from the ongoing process of monitoring to an evaluation after two years will allow us to take a look at the aggregated figures to see patterns emerging of who has had access, who has had use and maybe who has been missing out. I am very happy to support that request from Senator Lees. I think it is thoughtful and considered. I believe that it will add to the value and the impact of this legislation. </PARA>

In an ideal world there would not be any targeting of the rebate, but the reality of the economic imperatives facing us means that the application of an income test is appropriate. It reflects the coalition's position as stated in our 1993 child-care policy statement. Such an income test is not unprecedented.

In 1991-92 there were three new cases in that area compared to one new case in 1992-93. Given that there are a number of factors which contribute to the incidence of OOS, including work practices, work load, workplace design and machine usage, it is not possible to establish a direct causal link between the introduction of pause gymnastics and the incidence of OOS.</PARA>
