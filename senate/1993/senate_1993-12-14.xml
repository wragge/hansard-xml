Obviously, I would not have put up these proposals if I did not believe that they were necessary and if I did not believe that, over time, unless something is done, there are going to be some serious consequences for the public health system. I have stressed, of course, that they are not for now, that I was looking at the medium term&mdash;the 10- to 20-year term&mdash;where I believe we will get some problems down the track if we do not act now.

Presumably, if the minister is arguing for change, he recognises shortcomings currently exist in the system. I note that he has been referring to strains that exist in the system. We therefore ask him as health minister what shortcomings he recognises currently exist which will further deteriorate if the changes he is advocating are not in fact implemented?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not sure that I have much to add to the first answer that I gave. I have said that there are strains in the system. I have identified them as being waiting lists in public hospitals around the country. As Senator Hill and other honourable senators would be aware, in the last fortnight we have announced a $100 million package which we hope will address that. Certainly in the course of the next few years it will show us the way that that ought to be addressed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have said that there needs to be extra because, if I cannot be sure that over a 10- to 20-year term there will not be added pressures over and above those, the strain will become serious. At the moment, the system copes. With the extra $100 million that we have talked about and with the demonstration projects that it will show, I am sure that the system will continue to cope well. It just depends what volume it faces over that one to two decades.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That having been said, what I have pointed out continually, as I did in my answer to Senator Hill, is that I am therefore not looking at the situation as of this afternoon. I am not concerned that there is any crisis in our system now. I want to make sure that over the next 10 to 20 years some extra strains will be avoided. That is why I have said that we should try to put a floor on the numbers that are in private health insurance now.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, it is not. I think that I am doing alright, Winnie. I digress, however. Australia spends $1.3 billion subsidising private patients in both public and private hospitals who are having procedures. If my proposals go through, clearly the Medicare agreements with the states will need to be looked at again so that we can claw back the extra money that the public hospitals will get in bed day charges. The states will get extra in bed day charges because the public hospitals will charge the funds more. As is already obvious, the colleagues of those opposite in those states agree and have said so publicly. I do not see that as a great problem. I would much rather be sitting on my fence than yours, old son.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is the Minister for Health aware of a series of newspaper articles which refer to legal action being taken against CSL Ltd by the relatives of those who received human pituitary hormones, pertussis vaccine and a range of blood products? Will the Commonwealth provide an indemnity to the company before its public float so that the potential investors are fully informed?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="4487" SPEAKER="Richardson Sen The Hon G.F." NAMEID="4E4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="NSW" MINISTERIAL="HEALTH" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I am aware of those reports. There have been a number of articles in the press recently. I can think of one article written by Jennifer Cooke in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> which referred to 31 actions&mdash;I think that is the figure; I do not have the article with me&mdash;that have been taken. I think there have probably been some more actions since then. They include a range of actions for different alleged maladies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ones of most concern will be those actions taken by the relatives of those who have died from Creutzfeld-Jakob disease, allegedly received as a result of deficiencies in human pituitary hormone programs over the last couple of decades. That is obviously a major concern and will no doubt lead to very extensive sums of money being claimed if those cases are ever proven in a court. As I understand it, it is also the case that a number of people are suing&mdash;although I have not received details&mdash;for strain, worry and stress caused by concerning themselves about whether or not they might fall victim to that kind of disease.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator West also mentioned other ailments that can be picked up via blood products. CSL does have a difficulty in this regard. To make sure that potential investors are well and truly reassured about what might happen, the government will be giving an indemnity to CSL. That will be public. It will be known to all those who seek to invest in CSL before the float. So no-one will be in any doubt whatsoever as to the state of what he or she is buying. CSL is a viable, excellent company that will go from strength to strength.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Trade. Honourable senators will no doubt be aware of the announcement by the Japanese Prime Minister, Mr Hosokawa, that Japan has agreed to open its rice markets. I ask the minister whether he can inform the Senate of the implications of this decision will have for the Uruguay Round negotiations and the Australian rice industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="4487" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The announcement by Japanese Prime Minister Hosokawa earlier today that Japan will open its market to rice imports is a very welcome and courageous one, and it does remove the final major obstacle to concluding the Uruguay Round agriculture negotiations by tomorrow's deadline. The announcement by Japan has been a very long awaited one and will certainly generate significant commercial benefits for Australia's rice industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Japan will be opening its very lucrative market in 1995 to around 400,000 tonnes of imported rice, which is equivalent to four per cent of domestic production. Over the six years from 1995 to 2000 the access will expand to 800,000 tonnes, equivalent to eight per cent of domestic consumption. The Japanese market for imported rice in the year 2000 will be almost double Australia's current level of total rice exports, which are valued at around $230 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian industry has been actively gearing up for the eventual opening of the Japanese market for some time and has already been successful in securing sales under the emergency import arrangements that Japan has just put in place for next year as a result of its current poor harvest. The movement by Japan on rice, coupled with the announcement of the South Korean President, Kim Young-Sam, on 9 December that South Korea would also allow rice imports as part of the Uruguay Round settlement, have vindicated the very strong stand that has been taken by Australia and the other members of the Cairns Group in pressing strongly and consistently for liberalisation of access for all agricultural products without exceptions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This will be a major and enduring benefit of the Uruguay Round agreement on agriculture for efficient agricultural producers. It will open markets formerly closed, as in Japan and Korea, and improve the transparency, predictability and security of access to other agricultural markets for the full range of agricultural products.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I indicated in answer to a question yesterday, there have been modifications agreed to the Blair House accord by the United States and the European Union which affect rice. However, the end point of reductions has not been affected by these adjustments and the US will have to reduce its current levels of subsidies by almost 90 per cent. Nonetheless, as I did say yesterday, we are still concerned that the US will have substantial capacity in the early years of the implementation period to subsidise its exports heavily, including possibly to the Japan and Korean markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Cook, who is in Geneva now, has raised with the United States our concerns about the additional flexibility provided to export subsidies on rice and has put some proposals to the United States which would minimise the potential adverse impact on Australian rice exports. We will be hoping very much that those proposals can be accepted and that we can benefit accordingly.</PARA>

Did the minister's grievously misrepresented senior colleagues who rang this morning deny that they are still determined to roll him? Instead of doing private deals with the ACTU and studiously ignoring consumer interests, why will not the minister defer further cabinet consideration of the issue and publicly circulate a discussion paper on the financial and social implications of his proposals?

Medicare has been the hallmark of a health policy for five elections in a row. Those opposite have not had one for longer than I can recall; they have not had one at all.

Sometimes one is opposed by people who are opposed to those ideas because one put them. Sometimes one is opposed by people who have deep ideological convictions about them and others who have deep intellectual convictions about them.

It should also be said that, typically, the opposition is reacting every single time to the greed of some doctors. It is that greed which they will always support.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;An important review of commercialisation has been initiated and it is intended to report to the government in the 1994-95 budget context. It would be of interest to at least some members of parliament that that review overlaps with some reviews undertaken by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts into commercialisation and will also be impacted upon by the important Hilmer report on national competition policy. It is important from time to time to look at where these reviews are going and look at what the current situation is with regard to the matters under review.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the good work of my colleagues and predecessors since 1987, the department of administrative services has changed from one which has provided a range of prominent services to one which competes on the basis of user choice and users having to pay. It has been transformed so that there are now some 14 commercially focused business units within the administrative services portfolio, which turned a 1987 loss of $68 million into a net operating return in 1993 of some $17 million. There have been cost reductions of about 30 per cent, increased productivity in terms of sales for employees of around five per cent per year and improved returns on the Commonwealth's equity up to 6.4 per cent in 1992-93. The Auditor-General has also commented favourably on the results of the DAAS commercialisation experience.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These changes have not been easy.

It is important to note that, given the public interest in Western Australia about the relationship between the Attorney-General of WA and Dr Bradshaw, my advice is that no request for Dr Bradshaw's extradition has been received from the Western Australian Attorney-General, Mrs Cheryl Edwardes, or her DPP. In terms of the next step, should Western Australia seek Dr Bradshaw's extradition, the Attorney-General will consider making a formal request to the Maldives.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure that, as Senator McKiernan has said in asking his question, all in this chamber would agree that acts of vandalism against a war cemetery or a memorial are particularly mindless and cowardly. Previous episodes of vandalism have occurred in one form or another in most major war cemeteries and plots over the past five years, but in 1989, over the Christmas break, vandals completely destroyed the Goulburn War Cemetery, resulting in the then Minister for Veterans' Affairs announcing a $3,000 reward would be paid on the conviction of those who vandalised war cemeteries and war memorials. The result of that was the arrest of those responsible for the desecration of war memorials in Brisbane's Balmoral Cemetery in 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ought also say to the Senate that the cost to the Office of Australian War Graves, and ultimately to the taxpayer, has been increasing not only for the repairs to and replacement of memorials but also on prevention in the form of security alarms, patrols and the like in war cemeteries. There have been some five acts of major vandalism and numerous minor instances during the past five years, resulting in in excess of $25,000 in direct costs and much more in indirect costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Office of Australian War Graves has in place new security systems in the major locations, including the gardens of remembrance in most states and Papua New Guinea, and has programmed additions in other areas. Approaches to the editors of local press outlining the nature of these senseless and uncivilised acts have to some extent drawn the public's attention to this problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other aspect that I think is worth mentioning to honourable senators is the fact that this does have a serious effect on the morale of the staff of the Office of Australian War Graves.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am shocked that honourable senators opposite want to mock this. Summer is coming on and Senator Boswell, particularly, coming from Queensland where skin cancer has the highest incidence in Australia, and probably holds the world title, should be very concerned about this article and the point that is raised by it.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> What is at question is whether or not sunscreens actually lose their effectiveness if they are exposed to heat&mdash;for example, if they are left in the glove box of a car or left lying in the sun for any length of time. This matter has just been brought to the notice of the pharmaceutical industries and also the TGA.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no advice, no warning and no expiry date information on sunscreens. It is a very serious matter that people buying sunscreens&mdash;particularly those marketed as 8+ or 15+&mdash;expecting to have a full sunscreen protection may then discover that they do not. So this matter is properly raised and brought to my attention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Therapeutic Goods Administration has obtained a sample of the product that was the subject of the newspaper article. It is examining that sample to test for stability, content and the appropriate broad spectrum claims ascribed to that sunscreen. If the TGA's review demonstrates any concern about those claims&mdash;particularly as to effectiveness and its loss over time or due to exposure to heat&mdash;then it will be advising me and we will be making that information public and making the necessary changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other matter under consideration by the Therapeutic Goods Administration is whether or not there is a need for an expiry date on sunscreen products. This is again a matter of considerable importance because there is some evidence that these products lose their potency simply by a long shelf life&mdash;maybe over a year, maybe not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to know that Australia is regarded as being at the forefront of control of sunscreens, which have been regulated as a therapeutic good since the commencement of the Therapeutic Goods Act in February 1991. Overseas, these products are generally regarded as cosmetics. Perhaps it is a measure of how important skin cancer is for Australians that we can take comfort in knowing how seriously we address it in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The TGA only accepts applications for sunscreen products which are certified by applicants as complying with the test requirements of the Australian standards for sunscreens. So far, no significant evidence that sunscreens do not meet the required standard has emerged from the testing program, but in the light of this information it is a matter of great concern that we do very quickly get that examination by the TGA concluded and provide timely and current information and advice to consumers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the most important advice that I can give to consumers while we are awaiting that scientific evidence from the TGA is that they check the date on which the sunscreen was actually issued. Even though consumers are buying new products, they should see whether they can measure their shelf life and buy only currently issued ones while this is still a matter for concern.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The MLC superannuation index is based on a periodic survey conducted for the MLC Life Office. It started in mid-1992 and it broadly measures consumer confidence in superannuation arrangements. So it is very new. The latest index level, released on 1 December, indicated a downward trend in the confidence of Australians in their superannuation arrangements. What this survey does not show is the reasons underlying this trend. MLC has indicated that it will conduct a further survey early next year to explore the reasons.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The index reported that older Australians are less confident than young people about generating sufficient savings to meet their retirement needs. The lack of time remaining to accumulate a benefit and the long-term nature of superannuation would seem to explain this result. We need to be concerned about what underlies this decline and if it measures a real change rather than just being something thrown up by the nature of this index. It is so new that we cannot be extremely confident about it at this stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another important factor to take into account. It may well be that the apparent decline in confidence in superannuation should be interpreted having regard to the fact that people are generally becoming much more aware about how much saving is necessary to generate adequate living standards in retirement. Therefore, as a consequence, more people are questioning whether their existing retirement provision will be sufficient.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been, particularly with the initiation of the superannuation guarantee charge but also broadly, increased debate about superannuation in the community. It is quite plausible that this has led to a change in consumer confidence in superannuation arrangements which cuts across the real change. The community has better arrangements but people are less confident of them because they are more aware of what is required in terms of savings to generate adequate living standards in retirement. So there are some pluses as well as some interesting questions in this survey. The government will be very interested in the outcome of the MLC's further inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The index reported that 55 per cent of Australians now believe that their retirement planning is inadequate. This is a positive development because it is likely to lead to an encouragement for greater self-provision for retirement income. So although on the face of it this measurement of consumer confidence is a cause for concern, it is probably more positive than negative.</PARA>

The number of families with children aged nought to 14, in which neither parent is working but at least one parent is looking for work, has gone up and the number of long term unemployed has gone up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the minister thinks that there is no increase in need between this Christmas and last Christmas, she is just joking and trying to fool the Australian public. In answer to my question she said that the emergency relief program this year had increased on its base funding from last year. Mr President, there is no intention to increase or have a special Christmas appeal at this stage. Let me tell you, Mr President, that the base funding for 1992-93 was $18.35 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) announced his scam scheme of matching dollar for dollar raised, but when the government went to sign, we saw in the fine print that it was dollar for dollar raised and spent. That amounted to about $9.9 million last year. Then he added another $2 million on to that base funding. The base funding for this year is estimated to be $17.63 million. I cannot see where it has gone up. In the previous year&mdash;1991-92&mdash;the figure was $16.3 million. So in 1991-92 it was $16.3 million. The next year the base amount was $18.35 million, with another $12 million handed out gratuitously before Christmas. This year we have an estimate of $17.6 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amount of emergency relief last year came to $30.2 million, much of it given before Christmas&mdash;$12 million in Christmas appeals, including $10 million to the Christmas appeal and $2 million as a gratuitous amount given out by Mr Keating. We see a 42 per cent decrease in the emergency relief funding from last year to this year. What was the emergency last year? There is no difference between the needs of the people in the community. I have demonstrated that the need is greater. The emergency was that the Labor Party was facing an election in February or March. Santa Claus Keating&mdash;Prime Minister Keating&mdash;came out with his Christmas sack on his back on 11 December on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program and announced his scam scheme, tricking the organisation into thinking it was going to get all the money that it raised, but it had only the money that it spent during the Christmas appeal. It had to keep some money until winter to deal with people who were in great need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has happened? We get no funding before this Christmas because there is no election. I hope the Democrats are listening to this. This is the sort of government that we have in power. It comes in before an election and gives out $12 million in emergency relief. This year, when the need is as great, there is no money. The Australian people were duped last year before Christmas and they have been duped this year before Christmas&mdash;two Christmases in a row. The Christmas before last there was no money either. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have not seen an increase. In fact, we have seen a 42 per cent decrease in emergency relief funding. It is an appalling situation for Australians in need.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has made it quite clear that its main emphasis through its budget policies is to target assistance to people in a long-term and permanent way, which is a point I was making during the answer I gave Senator Patterson. That is the main thrust of the announcements in the budget, and takes account of the fact that, despite the best intentions in the world, some people will get into an emergency&mdash;a financial or economic crisis. Such crisis is best dealt with by assistance&mdash;sometimes by payment of bills; other times by direct cash assistance to people under that emergency relief handout. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That emergency relief funding will be increased this year by $2 million and will be allocated to people at Christmas time. The government recognises that, despite the best intentions of government to make sure that people are assisted with housing and pension benefits and payments, for some reason things go wrong for some families. So there is that continuing backup of emergency relief&mdash;not the main game but a backup. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The increase of $2 million this year is over and above the increase in last year's allocation, and is allocated for payment in December.

If we allocated all assistance to people as emergency relief, Senator Patterson would be the first in here saying, `Why don't we do the more long-term thing; the more permanent thing?'.

<PARA>Senator Faulkner expressed injured innocence that I should ask a question about the state of resignations and the resignations that may be pending in the F111 and FA18 squadrons in the air force. I maintain that he should know that because he is the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel. We are not talking about knowing what every person in the Defence Force is doing but a very small, critical group to the RAAF. There are only three fighter squadrons&mdash;Nos 3, 75 and 77&mdash;and we are talking about a pool of between 50 and 60 pilots. If we put in the two F111 squadrons&mdash;Nos 1 and 6&mdash;there maybe another 20 pilots. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is common knowledge that the airlines have started recruiting again, particularly Cathay Pacific. I would have thought that it is quite wrong for Senator Faulkner to maintain that he has no knowledge of what is going on in the marketplace in relation to a group of pilots who are absolutely critical to the operational efficiency of the RAAF. In the latter part of the 1980s, the airlines recruited very aggressively and we lost a lot of pilots in whom the Commonwealth had invested a great deal of money in training. A pilot who has about 1,000 hours experience in an F111 or an FA18 probably represents an investment of well over $5 million for the Commonwealth. That experience cannot be replicated in a crash program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present, the RAAF has many pilots&mdash;it probably has its full complement of pilots&mdash;but it has a great number of very low time pilots who were recruited and trained after the mass exodus in the late 1980s. Since that time we have had budget restraints. At best these pilots in the fighter and strike squadrons are flying only 170 to 172 hours a year. With those hours they simply cannot build up the professional expertise that they need to take positions of authority in the squadron. Therefore, the few pilots that we have&mdash;who are precisely the pilots who are attractive to the airlines&mdash;have got to be retained. As I see it, the government is doing nothing to retain those pilots. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had a very stupid scheme introduced by Mrs Kelly when she was the equivalent of the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel a few years ago at the height of the pilot resignations. All that did was to place great piles of money in the hands of pilots who are never going to resign; they were the helicopter pilots who were not attractive to the airlines at all. So at the expense of public funds we retained people who were at no risk of going. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not ask for a repeat of that scheme. But I am alarmed that the government is not aware of the way in which the few experienced pilots we have left in those squadrons are under option and being courted by the airlines, principally Cathay Pacific. If the government does nothing to counter the blandishments of the airlines, we will lose those pilots. The air force would then be very severely restricted in its capabilities, not for five or six years but probably 15 years before that expertise is rebuilt. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Gareth Evans), to a question without notice asked by Senator Kemp this day, relating to media reports speculating on the future appointment of Senator Gareth Evans to the High Court of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>I rise to reiterate to the Senate that Senator Gareth Evans was asked twice, and perhaps a third time in a question asked by my colleague, whether he would rule out any future prospect of an appointment to the High Court. This is a very serious question which goes to the heart of the way in which this government operates. Senator Gareth Evans is in charge of the foreign affairs of this nation, certainly one of the most senior portfolios in the cabinet. In the last month or so he has been subject to speculation about two possible jobs. First, it has been alleged that he would be seeking the secretary-generalship of the United Nations; and today, we read in the press that he is holding out for himself the prospect of a job in the High Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put it to you, Mr Deputy President, that these are two serious issues. In relation to the first issue, I believe that there is a serious conflict of interest. Like many Australians, I happen to be very concerned about certain activities of the United Nations, particularly this government's capacity to constantly sign UN conventions and covenants which enmesh our legal system in the UN. I am quite opposed to that, but I understand that Senator Evans has a different view&mdash;and that is an intellectual argument. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I would be exceedingly worried if Senator Evans, on a future occasion, were to seek a very senior job or the most senior job at the United Nations. There is a potential serious conflict of interest. I do not allege that Senator Evans is doing that, but it is important that that prospect be ruled out. Equally, I put that it is unsatisfactory for Senator Evans to be encouraging&mdash;and that is what he did today&mdash;speculation about a move to the High Court. Senator Evans had the chance, as I said, three times to rule out any prospect of a move to the High Court and each time he ducked the issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Evans laid out the principles very clearly on this sort of issue some 13 years ago when he launched a vicious attack against Mr Ellicott, who at that stage was rumoured to be seeking a move towards the High Court. Senator Evans conducted a very unpleasant, vicious campaign against Mr Ellicott. He put out a press release which, among other things, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We believe that the appointment of Mr Ellicott to any position on the Court would be a deeply divisive and unhappy one for the nation. It would do nothing to raise the stature of the Court and a good deal to bring it into almost permanent disrepute with a significant proportion of the community.</PARA>
<PARA>Equally we would say that about Senator Evans. We believe that any potential move by him to the High Court would precipitate a major debate in this nation about whether this is a worthy `job for the boys' and whether, indeed, he has the capacity to take that job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly we on this side of the chamber would be very much opposed to that. I put Senator Evans on notice that he can do this chamber a favour by now ruling out&mdash;and we will give him a fourth chance to rule out&mdash;any prospect of his moving to the High Court. I urge Senator Evans to reflect heavily on the Ellicott principle, which he did so much to establish in this chamber. </PARA>

If that does not put the lie to what the Prime Minister believes, it certainly demonstrates that Senator Richardson has a tremendous education job to do on the Prime Minister to convince him that the only chance for the public hospital system of this country to survive is to take the pressure off it by getting people to insure privately. It is the only chance. As Senator Richardson well knows, this is his last chance to convince the Prime Minister, the cabinet, the rest of the caucus, the ACTU, even the Democrats and whoever else is opposing him. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the explanation.</PARA>
<PARA>I indicate that these questions were asked, as I have mentioned, on 18 May 1993. Even for a government as incompetent as this one, one would think it might have been able to find an answer in almost seven months to what was a fairly simple set of questions. I did raise this last Wednesday with Senator McMullan, after giving him notice. He was in the chamber. He rose last Wednesday and he said to me:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I thank Senator Macdonald for the courtesy of advising us in advance. All I can advise him today&mdash;because I have not had time to do more&mdash;is that the Treasurer's office has advised me that there is an answer to the above question in preparation, but I will follow the matter up for Senator Macdonald.</PARA>
<PARA>That was six days ago. I intend to raise this matter again tomorrow, perhaps with more consultation with my party and the other groups in this chamber, and to censure the minister for his complete lack of regard for this chamber and the standing orders of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What Senator Ray said earlier may well be correct, but what he acknowledges, which I confirm, is that of course they are the standing orders. The fact that the minister may be busy is tough luck. The standing orders are the rules which run this chamber, and the minister, no matter how busy he is, is obliged, like all the rest of us, to abide by the standing orders of this chamber. Senator McMullan was aware that I was going to raise this matter again today because my office again gave him the courtesy of advising him. It also raises the question of what is the whole purpose of asking questions on notice. We are entitled to get answers. Again, the standing orders provide for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The procedural order that I am speaking under at the moment requires the minister to either give an explanation or provide an answer. I do not know what is so tough about that. Should I perhaps suspect that there is something to hide? After all, the question involved is the gift of some Penfolds wine by Mr Dawkins, when he was the trade minister, to Mr Bentsen. I would have thought that the records on that would be pretty clear. There were some 528 bottles of Penfolds wine involved. The news report that I am referring to does not indicate which sort of Penfolds wine, but I suspect from the commentary that it was probably grange hermitage&mdash;quite an expensive bottle of wine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I simply want to know whether Mr Dawkins paid for it himself, or who paid for it, in which way the money for it was obtained, where it was delivered, what was the cost, and who paid for the delivery. I am asking whether Mr Bentsen contributed to the cost. I want general details about that. They are all quite legitimate questions in order to find out just what happened in the gift of that large quantity of wine by Mr Dawkins. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raise the matter yet again. I am not moving a censure motion today, but I would hope that Senator McMullan could indicate to me that by this time tomorrow I will have an answer. Alternatively, we might have to proceed with the Senate saying to the minister that we require him to comply with the standing orders of this chamber. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We, the undersigned of this public petition strongly support the campaign initiated by the Australian Council for Overseas Aid (ACFOA) subcommittee of Central America along with more than 12 representative institutions. The central objective of this campaign is: that the Australian nation play a more relevant role in the process to consolidate peace and democracy in El Salvador.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The UN Secretary General has noted that El Salvador is a model of particular importance for the peaceful resolution of internal conflicts in other parts of the world. If Civil/Democratic values are to prevail over military objectives in El Salvador then the international community, including the Australian Government, must contribute to the strengthening of Salvadoran society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We, as individuals and as part of the Australian community in general, feel that for the first time in the history of El Salvador a real possibility exists for civil society to be the principal force of its own destiny in a truly participatory democracy.</PARA>

<PARA>To Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in the Federal Parliament assembled:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) One of the most critical issues to the Vietnamese people today is the persecution of their freedom of religion and expression, which has been carried out by the Government of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam (GOSRV) since 1945. World media reports have shown consistently that this persecution has increased greatly since 1992, when Buddhists, despite violent repression by the GOSRV's armed forces, started asking for `real' freedom of religion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The continuation of the GOSRV's centralised and corrupt structure, as well its failed and disorderly `economic renovation' and its declared loyalty to the atheistic socialism, has seriously degraded the moral, cultural, family, economic and spiritual life of most Vietnamese people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The GOSRV's policy of oppressing religions has, since 1945, applied equally to Catholics, Protestants, Caodaists, Hoa Hao Buddhist members and, most seriously, to the Unified Vietnamese Buddhist Church (UBCV) which represents the faith and spiritual life of 80% of 72 million Vietnamese.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4)  As the rightful heir of the 2000-year old Buddhist tradition in Vietnam, the UBCV was formally formed in 1951 by all Buddhist sects, lineages and regional congregations. It is the sole legitimate umbrella Buddhist body in Vietnam despite the GOSRV's unsuccessful attempt, in 1981, to disband and forcibly replace it with the State-run Vietnam Buddhist Church (VBC), and instrument for the GOSRV's propaganda purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) Despite being held under strict house arrest since February 1982 simply because of his opposition to the GOSRV's attempted disbandment to the UBCV and its formation of the State-controlled VBC, the Patriarch Thich Huyen Quang, a nominee for 1979 Nobel Peace Prize, has been repeatedly and patiently appealing to leaders of the Communist Party and the GOSRV to ask for:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">a) the urgent restoration and legal recognition of the UBCV's independent status,</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">b) the separation of Church and State and the withdrawal of the GOSRV's control over, and politicisation of, the Buddhist church.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">c) the release of all arrested clergy, including the Patriarch, along with thousands of other prisoners of conscience,</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">d) the return of, and compensation for, all confiscated and misused Church properties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">e) open negotiations, free of pre-conditions, between the leaders of the UBCV and the GOSRV to establish mutually agreed solutions to the current conflicts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) In replying to these reasonable requests, the GOSRV has, in the last few months, ordered stricter surveillance of the Patriarch's place of confinement and placed bans on all of his external communications. Whoever tries to contact, visit, help or offer gifts to him are stopped, threatened, interrogated, bodily searched (and in some cases strip searched), etc. The Patriarch's straightforward appeals have not only been ignored by the Hanoi leaders, but have also been vilified as `anti-state', `reactionary', `creating division amongst Buddhist community', etc. by the GOSRV's mass media and its nation-wide agencies, including its own VBC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) All of the UBCV's brave clergy and lay members, who openly declare their support for the UBCV's appeals and who have worked sincerely for the reconciliation between the State and the UBCV, also between the VBC and the UBCV, have been inhumanely and violently attacked by the GOSRV. In the last 12 months, hundreds of monks, nuns and lay persons have been arrested and/or tortured, harshly interrogated, searched, investigated and threatened. Amongst them are the Venerables Thich Nhat Lien, Thich Tri Luc and Thich Khong Tanh (Oct&mdash;Nov 1992), Thich Thien An (Oct. 1992, tortured to death few days after arrested), Thich Hai Tang, Thich Tri Tuu, Thich Hai Thinh and about 50 lay members (5/6/93), Thich Hanh Duc, 17 other monks and about one hundred of lay followers (9/7/93), etc.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(8) The GOSRV's violent attack and mass media campaign against Buddhists' appeal for Church independent have caused suffering to many thousands of people, resulting in increased instability for the whole country. Despite the GOSRV's current campaign to illogically calumniate them and to deceive the world, these monks and lay Buddhists are arrested solely because of their aspiration to be involved and support their chosen church, the UBCV.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(9) To politicise the traditional Buddhist community in Vietnam, the GOSRV has publicly been, and is:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">a) recruiting members for the VBC by forcibly converting the UBCV's moderate clergy to join it, and arresting or exiling other leaders who refuse to do so. (The GOSRV's view of `religious freedom' is not in accord with natural human dignity and heritage, but a rare favour given reluctantly on the terms of the State),</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">b) forcing the VBC to include, in its Charter, `Socialism' as its third aim of service&mdash;the other two, which originated from UBCV Charter, are People and Buddhism,</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">c) creating mutual distrust and conflicts between the lay Buddhist community and their clergy or amongst the clergy themselves by appointing VBC senior leaders to artificial political positions, and by closely controlling and intervening in the limited activities it is permitted to perform training programs such as ordination procedures, seniority promotions, etc.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">d) requiring the VBC to make frequent political statements supporting the GOSRV's inconsistent policies, with the consequence of eroding the VBC's religious identity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">e) directing the VBC to start a nation-wide campaign to accusing the UBCV of having political ambitions, and forcing it to declare the VBC as the `only legitimate Buddhist authority' and its `everlasting loyalty' to the GOSRV. This is whilst the GOSRV is facing huge pressure and condemnation from the international community about its oppressive attitude to the Buddhists and its systematic violation to all human rights of all non-party-cadre citizens in the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(10) The GOSRV's exclusively economic renovation has not, and can not, lead to democratisation or potentials which will allow long-overdue human rights to its citizens, such as freedom to select their own political aspirations, ways of expressions, religions, education, employment, place of resident, etc. The greater its economic strength, the more determined and confident the GOSRV is in its opposition to such a democratisation process and the worse its treatment of its citizens becomes. This causes ever greater social instability and a sense of total hopelessness for Vietnam's future, and more broadly, prevents the development of stability in the SE Asia region as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(11). As its history has proved, if the UBCV is completely free and independent of political intervention, it would be a most beneficial part of, and the best spiritual force to contribute to, a humanitarian and ethically orientated redevelopment process for Vietnam.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Senate requests the Australian Government to:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">1. make conditional the release of currently approved financial assistance, and any future aid, to the GOSRV, on its granting of all internationally accepted human and civil rights to its people, without discrimination.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">2. urge the GOSRV to cease all ill-treatment of the UBCV, and to achieve a mutually acceptable resolution, by means of fair negotiation, of all appeals made by the UBCV's Patriarch;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I present to the Senate the following petition, from 114 citizens, which is not in conformity with the standing orders as it is not in the correct form:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The petition of the undersigned shows that concerned Australian parents and citizens reject the proposed guidelines for childcare centres as set out in the National Childcare Accreditation Council's Quality Improvement and Accreditation System Handbook on the grounds that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Discipline is an essential requirement within a caring environment to enable the child to co-operate with his/her peers and to respect the teacher/worker's authority in order for effective learning to take place. Staff must be allowed to use terms such as `no' and `don't do that' if necessary, to prevent the child disrupting the entire group and to ensure the safety of the child.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is appropriate for children of both sexes to have access to a variety of toys and activities. It is totally inappropriate for a teacher to demand that a child follow, not his/her own preferences when it comes to choosing these toys/activities, but instead follow a preset agenda designed to eliminate the differences between the sexes. Equality of the sexes does not equate to bland uniformity between the sexes. In fact, the differences between the sexes are complimentary and need to be appreciated as such.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The labelling of Christmas carols as `culturally irrelevant' shows a total denial of our Christian heritage as a nation. Christmas is not a pagan festival but a Christian celebration of the birth of Jesus Christ. The singing or playing of carols/songs with their message of `peace on earth and good will to all mankind' is a vital aspect of the celebration of Christmas and promotes cross-cultural unity not division. Childcare centres must retain the freedom to use these songs and nativity plays accordingly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is reprehensible for the Federal Government to undermine the professionalism of trained childcare teachers/workers through these dictatorial guidelines and to attempt to control in this way the reading material, toys/activities, songs and disciplinary procedures used in these centres.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The petitioners therefore request that the Senate should, as a matter of urgency, reject the guidelines/principles set out in the Quality Improvement and Accreditation System Handbook and further request that this Handbook be dispensed with entirely. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A vision of a sustainable future for Australia requires an end to export woodchipping.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The last of the best of these forests are too precious to lose&mdash;woodchipping them for paper bags is like using a Rembrandt as a dish rag.</PARA>

As I have mentioned before in this chamber, we will, in fact, have our ability to make ethical and regional decisions pulled back as a result of the Uruguay Round of GATT inasmuch as we will have to argue, perhaps in international courts, about our decisions regarding who we sell arms to, which countries and why, if there is no international treaty on which to base this. </PARA>

The most appropriate response to resource cuts might have been to downsize the organisation. However, it seems that the move is towards corporatisation.

At that stage, the community did not have a means of communicating many of those concerns through to government levels. In terms of corporatisation, the Greens believe that such moves are inappropriate. If there are cuts to such organisations like ASIO, perhaps the response is to downsize the organisation appropriately rather than looking at corporate methods of raising funds, which may not be in the best interests of all Australians. </PARA>

<PARA>I have particular interest in this report because many of the changes that have taken place in industry policy in the last few years have affected certain industries. One of the sectors which has been most affected by our changes in policies relating to tariffs and bounties has been the textiles, clothing and footwear sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The figures given in this report show that in 1992 exports increased significantly by 30 per cent to $545 million and imports rose by 13 per cent to nearly $4 billion. If one actually looks at those figures carefully one will find that that actually means that exports have grown by $160 million but imports rose by $520 million. The industry that we were supposed to be making more competitive is going downhill fast. I wonder about people who cannot see what is happening in the stores when they go out to buy goods and services. Sales of such things as wool yarn, woven wool fabrics, trousers and shorts and footwear are decreasing. Employment in those areas is also decreasing. Investment and profitability in this industry fell during 1992-93. The clothing and footwear sectors had the biggest drop in investment of 34 per cent compared with about one per cent in textiles. These declines are accompanied by substantial falls in clothing and footwear products. Employment in this sector fell by nearly 7 per cent to almost 94,000 persons. </PARA>

<PARA>We have before the Senate a report from NBEET on credit transfer and related issues. I would like to note initially, as I have done with previous reports from NBEET, that the timing of this report seems very strange. The letter at the front of this report was written on 27 October and yet here we are in the middle of December receiving this report in parliament. One wonders why it takes seven weeks to get this report through. I believe the reporting date is 15 parliamentary days and that is exactly what we have. It amazes me that this lands in parliament in the last week of sittings. The Senate will recall that this happened before when we had a huge number of education reports come in at the end of the parliamentary sittings. I wait eagerly for Thursday to see if the same thing happens again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report draws attention to a very important area of education that deserves better treatment than it receives with this reporting program. Credit transfer refers to a system where students who have prior learning in a particular area are given credit for that when they move on to another area. Such a development is most welcome. We have a very sorry history in this country of not recognising prior learning properly. Certainly for many years we have been way behind the sort of credit given in countries like the United States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fortunately, we have moved a very long way from the 1940s when the University of Sydney would not recognise anything from the University of New England which was a college of the University of Sydney that had broken away to become an independent university. Thank heavens that sort of academic snobbery is behind us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 1960s we found examples of students being severely disadvantaged because there was  not  proper  credit  transfer  between courses. My sister-in-law had completed eight-ninths of a degree at the University of New South Wales in the mid-1960s when she transferred with her husband to New Guinea and studied through the University of Queensland. That university recognised only four-ninths of the degree so she lost half of the degree and had to do all that work over again. That is no encouragement for people to go on to study for higher awards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fortunately in the 1990s we are recognising and trying to create greater articulation, not only between universities but also between different levels of education. There have been considerable problems in developing articulation between TAFEs and universities. These are slowly being overcome and again there is the academic snobbery issue. There are also some very real issues in terms of the standard reached in various courses. It is good to see that the different levels of education are now cooperating to overcome that sort of problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A Senate committee looked at this issue a few years ago. There also seems to be great progress. The new direction in credit transfer is the recognition of informal learning before people come in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is surprising that in this report there is an emphasis on moving in that direction. The report seems to be indicating that most of these sorts of problems have been addressed. On page six of the report, the recommendation states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recognising that the continuing momentum of credit transfer through recognition of formal prior learning is becoming well established, the National Board recommends:</PARA>
<PARA>I think that is a little premature. We certainly have not solved all the problems. A consultative forum met in 1993 to consider some of these problems that still exist. At the forum it was pointed out that there is still not universal support for credit transfer arrangements. The industry representatives perceived that there was a lack of progress and that in some areas things could be made a lot clearer and articulation between courses could work far more effectively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the big problems they had was the issue of assessment of prior learning and who pays for that assessment. Certainly as more students come in from adult and community education they will need mastery tests and a whole series of other expensive systems to work out whether they are appropriate to come into a particular course. This move towards credit transfer is most welcome. I recommend the report to the Senate. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA>This is a most fundamental and important report. It is also very timely that it has been tabled here today before the Senate proceeds later this day to the debate on the Native Title Bill. Implications arise from this report that should be measured in the detailed consideration that the Senate will be giving to the important issue of land administration. I am sure that all senators are very well aware that the Aboriginal Land Rights Act of the Northern Territory has been in existence since 1976. In that period, a lot of the operation and day-to-day administration of the Aboriginal Land Rights Act has been very satisfactory, but there has also been a lot to be critical of and a lot of criticism. This report is, as I said, very fundamental to the accountability, scrutiny and criticism that is so vital and so necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General has made 52 recommendations on a wide range of issues that were drawn to his attention. Most of the issues arise from details that I put on the agenda back in the estimates considerations earlier this year. The Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, Mr Tickner, followed up that matter at that time by commissioning this very important consideration. I commend the minister for the terms of reference that he extended to this audit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time, the report must be read in parallel with two other very significant reports to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, particularly its Office of Evaluation and Audit. Two reports of May 1993 and September 1993 by Walter and Turnbull deal with the management of the Aboriginal Benefits Trust Account. I must address a couple of points in those reports before proceeding to the Auditor-General's report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Walter and Turnbull report that was tabled here in the last month or so, some very fundamental points were made with regard to the depletion of funds in the Aboriginal Benefits Trust Account. Under the cash flows for the period 1989 to 1993, the ABTA funds peaked at $33.7 million in 1992, based on balances at 30 June, and this dramatically declined to $23.6 million at 30 June 1993. That is a depletion of $10 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Walter and Turnbull went on to draw our attention to the deteriorations in the fund and the various distributions that were totally out of whack by any consideration. They made the point that section 64(7) distributions have averaged 47 per cent of the available 30 per cent of royalty equivalent income from 1984 to 1993. For 1993 the percentage was 155 per cent of the available royalty income. The combined average level of distributions for 1989 to 1993 have been 134 per cent of the 30 per cent royalty equivalent income for the same period, and this has been the cause of the diminution of the fund. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, land council estimates of expenditure have certainly outgrown the CPI increases. It was important that Walter and Turnbull in their report, whilst addressing many other issues, drew attention to the fact that `a major review of the mechanisms of funding and clarification of the provisions of the ALRA Act probably by amendments is overdue'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to the Auditor-General's report that has been tabled today. I am sure Minister Tickner now feels that his fingers have been cut off and that he is getting pretty close to having his head chopped off. There is a degree of ministerial responsibility that Mr Tickner must take into account in respect of the issues that have now been addressed by this report, particularly the exercise of his delegation of authority to staff members in ATSIC with regard to the distribution of funds. The minister himself must be accountable and must accept full responsibility in that area. I notice that one of the principal officers who was involved at the time I raised these issues back in March&mdash;Mr Castine, who was then the regional manager for ATSIC in the Northern Territory&mdash;has since disappeared from the scene; he has resigned, been pushed or whatever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the report in detail. As I said initially, there were 52 subsequent recommendations. We must not take one part of the report and isolate it. We must put it together and look at it. If we do that, we will see very clearly that it is a very severe and savage criticism of very poor, and in fact rotten and lousy administration. I am going to call for either the removal or the resignation of two particular people from any office of the crown. One is the Chairman of the Northern Land Council, Mr Galarrwuy Yunupingu, and I will come to the particular issues that have been found in this report against Mr Yunupingu. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second person whose administration I want to call into question is the current occupant of the position of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner, Mr Mick Dodson. Mr Dodson was the Director of the Northern Land Council for the entire period that is under review by this report. By any measure, I cannot see how the government can have any confidence or any faith whatsoever in Mr Dodson as a result of this report. He should resign from any public office or the government must remove him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The precedents that have been set out in this report require very careful consideration. The minister set out seven terms of reference for this inquiry. They are royalty trust account administration, advances to council members of the Northern Land Council, the fringe benefits tax arrangements, the use and engagement of consultants, the control of expenditure, the distribution of surpluses, and scope for other improvements in administration. On each and every one of those particular terms of reference, the Northern Land Council has been found to be far from satisfactory and, in fact, under very serious criticism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The area of royalty trust accounts worries me particularly. This is similar to a solicitor's trust account that each and every one of us might want to rely on&mdash;the degree of fiduciary duty to the people who are the owners of those trust funds that have been dissipated. It is not just the Aboriginal Benefits Trust Account that I mentioned, where $10 million went walkabout. This is the trust account for the day-to-day operation of all of the communities and groups of Aboriginal people throughout the Northern Territory whose income and royalties are derived from many areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report has found some very unsatisfactory and very poor systems and procedures. In fact, the audit office could not track a clear audit trail to get its hands on much of the accountability that was necessary. The accounting database was not adequate for any efficient and effective measuring of those royalty trust accounts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make my first point about Mr Yunupingu. I draw attention to the following statement at 3.12 of the report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Gumatj Galupa Association, which receives mining royalty equivalents, was often paid advances on those mining royalty equivalents from NLC funds. In 1992-93 a total of $27,124.96 was advanced to the Association from NLC administrative funds prior to the receipt of mining royalty equivalent moneys by the NLC.</PARA>
<PARA>Further on, the report notes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There was no evidence that other royalty associations had received similar advances of their mining royalty equivalents.</PARA>
<PARA>Very clearly, the chairman misused his position and directed funds to his own particular advantage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, I turn to the issue of the advances to council members. The Auditor-General found that these were made against the resolutions of the council itself. He refers to the way in which funds and payments were made, particularly the payments to the Chairman of the Northern Land Council, Mr Yunupingu. Paragraph 4.7 of the report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has also been the practice of the NLC to advance moneys to the Chairman. These advances include cash advances and payments of personal credit card accounts for travel and accommodation on council business as well as for private purchases.</PARA>
<PARA>Further on, it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since June 1992 the Chairman has been indebted to the NLC for amounts of up to approximately $23 200 for advances and credit card payments. The Chairman's account frequently remained outstanding for lengthy periods of time.</PARA>
<PARA>That was totally improper and totally unsatisfactory. No other government statutory authority would be permitted to be run in this way. It is totally against what should happen. The Auditor-General makes quite a number of comments in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the term of reference which the Auditor-General euphemistically entitles `flexible remuneration packages'. These were special key-man packages of employment that advantaged the senior managers within the Northern Land Council. Who was the top dog who benefited out of this? It was Mr Mick Dodson, the director. He organised and manipulated a series of salary packages that were totally outside the government's standards and guidelines. As the Auditor-General rightly points out, the required approval was not sought from the Department of Industrial Relations or the Department of Finance for any of these arrangements. It is important to look at the comment at paragraph 5.8 of the report, which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The NLC replaced APS equivalent salaries and conditions for selected senior staff with flexible remuneration packages in a manner that has resulted in substantial increases in the disposable income of these staff. The NLC achieved this by converting salary to other benefits that would not attract income tax but would, in normal circumstances, attract FBT.</PARA>
<PARA>Further on, paragraph 5.11 says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The flexible remuneration arrangements involve a significant taxation subsidy to the NLC.</PARA>
<PARA>This is because the NLC had negotiated and arranged tax exempt status in that regard. That is a very strong indictment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the use of consultants, many honourable senators will be aware that during the Senate estimates I questioned the Northern Land Council's very extravagant use of consultants and the very large numbers and amounts involved. What the Auditor-General has found in this regard is of very major concern. His concerns were over the value for money. Whilst contracts were arranged and acquittals were made for cheques at the other end, there was no demonstration that the consultancies were equitable or above board. Paragraph 6.23 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consultancy objectives or tasks were not well defined . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . objectives were very general</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the required outcome of the consultancy was not specified, or</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">there was little justification of the need for the work and, in some cases, reference to related work being undertaken by other consultants</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">internal approval procedures were not adhered to . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">claimed expenses were not documented . . . </PARA>
<PARA>There were other comments by the Auditor-General in this report relating to very extensive legal engagements and the need for them to be reviewed and carried on internally. Of particular concern are the issues that relate to the control over expenditure. In paragraph 7.23 the Auditor-General refers to a whole series of budget overruns. I should mention that these are in the order of millions of dollars every year. The budget run for the Northern Land Council this financial year is something like $4 million over. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General refers to the underestimation of project costs; the unforeseen expenditure on land claims; the expectation among project coordinators that estimates would be restored in the additional estimates process later in the financial year; project coordinators being slow to advise the accountant; and significant variations between recorded commitments and invoices rendered. The quality of documentation from project coordinators supporting expenditure bids varied greatly. There are very important issues here. The Northern Land Council ought not be able to appoint its own auditors. It should now be required to sit under the aegis of the Australian National Audit Office. There is certainly very insufficient management priority and management control, and I sheet that straight home to Michael Dodson. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the distribution of surpluses, over a period of years under Mr Dodson's control the Northern Land Council very cunningly used the surpluses that arose from a particular year to buy shares in a company which it had no legal right to go into. In the report the Auditor-General and ATSIC suggest that there is a need for further legislative amendment to avoid that happening again in the future. Much communication is needed in this area, particularly from the minister and the guidelines to the minister with regard to this. A totally undisciplined budget process resulted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many more general issues arise in relation to the Northern Land Council's administration. One that probably sticks in the craw of any public servant who lives in the Northern Territory is the very special arrangements that the Northern Land Council negotiated for its employees&mdash;every employee&mdash;with regard to annual leave and airfares. Paragraph 8.49 points out:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . staff of the NLC are entitled to recreation leave return airfares to Adelaide for themselves and their dependents residing with them.</PARA>
<PARA>This is allowed on an annual basis, contrary to government guidelines and there are no acquittal requirements. What do they do? They turn up, get a cheque, probably go to the bay around the corner and not south, and pick up thousands of dollars. That is totally unsatisfactory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the area of motor vehicle misuse, there are some damning indictments in this report. There was very poor documentation on the whole process of how vehicles would be purchased, used and disposed of. Catering services for major conferences is a very significant area. Similarly, in the whole area of the management structure and staff appraisals, there is need for a great deal of work. The Auditor-General has found that the lack of workload statistics and standards makes it difficult to assess whether the present NLC staff numbers are commensurate with the council's responsibility. The Auditor-General goes on to make a number of very important recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, this is a damning indictment of the minister for political control; of the chairman for his lack of personal responsibility, and for that reason he must go; and for the former director who now holds a much more senior office under this government of social justice commissioner, and he must go. Dodson must bear the full responsibility for the need for all 52 recommendations arising from this report. For the people who have missed out from the royalty dissipation and the administration changes and facilities that are just not there, there must be an immediate call and major changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The import of this, particularly the hide of Mr Dodson who has been running an international agenda with regard to indigenous people and with regard to the Native Title Bill, is of fundamental importance.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>I stress at the outset that the Auditor-General's report No. 21, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian government credit card&mdash;its debits and credits,</EMPHASIS> is a very important report. We have already had a foretaste of much of it through the leaks&mdash;or the early release&mdash;of it in the media last week. The report confirms many of the things that were made public last week but presents them in much more detail. Time is very brief so I will just take a few minutes to raise some of the matters that I think are the most important. The report raises very grave concerns about the effectiveness, efficiency and appropriateness of the usage of government credit cards by public servants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You will recall, Madam Acting Deputy President, that the Australian government credit card was introduced in 1987 following investigation and report by the Block committee. This Auditor-General's report examines the use of the AGCC in various departments and is the first comprehensive review that has been undertaken since the introduction of the credit card. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The report highlights several major deficiencies which  require attention. For example, the report states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The original intention was that the AGCC would be used to pay minor claims typically under $1000, yet out of $418m expended with the AGCC in 1992-93, ANAO estimates $283m&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>which is 68 per cent of the total&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">involved transactions in excess of $1000.</PARA>
<PARA>The report gives numerous other examples. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . where one Commonwealth agency pays another by means of credit card thereby incurring a fee for what should be a simple funds transfer.</PARA>
<PARA>Again, that is a very inefficient, incompetent and wrongful use of the credit card. The report also states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Departments were unable to identify to what use the AGCC is put or what advantages or disadvantages accrue from different patterns of use . . . Nor can departmental management monitor expenditure trends associated with card usage or payment mode.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ANAO concluded that many of the benefits claimed for the AGCC when it was established did not eventuate.</PARA>
<PARA>For those reasons it is therefore somewhat surprising to me that the audit office has supported the continued and appropriate use of the credit card arrangements, and I will come to some other reasons in a moment. This is despite the fact that the card is not widely used across the Commonwealth. Page 31 of the report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">-9% of AGCC holders accounted for 77% of expenditure</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">-26% of AGCC holders do not use their cards</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">-one department is responsible for 62% of AGCC expenditure, and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">-3 agencies account for 63% of AGCC transactions.</PARA>
<PARA>The credit card is not broadly used, but it is certainly very heavily used by the few departments or agencies that do. The report also states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are instances of purchases of capital items, such as speed boats and ancillary parts for missile launchers, using the AGCC.</PARA>
<PARA>Again, the credit cards were never intended to be used for these types of items. Indeed, if one takes the time to read the report, page four contains a couple of photographs of people who are very heavily covered with gear. The caption accompanying the photographs reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During 1992-93, bomb suits and accessories to the value $893 000 were paid for with the AGCC.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As my friend Senator Campbell says, the Prime Minister probably needed it. He will probably need a lot more in the future the way this government is going. It is a ridiculous and quite wrongful use of the credit card. It is important to point out that the Auditor-General in his report found:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The level of reported fraud identified was very low. </PARA>
<PARA>He then goes on to make this important point:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the full extent of fraud on the AGCC is not known because of inadequate control systems and ineffective reporting of fraud and misuse. The audit found 25 cases of fraud reported since 1987 with an approximate value of $400 000.</PARA>
<PARA>It is quite clear that that is very likely to be a major underestimate of the fraud. It is an indictment of the departments that they do not have proper control and monitoring systems in place to ensure that we do have a reasonable fix on what the real situation is. It raises quite fundamental questions about accountability and the potential for misuse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is of serious concern that this report follows hot on the heels of not only Auditor-General's report No. 20, which was also tabled today and to which Senator Tambling spoke so passionately and eloquently in raising such a matter of major concern, but also last week's Auditor-General's report on performance pay in the Australian Public Service and on inadequate dealing with under-performing Public Service officers. Taken together, these reports give the impression&mdash;rightly or wrongly&mdash;that the Public Service has some major problems which are costing Australian taxpayers a not inconsiderable amount of money. For example, in last week's report on performance pay in the Public Service, it was pointed out that more than $52 million was involved just in the administration of the performance pay scheme, let alone the additional payments which are often made for quite unjustified reasons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is about time that this Labor government began paying a lot more attention to the way it runs and administers government. With every passing day we glean more evidence of the massive and wildly costly incompetence of this government, in terms of both policy making and straight administration. This Auditor-General's report is just one example&mdash;but it is a classic example&mdash;of this fact, which I am sure will not be lost on the Australian public. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Auditor-General's report No. 21 of 1993-94, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian government credit card&mdash;its debits and credits</EMPHASIS>, which Senator Short has just referred to, is an alarming report. As he said, we were given an early taste of the report because of some leaking last week. However, our worst fears have been more than confirmed by the actual report itself. Senator Short has gone through some of the detail in it and I will seek to cover some other points.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we need to understand is that not only does this report follow on from the inquiries into the performance based pay scheme and the inadequate dealing with under-performing officers, where it was revealed last week that one non-performing officer had cost a department $300,000 to go through the procedures related to inefficiency, but also this report follows on from the one which was tabled a couple of weeks ago&mdash;which the people of Australia have yet to forget and I hope should never forget&mdash;on the inefficiency, maladministration and financial mismanagement of the sports rorts affair by Minister Kelly. I cannot believe that she is actually still a minister. What all of these reports show the Australian people is that no-one is responsible any more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Auditor-General's report contains pages of evidence relating to what should have been an efficient scheme for government purchasing that has run amuck over six years. No-one has reviewed the scheme to see whether or not it is working properly. When I asked Senator McMullan last week what he was going to do about it, he had a very carefully prepared brief which said that if anyone was found to be misusing the system they would be fined $20,000 or put in gaol. That is all very well, but the trouble is that over the last few months we have seen evidence that no checks have been made to see whether fraud has taken place or whether anyone is misusing the scheme. As Senator Short said, the Auditor-General's report states quite clearly that we cannot assess what fraud has taken place within this system because no-one knows what is going on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most alarming statements made by the Auditor-General early on in the report was that `There was no understanding of how the AGCC was used'. That lack of understanding was by the departments that use the card. In other words, we have 16,000 credit cards, some of which have credit limits of $2 million every month. So that is a $24 million per annum credit limit running around the country in the hands of some 16,000 Australian public servants who have very little understanding of how they are used. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report highlights the fact that most of the people using the credit cards have had insufficient training. In ATSIC, which was just referred to in another report, there was absolutely no training in the use of the credit cards. The better example, of course, is that of the Department of the Arts and Administrative Services, where training has been 100 per cent effective. But there are other departments that use the card quite regularly, such as Defence, where the training is less than adequate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To quote the Auditor-General's words, the report highlights some interesting expenditure on things like:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . chocolates, electricity generation and distribution&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I ask honourable senators to envisage how a credit card could be used to pay for electricity generation and distribution&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">floor coverings, flowers&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that reminds us of the Tax Department revelations&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">gas production and distribution, guns and ammunition, licensed clubs, lingerie&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>an interesting expenditure&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . mens and ladies fashion clothing, musical instruments&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>just to mention a few. Many Australian taxpayers' minds would boggle as to why credit cards, being paid for by the taxpayers, would be used on many of these items. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the more serious concerns of the opposition, which it shares with the Auditor-General, is the cost of using the credit cards. Originally, the scheme was introduced back in 1987 as a way of reducing paperwork and transactions costs and, therefore, saving taxpayers' money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All honourable senators would recall what used to happen a few years ago. A box of paper clips or something like that might cost $20, but with all the red tape that is involved in purchasing something for the Commonwealth or state governments, such as filling in requisition orders, issuing the cheque and having it cross-checked by half a dozen under deputy secretaries and assistants, the cost of purchasing the box of paper clips might be $60 when it should have been only $20. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt in anyone's mind that if we have a credit card system that has proper accountability, proper checks and proper audit trails, purchasing a box of paper clips for $20 using that system would be much more efficient. So the opposition does not oppose the use of a credit card system; indeed, we support it. However, we must learn from the alarm bells that the Auditor-General is ringing and make sure that we put in place adequate controls, checks, scrutiny and substantiation of all these expenditures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Short said, the original system was designed for purchases of less than $1,000. Indeed, what we have had are examples of expenditures well in excess of that. In fact, in the period between 23 March and 27 June this year, when the trial was run, there were 3,647 transactions in excess of $5,000. I remind the Senate: for a scheme that was designed and devised to expedite and make more efficient purchases of less than $1,000, there were 3,647 individual transactions in excess of $5,000 just in three months of the last financial year. These transactions represented something like 44 per cent of all expenditure on credit cards. So nearly half of all these expenditures was way in excess, more than five times in excess, of the guidelines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Short said, there was one interesting purchase where a credit card was used to buy a bomb suit for $893,000. The cost of these transactions is an important point. If the credit card system is used wisely, it will save the taxpayer money. In the case of the bomb suit, the cost of the transaction, including the minimum transaction fee, which is an added expense of using a credit card, was $11,603. The government actually pays that sooner or later, even though it is a charge that the bank puts on the supplier of the goods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A sensible purchasing officer who wanted to buy a bomb suit would go to the suppliers of the bomb suit&mdash;which is nearly $1 million worth of expenditure, just under $900,000 dollars&mdash;and negotiate with them. I think any of us would do that if we were using our own money to buy ourselves a bomb suit. Of course, if we had the choice of paying that supplier by cheque or electronic funds transfer or credit card and the supplier knew that the credit card would cost him something like $11,000 in servicing fees, it is not silly to assume that if we were to use an alternative purchasing method we could probably negotiate the price of the bomb suit down by somewhere in the vicinity of $10,000 or $11,000. This is a fact that the Auditor-General highlights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We understand&mdash;and it is understandable&mdash;that public servants are probably frustrated by the process that one would need to go through to get expenditures on these sorts of items approved. If a public servant needs to buy himself a bomb suit and he has a credit card that has a $2 million a month limit on it, it is probably a lot quicker to use the credit card. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the other major concerns&mdash;and I will restrict my remarks because we have a long week ahead of us, and my Whip has just given me the wind-up signal already&mdash;is the potential for fraud. Senator Short referred to the fact that only a few cases of fraud have been detected. They are very hard for the Auditor-General to pinpoint because of the incredible lack of scrutiny of expenditure; there could be fraud going on all around the place and we would not know about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report deals with the use of credit cards for personal use. On page 94 under section 30.6, it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Examples have come to notice where a cardholder has used the AGCC for private purposes. This has been reported by the cardholder shortly afterwards, accompanied by payment for the private expense. Alarmingly, the attitude of those cardholders and, indeed, that of the management of their agencies, sometimes appears to be that this is tolerable as the Commonwealth is not out of pocket and the cardholder has reported the matter.</PARA>
<PARA>This is a serious matter of concern because, in that case to which I have just referred, the cardholder was honest. He turned up on the Monday morning and said, `I spent some money on some private use over the weekend, and here is the money', so the Commonwealth is not out of pocket. For every one of those honest people, there are probably a couple of others who use the card for private use and no-one ever finds out. The trouble with this situation is that one of the other uses of the card is for cash withdrawals, which is explicitly against a number of guidelines and generally discouraged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We see from the Auditor-General's report that, in the last financial year, there were cash transactions and cash withdrawals in excess of $500,000. The mind boggles to think of holders of Commonwealth government credit cards going to handy tellers and withdrawing hundreds of dollars. The average transaction was actually $600 for these credit cards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of them, I am sure, were for proper purposes and would have been properly accounted for. But the Australian taxpayer needs to know that all of that expenditure is being properly acquitted and properly substantiated. I suggest that we are inviting fraud. I am sure that 99 per cent of public servants are totally honest, decent human beings who serve the Commonwealth in the best possible way they know how. But, when we give 16,000 Australian citizens a credit card on which there is a limit of up to $2 million and allow them to get cash out of the handy tellers&mdash;there is no bar on it; they have the plastic in their pockets and, if they want to go and get the cash, they can get it&mdash;we are inviting fraud; we are saying, `Here, come and get me'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by saying that there is international experience in this area which the Auditor-General has analysed. The federal government of the United States has a similar scheme; however, it has much stricter guidelines. The use of the card is better controlled and the average transactions are a hell of a lot lower than the average in Australia. The holders of those cards generally stick to using them for small purchases of less than $1,000. Also, there is a bar on those cards for cash withdrawals, which is one of the opposition's serious concerns with this report&mdash;they just cannot get cash, even if they want it. The Americans also have a far better system of scrutiny of expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report is a very detailed one. With the renegotiation of the Australian Government Corporate Card coming up in June 1994, it is extremely timely that the taxpayers of Australia, the Department of Finance and the relevant sections of the Department of the Arts and Administrative Services have this report when reviewing a system that has been in place for six years. It is quite incredible to think that this scheme has been in place for six years and only now do we have a review of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, again, this is indicative of some of the problems that are being experienced with this general devolution process. I believe that devolution in concept can be very good, as long as that devolution does not mean that in the process we dissolve responsibility, as opposed to devolving it. One of the problems we have here is that no-one in this parliament seems to be held responsible when these schemes muck up. The Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) will not take any responsibility for the maladministration and financial mismanagement, let alone the blatant, corrupt pork-barrelling, which has taken place during the sports rorts affair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Either the Minister for Finance or the Minister for the Arts and Administrative Services, or both, should at least take responsibility for what has taken place in respect of the Australian government credit card. If they will not take responsibility for what has taken place over the last six years, they should take responsibility for fixing it up and bringing back accountability. Someone has to take responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to see Mr Willis get up in the other place and say, `We are going to fix this. This is what we are going to do'. But in response to this report, the Department of Finance has basically said, `We just want some modest changes'. This report demands sweeping change to purchasing. It does not require fiddling at the edges; it requires a lot more accountability, checking and scrutiny to ensure that Australian taxpayers know that their money is not being wasted. </PARA>

But I must say that, looking through this report, the potential for misuse of funds on all sorts of things is quite incredible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think this report and the report that was presented earlier this afternoon certainly strengthen the case for the Auditor-General and the Australian National Audit Office to be retained. Perhaps some of those on the other side who have been critical of the Auditor-General and seek to dilute his authority should think again after seeing what he is bringing forward to the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Campbell said, the Australian Federal Police Association, in its submission to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Banking, Finance and Public Administration, said in regard to the level of fraud in the Commonwealth, `The simple fact is that we just do not know'. I have seen evidence where departments have set up their own fraud control units but still do not know what the level of fraud is within the departments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When this credit card system was set up, the government thought it was going to save money. But one should look at some of the facts that the Auditor-General has uncovered. If one believes that it is cheaper to use credit cards than cheques, one should look at this case: $354,000 was spent for the purchase of 202 containers. This generated a merchant services fee of something like $4,606, whereas the cost of paying by cheque would have been $12.60. One has to start asking oneself what this really is all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The potential to rort the system has been highlighted in this report. For instance, take the travel and hospitality area. The report instances the case of a traveller who received a cash advance for his travel allowance and then payed his hotel and restaurant bills with a credit card. In other words, he is double dipping. What took my eye was that part of the report in which the Auditor-General identified particular areas. I note that nothing was spent on undertakers, cemeteries and crematoriums; nor was anything spent on massage parlours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I note that there were two transactions for men's hairdressing totalling $155 and seven transactions for women's hairdressing totalling $2,631. One would have to ask: for what reason would any Commonwealth public servant use credit cards for nine transactions totalling something like $2,786 for men's and women's hairdressing? It is just quite bizarre. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other areas include doctors, dentists and camping equipment. As Senator Campbell said, the potential for fraud in these areas by using credit cards is quite immense. The figure for cafes and restaurants is $295,000; licensed hotels, $1.4 million; and private hotels, motels and other accommodation, $2.1 million. People have the right to use their credit cards in those areas. But it is interesting to note that between March and June there were 10,600 travel and travel related transactions totalling $14.8 million, and that included in that total was $307,000 paid to five star hotels and $205,000 to 4 1/2 star hotels. One wonders how these expenditures can be justified. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The speech read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From 1 May 1992 Victoria's Kirner government refinanced $1.267 billion in existing debt by converting it from a short-term borrowing within the public account to a medium-term borrowing from the private sector. In so doing, the Kirner government breached by that amount the 1991-92 global limit for new borrowing that had been set by the Australian Loan Council.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Kirner government did not promptly advise either the Commonwealth government or the Loan Council about this refinancing. The Commonwealth was not informed until 17 June and the matter deliberately was not raised by Victoria at the Loan Council meeting on 12 June 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There followed a period of more than three months during which this breach of Victoria's Loan Council global limit was not divulged either by Victoria or the Commonwealth. While the refinancing was referred to in the report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">State Finance Victoria</EMPHASIS> released on 23 September 1992, it was not until after the Victorian State election (on 3 October 1992) that the new Victorian government made public on 26 October that the global limit had been breached. Significantly, the refinancing was not revealed by the Commonwealth Treasurer (who is also Chairman of the Loan Council) in the 1992 Federal Budget papers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although the Commonwealth Treasury has argued that the Victorian refinancing needed to remain undisclosed  so as not to precipitate an adverse reaction in the financial market, there are reasons to believe that the market had already made a suitable assessment of Victoria's overall position. From the perspective of the then Labor governments in Victoria and Canberra, the imperative for non-disclosure undoubtedly was the imminent state election, if not the federal election due in the new year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Crucially, then, the events surrounding Victoria's breach of its Loan Council arrangements in mid-1992 demonstrate that executive governments, both Federal and State, can act to conceal financial decisions taken contrary to, not only formal commitments, but the national interest. While being significant in its own right, Victoria's breach of its 1991-92 global limit draws attention to a range of issues that deserve to be addressed and remedied.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first of these issues is accountability. The Financial Agreement under which the Loan Council was established does not specify ways in which the Council and its individual members should be accountable. Even the most recent proposals for reforming the Loan Council (announced in December 1992 and July 1993), while advocating accountability to the markets, do not propose accountability to parliaments. The Committee inquiry has established that it has been a major shortcoming of the Loan Council process not to have established clear conventions  where the Council and its members are accountable to parliaments specifically for decisions taken in that forum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second significant issue is the reporting of borrowing activity that is subject to Loan Council scrutiny and decision making. While the recent reform proposals provide for quarterly reporting to Loan Council on a uniform basis and an annual Financial Statement, they do not require that annual reports from the Loan Council be presented to parliaments. On this issue the Committee concluded that each jurisdiction under the Loan Council should present a report annually to its parliament. The Loan Council would present a consolidated report to the Commonwealth Parliament, this report also being tabled in the parliaments of all Loan Council jurisdictions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The third issue is closely associated with both the first and second&mdash;the auditing of reports to Loan Council and to parliaments. It was clear from the Select Committee inquiry that Auditors-General need to audit such reports and that the consolidated report presented to the Commonwealth Parliament and tabled in the parliaments of all Loan Council jurisdictions also must be audited. Without auditing, neither parliaments nor the Loan Council could have confidence in the information with which they were being presented. And given that adequate reporting is of major significance, the Loan Council must be capable of monitoring comprehensively the information with which it is provided.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Fourth, and as importantly as any other issue, the inquiry confirmed that numerous changes are required to the Financial Agreement (currently being redrafted). These changes must also be contained in legislation complementary to the redrafted Financial Agreement. They should cover each of the major issues to which I have already referred and others associated with them:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">-the requirements with regard to Commonwealth and State parliaments to ensure Loan Council accountability;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">-quarterly reporting and annual financial statements as already agreed by Loan Council;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">-the adoption of accrual accounting;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">-full auditing of relevant Loan Council statements by Auditors-General;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">-annual reports by all Loan Council jurisdictions to their parliaments, such reports to include the audit reports of relevant Auditors-General;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">-a coordinated Loan Council annual report (audited by the Commonwealth Auditor-General) covering all jurisdictions to be tabled in all parliaments; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">-Auditors-General to review annually their auditing practices at their regular meetings to ensure uniformity of approach.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clearly, if these initiatives are enshrined in a redrafted Financial Agreement and established in complementary legislation, then reform of the Loan Council and its processes will be considerably enhanced.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee's recommendations for reform of the Loan Council, honourable Senators will be aware, have not been achieved without considerable controversy about the inquiry. Some have gone so far as to describe it as a `political witch-hunt' because the circumstances of Victoria's breach of its global limit were considered in detail. Of course, the inquiry was anything but a `witch-hunt'; the Committee's conclusions and recommendations that propose comprehensive reform of the Loan Council bear testimony to that.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By the same token, it is regrettable that a number of persons invited to give evidence to the Committee did not cooperate. They include the Federal Treasurer, Mr Dawkins, and the former Victorian Premier Mrs Joan Kirner. Nevertheless the inquiry was most successful in hearing from a more than adequate range of witnesses as was pointed out in the dissent to the Second Report by Government Committee members. Those witnesses included the former Premier of New South Wales, Mr Greiner, the present Treasurer of Victoria, Mr Stockdale, and the Governor of the Reserve Bank, Mr Fraser. The Committee is most appreciative of their cooperation and contribution towards what has resulted in a most satisfying report which I commend to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Select Committee on the Functions, Powers and Operation of the Australian Loan Council was established following major public concern over the disclosure of the Victorian Kirner Labor Government's massive breach of its Loan Council borrowing limits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The $1.267 billion transaction occurred on 1 May 1992. It was not publicly revealed until 26 October 1992, when the new Victorian Treasurer, Mr Stockdale, made it public following the election of the Kennett Government on 3 October 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The deceit and complicity of the Treasurer, Mr Dawkins, in this matter became apparent during the hearings. Treasurer Dawkins never revealed the breach publicly and instead took part in an elaborate concealment of the fact. Page 67 of the final report confirms the interim report's findings in March 1993 that "the Committee believes that the Treasurer's actions had the effect of concealing a major breach of financial discipline from the public, who had a right to know the truth.".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Also of note on page 67 is the following question posed by the Committee, but unable to be answered adequately.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Given that he was advised of the Victorian breach on 6 July 1992, why did Mr Dawkins not make the Victorian borrowing explicit in the 1992-93 Budget papers, indicating that a breach of Loan Council limits had taken place ?"</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The only conclusion that can be drawn from this is that Treasurer Dawkins acted to protect the Kirner Labor Government from public criticism, as they were due to face a State election in the near future. That election occurred on 3 October 1992 and saw the Kirner Labor Government comprehensively defeated, largely as a result of its financial mismanagement and incompetence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fact was that Treasurer Dawkins was advised of the breach at the latest on 6 July 1992, when he was fully briefed, (Commonwealth Treasury was officially informed by Victorian Treasury as far back as 17 June 1992) yet neither said, nor did, anything publicly, and apparently little privately, about this massive breach (described by the Committee as "the most significant and public undermining of the Loan Council's procedures in its history") until it was announced by Mr Stockdale at the end of October 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The refusal of the main political participants&mdash;i.e Treasurer Dawkins, then Victorian Premier Kirner and then Victorian Treasurer Sheehan&mdash;in the breach and its subsequent concealment, to give evidence to the Committee can only heighten speculation that they had something to hide in a party  politically inspired manner.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The events of 1992 dubbed the "Victorian Loans Affair" were important considerations for the Coalition Senators in arriving at the conclusions and recommendations in the report. Our Minority Report contains some qualifications to the main report itself, but does not seek to lessen the final chapter, 8, in particular. Those recommendations are essentially about reducing the opportunity for political cover ups, like the Victoria Loans Affair in 1992, and increasing disclosure, accountability, and the integrity of the Loan Council system. They are practical worthwhile proposals which would undoubtedly be of benefit to the Australian public.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The work of this Select Committee is further evidence of the fundamental role the Senate has to play in monitoring and curbing the incompetences and the excesses of executive governments.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the interests of securing the passage of major legislative packages through the Senate this week, I intend being brief on what has been a long over-due end to this committee's deliberations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have now had 3 reports to the Senate and quite a number of minority reports. As opposed to the long winded debate on the I.R. bill, I am pleased that senators opposite have shown some restraint in debate on this report and refrained from simply restating old arguments which have been canvassed in previous reports by incorporating their speeches in Hansard.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addressing this report I wish to make a number of things clear:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Loans Council is a voluntary entity, it can only operate effectively if its participants respect the sovereignty of the other governments and enjoy some confidentiality in regard to the detailed discussions which occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the view of government senators, much if this committee's work has been a waste of time as all substantive issues were addressed in the 1992 and July 1993 Loans Council reforms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In spite of the fact that Victoria does not appear in the inquiry's terms of reference, much of the committee's time has been wasted on an opposition witch hunt which has produced no new information about events in Victoria in 1992&mdash;what is known is that there was no illegality on the part of the then Victorian Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasurer Mr Dawkins has been totally exonerated from accusations of any wrong doing. In regard to the sale and lease back issue, Mr Dawkins simply maintained the confidentiality as befits a voluntary arrangement. He acted conscientiously in regards to the best interests of the Commonwealth and Victoria, and on advice from his department.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It needs to be understood that Loan Council borrowing agreements have been breached on numerous occasions&mdash;the Sydney Harbour tunnel, the Eraring project, the finance and lease arrangements of New South Wales railway stock are all examples of technical breaches.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If this committee has served any useful purpose, it is to throw public light upon the questions and processes of the Loan Council deliberations. Unfortunately, the unbalanced attention to Victoria has often obscured the positive aspects of this discussion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sovereign governments must make decisions in regards to their infrastructure needs, debt management and their budgeting circumstances and at times this has involved breaches to borrowing limits. Flexibility has traditionally been a central element of the arrangements between the members of the Loan Council. As Mr Nicholls told the inquiry, only the Commonwealth has historically been interested in policing agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What is important is the issue of accountability&mdash;accountability to the people who elected them to manage the affairs of the state. The major reform principles, already agreed by the Loans Council over the last twelve months, will encourage greater disclosure and accountability.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many witnesses before the committee have expressed views on accountability and this issue is crucial in considering the current and future operations of the Loans Council.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I remain unconvinced by the arguments supporting greater market regulation of government borrowing activities. It has been suggested that there is no need for institutions such as the Loans Council. Many on the opposite side of the chamber would like to see it abolished in favour of a free marketeer approach which would rely on the discipline of the markets to monitor and restrain public sector borrowings. The government senators consider this to be a most irresponsible course of action.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Without ruling out a role for the financial markets, the Loans Council is essential to control the quantum of public sector borrowing; provide a forum for the states to discuss economic difficulties and; it provides a useful macro-economic lever for the Commonwealth government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many witnesses confirmed this viewpoint and expressed concern about relying too heavily on market discipline.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Standards and Poor stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Major credit rating agencies such as Standard and Poor's (S&amp;P) play a specialised but restricted role in financial markets. Credit ratings perform the isolated function of credit risk evaluation, which is one element of the entire investment (i.e. lending) decision-making process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Schroeders Australia stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where there continues to exist a residual Commonwealth responsibility for the financial obligations of State or Territory Governments, either real or perceived, then it would seem to be inappropriate to leave the responsibility for monitoring financial performance entirely to the market. In the event that a State or Territory Government was unable to meet its commitments the market may not readily accept this responsibility without looking to the Commonwealth for redress.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Des Moore from the Institute of Public Affairs stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The main problem with such a "market solution" is that governments do not necessarily respond to market signals, or at least not in a timely way. Further, markets and credit rating agencies are susceptible to allowing governments to borrow excessively because they know that, in the end, governments can and do generally fall back on their taxing powers to service their debts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Barbara Veoh, the former general manager of Vic Fin stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dilution replacement of Loan Council controls of the public sector borrowing requirement with a more market driven mechanism for the rationing of credit needs to take into account some of the following aspects. Firstly, there is the potential moral hazard at the Commonwealth and State government level. The extent to which the market operates on the basis of an implicit government guarantee can act to counterbalance market efficiencies in the rationing of credit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly, an entirely market driven system of credit rationing with heavy reliance placed upon credit agency assessments of public sector entities and governments would not necessarily encourage cooperation between the states and the Commonwealth in the development of macro-economic policy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thirdly, an entirely market driven system to ration public sector calls upon the capital markets would, in practice, primarily reflect market assessment of reported or rumoured information and not in itself be a panacea for prevention of non-disclosure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And so we see a broad cross section of groups all cautioning the government on the total reliance of the markets. It would appear that only the Liberal Party with their discredited ideological objectives still believes in this irresponsible approach.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of course government senators, along with the Commonwealth Treasurers clearly see a role for the financial markets&mdash;a role that complements the Loan Council which would continue to set borrowing limits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Governments must be accountable to the people who elected them. In making deliberations about spending on health, education, infrastructure or a range of other social policy they are accountable to the general community, not just the financial community. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They must take into account the perspective of current taxpayers, future taxpayers as well as the views of the financial community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is regrettable that this committee has taken 12 months to produce results which have basically been superseded by Loans Council reforms and which have little relevance to the current operations of the Loans Council.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I look forward to the end of this committee so that we can direct our attention to the more important issues facing the nation.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The statement read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The delegation comprised myself as leader of the delegation; Senator Jim Short, deputy leader; the Hon Don Dobie, MP; and Ms Mary Crawford, MP. Ms Robyn McClelland was delegation secretary, and my wife, Ms Jackie Watkins, accompanied the delegation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The visit of the parliamentary delegation was timely. In Vietnam, there has been a recent surge in Australian investment and commercial interest. The visit preceded the forthcoming visit to Vietnam of an Australian delegation on human rights.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In Laos, the Mekong River Friendship Bridge between Laos and Thailand, which has been funded by Australia, is nearing completion for opening in April 1994. The visit preceded the visit to Australia this week of the Lao Prime Minister, Mr Khamtay Siphandone.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The timing of the visit to Cambodia is particularly significant, following immediately after the establishment of the Constitution, the Parliament and the Government of the Kingdom of Cambodia. The three countries have not been visited by official parliamentary delegations for some time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As leader of the Parliamentary delegation to Indo China, the three main themes I have gained from the mission to Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia are the desperate struggle for Peace, Economic Development to alleviate poverty, and the Re-Settlement of people who had previously fled their homelands in fear of their lives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Leaders and Parliamentarians of all three nations were determined to work for internal and regional peace. Many experienced war and conflict at first hand, most have lost close relatives in the respective conflicts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Each country faces unique and individual problems but all share the fact that they  have recently been ravaged by war, have lost hundreds of thousands of people, and are poor and underdeveloped. I found a very firm resolve to work for greater national and regional stability and with that, to alleviate poverty. Politicians in each of the countries all realised that economic development would not and could not happen in conflict or warlike situations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The aim of the delegation's Report is to inform members of the Australian Parliament and Australians in general about the three countries, and specifically in relation to the status of economic and political development, the prospects for national stability and trade, and foreign policy and development cooperation issues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Indochinese region is significant to Australia because of its proximity and size, its importance for regional stability, and because many Australians are immigrants from the Indochinese countries. The report presents a number of recommendations, aimed at optimising Australia's role in the region, and ensuring that our good relationship with the three nations continue and develop.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The delegation saw it as important to ensure that its Report was presented quickly: the information in the report may become less valuable with the passage of time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Report presents Australian business people with information on the opportunities for developing Australia's investment and commercial interests in the three countries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia is well placed to be part of regional and in-country economic development, we are already the third largest foreign investor nation in Vietnam, and enjoy good political, diplomatic and business relations with Laos and Cambodia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An investment promotion and protection agreement between Australia and Laos is expected to be signed this week during the visit of the Lao Prime Minister. Whilst exports of Australian goods to all these nations is relatively small, all of them represent opportunities for growth in the foreseeable future. However, Australian business should be warned that there are high risks in chasing short term high return projects, rather they should prepare for the long haul.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would like to refer to two other matters included in the Report, human rights, and the Australian development cooperation programs in the three countries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whilst human rights was not a principal focus of the delegation, the delegation did raise particular issues on behalf of the constituents of its members. The Report includes two recommendations on human rights.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The delegation's investigations into a number of Australian funded aid projects showed in most instances, the programs addressed basic needs of the people, and were geared to be sustainable with training for locals being built into each program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Relatively little funding was made to go a long way with people and communities were being developed at the same time. The delegation visited many aid projects, and was generally satisfied with what it saw. There were, however, issues of viability and accountability for some projects. The delegation considers it very important for aid administrators to get out into the field to see their projects. A project that looks fine on paper may not be so in practice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The showpiece of the aid program was undoubtedly a visit to the recently completed Friendship Bridge over the Mekong River which joins Laos and Thailand.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Report is likely to be of particular interest to members of the Vietnamese, Lao and Cambodian communities in Australia. For example, the Report presents information on the situations facing `returnees' to each of the three countries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It includes in particular, a detailed statement from the Government of Cambodia on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I was particularly pleased with the responses we received in each country to questions about returnees&mdash;people who had previously fled their homelands to escape from war and the after effects of conflict.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A total of 42,000 people have returned to Laos, 30,000 of them voluntarily deciding to leave refugee camps and take control of their own lives. The number of Vietnamese who have returned so far is 50,000 and a staggering 370,000 have gone back to Cambodia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What pleases me most is the fact that these people, almost half a million of them, have not been punished, discriminated against or otherwise victimised. The delegation members questioned Ministers, Members of Parliament, Human Rights organisations, representatives from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, National Red Cross organisations and others including Australian Embassy staff in Hanoi, Vientiane and Phnom Penh.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Vietnamese Vice Foreign Minister Vu Khoan welcomed the return of boat people. Over 100,000 Vietnamese people are still in camps in South East Asia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The delegation were told that a number of Lao had returned to investigate business possibilities and several had remained operating businesses. We were told of a refugee who returned from France to Lao only six months before the December 1992 National Assembly elections. He had stood as a candidate and is now a Member of the Lao National Assembly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">HRH Prince Norodom Sirivudh, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs in Cambodia, assured the delegation that boat people would be welcomed back and that exit formalities for those who wanted to leave again, would be freely available to Cambodian citizens.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">His  Royal Highness went on to say that the Royal Cambodian Government understood that people had fled previous regimes, not from the democratically elected Royal Government. He specifically mentioned and welcomed the Australian Government's Special Assistance Category Program recently announced by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Senator Nick Bolkus.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The delegation would like to record its appreciation to the Chairmen of the National Assemblies of Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia for the hospitality and courtesy extended during its visit. The delegation also thanks the Australian Ambassadors to each of the countries: H.E. Michael Potts, H.E. Michael Mann and H.E. John Holloway. Australia can feel justly proud of the efforts of our Ambassadors and the staff of embassies in these countries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I thank officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Parliamentary Research Service and the Parliamentary Relations Office for helping with the delegation's program. I make special mention of the delegation secretary, Robyn McClelland, whose assistance and advice, prior, during and after the mission was invaluable.

<PARA>When the Australian parliamentary delegation left Australia in the middle of October this year, we went to visit friends in three countries very important to this nation&mdash;Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. The reason why they are friends and why we have such close links is partly historical, but it also relates to the metabolism of the peoples of each of the countries and, indeed, of our own country, Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the rest of the world, led by the United States, China and ASEAN, isolated Vietnam from the rest of the world, Australia took its own path and now we are reaping the benefits of following our own lead and perhaps being ahead of our time. Australia is now the third largest investor in Vietnam.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> We have had diplomatic relationships with Laos for over 40 years and those relationships have been built on by the visit of the delegation and, indeed, by today's visit to this country of the Prime Minister of Laos.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not a great deal more needs to be said about Cambodia. The efforts of our foreign minister, Senator Gareth Evans, and his team in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, which led to the historic peace settlement of that troubled nation, are on the record and we will glory in that peace settlement for many years to come. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the five minutes I have allocated to me, I want to touch on only one element from each of the countries that we went to. On page 31 of the report, there is a photograph of the delegation visiting the Women's Union Vocational Training Centre in Haiphong, the third largest city in Vietnam. The delegation is photographed with people who had previously fled from Vietnam, who have now returned and who are, with an Austcare-funded project, now resettling into their homeland. It was very heartening to me and the rest of the delegation to be able to witness that and spend some little time with the people that we met there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The delegation made one very significant achievement during the visit to Vietnam. At our very first official meeting, we made a request to deliver some letters to some monks who are part of the United Buddhist Congregation of Vietnam. It was not until the very last morning, in fact on our way to the airport, that we were able to deliver those letters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We met with the Most Venerable Thich Quang Do on our way to the airport. It has been put to me since my return to Australia that this is the first occasion on which a delegation of foreigners, be they parliamentarians or whatever, have been able to meet with dissidents of the like of the venerable that we met with. We did not have a tremendous amount of time with the gentleman in question, but I think it was very significant that a meeting took place at all. I think that is a sign that Vietnam is perhaps changing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In questioning Vietnamese ministers about their attitude towards human rights&mdash;as a matter of fact it was by Mr Phac and it is noted in paragraph 2.112 of the report&mdash;Mr Phac advised that a dialogue on human rights issues was very important. Vietnam had its own legal system and was doing its best to conform to international standards. Individual human rights were guaranteed by the constitution. In Vietnam's view, democracy and human rights were historical concepts. Vietnam could extend democracy step by step in accordance with its traditions and its economic development. I think Australia does have to be somewhat patient in trying to push our standards of human rights onto the Vietnamese.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had intended to mention our visit to one of the provinces in Laos, quite some distance from the capital of Vientiane, where we saw some magnificent on-the-ground Australian government funded aid projects in action, but unfortunately all I can do now is draw it to the attention of the Senate. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;By arrangement, we have five minutes each, a very short time in which to deal with such an important report. I fully endorse the remarks made by the leader of the delegation to Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia, Senator McKiernan, whom I had the pleasure to accompany as deputy leader. I endorse his remarks and also the tabling statement that he made on behalf of the delegation.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a couple of points I would like to make in the time at my disposal. It is very timely, indeed, that this report is being presented to the parliament on the very day of the visit to Canberra of the Prime Minister of Laos, His Excellency Mr Khamtay.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As noted by the delegation, the visit occurred at a time of significant change in the internal policy priorities and external relationships of the three countries. Our visit was, therefore, very informative to all of us who visited these countries in assisting our understanding of the changes and developments in the Indochina region. I make the point, as Senator McKiernan did, that with each of these three countries Australia has a very close, warm and, I believe, growing relationship.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In each of the three countries, I certainly got the very strong impression of countries on the move, all of them benefiting greatly from the economic reforms of recent years, although they are of course starting from a very low base indeed. In each of them, we were struck by the strength of the goodwill that existed towards Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In each of the countries, we were the guests of the national assembly and that perhaps imposed limitations on our program, although again I would say that in virtually all instances we were able to have the meetings and discussions we asked for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Vietnam, we sought, as Senator McKiernan said, to include in our program meetings with a number of people who have suffered under the current regime, which prevents true democracy and fails to provide the sorts of civil liberties and basic human rights that we in Australia take for granted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, the delegation was privileged to meet with the Most Venerable Thich Quang Do, the Secretary General of the United Buddhist Congregation of Vietnam. I must say that that meeting took place only after considerable pressure from the delegation&mdash;Thich Quang Do has been under house arrest for several years&mdash;and the meeting was permitted by the Vietnamese authorities only at the last minute. It took place at 6.30 on the morning of our departure from Vietnam. It was a very brief meeting, about 20 minutes or thereabouts, and it lacked, therefore, some of the substance that we would have wished for. Nevertheless, the fact that it was included in the end as part of our official visit was, I think, a matter of some encouragement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most notable exception to a positive response to our requests for meetings was the failure of our hosts to allow us to meet with Professor Doan Viet Hoat and Dr Nguyen Dan Que, both of whom are internationally recognised prisoners of conscience and serving long sentences. It was a matter for regret that we were not able to meet them and I am concerned at the events that have occurred since the delegation's visit in October, particularly the now solitary confinement of Professor Hoat, for reasons that I have elaborated on on other occasions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Human rights issues do remain an area of considerable importance in respect of Australia's relationship with Vietnam. In that respect, the forthcoming human rights delegation to Vietnam from Australia that was agreed during Prime Minister Kiet's visit to Australia last May to be of very considerable importance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lack of time prevents me from saying all the other things I would like to have said. A great deal could be said about Laos and certainly about Cambodia&mdash;starting with a new government, a new parliament and a new spirit. Cambodia has a huge task ahead of it and we wish it well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I do wish to join Senator McKiernan in the appreciation he expressed to all of those persons&mdash;Vietnamese, Lao and Cambodian&mdash;plus Australian officials and business people who did so much to make our visit so valuable, informative and enjoyable. I want in particular to thank the members of the national assemblies in each of the three countries we visited for their hospitality and friendly assistance at all times.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I foreshadow opposition amendment No.13, dealing with secondary boycotts, part 6, pages 65 to 82 inclusive, and clauses 36 to 54, which reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is hereby declared, for the avoidance of doubt, that the statute laws of the Commonwealth relating to secondary boycotts, as in force on 7 December 1993, served the public interest.".</PARA>
<PARA>In speaking to this amendment, the opposition wants to put it fairly and squarely on the record that we believe that the situation which now relates to secondary boycotts is appropriate for Australia from a number of points of view. Firstly, it gives protection to business from unfair and unjust interference across a full spectrum of boycott activity, including political boycotts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the government does in its legislation, in transferring certain aspects of sections 45D and 45E to the industrial relations bill, is remove that aspect, which we believe is a step in the wrong direction. In fact, it will give open slather to a number of organisations or individuals to pursue matters of a political nature, which will in fact do serious and continuing damage to the Australian economy. It will also do serious and continuing damage to employers, or businesses, and, of course, the employees within those businesses, because they will suffer equally from this type of action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point that we want to make in terms of the secondary boycott provisions is that in dealing with them under the Trade Practices Act and through the Federal Court they remain in what I would term a proper court of law, not a specialist court. We believe it is a dangerous precedent, in terms of industrial or political matters, to be establishing an industrial court or one that is a specialist court that has certain restrictions around it in terms of carrying out its functions in a fair and equitable way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I particularly refer to the 72-hour clause, relating to the length of time before action can be taken, which will be contained in this legislation. One must note here that the principal role of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and the industrial court attached to it will be conciliation. In a national context, enormous damage can be inflicted on a business or on our reputation as a reliable supplier of goods and services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to that, damage can be done to a particular business which is a supplier within Australia. For example, I know of a Western Australian business which produced mining equipment which was needed by a deadline in New South Wales. Because the company did not meet that deadline, it lost the contract. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addressing the position that we believe is the proper one, we must reject the government's proposals. One must also question some other aspects of the government's proposals, which I will deal with when we look at the bill clause by clause. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also raise this issue with Senator Bell from the Democrats. Senator Bell sat through most of the inquiry's hearings, if not all the hearings, into sections 45D and E. One could not but conclude at the end of those hearings that a number of aspects were raised about the use of sections 45D and E and their effectiveness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to some of the evidence given to the inquiry. Between 1977 and June 1993, only 206 court actions involved the use of sections 45D and E. The vast majority of those court actions were taken against unions. Forty per cent of the applicants were able to obtain interim injunctions to halt the damage to their business. Under the government's proposal, we will find that there can be up to 72 hours of damage. As one witness said to us, 72 hours can be a long time, particularly if we are dealing with a Madonna concert, for example. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing that came through very clearly was that this measure was a very strong deterrent. People thought very carefully before they went into boycott action, which I think is a very important aspect of this matter. Law must be a deterrent. We must be aware of the consequences of taking an action which can harm and hurt somebody else. There must be balance in dealing with these aspects between the various parties. The government's proposal removes that balance. During this debate, we have heard much from a number of speakers here about discrimination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite categorically, the removal of sections 45D and E from the Trade Practices Act and the changes being made are creating a serious and severe discrimination against the wealth producers of this nation, against those who will be responsible for overcoming the unemployment difficulties we have in this nation, and against those who are prepared to invest and expand our economy to maintain our standard of living. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When this matter was last debated, former Senator Jack Evans of the Democrats summed it up absolutely perfectly:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one gets to a secondary boycott which is non-industrial&mdash;an economic boycott or a political boycott&mdash;one has a very difficult position which probably cannot be satisfactorily resolved under a conciliation and arbitration system.</PARA>
<PARA>That is exactly what the government is trying to do and, as I understand, it is supported by the Democrats today. Jack Evans further stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It will probably need to be taken out of that system so that it can be handled through other courts. Partly because of that but, in the end principally because of the unwillingness of the Minister to budge at all in looking at a number of alternatives that have been put to him by industry representatives&mdash;representatives of the Confederation of Australian Industry, the Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia and many others&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>That is exactly the same as the situation we have now. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Australian Democrats have been put into the position that we will have no alternative but to reject outright the proposals in this legislation. We will do so unhesitatingly, without any qualms of conscience, because we know that we will be protecting a very vulnerable group. Such a group includes people in small business who, if they become the targets of a secondary boycott, are likely to suffer not just a brief economic setback but could suffer annihilation.</PARA>
<PARA>He later said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Regrettably the alternatives to sections 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act, as proposed by the Minister, simply give access in the first instance to a conciliation system.</PARA>
<PARA>I have already made that point. This is very relevant. Jack Evans continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This means sitting around the table and having a chat&mdash;nobody would have any power to arbitrate&mdash;in the hope that something good will come out of it. That is fine if the person who was subjected to that sort of pressure was not in the vulnerable position of having to expect an instant decision.</PARA>
<PARA>I cannot emphasise enough the importance of that instant decision. I also want to lay to rest a couple of furphies that were thrown at us about the position of employees not being protected under the current provisions of sections 45D and E as far as taking action with regard to their working conditions and their position. That matter is covered in section 45D(iii). It is backed up by precedent established in a 1990 court case involving the AMIEU. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another furphy that came up related to political boycotts. Once again there is precedent in law. In a case involving the BLF and a company in Western Australia, action was taken with regard to a boycott situation. Because the boycott was targeted at the Western Australian government and Homeswest&mdash;this is a very important precedent relating to sections 45D and E&mdash;the court did not consider it to be targeted at the business on which the picket line was put up. That was known as the Jaycorp case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to the Minister for the Arts and Administrative Services (Senator McMullan) who is at the table and to Senator Bell that when they are dealing with this matter they should take into consideration these aspects of the law and the precedents. By removing sections 45D and E from the Trade Practices Act, they are destroying a whole set of precedents in law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the next two, five or probably 10 years under this legislation, we will see a whole series of precedent-setting court causes to establish precisely what I call the gobbledegook, because I am having a great difficulty understanding this, and so are a lot of legal people. Only the courts will sort out what it actually means. The government and the Democrats are creating a situation where the lawyers of this country, the legal firms of this country, will have another bonanza. If they want a lawyer-led recovery, they are going the right way about it, not only in terms of this legislation but also the legislation that we will be dealing with either tomorrow or the next day&mdash;the Mabo legislation. I will not say any more about Mabo now, because I will have my opportunity then. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government seems hell-bent on this, and the Democrats seem to be in the same situation. They want to create bonanzas for legal people when proper precedent is already set down in law. People understand the rules. The rules have worked effectively; they have protected Australian industry. There is protection for people's working conditions&mdash;which was established quite clearly in the inquiry's hearing&mdash;and there is protection when the action is targeted, as it is in this case, at the government of the day&mdash;the Western Australian Labor government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In foreshadowing this amendment, I emphasise to Senator Bell, who is here on behalf of the Democrats, that we believe that what Senator Evans said back then is as true and factual today. Nothing has changed in the government's fundamental thrust, except that it is giving additional privileges to the union movement&mdash;we will deal with that when we get to some of the clauses in the bill&mdash;at the expense of those who are not in the union movement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of these issues which we will be raising are quite horrendous. I ask the minister to think very carefully before he continues down this path. He has probably gone so far down this track that he cannot reverse.

Those rewards will damage&mdash;I should not be using the word `rewards'&mdash;the Australian economy, business in this country, our reputation as an international supplier and the employees who work in those various businesses.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Chairman. I oppose clauses 36 to 54 which we are presently dealing with. They seek to remove the legislative provisions relating to secondary boycotts from the Trade Practices Act and install a much watered-down version of those provisions into the Industrial Relations Act through this amendment bill. Like all my coalition colleagues, I am vehemently opposed to this proposal. I indicate that opposition and also indicate support for the amendments which have been foreshadowed by Senator Crane with regard to declaring that the statute laws of the Commonwealth relating to secondary boycotts, as in force on 7 December 1993, serve the public interest. I also support the amendment to clause 40, which has been foreshadowed by Senator Crane.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I was saying before being interrupted by the discussion on the procedures to be adopted in relation to these clauses, secondary boycotts have been a serious and significant problem throughout the history of Australian industrial relations. Until the introduction of legislation by the Fraser government that provided for a remedy against secondary boycotts through the Trade Practices Act, they were a very costly problem for the business and industry sector and for the nation as a whole. Since that secondary boycott legislation was introduced by the Fraser government in 1977, there has been a continual campaign by the trade union movement and certain academics to have that legislation repealed and having at least&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Kemp" NAMEID="WW4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WW4">Senator Kemp</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Because it was effective.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FF4">Senator CHAPMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Kemp says, because it was effective. Those groups failed to get the legislation repealed so they sought to have it watered down in the way the government is seeking to water it down through these proposed new clauses in this bill. That campaign by the trade union organisations and their supporting weak-kneed academics has been entirely self-interested. The reason they have sought to water this legislation down is that it has been so effective in preventing the enormous damage which secondary boycotts previously caused to business activity and ultimately to employees through the damage it caused to businesses and therefore their capacity to provide jobs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth noting that as far back as 1984 the predecessor to the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry conducted a survey of employers to see how many employers had used sections 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act relating to secondary boycotts in the previous 18 months. It is worth looking at some of the reactions it got in that survey. A typical response was, `The unions involved in the boycott were totally recalcitrant until section 45D proceedings'. That word is fashionable these days. It is good to see that it was used as far back as 1984. That word has been highlighted in recent days so we know what it means. It means stubborn. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While it was possible pre sections 45D and 45E for employers to take action to overcome secondary boycotts, that action took much longer to initiate and it took much longer to get an effective result. By the time successful action was taken under the legislation that applied prior to 1977 companies could be bankrupt and out of business and the jobs that those companies provided destroyed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any delay in court proceedings which occurred before sections 45D and 45E were available was disastrous for particular businesses. I cite as examples the waterfront industry and the building industry. In those industries even one day's delay can destroy a business. In the waterfront industry it can even destroy the goods that are waiting to be shipped overseas to our customers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know only too well the damage that has been done to our export industries for years and years by industrial action of this sort on the waterfront. Australia has become known around the world as an unreliable supplier of goods and services because of our waterfront disputes and the use of secondary boycotts. These actions cause enormous damage to our trade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Do we really want to encourage secondary boycotts to rear their heads again? That is what the government's proposed amendment will do. This proposed amendment will make it much more difficult for employers and businesses to act against secondary boycotts because we are making them less effective and much weaker. There is also a 72 hour delay in having effective access to secondary boycott provisions under the government's proposal. The removal of sections 45D and 45E from the Trade Practices Act and their installation into the industrial relations legislation will undoubtedly reduce the protection that is available to employers against primary and secondary boycotts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to the claim by some that these provisions are not really necessary because they have not been used all that often to seek and to ultimately award damages on the part of employers. In evidence given to the Senate committee that investigated the government's proposal to change the way sections 45D and 45E operated, it was made clear by witness after witness that it was not the fact that this legislation provided for damages to be claimed and obtained but it was just the availability of this clause that was useful. Businesses that were threatened by secondary boycotts would have access to sections 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act and could use that as a deterrent. A submission to that inquiry lodged by the National Farmers Federation stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Rather than have 45D and 45E seen in negative terms, these provisions are a positive method of settling disputes and more importantly a means by which to prevent them. As more employers have exhibited their willingness to exercise their rights to legal redress, the union movement has been forced to be held accountable for their actions. With the realisation that unions may have to make some contributions to the damages that they cause, this has created a situation where unions are more cautious about engaging in prohibited conduct. This in no way impinges upon a union's rights but merely places those rights into perspective with the rights of all in society.</PARA>
<PARA>That was specific evidence from the National Farmers Federation but it mirrored evidence from many witnesses to that inquiry, which highlighted the usefulness of sections 45D and 45E being maintained within the Trade Practices Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Witness after witness to that inquiry clearly showed that sections 45D and 45E were usually used as a last resort. Those sections were used when attempts to obtain relief within the industrial relations jurisdiction had failed. Sections 45D and 45E were available as a last resort because those provisions are not presently contained within the industrial relations jurisdiction. They are within the Trade Practices Act and therefore outside the jurisdiction of the industrial relations system and outside the jurisdiction and the control of the industrial relations club. Given that these provisions are used only when the industrial relations jurisdiction has failed, to include these provisions within that jurisdiction will emasculate them in terms of their effectiveness and their utility to employers to defend themselves against rapacious unions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another witness to that inquiry was asked why injunctions rarely led to damages, and that witness responded by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a common experience in relation to any forms of statutory or common law relief which is available to employers. They are, as a rule, not availed of as a first resort. There is normally an attempt to resolve the issue by other means and, if those means fail, the employers will turn to whatever remedies are available to them. As we pointed out, section 45D has proved very effective in that sense, either the threat of the relief being sought or of the injunction being obtained.</PARA>
<PARA>Again we see that the effectiveness of this legislation is simply its availability. It is not that it has on many occasions resulted in payment of substantial damages. I can recall cases where that has occurred. In the Mudginberri Abattoirs and the Dollar Sweets cases the ultimate penalty has been exacted from the recalcitrant damaging behaviour of trade unions, and substantial damages have been obtained by those particular businesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite unjust and it is contrary to the interests of this country to have access to common law remedies seriously weakened in the way that these proposed new clauses will do. Incorporating those provisions into the industrial relations legislation will weaken the anti-boycott provisions of the trade practices legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a direct threat to small business because by and large it is small business that has benefited from the application of this legislation.

A further difficulty that the opposition has with these proposals is the requirement that 72 hours must pass before a business can seek remedy under the government's much watered down secondary boycott provisions that will apply in the industrial relations legislation. That is far too long for a business to have to wait to seek remedy when a secondary boycott is put in place. A business may be staging a one-day event. That time would be passed and the whole event would be ruined, with enormous losses to that particular business. Under these proposals, there is no protection afforded against politically motivated secondary boycotts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw my remarks to a close by saying that in no way can the opposition countenance this proposal. It is a direct threat to all business, particularly small business, in its capacity to protect itself against the rapacious activities of militant trade unions. The benefit of this legislation is in its deterrent effect, the very fact of it simply being there, simply being available for use by a business threatened in this way. That benefit will be completely lost if these clauses are passed and become part of the Industrial Relations Reform Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In effect, these proposals put unions above the law, and that is something that ought not to be countenanced. Unions ought to be subject to the law in exactly the same way as every other member of our community is. But this again shows the bias of this legislation; it shows the bias of this government; it shows the pay-off that this government is giving the trade union movement by putting it above the law and by not making unions subject to the law in a way that other members of our community are. It is simply a device by which this government is seeking to reinforce the privileged position of trade unions in our community. It is a privilege which the unions abuse time and time again; it is a privilege to which they are not entitled; and it is a privilege which this legislation ought not give them. That is why these clauses ought to be removed from this amending bill. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to amendment No. 13, with which we are specifically dealing and on which Senator Crane specifically wishes us to vote initially. Quite clearly, the government does not support the amendment; it does not support the deletion of the clause or the proposed insertion. It simply highlights the contrasting approaches&mdash;not just to secondary boycotts but to the question of industrial relations overall. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was an historic debate and a major confrontation in 1983 about the issue of alternative approaches to industrial relations&mdash;the confrontation versus consensus debate of 1983. Over the decade nobody has been able to tell what the outcome of the confrontationist approach would have been. Its advocates can claim that all sorts of wonderful virtues would have followed if only it had been pursued. But we can certainly establish that the consensus approach has been remarkably successful, with historically low levels of industrial disputes. I know that people who like to downplay the success of the accord say that is because of the economic difficulties in Australia, but even in the periods of sustained high growth during the early 1980s we had remarkably low levels of industrial dispute as a result of the consensus approach. The government sought to make changes to sections 45D and 45E consistent with that consensus approach. We were not successful then. We are seeking to do so again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not a question of good versus evil. It is about alternative approaches to industrial relations and finding an approach that will most effectively serve the national interest. The national interest is not well served by our saying that one side is in defence of the national interest and that the other is in some way malicious, poorly motivated or seeking in some way to undermine the national interest. That is not the case. We have contrasting views. I strongly disagree with the views of the opposition about industrial relations, but I accept that it sincerely holds them. I would not mind if it returned the compliment. But we accept that the opposition's views are sincerely held, even if wrong. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To me and, I think, to any observer it must be obvious that a great number of those early actions sought under sections 45D and 45E were occasioned by the 70s-style disputes which were essentially demarcation disputes&mdash;arm wrestles between unions establishing power bases; a lot of huffing and puffing between those seeking power bases; and a lot of victimisation of legitimate businesses going about their legitimate business and suffering at the hands of the unions. I do not move away from my horror at the ramifications of these quite stupid actions by unions which, at that time, were irresponsible and arrogant in their attitude towards the welfare of others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it has to be recognised that this has occurred in the past 20 years. Indeed, events in the early 1970s provoked these measures, the mid-1970s justified them, and in the late 1970s these practices were effectively quelled. In relation to union amalgamations, the changes in work practices and the reorganisation of awards, I am sure we would be helped constructively by a contribution from Senator Gibson, if he were now present. Were he here, he would be able to tell us of the reduction in the number of awards directly affecting the Tasmanian Hydro Electric Commission&mdash;from several hundreds down to a mere handful today. He would tell us of the multi-award arrangement, the change in job specification and the change in union representation. There has been a huge, drastic change in the climate of the workplace and the confrontationist attitude&mdash;the minister hinted at that&mdash;to one where at least teams were recognised and the benefits that flowed from seeing a common goal between the work force and the employer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That change has brought about a situation in which the provocations, which were essentially brought about by demarcation disputes, have diminished to such an extent that in evidence in Hobart the advocate for the Tasmanian Chamber of Commerce, Mr Abey, was unable to indicate how relevant sections 45D and 45E would be in addressing the sorts of problems that we have now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That change has been responsible for different needs to be addressed on the industrial relations scene. And here we have the Industrial Relations Reform Bill. In this debate there have been suggestions by some speakers that past behaviour was bad&mdash;I have often agreed with them&mdash;and I have responded by saying that that is the very reason why we need to change and indeed why this bill is before us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I need to address a matter that was alluded to earlier in the discussion by Senator Crane. I refer to the application of sections 45D and 45E to matters other than industrial. In this area the Democrats have to disagree. We stand without equivocation on our assertion that it is not at all appropriate to use provisions which, to all intents and purposes, were intended to deal with industrial matters, albeit in the Trade Practices Act, later as a means of effectively preventing community protest at environmental inroads or concerns that are other than industrial. We contend and strongly believe that those who engage in legitimate community protest over environmental matters should not be subjected to provisions which were originally intended to govern industrial relations processes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If it is thought to be appropriate by any government to regulate the opportunity of citizens to protest about any matter, it should be up-front and come in here and describe what rights and privileges of the community it wishes to regulate. It should regulate them up-front in a manner that is honest about those protest rights which that government wishes to diminish. On the basis of that, we could see the sorts of measures that were brought in in Queensland where it was made very difficult for a family of four to stand together on the street. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7U4">Senator BELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Those provisions were ridiculed, and I have stretched the argument to prove the point. My point is that if any government wishes to bring in measures to regulate protest by its citizens on any matter whatsoever, let that government come in here and admit that that is what it is doing. Let it not persist with hiding behind measures of the Trade Practices Act which are then extended to deny citizens the opportunity to protest on environmental or other matters which they are concerned with. We will insist on that. I think we have made it very clear that we believe that there should be regulation of the sorts of actions that are taken in industrial matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I return to one other aspect about which people have become a little confused. I refer to the question of 72 hours. That number has been repeated quite often in this discussion. It is unfortunate that it is used in a couple of different places, in that 72 hours written notice of the intention to take action has to be given. Unfortunately, it has been interpreted right from the beginning&mdash;the very first time it was mentioned&mdash;that 72 hours would be a period of time which would apply as the time during which so-called protected industrial action could be taken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats were concerned that there would be a 72 hour free-for-all. I believe we have now ensured that it is expressed in the bill as being a maximum period of time and that any number of conditions can apply to bring an end to that period of protection. The commission has the capacity to determine, for example, that perishable goods are being threatened&mdash;</PARA>

Because of that fact and because the Democrats took a constructive attitude and sought to achieve these changes in negotiations, we now have before us not 72 hours as the required time, but rather 72 hours as a period of time after which there could not possibly be any further action, and that the certificate of access to the industrial court would be granted. It was a maximum period rather than the required period.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to look at the coalition's position; it cannot have it all its own way. When representatives of small business have represented opinions at the public inquiries&mdash;and we know the names of the organisations that purport to represent small business&mdash;some have taken the trouble to consult with their membership, and some have actually expressed opinions on behalf of small businesses. But when I contacted the actual individual businesses&mdash;and large businesses, I might say&mdash;of this several hundred which have contacted me I was unable to find any which had communicated with their representative industry groups. Not one. Even their political representatives had not taken the trouble to inform these individuals that there had been a public inquiry started over a year ago, and another public inquiry started a couple of months ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last night Senator Woodley gave the committee one example of a direct expression of the inadequacy of representation by the local political representative. At that time a great fuss was made by the coalition as if it was a slur on that local representative. What is wrong with that? As Democrats we have to come in here every day and suffer the groundless assertions that the coalition makes about our particular capacity to represent small business. I actually quite enjoy hearing members of the coalition making fools of themselves in that way because they are simply saying that there has not been enough time to represent things. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Bell said things were different today. This is a classic example. The coal mining industry went on strike because it did not like the price that BHP got for its coal in Turkey. Companies which were not involved&mdash;CRA was one and I have forgotten the other one&mdash;took out an injunction against the union. Instead of it being a five-day strike it came back to a three-day strike because of the deterrent contained in sections 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I am making is that what Senator Bell said was quite wrong. This example is an up-to-date version of the sorts of things that have happened. As Senator Bell would know, the whole purpose of section 45D was to prevent boycotts occurring by people who are not involved with the company concerned. It was simply to make life difficult for the company, to cost it money and markets, and to cost us reliability. This is yet another example of the Democrats selling out the small business community. Senator Bell knows it. He is trying to make lame excuses and, in fact, quite nonsensical arguments as to why sections 45D and 45E should be removed from the Trade Practices Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not surprising because only the other day, in response to Senator Kemp, Senator Bell disowned the founder of his own party, former Senator Chipp. He almost referred to him as some old fogy of years gone by, when it was former Senator Chipp who came in here allegedly to represent small business and keep everybody honest. It is a matter of being honest on this side. As I mentioned earlier, the Labor Party has not pretended otherwise&mdash;it knows what it is doing and Senator Bell is aiding and abetting it. </PARA>

Proposed section 163F says that if all you have done is infringe proposed section 162, then that is not criminal.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a very serious debate which relates to an issue which goes to the protection of people in small business, the protection of their capital and indeed the protection of their future. We are quite entitled to press the Australian Democrats on this issue. We are entitled to press the Senator Bells of this world and his colleague Senator Kernot on just why they are taking this action. I was very interested in what Senator Chapman had to say. We are going through each of these clauses in detail, and that is appropriate, but the reality is that these arrangements were  working perfectly well. There was no need for legislation. These arrangements had been tried over a very long period of time and were working extremely well.</PARA></TALK.START>

Why do we have to go through this incredible bureaucratic detail which will have the ultimate effect of paralysing small business, making small business vulnerable to the ravages of the Wally Currans and the John Halfpennys of this world? The answer is that we have to go through this process because Senator Bell and his colleagues have succumbed to the ACTU. I have to tell Senator Sherry&mdash;and I say this without breaking any confidences&mdash;that his party was basically happy with sections 45D and 45E as they were.

So let's just drop the issue'. Sections 45D and 45E are there to stay because the Australian Democrats will always support the coalition on sections 45D and 45E.

Let's speak to the Australian Democrats'. The ACTU has conducted a three-year campaign trying to convince Senator Bell and his colleagues on this issue. In the privacy of their own rooms, Labor senators would support this. The ACTU knew that the last thing the government wanted was a rogue union movement. Bill Kelty is not stupid; he might be quite contrary to the national interests of this country, but the guy is not stupid. He focused on Senator Bell, and these guys in the Democrats have bought it. The tragedy is that these guys have bought something which the government itself did not want to change, and which we did not want to change. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition will be opposing these clauses. We do not believe that it is necessary to set up a separate court to handle industrial matters. The industrial division of the Federal Court has, with great independence and clarity, handled industrial matters now for a number of years. In fact, the history of the industrial division of the Federal Court goes back to 1978 or thereabouts when Lionel Bowen, on the Labor Party side, made some very interesting comments in the parliament in support of it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was reinforced once again by Minister Ralph Willis in 1988, just 10 years later. He articulated why the government at that time was not proceeding with an industrial court. The evidence given by the Law Council to the Senate standing committee that dealt with this act made it quite clear that, with a couple of small amendments, the industrial court was, in its view, the best jurisdiction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two principal reasons that I want to put on the record as to why the Law Council thought it was the best jurisdiction. The first relates to the independence of that court and the fact that it is at arm's length from the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. Secondly, it did not believe it was good for the law making process in this country to have a situation whereby there are specialist courts. We have already canvassed that subject tonight so I will not go over it again. The other point that it raised which is most valid&mdash;I would like the minister at the table to address this because it appears that the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) was either not willing or not capable of doing so&mdash;is the issue of the cost of setting up a totally new court, how many people will be involved in it, and what will be the independence of the people who are appointed to the industrial court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In speaking to this amendment and expressing our strong objection to it and saying that after the next election we will not be continuing with an industrial court, I would like an answer to those questions.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Clauses 55 to 67 deal with the establishment of the industrial relations court of Australia. As Senator Crane has indicated, the opposition is vehemently opposed to this initiative of the government's as contained in the legislation. Our opposition is based not simply on our own view of this issue but on the evidence that was presented to the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training, which inquired into this bill a couple of weeks ago. The evidence presented to that committee clearly indicated that there were dangers in the establishment of this court and that the new court was unnecessary. The Law Council of Australia provided evidence to that committee and it has also provided subsequent correspondence in which it makes very clear its opposition to the establishment of this court. There is no demonstrated need for the establishment of a specialist industrial court. That view has been put very clearly by the Law Council and others.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The jurisdiction of the proposed court can be quite readily exercised by the existing industrial division of the Federal Court of Australia. For that reason alone, the court ought not be established. The new court will unnecessarily incur additional expenditure of taxpayers' money to operate, both in terms of the costs of setting up the court and its continuing operation, including its location, administration and staffing. We have heard no justification whatsoever from the minister for the establishment of this court, which effectively duplicates the existing industrial division of the Federal Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also the question of who will constitute the new court. Under these proposals, a judge of the court may also be a judge of the Federal Court. Again, it raises the question: why cannot these same judges simply continue to perform the role that they perform as Federal Court judges within that industrial division of the Federal Court?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Crane has already raised the issue of the perceived lack of independence of this court. Perhaps that is the most damning charge that can be made against this proposal. At the moment the industrial division of the Federal Court, being part of that Federal Court structure, has absolutely guaranteed independence, as our courts and our judges ought to have. Once this court is moved under the Industrial Relations Act and becomes part of the industrial relations specialised jurisdiction, there is always the question about its degree of independence and its degree of impartiality as compared with the existing Federal Court structure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This issue raises the question of courts being linked to programs and policies of particular governments, rather than being part of the mainstream system of justice&mdash;the mainstream court system. It simply serves to underline the ease with which they may be abolished by a government of a different persuasion in the future. Senator Crane has made the opposition's attitude to this matter very clear. When we come to government, as we surely will after the next election, given the recent results of state elections around Australia&mdash;particularly in my own state of South Australia last Saturday&mdash;we will abolish this unnecessary structure. Although we will abolish it because we are opposed to its being established and believe it is unnecessary, the very capacity that a future government has to abolish this industrial court simply highlights its vulnerability&mdash;a vulnerability that does not exist under the mainstream court structure of the High Court and the Federal Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no justifiable reason for the establishment of the industrial court. That is why we oppose it and seek, by amending this bill, to remove these clauses that will establish that court.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also wish to raise my voice of concern about this proposal to establish a specialist court in the industrial relations field. I would like Senator McMullan to indicate to us the need for the establishment of this new court. Is there some suggestion that the industrial division of the Federal Court has not performed its duties properly? Is there any complaint about that division of the Federal Court? Why is it necessary to establish a completely new court system when, from all sides, it would seem that the current industrial division of the Federal Court has performed its duties well and has been judged to be fairly concerned about the issues brought before it? Is there something particular which the industrial division of the Federal Court cannot do that this new court can do?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like my colleagues Senator Crane and Senator Chapman, I ask the minister to give some indication of the costs of establishing this new court and to indicate from where the judges of this new industrial court will be drawn. I understand that a judge of the new court may be a judge of the Federal Court. If that is to be the case, it could well be asked: why cannot those same judges who currently sit on the industrial division continue to play that role as part of the Federal Court rather than being appointed to the new industrial court?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its submission to the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training and in correspondence to many honourable senators, the Law Council of Australia has indicated its opposition to this proposal. It is an opposition that is not predicated on any political motive. In fact, the Law Council specifically, and by its constitution, never becomes involved in party political matters. It has an interest in the proper and fair distribution and treatment of the law. It is for that reason that the Law Council has become very seriously concerned at the proposals in this legislation, a concern which I share and which all of those on our side share as well. </PARA>

Like Senator Ian Macdonald, I fail to see where the government has outlined any reason for the establishment of such a court.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9X5">Senator ELLISON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I read the dissenting report with interest and cogent reasons were offered in it as to why this court should not be established. For a start, there are 164 million reasons. As mentioned by Senator Ian Macdonald, $164 million has been provided in the budget for the Federal Court from the taxpayer of this country. I ask the Minister: where will this new court advance the rights of workers? Where has the Federal Court fallen down in its exercise of the industrial division? Where will this court advance the interests of Australian taxpayers, the Australian citizens? Where is the reason for the establishment of this court? To date, the government has not offered any reason at all. It has not answered any of these questions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I would like to know from the minister is how will this court do things differently? Obviously it must do, otherwise why set up a new court? Where is the reason for having a new court because of this new legislation? Since 1976 the Federal Court has accomplished itself admirably in the industrial jurisdiction, and I have never heard any complaint about it. Not once. Where has the government previously said that the Federal Court was not doing its job?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can only assume that the government must have ulterior reasons for setting up this court. The establishment of a specialist court&mdash;a specialist judicial body of this nature&mdash;makes it more vulnerable to government interference. It makes it vulnerable to becoming an arm of policy and not the judiciary. That is one of the very reasons why the Law Council of Australia has opposed this very measure. I ask the minister concerned: has he had any regard to the submissions of the Law Council of Australia? Does he disagree with what the council says? If he does, why?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Ian Macdonald says, it is not often that the Law Council of Australia comes out and makes such a bold statement. One can only assume that Mr Mansfield QC, the president of that august body, has seen the prospect of a major intrusion into the rights of citizens of this country. I therefore ask the Democrats, because they always take human rights so seriously, to hearken to the fact that this could be a body which could be vulnerable to government control. Who knows&mdash;maybe not this government; perhaps other governments of different persuasions. We know not which. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole idea of the judiciary as we know it in this country is to insulate it from both the executive and the legislative arms of government. That is the essential core&mdash;the essential foundation&mdash;of this country. I do not think it has been said that the Federal Court has been influenced to date. Perhaps that could be the reason why the government wants to set up a specialist judicial body. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For those reasons, I fail to see any merit whatsoever in the establishment of this court. On the basis of cost to the taxpayer, there are the 164 million reasons that I mentioned. There are also other reasons including the dark prospect of a judicial body becoming an arm of policy and vulnerable to government interference; and the prospect that even the rights of workers and the rights of Australian citizens might be intruded upon by virtue of setting up a small specialist judicial body which is easier to control. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That was a nice little political speech for Senator McMullan's union mates but it did not really tell us anything. My colleagues and I pointed out that no justification for this new court has been given in either the second reading speech or the explanatory memorandum.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator McMullan said that it has happened before. I assume he is saying that, therefore, it must be right this time. He said it has happened in Western Australia, New South Wales, South Australia and Queensland. I assume his argument is that, therefore, it is right here. He says the new court will have wider jurisdiction. Why not imbue the industrial division of the current court with wider jurisdiction, if that were a problem, although I would not have thought it was. That is easy to fix under a current set-up without having to go through the red tape and cost of forming a new court. </PARA>

But neither he nor the minister's second reading speech have given any indication of what role those judicial registrars will play and where that role cannot be performed by the current industrial division of the Federal Court. He said the new court would deal with constitutional matters. Perhaps Senator McMullan does not know, but the High Court already deals with constitutional matters and so does the Federal Court and, in certain circumstances, so do state supreme courts. So that does not seem to be an argument. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator McMullan said that this new court could deal with harsh and unconscionable contracts. In case Senator McMullan does not know, the Federal Court and, in fact, all the courts of the land, currently deal with harsh and unconscionable contracts in the general contract law; and the current industrial division of the Federal Court would have no difficulty in dealing with that because the Federal Court currently deals with those sorts of matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator McMullan dismisses all our arguments by saying, `We think it will be better'. Simply saying the words, `We think it will be better' is supposed to convince us&mdash;and, I assume, the Democrats&mdash;that this is the right way to go. He gave us no argument, no explanation at all, as to why it is needed, why the current industrial division of the Federal Court cannot do it, and why the Australian taxpayer has to be put to this expense of setting up another court to do exactly the same things that the current industrial division can do. </PARA>

Perhaps now or at some other time, the minister might be able to provide me with information as to exactly on how many occasions this has occurred. Frankly, I do not believe it has occurred; it may have, but I do not believe it has. It might be even more appropriate for the new court to exercise that power because, as the minister has said, there is a whole range of new matters and functions which the new specialised court will be required to consider. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I am not getting any sense or any cogent arguments from the minister, perhaps Senator Harradine could help the minister by explaining to me why the skilled persons that he talks about could not be appointed. I think that was his main point on why this new court should be set up. Senator Harradine is saying that skilled persons can be appointed to it. Why cannot skilled persons be appointed to the industrial division of the Federal Court? Is Senator Harradine suggesting that the current people in the industrial division of the Federal Court are not skilled persons?  If that is the case, I think he would be one of the few people in Australia who does suggest that. The industrial division of the Federal Court is well regarded and it is composed of skilled persons. But the government can appoint skilled persons to the industrial division of the Federal Court as it can appoint skilled persons to the new labour court. </PARA>

It is the only argument that has been given. At least he has given one argument; Senator McMullan has given us no argument, and I am still waiting to hear why the Democrats support it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to expand on the remarks of my colleague, Senator Ian Macdonald. There is nothing that one could not do by amending the relevant legislation governing the Federal Court, or in fact its rules, that one could do in the establishment of this new court. What Senator Macdonald says is quite right: if we need specialised officers, if we need registrars with a certain skill or background, we could simply amend the legislation and the pertinent rules.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been put to me that this new court could provide greater access. I fail to see why, but if there is something wrong with the Federal Court in that it does not offer enough access, perhaps we could simplify that part of the Federal Court rules dealing with the forms and filing of papers at the court to make it much easier for people to file things in person, to conduct their own matters. That could all be very easily done without the millions of dollars of expense that a new court is going to cost the Australian taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With 15 years legal experience, I have seen that we can simplify and make courts perform a lot better by simply amending the rules under which they operate and the legislation which governs them. That is the way to go. We do not have to set up an entirely new court system with an entirely new set of forms, bureaucracy and judicial officers. We would have to find such a court a new building and new staff to work at the counters&mdash;and that all costs a lot of money. At the moment we have that set up very well in the industrial division of the Federal Court of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The so-called reasons that have been put to me thus far have not convinced me in any way. In fact, they have merely made me think that perhaps we could streamline or amend the existing system in some way and accommodate those concerns, but without the extra cost. I could also say to the chamber that there is no doubt that by making these amendments we would have a much better system because we already have one in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It always takes time for most new institutions to thrash out problems. So for the first year or so the consumers&mdash;if we could call them that, and this is particularly so with courts&mdash;run into the problems while the new court sorts itself out. I refer to the Family Court in 1975 and the problems it has had. Look at how many amendments there have been to the Family Law Act and to the rules of that court. All of that has come about with the benefit of experience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not against any changes for the better but if there has been some experience which has shown that we should amend the rules of the industrial division of the Federal Court, then so be it. But so far nothing has come close to convincing me that a new court should be set up. In fact, the problem with this country is that there are too many judicial bodies being set up, so much so that I would say that we are running into jurisdictional problems. We have administrative appeals tribunals, equality of opportunity tribunals, small debt courts, local courts, district courts, supreme courts, the Federal Court, the High Court, the Family Court&mdash;the list goes on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It all sounds very nice; it sounds fantastic when one puts it in terms of human rights but, at the end of the day, the people concerned have to live with that system. They have to find out which courts they have to go to. They try to avoid the cost of engaging the services of a solicitor by going to a body, only to be told, `I'm sorry; we can only go that far because that is the end of our jurisdiction. You have to go down the hall to another body and apply there'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what happens in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. People think they can lodge a complaint but then they are told, `No, we do not have jurisdiction. You have to go somewhere else. You have to go via the Social Security Appeals Tribunal'. So, at the end of day, the government is thoroughly confusing the average citizen; it is making it harder. In fact, what it is doing is making a bonanza for the lawyers. The more courts and institutions we have to confuse people, the better it is for lawyers because, at the end of the day, the individual will have to go to a lawyer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Believe you me, I am telling honourable senators that from 15 years experience. There were not as many courts and bodies 15 years ago. It was not as complicated, confusing and convoluted as it is today. So all these things start out with the greatest of intentions but they never end up serving the purpose for which they set out to achieve in the first instance. Unless someone else can come up with a better reason, it has me tossed as to why the government should set up a new court when simple amendments could easily do the job. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the registrars, as outlined at proposed section 381. The registrars of the proposed court will be required to have the same qualifications. They have to have been a judge of a prescribed court or enrolled for at least five years as a legal practitioner. Senator Bell says that their remuneration and allowances&mdash;I think this is what he hangs his hat on&mdash;will be less. But, according to proposed section 383(1):</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer Senator Bell and Senator Harradine to proposed section 401, which deals with the personnel of the court, apart from the judges and the registrar. Quite clearly, it states:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is the simplest of all matters. As I would have thought Senator Crane would know, many employers get their respondency to an award by virtue of their membership of a relevant organisation. If they resign from the organisation, their workers are in danger of losing the protection of the award unless the employee organisation concerned gets the opportunity to protect its members' interests under the award. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Happenstance should not affect people's industrial relations situation. If there is some matter of substance that means that the award should be varied or that people's conditions should be varied, that is a legitimate matter for the normal industrial processes to take care of. But the mere matter of an individual resigning from an employer organisation should not affect the respondency and award rights of those who work for that person.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is funny that after all the slings and arrows those who perpetrate them are not here to hear this. I agree with everything that Senator Crane has said and fully support the amendment. We recognise, as the coalition does, that this process is taking place without sufficient consultation and without considering the role that is performed by the existing members of the National Labour Consultative Council. A review by the Department of Industrial Relations was conducted of the membership of the National Labour Consultative Council on 17 September 1992. Page 10 of that review states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the ILO Constitution, the CAI&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>which has become the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and the ACTU, as the most representative organisations of employers and workers, have a particular standing in the Australian context and broadening the membership of the IAC&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is another argument&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">could be construed as interfering in their rights.</PARA>
<PARA>I suggest that that assessment would apply equally to the National Labour Consultative Council. I could read other excerpts from this review to demonstrate that the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry has well represented not just employer groups but also commerce and industry in general. It has acted as the spokesperson on behalf of commerce and industry particularly well. Perhaps it has fulfilled that role too well and perhaps that has motivated this; I do not know.

If one were setting up a new body today, as we are doing in this legislation, one would not say, `We'll have six from the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, none from the Chamber of Manufactures and one from the MTIA'.

We do not believe that it will achieve the objectives that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) set out to achieve on 21 August 1993.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What a load of rubbish. We are not dealing with master and servant now. I cannot believe this. I will make a few concluding remarks. Senator Burns wants to carry on all night. This legislation is about giving privilege to a select group in the community. Australia will pay an enormous price for that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to put it clearly on the record that the opposition is not opposed to unions but it is opposed to unions or anybody else in the community being given privilege over other groups. This legislation is about the survival of the trade union movement. Today 70 per cent of the work force&mdash;and that figure is growing&mdash;choose not to join a union. This bill will not enhance flexibility in the work place. In fact it is so bad that it will drive people away. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The one thing that was noticeable in all the questioning of honourable senators tonight is that when I put the proposal to Senator McMullan whether it will be possible again to put boycotts against live sheep without fair protection under boycott law, the answer was yes in some circumstances. We know that that will be widespread. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I express the opposition's deepest regret at the capitulation of the new Democrats, led by Senator Kernot, to the ACTU. They have now, by voting for this legislation, abandoned the small and large business sector in this country. They have also abandoned those 70 per cent of workers who choose not to be members of a union. </PARA>

But the bill will have the opposite effect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of the stringent conditions relating to enterprise agreements and because of the compulsory involvement of trade unions in the decision making process in respect of enterprise agreements, there will be very few enterprise agreements at all, which will be to the disadvantage of the small business community. In discussions I have had with the small business community, it has made it very clear to me that the net effect will be a disincentive for people to be put on the payroll as permanent staff and an incentive for more casual employment. That is a very negative effect. It is the last thing in the world that our country needs when we already have something like 1.5 or 1.6 million real unemployed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Although the Native Title Bill 1993 is in an unsatisfactory state, I am at least pleased to have the opportunity to explain the coalition's opposition and to further detail the coalition's policy in relation to this very complex matter&mdash;a policy which sets down a better approach. This is a complex, emotive and potentially divisory issue which has been appallingly handled by this Prime Minister (Mr Keating). If ever there was an issue which required a carefully thought through cooperative response, this was it. But, of course, that is language that the Prime Minister does not even understand.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an issue which tests our federal constitutional structure, which tests the communities' confidence in the rule of law and which potentially threatens the pace of economic development in rural and remote Australia. It is an issue that goes to the heart of Aboriginal development and the confidence of Aborigines in their society and their place within the wider Australian community. It is an issue that called for real national leadership, a cooperative federal response and a genuine effort to build community confidence in the decisions reached. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have none of that. We now have the states opposed to this legislation, the mining industry opposed to it, the Aboriginal community divided, pastoralists worried and the wider community confused. We have one of the most important pieces of federal legislation in our history based, as I said, on no more than what the government claims to be a fragile consensus. If ever a piece of legislation needed the sound foundation of community support, this is it. But an arrogant and inept Prime Minister, putting his own enormous ego above the national interest, is hell-bent on ramming this bill through on the eve of Christmas. It is a disgrace. The inevitable division and disunity which will flow from this ill conceived and poorly executed piece of legislation will be Mr Keating's legacy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We accept the existence of native title as declared by the High Court and the right of indigenous people to protection of that right of title. Having said that, sudden and dramatic turnarounds in the law do raise elements of uncertainty which many Australians find disconcerting. I remind the Senate of the established position as stated by Blackburn J. in Milirrpum v. Nabalco and the Commonwealth, which was decided in 1970, when His Honour said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a doctrine of communal native title to land does not form, and never has formed, part of the law of any part of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>The accepted position in law was that the Crown took possession of a land which was regarded as `terra nullius'&mdash;a `land belonging to no-one'. It was an application of what was seen as the right to occupy uninhabited land. If one applied the uninhabited test strictly, then it clearly did not apply to Australia. But the terra nullius doctrine was extended to cover the acquisition of any territory inhabited by peoples whose civilisation was thought to be less developed in terms of ownership of property and political organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where the settlers found societies which they regarded as better developed by their definition, they accepted that there was an existing form of native title. Canada, USA, New Zealand, New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, India and Africa are all examples of that. So it was a legal doctrine which flowed from the then contemporary assessment of the society they found. There is no doubt that over the years anthropologists, politicians and lawyers have become increasingly uncomfortable with that original assessment upon which the law of title was based&mdash;particularly as our knowledge of Aboriginal society and culture and, in particular, the relationship of Aboriginal people to the land has grown. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the chamber of the resolution of the Senate which was passed on 20 February 1975 in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate accepts the fact that the indigenous peoples of Australia, now known as Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders, were in possession of this entire nation prior to the 1788 First Fleet landing at Botany Bay, urges the Australian government to admit prior ownership by the said indigenous people, and introduce legislation to compensate the people now known as Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders for dispossession of their land.</PARA>
<PARA>So the attitude of the Senate was changing by 1975. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also remind the chamber of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs report, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Two hundred years later . . . </EMPHASIS>, put down in this parliament in 1983, a decade ago&mdash;and I was pleased to be a member of that inquiry. On page 7 of that report, the committee stated that there is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . growing appreciation of evidence that there were in existence at the time of white settlement Aboriginal people with complex systems of social, cultural and religious networks and of land tenure.</PARA>
<PARA>On page 39, the committee further stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is apparent that the Aboriginal relationship with land is complex, and attempts to define it have perplexed anthropologists. There is no doubt that at the time of the establishment of English law in Australia this Aboriginal relationship with the land was both underestimated and misunderstood, perhaps because it was beyond the comprehension of recognised English legal principles of land tenure.</PARA>
<PARA>So a decade ago this Senate was recognising that there was a much more complex and&mdash;perhaps this is an unfortunate word&mdash;sophisticated relationship between Aborigines and the land in this country than was first understood at the time of white settlement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, we see evidence within the international courts addressing the same issue of terra nullius. I remind honourable senators of the Western Sahara case, again decided in 1975. The judgment stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The nomadic peoples of the Shinguitti country should . . . be considered as having in the relevant period possessed rights, including some rights relating to the land through which they migrated.</PARA>
<PARA>One of their honours specifically stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I consider that the independent tribes travelling over the territory, or stopping in certain places, exercised a de facto authority which was sufficiently recognised for there to have been no terra nullius.</PARA>
<PARA>So the international courts dealing with the common law concept of terra nullius were also changing their attitude as they understood more of the nature of the relationship between land and what they referred to as nomadic tribes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, in some way, although it is contrary to well established law in this country, perhaps it should not have come as a total surprise to see the multi-faceted arguments adopted by their honours in Mabo No. 2. I specifically refer to the leading judgment of Brennan J. First, what he said is that, with our expanded knowledge, we have now come to realise that that basis upon which the terra nullius principle was applied within Australia does not accord `with our present knowledge and appreciation of the facts'. So basically our understanding of the relationship between Aborigines and the land has changed, and therefore the application of those facts to the law can bring a different result. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, looking at the development through the international courts, I think it can be fairly said that Brennan J. also indicated that it was time for precedent to change. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . if the international law notion that inhabited land may be classified as terra nullius no longer commands general support, the doctrines of the common law . . . can hardly be retained.</PARA>
<PARA>In an application to apply contemporary values to the common law, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . judged by any civilised standard, such a law . . .</PARA>
<PARA>that is, terra nullius as applied in these circumstances&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . is unjust and its claim to be part of the common law to be applied in contemporary Australia must be questioned.</PARA>
<PARA>So the High Court found that native title rights existed and survived through settlement, though subject to the sovereignty of the Crown&mdash;and that is a position which we on this side of the chamber accept and respect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whether any particular Aborigines still hold that native title will depend on whether they have maintained their connection with the land and to the extent that title has not been extinguished by acts of colonial, state, territory or Commonwealth governments; and their title will be defined in accordance with the traditional laws and customs of indigenous people. Obviously, therefore, such a judgment with so many ambiguities must introduce considerable uncertainty. It clearly leaves many issues unresolved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, laws have been passed in this country&mdash;and perhaps one could reflect on the Northern Territory land rights laws or, in my own state, the laws in relation to the Pitjantjatjara lands&mdash;on the basis of the then accepted understanding that native title did not exist. So it is not surprising that there was a considerable community reaction against the decision. But this government would simply label those who are concerned as racists and dismiss their concerns out of hand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has also failed to appreciate how a mishandling of this matter would detrimentally affect what we are now calling the reconciliation process. Reconciliation which we support is, in terms of our Mabo policy statement&mdash;which some on the other side should read&mdash;an effort to build a just and lasting understanding amongst the peoples of Australia on the basis that we share a common destiny as citizens of an undivided Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was also the bottom line of the Makarrata inquiry of the Senate committee to which I referred a moment ago and which we put down 10 years ago in this chamber. Clearly, building a just and lasting understanding, as we found in taking of evidence in that inquiry, involves issues of land; it cannot be developed without resolving the issues of land because of the special or, some might say, spiritual relationship between Aborigines and the land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Mabo case, therefore, can be seen as contributing to overcoming what is regarded by Aborigines as a great injustice&mdash;that we fail to appreciate their relationship with the land and to understand the pain of dispossession. Nevertheless, Mabo, because of the uncertainty it has created, contains the ingredients for a backlash which would set the process of reconciliation back years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Instead of understanding this, this silly Prime Minister, under the guise of extending or furthering reconciliation, decided that this legislation should further extend the concept of native title as found by the High Court and thus increased the uncertainty. But for his determination to include a social justice package, the cooperative response which he could have got with state premiers to manage and administer Mabo, in fact foundered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister should have kept the issues separate; Mabo was complex enough without the Prime Minister adding to it. Mabo required certain legislative action, particularly to validate any past grants of title which might be invalid as a result of the Racial Discrimination Act or at common law; and to manage this new form of title in a way which would remove uncertainty, inhibit economic development and resolve any issues of compensation. But it should have been done in a cooperative way with the states validating title and the Commonwealth taking such action as would be necessary to facilitate that validation&mdash;and any validation again, as we state in our policy statement, must of course be accompanied by payment of just terms of compensation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was no need for the Commonwealth to seek to usurp the traditional and constitutional function of the states in relation to land management. Why complicate the matter even further with a battle for turf? There is no need for the Commonwealth to build a new bureaucracy of tribunals, assessors and registrars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The best solution, which an impatient and power hungry Prime Minister would not accept, was one in which the Commonwealth and states worked together to validate existing titles through complementary legislation, leaving the states with the right to manage land titles in the future, provided that they would recognise the High Court decision and meet the requirements of the Racial Discrimination Act&mdash;our policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this debate others will detail ongoing concerns and uncertainty for the pastoralists which will flow from this legislation; the uncertainty for the mining industry, which will be dealt with in considerable depth by a number of my colleagues; concerns for tourist leases and their validity; forestry leases, which was raised by the latest Senate committee report; and fishing interests&mdash;I would not be surprised if that were raised by my friend Senator Boswell. These are issues not settled by this legislation and in some cases they were created by this legislation&mdash;new confusion, new uncertainty. Others will look at the constitutional doubt that surrounds this piece of legislation, also dealt with in some detail by the dissenting report of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs report put down a few days ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the few minutes I have remaining I want to return to the position of the Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders whose interests might have been thought to have been advanced by Mabo No. 2. Australian governments have struggled to develop policy which would help overcome the disadvantages suffered by our indigenous people. They found it very difficult and, sadly, indigenous Australians are among the most disadvantaged of our community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, health, education and housing services are all part of the correct policy mix. But there are other parts, some of which I think we still do not fully understand. Whilst I certainly do not claim to be an expert, my experience as a parliamentarian was to sit down a decade ago and listen to the communities at Thursday Island, Broome, Mornington Island, Derby, Fitzroy Crossing, Weipa, Cairns, Yirrkala, Alice Springs, Kakimburr, Aurukun, Balgo Hills and elsewhere. It was enlightening and the same issues seem to come through today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What was needed, in addition to health, housing and education, was something to redress what I mentioned a while ago&mdash;the loss of identity or connection with the land. This clearly raises difficult issues and Mabo could have made a small, positive contribution in that direction if it had been well handled. The fact that it was not is one of the tragedies of the management of this particular responsibility by Mr Keating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another just demand was the right of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders to be recognised and respected as original inhabitants of this great land. Related to that is the need for non-indigenous Australia to respect and appreciate Aboriginal and Islander culture as vital, important and enriching Australia as a whole. There is the need for us to cease evaluating Aboriginals and Islanders against our values, particularly values of success and achievement. What came through was that it was more important to encourage confidence and pride in the path each individual might choose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To that background, we now learn, as a result of the work of the Senate committee&mdash;I mentioned its report a moment ago and it is only a few days old&mdash;that many Aborigines are confused as to the effect of Mabo and want a longer period of consultation. Many were concerned as to what they see as the self-appointed negotiating team acting on their behalf without consent. They are concerned that the bill does not give the right to immediate exercise of native title; they are concerned with the fact that the bill is not stated to be subject to the Racial Discrimination Act; and that instead of land being controlled by its traditional owners in accordance with Aboriginal tradition and custom, the land will be controlled by corporations in accordance with corporate rules and by-laws, which is not in accordance with the Mabo decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of these issues could have been explored with much greater care if the government had been prepared for sensible debate in February. It was not, and it therefore stands condemned. It has missed the opportunity to build from the challenge of Mabo a stronger and more united Australia. The Prime Minister must accept personal responsibility for this failure. We will vote against this bill and, if we can gather the numbers, we will force the government back to the process which will build a sound foundation for native title legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a Western Australian senator, I think it is important that I make a contribution to this debate on the Native Title Bill. Western Australia has been very much part of the focus in the debate arising from the Mabo High Court decision. It is the state where the most impact from that decision will be felt; it is the state where legislation that seeks to abolish native title rights has been passed; and, quite clearly, it is also the state that elected the Western Australian Greens, who, in all probability, will hold the balance of power and determine the fate of this bill. A further point is that much of the industry campaign has been directed at Western Australian senators in an effort to influence how they will vote on this bill.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AX5">Senator CHRIS EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Panizza will be proud of the approach that I adopt on this occasion, although he will not agree with anything that I say. I would like to advance three main propositions in support of the bill. Firstly, the Native Title Bill is an appropriate response to the High Court's decision. It recognises and protects native title rights, provides certainty of title for other titleholders and provides mechanisms for resolution of conflicts regarding native title land. Secondly, there exists a real conflict of interests and rights at stake that requires a balanced political solution. And there is not universal community support for the recognition and protection of native title rights, nor for the need for Commonweath legislation. Thirdly, the failure to pass legislation this year will favour those who seek to diminish Aboriginal rights, will act to disadvantage Aboriginal people and will represent a lost opportunity for Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In support of my first proposition, I am very proud of the ALP's position in this matter and congratulate the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on his personal involvement in developing the bill and trying to develop community support for it. I think his involvement has been crucial, and it is to his great credit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill seeks to achieve four main purposes: to recognise and protect native title; to validate existing Commonwealth land titles where they may be invalid due to the existence of native title, and to allow states and territories to validate their own titles; to establish procedures for determining claims to native title; and to establish procedures for dealing with native title land. On any fair assessment, the bill is a balanced and fair outcome, given the competing interests that are at stake. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot has been made by the opposition of Aboriginal opposition to the bill. I was on the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs that heard from many witnesses in that regard. But I think one of the things that must be recognised is that the Aboriginals most affected&mdash;those most likely to benefit from native title&mdash;have supported the bill strongly. Some have preferred amendment and are still pursuing amendment, but they accept the basic principles that underline the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also a range of industry interests that recognise that the bill is a balanced and fair outcome, including the tourism industry, the National Farmers Federation and other interests. There is a range of mining and other business interests that think they can now do better out of the deal&mdash;the compromise&mdash;that this bill represents. That is their right, but I think on any fair, independent assessment, the bill is a balanced outcome that seeks to preserve and protect the rights of all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The more independent commentators that gave evidence to the legal and constitutional affairs committee&mdash;people like former Liberal Senator Fred Chaney and former Liberal Senator Peter Durack who, while not giving evidence, wrote a very interesting article on the subject&mdash;support the general thrust of the bill. I think their attitudes and comments ought to be seriously considered by honourable senators. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is a range of opinion, and I accept that. But I think a fair summary was given by one of the witnesses to the legal and constitutional affairs committee, Garth Netthiem, who is a professor of law at the University of New South Wales and chair of the Aboriginal Law Centre. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There have been trade-offs on all sides. But after 205 years of non-recognition of native title, it is only to be expected that its acceptance as part of Australia's legal landscape will cause adjustments which some groups will find uncomfortable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But with goodwill and generosity of spirit, the new regime should be able to operate with minimal disruption to economic activity and with substantial justice for indigenous Australians.</PARA>
<PARA>I endorse those remarks. In relation to my second argument, which goes to the question of the real conflict of interest and rights that exist, I think it is important that we make this point because there has been a suggestion that somehow delay and further consultation will bring a better result than is contained in this bill. I think some of Senator Hill's comments go to that argument. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that is a naive view. Maybe I am being too generous and some people have more sinister motives, but I do not think anyone who has goodwill towards Aboriginal people seriously argues that a better result is possible than what will be achieved in the Senate this week. I do not think anyone suggests that delay or coming back to the issue some time down the track will deliver to Aboriginal people a better result. What we have is a concerted attack from those who believe that Aboriginal rights preserved in this bill can be rolled back and diminished by a further delay in the bill or by further public debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a sad fact, in my view, that the major objective of the bill is not universally supported. That major objective is to recognise and protect native title. A range of Western Australian industry groups have endorsed the Western Australian state legislation and have put out a four-point policy statement that deals with their philosophical position on the question of native title. But there is a very clear and unambiguous divergence between their position and the position the government adopts on key principles. Nowhere in the industry statement is there any reference to native title. Their fourth objective, which is the relevant one, reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To continue developing an alternative policy approach which includes strategies to improve Aboriginal standards of living in areas such as health, housing, education, employment and land ownership.</PARA>
<PARA>There is not one single mention of native title in the objectives in relation to this matter. They do not seek to recognise and protect native title as this legislation does. That is the major point of divergence. There is a clear and unambiguous divergence on whether or not one ought to recognise and protect native title. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen in Western Australia a campaign to abolish native title. It has been supported by some industry groups and is the philosophical underpinning of the Western Australian state legislation, which has been endorsed by those Western Australian industry groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Western Australian act abolishes native title. The Premier, Mr Court, claims that in fact it confers better rights than, or alternative rights to, native title. That is not supported by any independent legal advice that has been proffered in this debate. In fact, the Western Australian Law Society, hardly a socialist organisation or one that necessarily supports this government, has this to say about that act. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On this considered view, it can only be said that the statutory rights of traditional usage created by the Bill are likely to be limited and of limited utility to any Aboriginal group able to assert them. They are rights far removed from the concept of native title declared by the High Court. In Mabo, the Merriam people were held entitled, as against the whole world, to possession, occupation, use and enjoyment of the lands of the Murray Islands.</PARA>
<PARA>The Western Australian Law Society says that the state legislation provides limited rights far removed from the High Court decision. The Liberal Party, in the state most affected by this decision, has adopted a completely different approach from the Commonwealth on this issue. It actually does not seek to recognise native title rights; rather it seeks to abolish them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not a question of a disagreement about interpretation or an argument about process, the sort of thing that the Liberal senators on the legal and constitutional affairs committee made great play of, the sort of thing Senator Hill referred to today. They cannot hide behind process forever. Sooner or later they have to stand up and say whether they support the philosophical position adopted in this bill of protecting native title rights or whether they support the philosophical position adopted in the state legislation to abolish native title rights. I will be very interested to hear from Western Australian Liberal senators as to which position they adopt because they cannot hide behind the sorts of interpretation, process and nice, fine legal arguments that were put by Senator Hill. They have to stand up and say where they stand on the fundamental issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do have a fundamental philosophical difference in this debate. We have seen attempts in Western Australia to reinterpret the High Court decision, to discredit the High Court and to legislate away the rights granted by the High Court decision. There is a real political issue and real political conflict occurring here. To illustrate the point, the Pastoralists and Graziers Association of Western Australia, in a submission to the legal and constitutional affairs committee, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Native Title Bill 1993 seeks to establish native title on mainland Australia, a fact not provided in the High Court's decision on Mabo No. 2 conferring a title proved for a settled agrarian and fishing community on a nomadic people of a completely different race and lifestyle.</PARA>
<PARA>If one has actually read the decision, one will see that that is nonsense, but these are the sorts of views that are being put about in Western Australia. In addition, we have had a range of leading Liberal Party figures seeking to run all sorts of agendas to discredit the High Court decision. A lot of people in the eastern states I think dismiss the President of the Liberal Party of Western Australia, Mr Hassell, as some sort of crackpot from the west, but he is very serious in his challenge to the High Court. </PARA>

I do not have time to go into them, but I think people ought to look at what Mr Minson, the Western Australian Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, said. He blames the high rate of custody of Aboriginals in Western Australian prisons on the Aboriginal Legal Service. They should also look at the comments of Mr Lightfoot, a backbencher of the Western Australian parliament, who called the Aboriginal people `the bottom colour in the civilisation spectrum'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I concede that a member of the leadership in the Western Australian Liberal Party rejected that view and put it on the record, and I am very pleased that he did. The Western Australian Liberal Party submission to the legal and constitutional affairs committee, however, is a good summary of its views. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislation is discriminatory and creates two classes of Australians. Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal. Aboriginal Australians will have exclusive rights to a form of land title unavailable to all other Australians. This is certain to create and foster racial division in Australia. This is especially the case where the form of Native Title, as proposed by the Federal Government, effectively establishes separate Aboriginal State within each State.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the formal submission of the Western Australian Liberal Party to the legal and constitutional affairs committee. Its position is to seek to abolish native title rights and then claim that it is the Europeans in Australia who are discriminated against. It advances this preposterous and twisted argument that we all ought to have one law and that somehow we are creating a separate law for Aboriginals. It fails to recognise the process the High Court undertook in recognising under common law that Aboriginal people had existing rights. I think Senator Hill explained the High Court analysis very well, but the Liberal Party in Western Australia rejects that whole argument and that whole philosophical position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I listened carefully to Senator Hill and I am still not quite sure what the federal Liberal Party's position is. It says that it supports native title, but I do not hear any criticism of the Western Australian legislation. In fact, I hear support or silence. What I want to know is: does the federal Liberal Party support native title or does it support the Western Australian legislation and the Western Australian Liberal Party position? Opposition senators cannot avoid the issue forever. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Hill suggested that we work for consensus with the states&mdash;consensus with a premier who refused to recognise the native title recognised in the High Court decision! Premier Court spent months saying that it should not have happened and that he did not recognise the judgment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had the Liberal Party president actually claiming that the High Court had no right to make such a decision, yet Senator Hill says we should have negotiated a consensus position with these people. We are not on the same planet; I concede that. We have no basis for that sort of consensus and the only way we will get the Western Australian Liberal Party to come to its senses and deal properly with this issue is to negotiate from a position of strength; that is, when this bill is passed. The Western Australian Liberal Party has passed its legislation and until the federal parliament passes this legislation there will be no native title rights in Western Australia and no bargaining power for Aboriginal people in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Hill made a great deal of the `fragile consensus' in support of the bill. Sure, there is a fragile consensus of interests which have conflicting views, rights and attitudes to this bill, and it is hard to hold that consensus together, but the most fragile consensus in this debate is the decision of the federal Liberal party room. Liberal senators and members of the House of Representatives walked out of their party meeting when they finally adopted a position on native title saying, `We've achieved consensus. We've resolved all those conflicts'. It reminded me of Chamberlain returning from Munich, because it meant nothing; it had nothing to say about the hard issues and it does not face up to the real problem. Just like Chamberlain and the Munich Pact, it is not going to take those opposite anywhere. They cannot hold their fragile consensus together, because they are going to have to vote on this bill and explain where they stand on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other argument I want to address is the importance of passing this legislation this year. I think it was adequately dealt with in the legal and constitutional affairs committee report. It will be a lost opportunity for Australian society to make a new start in Aboriginal relations if this bill is not passed. We must, and we can, deal with the legislation and pass it this week. The argument has been put that we must get it right, and I agree, but there are mechanisms for dealing with any errors or unintended consequences. The legal and constitutional affairs committee, of which I am a member, supports the need to review and monitor the legislation. I think that is a sensible step to take. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we really have to ask ourselves whether those who are arguing for delay really are seeking improvement. Do they really think that a consensus is possible or do they have a vested interest in undermining the principles in the bill?  Do they think that their vested interests are best served by delay? I think we have to look at those questions very seriously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that the agreement that has been reached is fragile in the sense that the longer it remains unratified, the more likely it is to be undermined. People who went to the negotiating table and negotiated a settlement will come under increasing pressure from both sides of the argument to renegotiate their positions. The longer it is left unconsummated, the more chance it has of falling apart. The government is genuinely concerned, because it believes that this is our best chance to get a proper and balanced solution. We are pessimistic about the prospects of having another chance to bring those disparate forces in society together if the legislation is not passed this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to ask people who advocate delay or refuse to support the bill this week: what will happen if the legislation is not passed?  What will the other states do in response? Will they go down the Western Australian track or will we find the Commonwealth under pressure to just pass legislation that validates titles for existing titleholders and abandons native title and protection of native title rights for Aboriginal people?  I think that is the reality we are faced with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we also have to ask: if we re-open the debate, who will win? Who will benefit from the extended public relations campaign? In Western Australia we are already seeing a campaign from the Liberal Party, funded by taxpayers, as the state government winds up a campaign in support of its position. We also have a campaign by the mining companies and quite a scurrilous use of surveys by both groups. It reminds me of the 1980s lands rights campaign experience. I think we ought to bear that experience carefully in mind when we debate this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My major point is that there is genuine disagreement about the detail of the bill by those who have goodwill for Aboriginal people. We recognise that those disagreements, however, are on the margins of one side of a fundamental debate as to whether to recognise native title rights granted by the High Court or to extinguish them. Amendments should and must be debated, but we must do that in the context of the debate in Australian society about whether we recognise native title or whether we extinguish those rights. That is the hard political choice. That is where every senator will have to stand up and be counted on this issue. We must bear that in mind as we determine this bill.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It should be pointed out that under Western Australian law, the State's Director of Public Prosecutions has full responsibility for extradition and has established policy guidelines.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 14 of the Director of Public Prosecutions Act states that `It is the function of the Director to take steps to secure the extradition to Western Australia of any person required to answer any charge of an offence or to serve a sentence imposed in Western Australia'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Office of the DPP was created to be independent of the Government of the day and I have not or will not instruct him on such a matter.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whilst there is no bi-lateral extradition treaty with the Maldives, the Maldives is a `London Scheme' country to which the Extradition Act 1988 (Commonwealth) applies.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The state Attorney, Mrs Edwardes, would have to contact the federal Attorney, Mr Lavarch, for him to initiate the extradition proceedings.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Gannon then said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So it's a government to government exercise, at Attorney-General level.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator McKiernan replied:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It would.. a request would have to be made to the Commonwealth. It could be done by the DPP, or the police, but it would be more proper, in this instance, because of the previous links between Mrs Edwardes and Mr Bradshaw, that she do it. I do believe that, you know, her reputation, and the reputation of the state Attorney-General is on the line on this matter.</PARA>
<PARA>I will err on the side of righteousness and assume that Senator McKiernan was appallingly ill-informed of the facts when he made that statement. The truth of the matter is that the statement made by Senator McKiernan had no basis in fact and no basis in truth. As I have just indicated by reading the DPP's press statement and a statement put out by the state Attorney-General, this matter is beyond an Attorney-General's reach of responsibility, and it would be most improper for her to seek to intervene in the affairs and the conduct of the office of the DPP. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator McKiernan has, by a set of words, connected the Western Australian Attorney-General&mdash;the chief law enforcement officer of that state&mdash;with Mr Bradshaw, I hope that he will come in and apologise for his assertion that she has been negligent in her duty, and for the imputation that her reputation is on the line. The fact that she did not interfere enhances her reputation and tarnishes those who would seek to damage her. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said this afternoon when taking note of ministers' answers given during question time, to make an assertion about the integrity of the conduct of the duties of the chief law enforcement officer of any state of Australia or of the Commonwealth is the gravest of allegations. It goes to the very fabric of our society. I noted that, once the assertion had been made, it attracted the mirth and giggles of a senior Labor senator. I wonder whether those opposite, when they stumble into this area, understand the damage that they are doing to the Senate and to the office that they hold by conducting themselves that way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would hope that when Senator McKiernan made the statements he made on the Gerry Gannon show, and another program, that he was not doing so for partisan political purposes.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WH4">Senator McGAURAN</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Victoria)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP> (12.07 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In recent weeks the structure of the Australian stock market came close to undergoing one of the most profound policy changes in its history. The near decision of the Australian Stock Exchange Board of Directors to allow the introduction of differential voting shares&mdash;or super shares as they are known&mdash;would have transformed the investment culture in this country and would have altered the terms on which ordinary shareholders buy shares. It had the potential to change the relationship of power and accountability which operates across the stock market.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of the introduction of super shares onto the Australian Stock Exchange needed to be treated most cautiously. It needed to be pursued in an open and orderly manner so that the Australian shareholders, large and small, could make an informed judgment as to its merits or otherwise. But the manner in which the Australian Stock Exchange pursued the super shares issue should be of great concern to the investment and business community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If nothing else, it caused the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities&mdash;of which I am a member&mdash;to intervene and, by doing so, encouraged the federal Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) to intercede in the issue as well. This dramatic parliamentary intervention occurred simply because, in mid-November this year, it looked as if the Australian Stock Exchange was about to introduce super shares of its own volition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, the Australian Stock Exchange issues paper on differential shares was only widely distributed on November 10. The Australian Stock Exchange issues paper raised some 25 specific issues which needed to be responded to. These had to be lodged by November 29&mdash;only 19 days after it was first released. Further, the Australian Stock Exchange informed the public that it would make a decision on the share plan as early as December.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand the Australian Stock Exchange's concerns over the threat of losing News Group's contribution to the market's profitability. I believe News's contribution to daily turnover is something like 10 per cent, and I understand trading in News shares earns brokers about $60 million a year. I appreciate that the exchange operates in an international market and cannot long survive structural distortions in its own listings which are not apparent in others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite this, however, there were bigger community issues involved about which the ASX needed to be well aware. The decision to rush through the superannuation shares initiative did nothing for the confidence of the ordinary shareholders&mdash;those mums and dads&mdash;who have been courted by the stockbrokers in the last two years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Principally, with the Woolworths and the Commonwealth Bank floats, the share market has won a good deal of renewed favour and interest from small shareholders. The mums and dads have been encouraged to return to the Stock Exchange and to invest their private earnings&mdash;their wages and salaries&mdash;into stocks and issues. They have done this on the basis that the wheeling and dealing which characterised the market in the 1980s has been buried. They have returned because they believe that the Gordon Gekko mentality has been burnt out of the boardrooms and that an Australian family can invest confidently in a new, responsible, sober-minded investment industry which looks to the long term, not to the quick return at their expense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But no sooner does the family investor return to the market than the managers of the stock market are seen to be back to their old tricks. What sparks the public suspicion even more so in these matters is the coincidental timing of the superannuation share development. No sooner does the stock market become a bit bearish and no sooner does its capitalisation increase, investment rates recover and the brokers become a bit flush with funds again, than we get the smell of the deals being done all over again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Stock Exchange's unseemly rush to embrace superannuation share plans shows that the board of the ASX is not sufficiently distant and dispassionate from the market forces operating in brokerage houses and other across-market influences. It seems to me that the ASX board has an ongoing potential conflict of interest between its perceived loyalties to the brokerage houses on the one hand and the investing public on the other. This problem is set to become the source of continuing difficulties in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As long as the Australian Stock Exchange board of directors continues to be simply chosen from amongst the ranks of the brokerage houses we cannot expect it to act effectively as a watchdog of its own conduct. Look at the composition of the ASX board of directors. Its 15 members all come from the narrow stock brokerage and banking areas. Ten are elected members of the ASX and four were appointed directors by the other 10. The other is the managing director of the Stock Exchange. So, at a minimum, 11 of the 15 are straight out of the Stock Exchange itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not see on the current membership list too many ordinary shareholders or dispassionate observers, obviously dedicated by virtue of their backgrounds to oversee the interests of the investment public. They are part of the broker-stock market culture and cannot be rightly expected to carry out an increasingly formal regulatory role. But here they are making judgments which have massive ramifications for the community and for the legion of small, ordinary shareholders. This serves as a warning for the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ASX board, as currently constituted, may not be suitably representative or appropriately far enough removed from the stock market to make the professional judgments that the community and the parliament expect of it. In view of this, it is important that the parliament reassess the structure of the ASX board to ensure that it is effectively pursuing the interests of the investing public and executing its regulatory responsibilities in an arm's length way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regulatory agencies are expected to be aloof from the activity that they are designed to regulate. But, for some reason, the ASX has escaped the issue and the responsibility. I remind the Senate that when similar issues arose in the UK the board of the London Stock Exchange was restructured to widen its representation to provide it with the basis for the effective execution of its regulatory and monitoring functions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I propose the restructuring of the ASX board, either by statute or through its own articles of association, to ensure a wider body of representation of interests and viewpoints. The current ASX articles allow for four appointed representatives from the business community. I believe that this practice needs to be widened. Representation on the ASX board should embrace shareholder representative bodies and associations and other public and private figures with a professional and academic interest or a long experience in company law, the activities of the stock market or consumer affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The appointment of outsiders to the ASX board could be given effect through amendments to the Securities Industry Act 1980&mdash;the principle act under which the ASX was incorporated. This would give statutory effect to the representative remodelling of the ASX board, and it would serve to override any inconsistencies which might arise in the ASX's own articles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Generally, I would envisage that outside appointees to the ASX board would be similar in status and standing to nominee directors in other companies. I also consider it important that there be a mandatory reporting requirement on the part of the ASX to the Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities of all major decisions affecting the operation of the share market and the interests of ordinary shareholders. This will ensure that no key decisions are pushed through the ASX without careful consideration. This reporting requirement could take a legislative form, though I envisage the ASX accommodating a requirement from within its own resources and on a cooperative basis for a trial period at the very least. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make this recommendation in view of the simple fact that neither the joint committee nor the Attorney-General received any prior warning concerning the decision making process that the ASX had embarked upon in respect of super shares. This is a set of circumstances which the investing public and the parliament should not have to tolerate. I cannot see any reason for having any confidence that these circumstances will not re-emerge unless the parliament pushes for change in the ASX board structure. I intend to refer the matter to the Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities, with the aim of establishing an inquiry into the representative nature of the ASX board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having lost the confidence of the public in the 1980s, we surely cannot afford to lose it again in the 1990s. While accusations of interference in stock exchange activities may be levelled and its greater freedoms damaged, I believe greater damage would be done to the competitiveness of the exchange by loss of confidence in the ability of the ASX to monitor exchange activities than any small scale regulatory intervention into the ASX's affairs could ever cause. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be brief because I am breaking my own rule never to speak on the adjournment so as not to incur the reputation that my colleague Senator McGauran enjoys among some honourable senators. It is important for me to respond to the contributions Senator Crichton-Browne made tonight and earlier today following question time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable senator suggested tonight that the question I asked of Senator Bolkus in his capacity as the Minister representing the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) carried some sort of imputation. In response to that, I refer him to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. I suggested that Senator Bolkus be asked a question relating to a matter of public importance in Western Australia&mdash;the extradition of Dr Wayne Bradshaw, who is wanted there on very serious charges and who has been a subject of much media publicity, including a front page story in a local paper published on December 13 about his life in the Maldives. It is a matter of interest and public importance in Western Australia. The question merely sought information on whether there had been any application to extradite Dr Bradshaw from the Maldives, as it has been common knowledge in Western Australia for at least a month that he was living there, as was revealed by the paper earlier this week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I reject the suggestion that there was any imputation in the question. A simple referral to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> will clear up that point. The suggestion that Senator Crichton-Browne made earlier about my question being unsavoury would also be cleared up if he reads the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. In his effort to spray anyone concerned with the imputation, the spray on me was clearly misplaced. I think the minister adequately dealt with the question of an apology in his reply, and that is clearly a question for him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will make one final point. Senator Crichton-Browne is taking a high moral position on the question of criticism and allegations made about Attorneys-General in Western Australia. I have lived through the last three years of attacks on the previous Labor Attorney-General, Mr Joe Berinson, and the slurring and denigration of his reputation, so I find it incredible that a WA Liberal would attempt to take the high moral ground on such an issue. Mrs Edwardes made slurs on the reputation of the then Premier Carmen Lawrence and a range of ministers in relation to the western women's matter. These slurs were totally unfounded and without substance. It is a bit rich to have this high moral ground and mock outrage paraded in this parliament. I will conclude by saying that I think Senator Crichton-Browne `protesteth too much'. </PARA>

To the best of my recollection, I have not at any time used this forum to attack any member of the now government of Western Australia. I do not believe I have ever done that. I have a very strong view about using this place as a coward's castle. I have endeavoured to hold up a standard by not embarking on individual character assassinations in this particular place. That is not to say that I have a 100 per cent clean record. I can remember referring to one of my Western Australian Labor Government ministers at one time. But I am not sure that that is a factor for this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Crichton-Browne in his comments earlier this evening quoted from an interview that I did with Gerry Gannon on an ABC morning program in Perth yesterday. My recollection is that it was at around 20 to nine Perth time or 20 to 12 eastern standard time. I do not have a copy of the transcript, but as far as I can recollect Senator Crichton-Browne has quoted me accurately. He has not quoted the whole of the interview because stronger comments were made in the interview. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not really feel the need to get up and respond to that. I made my comments in the public arena. I have been told&mdash;and I cannot say with 100 per cent accuracy, because I did not hear it myself&mdash;that not only was the state Attorney-General listening to my comments but she immediately followed me on the radio. If she feels peeved about some of the things I had to say about the Wanneroo-gate affair I point out that she had the same forum as I did to address the matter. I have not felt the need or the inclination to utilise the forum of the Commonwealth parliament to raise matters of this kind. I do not feel the need at this point in time to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Evans said, it is a matter of great interest to the people of Western Australia. It has not only been the subject of one front page story yesterday, which Senator Evans quoted from, but it was also a front page story today. Matters associated with the affair have been front page features on a number of occasions in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> and, indeed, lead stories on the television and radio news bulletins. I have not raised those stories in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did not take too kindly to the reference to my wife who, until February this year, was the member for the state seat of Wanneroo. She contested the election for that seat and was defeated. She ran a very clean campaign and her opponent, who is now the member for Wanneroo, congratulated her on the campaign she ran. In this debate, I only make that point to defend an innocent individual. My spouse has not made any public comment on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have certainly never felt the need to stand up in this place or in the city boundaries of Wanneroo to defend my spouse or her political position. She is a very strong individual who is more than capable of defending herself or advancing her own arguments on matters that are of interest to her. She has done that in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My comments this morning on Perth radio were of interest to the electorate that I represent within Western Australia. As Senator Crichton-Browne indicated in the quote from Gerry Gannon, I live within the city of Wanneroo, and I am aware of the scandals that have gone on for a number of years within the council of Wanneroo. Again, a check of the record will indicate that I have never utilised the forums of this parliament to raise those matters, and it has not been my intention to do so; but I do not run away from a brawl either. If that is the way honourable senators want to play it, I am more than happy to muck in with the best of them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 9 November 1993:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With reference to the answer to question on notice no 232 (Senate <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, 1 September 1993, page 841) concerning the integration of the health staffs of the Headquarters of the Australian Defence Force and the Service Offices, and particularly on the issue of not allowing health professionals, other than doctors, to compete for three of the four most senior positions in the new organisations:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Is the practice of not allowing health professionals other than doctors to compete for these positions consistent with the practice in other Commonwealth and State health authorities in filling SES band one and two positions with responsibility for health policy formulation and health service management.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator Robert Ray</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The Chiefs of Staff Committee agreed that all positions not clearly requiring medical, dental or nursing qualifications were to be available to all health service professionals or general list officers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The responsibilities of the Surgeon General and two of his Directors General are predominantly medical in nature necessitating medical qualifications as a prerequisite in addition to broad military and health service experience.  The responsibilities of the third Director General are such that the position is available to both medical and other health professionals. All three Directors General have Service-specific responsibilities and are selected by their respective Service in accordance with Service prerequisites.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) As indicated in my answer to question on notice no 232, this arrangement is entirely in keeping with modern military medical practice. The health services in the Australian Defence Force provide a service not available from the civilian sector: a field service in support of military operations. At the most senior levels of health management, the task is to situate the provision of health services in the military context. This involves the provision of health advice and the development of health policy with an appreciation of the impact that such advice and policy will have on the provision of military health services to meet military operational needs. Considerable military experience is necessary and, as the advice requested and the policies generated are predominantly of a medical nature, the Service medical officer stream is the best placed to provide candidates for these positions. Under the circumstances it is not valid to compare the unique military requirement with the practice in other Commonwealth and State health authorities when filling SES band one and two positions. The incumbents of these positions generally have the responsibility for health policy formulation and health service management only; they do not have any equivalent to the Service responsibility to provide medical advice to a Chief of Staff, to enable him to discharge his command responsibilities.</PARA>
