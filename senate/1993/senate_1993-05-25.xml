In order to conclude this particular section of the report from my point of view, I would like to raise a couple of matters. Firstly, I ask: what steps will Senator Evans now take to put into effect his responses to the concerns I raised last night so that this matter can be speedily resolved and the next time the issue of performance based cash bonuses comes up we will be better able to address the accountability issue?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second issue is also important. Last night, in relation to the SES performance based cash bonuses, Senator Evans said, `There is some way to go before these issues are resolved'. As far as the SES is concerned, the key issues were effectively addressed in the original agreement signed by the Government and the ACTU in December 1992. On page 53 of the document I am holding, which Senator Evans's department was kind enough to give to me, the SES is specifically mentioned together with the cash bonuses to which officers may become entitled. Can Senator Evans comment on the matters that remain to be resolved because I understood that the key matters, the general principles, were resolved last December?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third question is: can Senator Evans confirm the figures set out in the document; that is, the maximum cash bonuses which could be received by SES officers at the top level are in the order of $15,000? If Senator Evans could answer those three questions, I will conclude my comments on this area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As to how I propose to advance further consideration of the issues of principle that were raised yesterday and indeed previously, it is my intention to write to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), who is responsible for the Public Service Commission, identifying the issues and seeking a review of them. A preliminary draft of that letter has already been done. I will get that off in the next day or so and we will have a look at that whole issue before the next round of these things comes into effect. I repeat my acknowledgment of yesterday: there are legitimate issues of principle; there are grounds for debate about this; and I think it is appropriate that further consideration of the kind I indicated be given to it&mdash;and it will be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the question of SES performance pay, the answer is essentially as I gave it yesterday: although the decision in principle has been made to move forward with the extension of this to the SES&mdash;and that is reflected in some of the material that the honourable senator has&mdash;still it remains the case that the specific guidelines for SES level performance pay have yet to be finally resolved by the Public Service Commission. Those guidelines are expected to come down in July. The pool of available money in effect to be distributed for this purpose has yet to be finally determined, and so too have some other matters of internal process involved in these decisions. In particular what has proved a difficult matter already is getting comparability of assessment as between officers based in Canberra and those working in missions abroad. It is that kind of issue that is specifically being addressed at the moment. That is another reason why it was accurate for me to say yesterday that the detail of this has not yet been finally bedded down. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was pleased, as was Senator Kemp, that Senator Evans acknowledged that this secret payment of money to individuals is not acceptable in terms of public accountability. Last evening he made the point that maybe it was okay because it was comparable with practice in the private sector. It is very important to have on the record that there is a huge distinction between practices in the private sector and practices in the public sector. Basically, an investor, a shareholder or whatever in the private sector takes his or her own hard-earned after-tax money and makes a decision about what to do with it. If investors do not like the body they have invested in, or how somebody else is dealing with their our money, they may take it out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the public sector the Taxation Office compulsorily takes the money from the taxpayer via enabling legislation and, of course, the interesting question of rulings. It is then spent in accordance with government policy and administered by the bureaucracy. The individual taxpayer has no right to say, `I don't like your policy; I am going to take my money out'. The taxpayer has no say over it at all. So the waiver system of accountability works. Expenditure by the executive and the bureaucracy is to this Parliament and, through this Parliament, to the tax paying public and the general voting body. That is the way our system works. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, to have secret payments is simply not a proposition, and I was pleased to hear Senator Evans say that he was going to make a submission to the Cabinet to review this scheme. He says that the guidelines will be laid down by the Public Service Commission. Of course there are already some guidelines in existence. The schedule of guidelines for performance based pay states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The performance pay arrangements have been designed to be broadly based with a substantial proportion of staff having access to the performance payments. The amount determined for the lowest eligible rating should be sufficient to provide and maintain the desired motivational and incentive effects, and to provide a tangible reward consistent with the scheme designed.</PARA>
<PARA>When we put those guidelines with the minute signed by Mr Richard Woolcott to Mr Costello&mdash;who I understand is to be the new head of the department&mdash;which says that this is really a bit of a scam to get salary increases, we are even more concerned to have these arrangements fully disclosed so that there is proper accountability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Evans also said, `It's all decided by the Public Service Commission'. Whether or not payments to public servants are to be made and disclosed in the proper way, or whether it is to be a secret pool of money paid secretly to individuals and we never know about it and we never know why they got the money, is a question of policy. That is a matter for government. The Public Service Commission is part of the bureaucracy and it administers the policy, but the decision as to whether or not we are to have secret payments within our system is a matter of government policy. Government must be responsible for that decision and people must know that it is responsible for that decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, I was grateful to hear Senator Evans say that he has already drafted a letter and that it will be going to the Cabinet. Perhaps then we will see a proper system of accountability, not only in his department but right across the Public Service, where the present arrangements are equally inappropriate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will clarify a couple of matters for the record. Firstly, the letter I will be writing will be to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). Whether the Prime Minister chooses to put that to the Cabinet as a whole is a matter for him. I am not able to refer matters directly to the Cabinet. I just want to explain that matter of process lest there be any misunderstanding, but I do acknowledge the point that what is involved here is an issue of policy and not mere administration and, as such, it is for the Government. I have no doubt that it is in that spirit that the Prime Minister will address the issue, taking such advice as he thinks is appropriate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, Senator Bishop began by putting some words in my mouth. I did not acknowledge yesterday that this was unacceptable in terms of Public Service accountability. All I acknowledged, and I do so again, is that an issue of accountability principles is involved here which needs to be weighed and balanced against the competing issue of personal privacy which has been referred to as justifying the particular way in which this matter is dealt with at the moment. It is that particular balance of competing interests that needs to be addressed. I certainly do not want to be taken as having hung my hat on either one of those two horns of that particular dilemma. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, Senator Bishop referred to guidelines being already in existence. Yes, of course they are, but that is only for sub-SES personnel. A question does arise as to whether there needs to be any variation in those Public Service Commission guidelines so far as SES personnel are concerned. That is a matter being addressed at the moment and it will be resolved by July. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Very quickly, I want to deal with my reservation in the report dealing with the Gillespie children matter. I want to deal with a particular piece of information that has come to me subsequent to that&mdash;that is, information from Ms Barbara Karadin. She says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I am a Volunteer Marine Radio Operator and Justice of the peace for New South Wales. I operate what is known as `Bar Point Base, Safe Boating Rescue and Radio Communications Club, Incorporated' from our home. My base radio station is opened on a twenty four hour basis and I am generally available 13-14 hours per day, per week on average.</PARA>
<PARA>She goes on to explain what her call signal is. She then says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I recall the morning of 18 July 1992, when at about 0813 hours my husband told me something and I immediately went to the radio which is situated in our loungeroom.</PARA>
<PARA>She then describes the band she was operating and how she is able to pick up long distance messages as far afield as Vanuatu. She goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have been involved in this activity on an almost full time basis since mid 1984 . . .</PARA>
<PARA>She says that after being called on 18 July she went to the radio and noted the receiving channel was set at a particular frequency, which was the emergency distress band used in Australia. She continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I heard a transmission from a male with a foreign accent, although I had no difficulty with that accent. This male spoke in English and I heard him say words to the effect that he needed some specialised medicine brought out for a heart condition. I queried his position and was informed he was eight degrees, 54 minutes south, 139 degrees, 2 minutes East.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I said: `where is that?'. He said; `Thirty kilometres south of IRIAN JAYA. I said `Where is that?'</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He said `IRIAN JAYA, BOROKA Boat Harbour, south coast of IRIAN JAYA, port of BOROKA, I want the Indonesians to bring the medicine out from MERAUKE'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At about this stage I contacted the Australian Maritime Safety Authority by telephone . . . and spoke to the male who answered . . . He told me something (that he had been getting reports of this distress call for the past four days and that the AMSA had advised Indonesian authorities of the calls).</PARA>
<PARA>Bear in mind that this is all taking place on 18 July. Ms Karadin continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That male requested my assistance to continue the transmissions with the male seeking assistance. My telephone is alongside my radio which I continued to monitor and in fact I placed the telephone receiver alongside the radio speaker for a period so that the AMSA male could hear the call.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The AMSA male requested me to tell the distressed caller that they had despatched a patrol boat out to the location and that the patrol boat would arrive at about 1230 hours Indonesian time, that is, local time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I did so (whilst the AMSA was still on open telephone line), I said: `To the vessel near MERAUKE, do you hear `HAWKESBURY RIVER''. I cannot recall if he acknowledged, but I then said: `Australian patrol boat, 1230 ETA, they are going to rescue the man, they are going to rescue the man'. He then said: `They take us to MERAUKE Embassy'. He then acknowledged that `they' understood and he said words to the effect of: `Will the boat take us to MERAUKE?'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Acting on AMSA instructions I ignored that question and merely repeated: `Patrol boat arriving 1230', or words to that effect. That was the last radio exchange I had with the man in distress, until about 0826 hours when I heard the same caller transmit words to the effect of: `Everything okay now, no engine trouble, cancel help, cancel help'. At that time I had an open telephone line to the man from the AMSA in CANBERRA and was holding the hand set to the radio speaker. The AMSA man indicated to me his displeasure to that response and indicated that an aircraft had overflown the craft that morning and had only seen one person aboard.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After the last transmission from the distressed caller, acting on AMSA instructions, I transmitted to him: `Okay, Bar Point out', and I heard no further transmissions from him. I had identified myself and provided my telephone number to the AMSA man (whose name I never noted at the time) but did not hear from them again.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have a practice of taping all emergency calls on a portable tape recorder which is by the radio. The recorder is a Sharp cassette recorder, and in this instance I commenced taping as soon as I responded to the radio call. That taping continued throughout the exchanges until the tape cassette expired.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have marked that tape `1/6/92 (Indonesia) 2' and signed it with my normal signature. I have handed that tape to . . . for his retention if required. I PRODUCE that TAPE CASSETTE.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the transmissions, I made rough notes on two pieces of notepaper which I have also handed to . . . I have written my signature on each page along with the date and (3) (3-A). A Logsheet that I used was also handed to . . . and I marked it (3-B). I PRODUCE THOSE DOCUMENTS.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The following day, 19 July 1992 at about 0820 hours, I heard a transmission by radio on the same frequency and I recognised the male caller as being the same person who called on 18 July 1992. He said: `May Day, May Day, there are five aboard'. I then said (at the same time I telephoned AMSA at CANBERRA and told them something at the same time putting the ear piece of the telephone to the radio speaker): `This is Bar Point Base, what's the trouble now?'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He said: `I am aground on the other side of MERAUKE, no food, no water, tell INDONESIA'. Before I could acknowledge, the `skip' (that type of abnormal radio transmissions) faded and I heard no more.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At that stage, CANBERRA was still on the line and the male there instructed me that he would `inform INDONESIA'. That was the last I heard of the matter. During that exchange, I made rough notes on a piece of notepaper, which I have handed to . . . and signed and dated and marked 19/7/92 (4). I PRODUCE THAT NOTE.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, all these things occurred while those people were still in Indonesian waters before they had left the jurisdiction of Indonesia. There was ample evidence on the record that they were there and action should have been taken. The Maritime Safety Authority was well and truly in the know. This statement was made to the police. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ms Karadin also informs me that she sent a copy of this to DFAT, the Minister's department, and has never had an acknowledgment. She says in her statement:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 30 July 1992, I heard a news broadcast, as a result of that I contacted official of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority CANBERRA at about 1718 hours and later the Australian Federal Police, CANBERRA . . . told him something about 2130 hours . . . between the distress caller, myself and the other radio station, which I believe to be at MOOLOOLABA, QUEENSLAND.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot assist further, except to explain that the cassette tape was dated . . .</PARA>
<PARA>That was when she had dated that material. Again the matter that concerns me is that there was so much information around on which action could have been taken and was not taken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think I made quite clear at the time of the estimates hearings that there is a responsibility on the Minister for Foreign Affairs to make sure that his first interest is for Australian citizens. As I said at the time, this is simply more information that has come to hand which surely required from the Minister a much better response than merely raising the matter over the dinner break in a particular conference that he was attending in Manila. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Bishop has raised absolutely nothing new. It is perfectly well acknowledged that, around the time that the Gillespies were in fact in the process of transiting Indonesia, there was a whole course of events involving distress calls from a boat, action taken by the maritime safety organisation to follow up and respond to those calls in various ways, including by contacting Indonesian authorities. This further information about this particular radio operator's contribution to that exercise adds a little more information about what was going on during that particular period. But all of this, of course, was without anyone's knowledge that that particular boat did have aboard the Gillespie children or the Prince. It is only with the benefit of hindsight that that connection has been made. Obviously that was who it was on the boat, but nobody at the time knew that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To try to import backwards into this particular circumstance which, on the face of it, must have seemed to the authorities like a routine maritime issue is to invest the whole thing with a degree of significance in the context of the Gillespies which it did not have then to anybody and which it obviously does not have now. I can understand Senator Bishop's scratching around, finding any possible way she can to introduce, hopefully, something new from her point of view into this tale. But it adds absolutely nothing new to our understanding of the general course of events, nor certainly does it add anything to the allegations that have been made about some maladministration so far as the Government was concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole question as to whether or not there should have been better coordination between the Australian Federal Police, the coast guard and so on is one that has been addressed in the Glenn report. It is a matter which, if Senator Bishop wants to pursue it, she should do so with the other relevant Ministers. The maritime safety agency is of course a DOTAC responsibility; the Federal Police is the responsibility of the Attorney-General and the Minister for Justice; and so on. But this has been explained often enough in the past and I do not think Senator Bishop is contributing anything helpful at all to this matter by coming at it again in this way today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the general substance of her reservation on which she concluded again her remarks today about the manner of my raising this with foreign governments being inadequate, I make absolutely no apology whatsoever for the way in which I raised it, the degree of specificity with which I raised it or the sense of urgency with which I raised it. All of that was entirely appropriate to the particular circumstances. The insinuation that she continues to make that these were somehow casual discussions over dinner or something, represents&mdash;if I can put it at its most charitable&mdash;simply an ignorance or a naivety about the way in which multilateral conferences work. This was the ASEAN-PMC meeting. It is a gathering of 13 nations&mdash;12 countries and the EC. It is a very high level meeting involving Ministers and literally hundreds of officials with a very jam-packed agenda. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The way in which these conferences work is that we are in a chamber, around a conference table, from early morning until late in the evening. There are extended breaks for meals of a couple of hours and so on, and it is during those breaks that bilateral discussions, both formal and informal, are held. That is the time when people get together with their counterparts to raise particular issues that may be of urgency or importance. It is absolutely familiar routine, well understood, and a perfectly appropriate way of doing it. My particular exchanges with Mr Alatas, my Indonesian colleague, and Mr Abdullah Badawi, my Malaysian counterpart, were conducted during the dinner adjournment&mdash;not in fact over the dinner table, as I now better recall, thinking about it, but by taking the Minister aside and sitting down at a coffee table somewhere and talking it through for five minutes or so with notes being taken by officials. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That particular way of doing things is just the way we do things. I know it is hard for Senator Bishop to grasp, but that is the way it works. Moreover, unlike the way in which she puts it in her reservation, it was not a matter of just raising it fleetingly and only once; I raised the issue on at least four occasions with Ministers: with Foreign Minister Alatas during the dinner adjournment on 24 July; during a formal programmed bilateral meeting, which happened to be over dinner, with Foreign Minister Abdullah that same evening, and again with both Ministers on 26 July. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Simultaneously, as I made clear in the statement that I put down in the Senate on 10 May, our embassy in Jakarta and our High Commission in Kuala Lumpur are also vigorously pursuing at senior level the concerns that I had raised at ministerial level. There has been an enormous amount of departmental energy devoted to this both at that time and subsequently. I recorded the number of contacts specifically made with the Malaysians in the schedule that I put down in the Senate on 10 May. There were in fact 30 such contacts going to the question of the whereabouts of the children before 26 July and then, when their whereabouts were clear by their appearance in Malaysia on that day, subsequently the rest of those 30 contacts were made on the subject of consular access. There is no government that could have worked more assiduously or more appropriately to raise the matters in issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Might I say finally on this subject that I am a little underwhelmed by the way in which this issue is addressed in the Estimates Committee A report. For a start, I think it is a little unusual in committee reports for the preoccupations of one particular senator, or in this instance the criticisms of one senator, to be recorded as such when they are manifestly not the views of the committee as a whole. But be that as it may, I think it is also a little inappropriate for this to be recorded in a way which really quite inaccurately describes the nature of the exchange and, in particular, my response to it. I refer to paragraph 22 in particular, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister defended his actions, arguing that the demands of diplomacy limited the extent to which he could press the issue with his Malaysian and Indonesians counterparts:</PARA>
<PARA>That clearly implies that there was some extreme delicacy or some sort of caution about the nature of the way in which I pursued this with my colleagues, that I was anxious not to offend. That completely misrepresents the nature of my replies in the estimates committee. It was a straightforward consular matter which I put to my counterparts in a way that made clear the nature of my concern, the Australian Government's concern, with the status situation of particular Australian citizens. There were no ifs, buts or maybes. In my conversation with Minister Badawi I described with some precision what it was that the Australian Government could do in this matter, including by way of seeking extradition if the appropriate criteria were satisfied. All of that was laid out. There was no `diplomacy' in the sense of the caricature use of that expression which is rather the implication that is conveyed here in paragraph 22. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was simply making the point that one does not harangue one's colleagues in this situation in the way that Senator Bishop, in her particular naivety about the way these things are done, seems to think is the appropriate manner of behaviour. Certainly I would not have done that. It is a matter of a polite exchange, but it is also a matter of saying what is necessary to convey the messages that have to be conveyed in the sense of urgency and importance we felt about them. I did all that; I make absolutely no apology. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other problem with this capsule summary of this exchange in the committee A report is that&mdash;as I made extended reference to in the estimates committee&mdash;it makes no reference to the statement that I made in the Senate chamber, with its very detailed tabulation of the contacts that were made on this matter, in particular with the Malaysian Government. With the utmost respect to the committee members, for them to record the exchange in this way is incomplete&mdash;as this is&mdash;and with the clear implication that there was some substance in Senator Bishop's criticisms really is regrettable and does represent some conspicuous inadequacies in the terms of this committee report. It is important that I should have this opportunity to correct the record in that respect. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The record does not require correcting; it is an accurate report. I find the Minister's use of the word `charity' rather curious. Quite clearly, when the Minister was speaking about the nice chat he had over the dinner break with his two colleagues attending the same conference, anyone listening got the clear impression that it was all far too important just to worry about two Aussie kids.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bottom line is that there was an enormous mix-up, lack of communication and lack of coordination in the whole sorry episode: police not talking to Coastwatch; people not being made aware of orders; information coming in from people like Ms Karadin and not being used, and her communication to the Minister's department never being acknowledged; and the Minister saying, `Why don't you go talk to DOTAC and AG's'. We have become quite accustomed to Ministers in this Government not wishing to take ministerial responsibility. This is just another example. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The conclusion one cannot help coming to is that the Minister thought the business of getting these two kids back was just too difficult and he was not about to upset his nice relationships. The Minister carefully said that he raised it with these people over the dinner break on 24 July. It was not raised again until the 26th and yet he was constantly with those people in that conference and the 25th could well have been the crucial date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister's own department contacted the lawyers for the Gillespies and said, `Your children are in Indonesia'. But the lawyers were unable to take any action to prevent those children leaving that jurisdiction for the simple reason that the Minister's department would not give them any more information to physically ascertain where those children were in Indonesia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The very valid point that I made in estimates is that there was an opportunity to get those children back before they left the Indonesian jurisdiction. As I said, there was never any suggestion that it was Indonesian Government policy to cooperate with the people in Merauke. The point was, however, that the Minister's department knew they were in Indonesia. The fact was that the Minister had an opportunity to do something quite strong about it and he failed to do it. Having a chat over the dinner break is not enough. No matter how important the conference is, the rights of Australian citizens come first. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand how those other ministers from Indonesia and from Malaysia stand up for their citizens because they are Ministers of those countries. All I ask is that the Minister does the same.

I believe that anybody who heard the long, bitter, angry attacks that Senator Bishop made on Senator Evans at the Senate estimates committee hearing&mdash;the attack probably lasted for over an hour, during which time Senator Bishop inevitably made reference to a conspiracy and all the other things that are synonymous with her questioning&mdash;would acknowledge that the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Evans) and the department have acted very properly.</PARA></TALK.START>

The Minister also pointed out the specific way in which those discussions took place, giving the lie to the suggestion that Senator Bishop keeps repeating; that is, a certain chat took place over dinner. She has referred to other matters, but the Minister's denial of them and his putting the facts straight do not seem to have any effect. At the estimates committee, Senator Bishop said to the Minister:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, Minister, the tugging of that forelock to foreign nations is becoming rather obvious.</PARA>

Although Senator Evans is unhappy with the estimates committee report, I can assure honourable senators that the record of the estimates committee hearing is an accurate reflection of the way in which the Minister answered the questions raised by Senator Bishop. Senator Evans has complained that Senator Bishop was being critical. I would have thought that he would know that everything that Senator Bishop does is based on a critical style.

There are two ways of doing these things. One is to respond on the basis of information supplied by the other department with the relevant input into it, the other is to refer it to that other department. Our initial response was to send it off to the other department on the basis of advice received from the secretary of this committee. But it seems that, in a belt and braces exercise, we have now written to Senator Crane giving him the answer that, hopefully, will meet the points he made. That is the explanation for why it was dealt with in that way. I have given him his answers. I hope they are adequate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I raise a matter relating to an unanswered question. I refer to the schedule in the Estimates Committee A report to the Senate of May 1993. One of the questions I asked in that estimates committee hearing has not been responded to. I asked: in view of the law as laid down recently in Australia in the case of Rogers v. Whitaker regarding informed consent to medical procedure, what is being done where Australia is helping to fund population control programs to ensure that full and frank disclosure is made to ultimate recipients of the health risks associated with contraceptive medication?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That question was not asked of AIDAB; it was asked of the Department of Foreign Affairs when the committee was discussing the particular subprogram with which we are now dealing. The program is entitled `Bilateral relations', and the subprogram is entitled `Relations with the South Pacific, Africa and the Middle East'. That subprogram refers to our contribution to peaceful political and economic development, particularly in Papua New Guinea and the South Pacific, enhancing regional civility and Australia's security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I am specifically asking the Minister now, and this was asked of the department in the estimates committee, is whether he is fully aware of the implications of the judgment to which I refer. That judgment actually rewrote the principles of informed consent. If this has been done in Australian law, surely it is important that it be observed by the Department of Foreign Affairs and any of its agencies, or any government agencies, in respect of countries with whom we have bilateral relations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to that case of Rogers v. Whitaker and the High Court decision of Justices Mason, Brennan, Dawson, Toohey and McHugh. It is interesting that they adverted to the principle previously stated in respect of informed consent, and that was in the case Bolam v. Friern Hospital Management Committee in 1957, case No. 1 WLR 582. That principle stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that the law imposes the duty of care, but the standard of care is a matter of medical judgment . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Their Honours in this recent case disapproved of that principle, stating:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that a medical practitioner has a legal duty to warn a patient of a material risk inherent in proposed treatment&mdash;a risk being material if, in the circumstances of the particular case, a reasonable person in the patient's position, if warned of the risk, would be likely to attach significance to it or if the medical practitioner is or should reasonably be aware that the particular patient, if warned of risk, would be likely to attach significance to it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We all know that some of the contraceptive devices and birth control methods&mdash;which the Australian taxpayer is funding and which the Government seems hell bent on pursuing in sparsely populated areas such as PNG&mdash;very regularly have adverse and traumatic effects. From the material provided to me regarding what needs to be told to the recipients of that attention, it appears that the principle of informed consent, which the High Court considers appropriate for Australians, is not upheld by the department or other government agencies when it comes to dealing with persons in less developed countries. That is why I am drawing the matter to the Minister's attention now, so that he may give the Senate a guarantee that the principle of informed consent, as stated by their Honours in Rogers v. Whitaker, will also apply in respect of our aid and our bilateral associations with persons in other countries. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most I can quickly tell the honourable senator now is that AIDAB has policy principles for assistance in family planning and those principles have been reduced in the AIDAB programs operations guide used by officers and consultants. These principles advocate quality of care in family planning programs. Some of the elements of that quality of care, as specified by the principles, include: choice of method of contraception to suit individual needs based on the principle of informed consent; adequate information and counselling services; and the improved technical competence of family planning service providers. We recognise that many family planning programs in various parts of the world have serious deficiencies in those and other aspects of care. It is the aim of our family planning assistance programs to help improve the situation through technical assistance, training and other inputs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What Senator Harradine wants to know with a little more precision is, as he put it in his question, what is actually done when Australia is helping to fund these programs to ensure that full and frank disclosure is made to the ultimate recipients of the health risks associated with the operation of the various contraceptive measures. It is a fair question.

I do not think there is too much argument with him now among policy makers. But the point is that tobacco consumption is, I am advised, going down about seven per cent per annum at the moment as a result of the kind of campaigning that he and I both agree with. But so long as it does remain a legitimate item for consumption&mdash;and we are not in the business of banning absolutely&mdash;then a question arises as to how to supply that legitimate demand. Obviously it is in our interests as a national government to ensure that that supply is, so far as humanly possible, from viable Australian producers. So long as tobacco continues to be consumed in this country, we would much rather it was being supplied by Australian producers than outsiders. So it is in that context that these questions are being addressed by this department.

The leaf that we produce in Queensland, particularly around Mareeba, is the equal of any tobacco leaf to be found anywhere in the world. It is the equal of the leaf that is grown in Virginia. The problem is that enormous subsidies are given to tobacco farmers in Virginia by the United States Government, so they net in the vicinity of $US5,000 an acre.

Accordingly, I would seek the advice of the Minister as to whether those comments, in the fashion they were promised to me on 12 May, are now available for me. </PARA>

It appears that Senator O'Chee's particular question may not yet have been finalised, possibly because of this customs issue. But I have just been given an undertaking, which I re-tale to him, that he will get it by the close of business today, and that answer will seek to address the matters with which he is concerned, including those that do impinge upon, strictly speaking, customs issues.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before we deal with specific matters, I would like to draw to the attention of the Senate the fact that of the three departments covered by Estimates Committee B, the Department of Employment, Education and Training was the only department unable to provide answers to questions on notice before the committee reported to the Senate 10 days later. DEET managed to provide answers to the questions on notice 14 days after the estimates committee met.

The conclusion to be drawn from this repeated action by DEET is that either the department or the Minister is deliberately trying to avoid the scrutiny of the Parliament.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The circumstances on this occasion are not quite the same as normal. One mitigating factor is that there is usually a much longer period between holding the actual estimates committee hearings and the consideration of the committee of the whole. Sometimes it is in the order of six weeks; this time it was a much more compressed period.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, it is a little more awkward when the Minister is not in this chamber. What happened in the Department of Defence was that I pursued my own department&mdash;and I know Senator Faulkner now does the same&mdash;to get the answers, and we have had a very good record in the last two or three years in that regard. Because we are the Ministers in charge of the departments we press those matters. There is a slight difficulty when it involves a Minister representing the Minister, because the answers must be cleared by the portfolio Minister before they are cleared by me. When the House of Representatives is not sitting this process is sometimes more difficult. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, I will take an interest in this matter in the spring estimates committee process. We will have more time to get answers and we will be dealing with a different process.

I say that out of self-interest because I do not want be standing up every five minutes and telling senators why questions are not answered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The process was slightly unusual this time because we had a much more compressed period to get answers. We had the secondary problem that the House of Representatives was not meeting, and the portfolio Minister is not necessarily full time in Canberra&mdash;and I think Senator Tierney would understand why. Therefore, some of those answers are awaiting the Minister's clearance. I think it is a good process for the Minister to clear the answers because it does give them more authority. If there are then problems with the department it gives the Opposition more of an opportunity to follow it through than if one departmental official clears the answers and they do not go through the Minister. </PARA>

The dramatised documentary deals with some of the problems women face when they are told they have to have a Pap smear. Many women believe this means cancer while others are embarrassed. Many women believe that a Pap smear is a cancer test. I know women think this from my experience of working in the health area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A Pap smear is a way of detecting cell changes so that problems can be treated before cancer develops.

Like the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">English at Work</EMPHASIS> program on cervical cancer, the program on breast cancer will be screened in different languages all the next week.

They are very interesting suggestions but I think, given the fact that Professor Garnaut is presently chairing a committee of inquiry with broad-ranging terms of reference on this whole issue, it would be quite premature to speculate on the particular recommendations that are likely to arise from that review, whether they relate to trade with China or anywhere else.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to textile and clothing concerns more generally, the objectives of the textile, clothing and footwear plan are to promote the restructuring and revitalisation of the TCF industries, to improve efficiency in international competitiveness, to reduce dependence on Commonwealth assistance and to encourage the adoption of best business practices including progressive human resource policies. In particular, the TCF Development Authority has been established to implement that whole strategy with funding available to it and policy mechanisms now in train to actively promote the restructuring and revitalisation of the TCF industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Increased value added to wool is being encouraged by assisting a small number of major investments and projects which are export oriented, financially sound and directed towards developing markets for branded and differentiated Australian products. The local apparel industry needs to restructure and reinvest in order to focus its operations upon exports in a smaller, more market oriented domestic apparel sector. Authority assistance in this context to the textile sector is directed towards projects that involve restructuring, rationalisation, reinvestment, export orientation and the further processing of Australian raw materials.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For clothing firms&mdash;this is true of footwear firms as well&mdash;priority is being given to those which, again, are market rather than production oriented, have close relationships with retailers, are developing branded quality merchandise and are using quick response manufacturing techniques including electronic data interchange systems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the strategy which is under way. The success of that in practice has been demonstrated, I think, by the fact that value added in 1991-92 was $2.2 billion. That is only about $200 million less than in 1986-87 despite a fall in employment over that period of about 15,000 people. Average value added per person employed has increased by about 10 per cent. Exports have risen strongly each year with total TCF exports in 1991-92 of $418 million, which was 38 per cent greater than the figure for 1986-87.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a strategy in place and it is working. It has won, I think generally, the acceptance of the industry. The inevitability of changes of this kind is acknowledged and most participants, rather than continuing to try to impose or hold the line on quantitative restrictions, are planning how they will handle the change to lower tariffs. Overall, the industry is supportive of the plan and can be expected, I believe, to continue to work towards the overall restructuring of the industry in such a way as to guarantee its future as an important part of the manufacturing scene in this country.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's specific objectives at this conference are as follows: first, to press for a reallocation of funding within the UN to correct the serious disparity between the organisation's proclaimed priority of promoting and protecting human rights and its actual allocation of resources; second, to develop a program designed to achieve universal acceptance of the core human rights instruments and to reform the operation of existing treaty bodies and human rights political organs to ensure their effective operation; third, to develop a particular Australian initiative on the establishment of independent national human rights machinery to promote and protect human rights; fourth, to promote another initiative on national action plans which invites each state to draw up a written plan of action identifying steps whereby it could improve its observance of human rights; and, finally, to ensure that further impetus is given to the handling of women's issues and indigenous issues by the world conference.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to women's issues&mdash;the second part of Senator Giles's question&mdash;we did fight hard during the preparatory process to have a specific reference to women included on the agenda. In close consultation with other delegations, in particular Canada, we have recently succeeded in strengthening the text of the draft final outcome relating to women, which is now to go forward to Vienna.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the last part of the question, Amnesty International has proposed that one of the outcomes of this Vienna conference should be the announcement of a special commissioner for human rights based in New York. We see considerable merit in that proposal. In particular, it would raise the profile of human rights in the whole UN system and ensure that these concerns were injected into the mainstream of the UN political process. It might also succeed in attracting some additional resources, which are very badly needed in this area. We would want to avoid duplication of or conflict with the Centre for Human Rights in Geneva. We would be concerned if the price of establishing such a position were some purported rationalisation of existing UN human rights machinery which might actually end up weakening that machinery by folding existing procedures and institutions into the office of a special commissioner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overall, this proposal is an important stimulus for discussion on reform matters. We are concerned that it may founder on opposition from other regional groups. In those circumstances, we acknowledge that, while supporting it, we may need to look simultaneously at other options to ensure that the outcome of the world conference will lead to an increase in resources and better coordination in the area of human rights. I thank Senator Giles once again for her question.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The development of electronic data interchange, or EDI, in the waterfront industry is a vital element in improving the overall coordination and interaction of all of the participants in the transport chain. This was highlighted in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Warehouse to wharf</EMPHASIS> report, which recommended the establishment of a national consultative group on EDI to accelerate and coordinate the spread of EDI in the transport sector. It is very impressive to actually have a look at what has been done in the Australian industry just over the past few years with things such as brokerage insurance and so on. In previous years this took a mass of paperwork. The entire transaction can now be completed just by tapping it all out on a keyboard. So there has already been tremendous progress made by industry particularly in providing these EDI services.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The group that I have just referred to was established late last year. It comprises high level representatives from the relevant Commonwealth and private sector organisations. It has already undertaken a preliminary study of the current state of EDI in the transport sector, identifying any impediments to its implementation and examining possible solutions. Progress is also being made in the alignment of EDI systems between Commonwealth agencies, and of course the major agency that already accesses this EDI system is Customs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service is ensuring that its electronic transfer of export documentation is developed in line with the Australian Customs Service system that I have just mentioned. Similarly, for imported cargo, both AQIS and ACS are committed to an integrated clearance process whereby both agencies present a common point of entry and exit for importers. Already over 95 per cent of import entries are now lodged and paid for electronically.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further initiative will allow cargo manifests to be sent electronically to Customs, which will then direct copies electronically to port authorities and to the quarantine service, and subsequently issue a joint ACS-AQIS clearance through a single electronic message. This system is very good. Might I just say that under the old system that existed only a few years ago it could take up to 100 separate paper transactions to get a container into and out of an Australian port. So a tremendous amount of progress has already been made to obviate all of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The system that I have just referred to, which is called sea cargo automation, is currently undergoing trials in the port of Brisbane. The ultimate aim is to have a completely paperless trading system. This will produce considerable direct cost savings and greatly improved service levels to waterfront users. In fact, I would like to be able to table documents in this Parliament on a floppy disk&mdash;if I could put in a quick bid for that&mdash;instead of having to lug them into the chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Warehouse to wharf</EMPHASIS> inquiry estimated that 40 million documents related to import and export of cargo were generated annually in Australia. As I have said, a single import process was found to involve up to 100 separate pieces of paper. Any reduction in this paper mountain would be a welcome improvement for the trading community in Australia. However, the inquiry also highlighted the vital role of the private sector in addressing inefficiencies at the port-land interface. The adoption of EDI technology places the primary onus on users of waterfront related services to adopt this new technology and make the necessary investment in computer equipment and software to access the system, thereby realising the full benefits to all users of the system.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister representing the Treasurer to a question that I put to the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration last Friday dealing with the issue of the bringing forward of tax return lodgment deadlines for registered tax agents. Given that this new deadline is expected to raise an extra $25 million, can the Minister give an assurance that the precipitous reduction in the time available to tax agents to process returns is not the result of the Government pressurising the ATO, either explicitly or implicitly, to increase revenue collections for this financial year because of the problems with the Budget deficit? Given this new time frame, will the Government also give an assurance that the Tax Office will, as in previous years, provide extra time to pay 85 per cent of tax payable due 28 days after the end of the year of income?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I acknowledge that Senator Watson has a question on notice with regard to this matter, the answer to which will be tabled shortly. Notwithstanding that and whatever the consequences may be for Standing Orders, it is an issue of concern. It was publicised in this morning's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>. It may have caused some misunderstanding or misapprehension, so I am happy to respond to the matter here and now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of the first important question, which Senator Watson invites me explicitly to respond to, the Government has not sought to influence the Taxation Office in the discharge of its responsibilities in this way. As Senator Watson and most senators would be aware, the Commissioner has a clear discretion in these administrative matters. I am advised that this action is not the response of any attempt by the Treasurer or other Ministers to influence the Taxation Office in this way. My advice is that the Tax Office proposal stems from its responsibility to collect revenue as soon as practicable on or after the due date set by the law. The timely lodgment of tax returns is a critical part of this cash flow management responsibility, one in which tax agents have a major role to play.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accepting that return preparation and processing volumes need to be managed, the Tax Office has for many years had lodgment programs in place for tax agents, as Senator Watson would know. This year the Tax Office has noted that the flow of returns from agents was unevenly compressed into the last stages of the program, regardless of agreements with the profession that returns would be lodged progressively. Delayed lodgment of returns can cause significant slippage of collections. Bringing forward the final dates for agent lodgment is a way of addressing this slippage. It is an initiative which the Tax Office has taken in response to these concerns which have come to its attention and which appear to be contrary to agreements with the profession.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The article in this morning's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> that related to this matter missed the important point that the Tax Office letter referred to was canvassing alternatives to the `bring forward' proposal from members of the Tax Office's peak professional consultative body, the national tax liaison group. The letter proposed meetings with the profession during the next few weeks to discuss any alternatives. By definition, these meetings have yet to occur. So final decisions on the 1993-94 agent lodgment program have not yet been taken. They will be taken after that consultation of which the letter is the catalyst.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. I know the Minister is aware of the difficulties that tax agents will have in meeting this new deadline. This bringing forward of the deadline, in effect, represents the compaction to one month of the time now required by registered tax agents to lodge returns within the space of a two-year period. Is he aware of that difficulty? What can he do to ameliorate the problem?</PARA></TALK.START>

The most important response to Senator Watson's point is that, if there are substantial concerns&mdash;and it is quite possible that there would be&mdash;the meetings and consultation which the Tax Office proposes to have with the profession during the next few weeks should enable a 1993-94 program to be developed which obviates the worst of those problems, although it is a matter for discussion between the Commissioner and his representatives and the profession.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins), in response to a question without notice asked by Senator Bishop this day, relating to a report into air safety standards commissioned by the Civil Aviation Authority.</PARA>
<PARA>The answer that Senator Collins gave to my question earlier today would have left people who were listening to that question with the opinion that safety with regard to air traffic and aviation in a general sense had not been diminished. I attempted to table the documentation. The Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Gareth Evans) declined to allow me to do so, saying that the courtesy of letting the Government see the documentation had not been observed. I would point out that that was quite needless as the Minister has all the documentation. He has the letter, for instance, from Captain Alan Terrell which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you for your letter . . . of 6 April enclosing the unconfirmed minute of the Board discussion regarding the report on SR&amp;S which I Chaired.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If I may be permitted to comment now, as I could not comment on the report to the Board when presented: there are three specific points I would like to make.</PARA>
<PARA>In an addendum to this letter, Captain Terrell says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The main report did not specifically address the question of safety as it was not included in the terms of reference.</PARA>
<PARA>Convenient. He continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I did make some mention of it, however, in the draft Board paper but again, made that comment as innocuously as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is in my opinion, however, a fact that safety standards/levels have been reduced so that they are closer to the regulated margins. It would be most surprising if this were not so, as in essence what has occurred is that the industry has been deregulated, the Authority has been commercialised, policy has insisted on devolution wherever possible and delegation where this can be controlled, and the country is experiencing a major economic downturn, all at the same time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Summing all that up, standards are certainly lower, the essence of the argument would be: are they too low?</PARA>
<PARA>The entire document deals with the question of whether or not those standards are too low. I refer again to the letter that was sent to the Minister in April:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . , roman numeral ii) of the Board's resolution points out that there was no conclusion with regard to air safety in the report. This is true, however I referred specifically to this aspect in my letter to you of 30 March . . .</PARA>
<PARA>That was an extract of the letter I was reading from. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . , as I assume from the minute that the Board did not see this letter. These extracts clearly show that I believe safety has been `damaged' or `weakened' . . . but that felt it was better not said in the main report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have heard suggestions that I am `crying wolf' in regard to safety. May I assure you my comments are based on a selective analysis of comments we all received and as a consequence, the Board resolution does not reflect the totality of my comments to it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thirdly, the composition of the working groups has been delegated to Management, however I personally believe the exclusion of the ALAEA&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the body of licensed engineers who called yesterday's strike&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">on the basis that they are not "a union having industrial coverage of the Division" could be unfortunate if this is the intention. They are certainly part of the industry.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, this entire document, which I believe the public is entitled to see, is a catalogue of complaints about the Civil Aviation Authority. It is a statement by and large which says that in the bid to commercialise safety&mdash;that is, to put a price on safety&mdash;people's lives are being put in jeopardy. </PARA>

Senator Evans is absolutely correct in what he said about the practice that has been adopted in this chamber. It is more than a courtesy; it is a far more important issue than that. All documents tabled in this Parliament instantly attract privilege. The practice in this chamber, and I am familiar with it, is for members of the Opposition and members of the Australian Democrats to routinely show Ministers any package they wish to table, giving them at least five minutes to look through it before making a decision about whether they will support the attraction of privilege to the documents.</PARA></TALK.START>

If Senator Bishop would like to give me just a scant 30 minutes to look at this package, I will be happy to seek the leave of the Senate in half an hour's time and respond as to whether I have any objections to the package being tabled and attracting privilege. I ask to be given 30 minutes to read the package. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The evidence in relation to the safety of the Australian aviation system that has been placed before the Senate this afternoon is of the utmost gravity. For some years now I have been warning, in a responsible way, about a diminution of standards in the Australian aviation industry. I have been very heavily ridiculed by Senator Collins and Senator Schacht. I do not mind that because my shoulders are broad enough to put up with any irresponsible comments from those sorts of people. Nevertheless, the issue is an enormously serious one.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The evidence of a diminution of standards with respect to safety has been in the public arena since the airline pilots dispute in 1989-90. I will be very clear on this point: I am not saying that the pilots strike was in any way at all the cause of the diminution; it just illustrated the shortcomings that were becoming apparent. It is very important to ask why safety in Australia has collapsed or is running down. There are many reasons for this but basically it stems from the Civil Aviation Authority, the successor to the Department of Civil Aviation, taking the wrong approach at the instigation of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had the doctrine of affordable safety under which somehow we measure safety not in terms of lives lost but in terms of statistics&mdash;that is, if not as many people are killed in aeroplanes as are killed in buses, we are wasting money by setting excessive safety standards for aircraft. We have had a perverted view of the user pays doctrine which tries to argue that there is no public interest in transport at all, particularly in aviation, and because the community gets no benefit at all, everyone who flies must pay the whole cost. That has perverted the safety standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Safety is a cultural thing. It is not just a simple set of rules; it is a state of mind. Safety is something that perfuses the whole of the industry. It takes years&mdash;generations&mdash;to build up. That is why when things start to go wrong they do not necessarily go wrong overnight. It is why we do not necessarily have a great disaster once things start to go bad. But it is terribly important at this stage that we review what is happening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This matter was triggered off by a report made by Captain Terrell, a former board member of the Civil Aviation Authority. He was without doubt the most experienced airman on the CAA board&mdash;a board that has been quite noticeable for its lack of knowledge and personal experience of the area in which it is dealing; namely, the aviation industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Captain Terrell has reported as a member of a committee and in a private capacity to the Minister, voicing his alarms. Coming from a person like that, the Senate must take note of those concerns. Just to illustrate the point, the general aviation accident record in Australia shows a pattern of continuing deterioration. It is I think, off the top of my head, twice as bad as it is in the United States, despite the fact that we have a far better climate and far less traffic density. What we are dealing with here is the application of wrong and incorrect policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had from the Minister a very arrogant defence of his department and an absolute refusal to recognise that something might be wrong. We have seen the Civil Aviation Authority introduce massive changes with respect to air space. There has been advertisement of those changes but there has been no education campaign mounted. There is no way pilots in the recreational or the general aviation sector, apart from those flying for hire and reward, can know what the rules are now because the publications are not there. The face-to-face briefing has been abandoned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Macphee report on the inquiry into the TAATS aviation contract which was tabled in December last year showed that the board was collectively incompetent on a grand scale, and the Government still keeps the board in office. It now looks as if the chairman of the board, Mr Butcher, is going to slip gracefully away instead of being fired. I think that is outrageous. This is the man who approved six-figure payments for people like Baldwin and Edwards, who were found in this report to be culpable of gross incompetence in the management of their affairs. They depart, courtesy of Mr Butcher, with huge separation payments when they had to go because of their incompetence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the matter that is before us is the need for the Minister to put aside his preferences. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the comments of my colleague Senator MacGibbon. Most of us in this place are involved in extensive flying. I was a passenger in an aircraft which attempted on four occasions to land at Launceston airport but, because of fog, the first three attempts were unsuccessful.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that all of us have had these sorts of personal experiences and that adds to the concerns about the standard of safety and the lack of personnel available to give information about such things as height of fog ceiling, its density and so on.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is one really essential point that needs to be made here. I was the Minister who appointed Captain Alan Terrell. It was deliberately done by me, and I think Senator MacGibbon knows that. I deeply regret&mdash;and I am very sincere about this, as my office will attest&mdash;that Alan Terrell is no longer a member of that board. I am very sorry indeed that, for reasons entirely unconnected with his board activities, he is no longer a member of the board.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I appointed Captain Alan Terrell personally to the board of the CAA. At the time that I appointed Captain Terrell&mdash;and I might add that I received the full cooperation and support of the senior management in CAA and the chairman of the board; not that it was required, but I did&mdash;I spoke to the board of the CAA. I indicated to it that the most effective way of utilising Captain Terrell's experience&mdash;which I freely acknowledge Senator MacGibbon has correctly stated&mdash;his high reputation in the industry and his long-time experience as a senior captain with one of the major airlines in Australia was in fact to put him in charge of a safety subcommittee of the board, and that was done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I simply say to senators, because I think it is important, that I am looking high and low at the moment&mdash;and I tell senators that it is hard&mdash;to find a board replacement for Captain Terrell, who I am still actively involved in discussion with on this issue, who has the same level of expertise as Captain Terrell. I particularly appointed him for that purpose and to set up a safety subcommittee of the board, which he chaired very well. The reason that I make that point is that it is a direct result of that appointment by me of Captain Terrell, and his role in chairing that safety subcommittee that was established, that the board of the CAA initiated this report. It is not a report which has been forced down the throats of the CAA board by Captain Terrell, as he himself will acknowledge; it was an initiative of the board that the review be undertaken and I am glad it was. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, the CAA board is moving, and properly moving, expeditiously to properly consider&mdash;in full consultation with the industry, the unions and with its management&mdash;the Terrell report. I gave that advice earlier today in Question Time. The working group's draft reports are being considered by the board today and the final reports will be completed at the end of this month. All of that information has been provided by me to the licensed aircraft maintenance engineers. In addition to that, as a direct response to the representations they made personally to me at meetings that I had with them, I have in writing proposed to personally chair a round table meeting of all the participants, after the CAA's consideration of this issue, to bring this matter to a successful resolution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by saying that I will complete expeditiously my examination of the documents that Senator Bishop wishes to table, but I have already picked up, just in glancing through them, a number of comments made in terms of the anecdotal evidence that has been provided that would concern me in that they appear to be potentially defamatory. I am simply saying that I have picked that up already and I will have a closer examination of the documents when I leave the chamber. But I do not want parliamentary privilege to be abused in the sense that anecdotal evidence, which I have picked up on two or three pages already, may be damaging of people's reputations and therefore be protected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make the final point that the board is taking Captain Terrell's report seriously, but Captain Terrell went at large into an organisation which has just gone through a great deal of change. I say without hesitation that  I support people like Senator MacGibbon who over the years have publicly demanded that change, long overdue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This matter is of major importance. In perusing some of the issues that the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins) has under consideration, and in looking at the evidence, he refers to what he considers to be anecdotal evidence in some of the correspondence. But equally I would draw the Minister's attention to some of the very important stuff that is contained in this file that is very important for the public record.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, I would draw to the Minister's attention a letter, a copy of which he received&mdash;by CC, I note&mdash;dated 6 April 1993. Importantly, this letter is from Qantas. It is from Captain R. Heinecke, the Acting Deputy Chief Executive, Operations. Following a briefing, Captain Heinecke writes to Mr Butcher stating:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is of particular concern to us&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I would point out that that is senior officers of the Qantas group&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that differences exist between the proposed course of action suggested by the study group and the action proposed by your Acting Chief Executive. In respect of task force composition, for example, the study group recommends that each task force would contain appropriate experts from industry et cetera. However, the Acting Chief Executive has seemingly decided that the industry will not be involved and outside consultations will be used as nominated by the working group chairman.</PARA>
<PARA>Further on in the letter, and I draw this to Senator Collins's attention, Captain Heinecke says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The very creditability of, and industry confidence in, the safety regulation and standards division is in serious jeopardy. Unless this is properly and effectively addressed there could be serious industrial implications and an erosion of public confidence when the facts of the report are made public.</PARA>
<PARA>It is very concerning that the Minister is now hedging and delaying, and is not prepared to face the decent action that he ought to take. I am absolutely astounded that in the last division the Australian Democrats were equally prepared to walk away from their responsibility in this matter. They did not even seek to acquaint themselves, very obviously, with the important issues that are to hand and need now to be very carefully addressed. </PARA>

<PARA>Earlier today in Question Time Senator Crowley said that the Government was encouraging all women over 50 to have a mammogram every two years. She was questioned about that by Senator Hill who pointed out that, as a general rule, mammograms performed on women of any age do not get a Medicare rebate. A specific reason for having a mammogram done is required before a woman is entitled to a Medicare rebate. </PARA>

I am not complaining about that at all because I believe that these screening programs must be set up very carefully. The people who read the mammograms must be experienced people. So far as I am aware, the screening programs are set up only in capital cities. For instance, we have only one in Tasmania, although others are coming. I am not suggesting for one moment that the setting up of these screening programs ought to be rushed, because we need well experienced people to read the screens. I believe if we do not have those experienced people it could be even more dangerous than not having the screenings done at all. </PARA>

She is correct to pursue the pap smears issue because women are entitled to Medicare rebates for pap smears. However, at present women are not entitled to Medicare rebates for mammograms and, of course, they should be. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am disappointed that the Senate does not have the opportunity today to deal at length with the report and with the ministerial response thereto. Our relationship with the People's Republic of China is a very important and grave question of public policy. It is important that we are conscious of the gross violations of human rights in China when consideration is given to the pursuit of most favoured nation trading conditions with the PRC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have time to deal with just two matters. The committee deals in rather philosophical terms with the issues of human rights and the different interpretations that are placed on human rights in China by the PRC as compared with those placed on human rights in Australia by the Australian Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is evident from the white paper on human rights produced by the PRC that its view of basic and fundamental human rights for individuals means that those rights could be subordinated to the perceived rights of the state, which are termed economic, social and cultural rights. Of course, those rights are determined by the PRC. We all know that human rights are universal and indivisible. This type of nice philosophical dialogue means very little to some of the political prisoners currently rotting away in Chinese gaols. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did ask quite strongly that the human rights delegation investigate what has happened to those refugees whose applications were rejected by the Australian Government and who were forcibly repatriated to China.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect to Senator Harradine's very good suggestion about the present parliamentary delegation travelling in China, it is a good suggestion and therefore has occurred to others. Indeed, that delegation has been briefed on precisely this matter. It is amongst its working papers and documents, as I understand. I am quite sure that there would be persons within the delegation who would have an opportunity&mdash;and, as a delegation, there would be an opportunity&mdash;to utilise that brief in order to follow up the matter.</PARA>
<PARA>In this delegation report I cannot see any reference to that matter. The philosophical discussions in here are all very well, but I believe they mean nothing to those people who have been forcibly repatriated. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS> There is nothing in this document to say what has happened to those people. We know that the Chinese have said that people who are forcibly repatriated will not be punished for illegally departing China. That is not the point. The point is whether they are being punished&mdash;and all evidence seems to suggest that many of them are&mdash;on their forcible return to China as a result of their previous activities, including pro-democracy activities. </PARA>

I will be dealing with that matter in greater detail when it comes before the Senate in August. </PARA>

<PARA>I am not quite certain what I am more put out about&mdash;the contents of this report of the Copyright Agency Ltd or the manner of its presentation to the Senate. I would ask you, Mr Deputy President, to raise with the President the manner in which the Senate has been conned by the Government&mdash;I presume it is by the Government&mdash;in the Order of Business paper for today. It states that this report&mdash;which was signed on 14 October 1992&mdash;was presented to the former Attorney-General on 14 December 1992. However, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> states that it was in fact submitted to the present Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) on 20 May 1993, left his office on 24 May and is now being eventually tabled on 25 May 1993&mdash;that is, a report for the year to 30 June 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As you know, Mr Deputy President, it is arrant nonsense for the Government or anyone else to pretend that `the Minister' means anything other than the position of the Minister, not the particular person who may have happened to be the Minister at the time. This report was submitted to the former Minister in time for it to be presented to this chamber while we were sitting last year. That was not done. In other words, the requirements of speedy reporting were not broken by the Copyright Agency Ltd but by the Government itself&mdash;although why it took from the date of signature on 14 October 1992 until 14 December 1992 to get to the previous Minister is beyond me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy President, I would ask you to see whether the President does not consider it grossly misleading that in today's Order of Business the Government is trying to pretend that this was only received by the present Minister on 20 May. It does not matter who the Minister is. The Government sat on this report from 14 December until 24 May. This may have been done because the report itself is inadequate&mdash;I do not know&mdash;or it may simply be that there has been massive incompetence in the transfer of responsibilities from one Attorney-General to the next. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problems that I see with this Copyright Agency Ltd report&mdash;and I say in passing that I support the principle of this organisation&mdash;are in relation to the fact that this organisation is handling a very large amount of money indeed, and yet the audited reports relate not to the enormous amount of money being handled but simply to the corporate accounts, the accounts of the Copyright Agency Ltd, which handle this enormous amount of money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While it is true that some private sector auditors, chartered accountants called Camphin Boston, have audited the accounts of the Copyright Agency Ltd, which involve some millions of dollars&mdash;for example, something like $1.9 million in running costs, which seems to me to be an extraordinarily large amount in view of the sum actually handed out to authors&mdash;the real issue is what happens in the trust account, which deals with $17.8 million. It is not audited, there are no comparable figures for the previous year, and it does not meet the requirements of the Companies Act. It is not good enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from anything else, there is something like a 21 per cent operating cost to revenue, which clearly seems to me to be far too high. Funds of $9.4 million were received during the year and $6 million went out. However, there is to be a $9 million disbursement to authors this year. If we are to have this kind of reporting, can it please be more effective and more accurate with some comparable figures so that we can see what on earth is really happening. The audited accounts are next to meaningless&mdash;apart from being monumentally late, of course. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is one of the reasons why it seems to me that the Senate estimates process should cover all these sorts of bodies, even when there is no requirement for an appropriation of funds. Otherwise, all we will get by way of supervision of this kind of operation is five minutes allocated speaking time during the presentation of documents, such as we have had today. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the seventh in a regular series of reports from the National Board of Employment, Education and Training to the Parliament through the Minister about firstly the operation of the profile process, that is, the profile of educational institutions which need to be negotiated and agreed to under statute by the Commonwealth Government, and secondly the operation of the higher education contribution scheme. There is a third matter raised in this report, that is, the question of institutional autonomy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These three topics are very briefly considered in the report. The board agreed on this report on 5 March, a few days before the last election. It describes everything as rosy with regard to profiles, institutional autonomy and HECS and I do not doubt the sincerity of the chairman of the board, Mr Peter Laver, or the Chairman of the Higher Education Council, Professor Chubb. I do not challenge the sincerity of their putting forward a report on 5 March saying that all is rosy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I take this opportunity to say that I am not convinced by the board or the council's statements in regard to these three topics. The findings in this report are contrary to the statements made to me over a regular period, including in recent months, about the lack of sufficient autonomy in our universities and other educational institutions and the onerous provisions whereby a centralist government in Canberra requires profiles to be defined in backrooms between university representatives and the Government here in Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These matters were hotly debated in the month of March during the election campaign and it must be observed that, when a report like this is tabled a couple of months later for the attention of the Parliament, the statement about everything being rosy lacks credibility. It is merely an assertion in the context of an education debate which has raged not only during the month of March, but in all the months before. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Page 2 of the report concerns profiles and states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The universities, as autonomous institutions, need these opportunities to understand government policies about funding in a wider context, and about social issues such as equity and participation, in order to arrange their own programs more effectively. It is also apparent that most appreciate the opportunity the profiles process offers for this interaction.</PARA>
<PARA>I regard that as a patronising statement by the council and the board. I want to hear directly from institutional representatives rather than just hearing these rosy statements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the section of the report concerning institutional autonomy, I wish to refer to the reference made in one brief paragraph to the glaring intervention of this Government in regard to the John Curtin School of Medical Research at the Australian National University. I expect Senator Tierney to speak at length about this matter in a moment or two. Of course, the report acknowledges that this was a grave intrusion upon the autonomy of the ANU. In its passage on the John Curtin school it even recommends that the funding responsibility return to the Department of Employment, Education and Training. But it concludes in this way on page 7:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In general terms, however, the Council's position&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is the Higher Education Council&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">is that institutions have a greater degree of autonomy than in the past.</PARA>
<PARA>Which past? I put it to the Senate that that comparison is made only with regard to the last few years, not with regard to 10, 20 or 30 years ago. It is an unbelievable statement. I ask that these matters be considered with greater credibility. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The seventh report of the Higher Education Council is in the form of advice to the Minister. It is NBEET's report on two of the most controversial issues in the higher education sector: the profiling process and institutional autonomy. Before I discuss the report, however, I would like to point out that it suffers from the same delays as all other reports from NBEET. It was interesting to note Senator Baume's comments earlier with regard to another department. Let me chronicle in a similar way the delays this report has suffered in coming before the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Higher Education Council had undertaken to review and report to the national board, and its report is dated 23 February. It then took the national board another six weeks to forward the report to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley) with a very brief covering letter. It then took the Minister another six weeks to table the advice to the Parliament. Given that the Parliament has been sitting for the last 3 1/2 weeks, I cannot understand why the Minister should delay the presentation of this and every other NBEET report for so long. We had the disgraceful situation a few weeks ago where 10 reports were tabled on one day, thus avoiding the scrutiny of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These delays mean that important issues that are at stake are not fully debated. Two of the issues of higher education that are at stake are profiling and institutional autonomy. This report before us reports briefly on the 1992 educational profile process. The report states that the profile process has again been seen to be helpful and not intrusive. As I have noted before when NBEET has made this sort of statement, I do not really understand who is telling this to NBEET because the comments that I have received from people in higher education institutions are that they regard the profiling process as largely a waste of the time and resources of the university. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This attitude seems to have created problems in data collection that affects the relationship between the institutions and DEET. The valuable time of university staff is taken up on a number of other similar exercises providing similar data to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the Australian Vice-chancellor's Committee, as well as the department. University academics have a lot better things to do with their time in teaching and in research and should not be wasting an enormous amount of time filling out forms that have very little value. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The document also reports that the council wrote to each vice-chancellor inviting comments on any specific examples of intrusion which their institutions may have experienced with regard to autonomy and seeking examples of potential intrusion which could lead to unease. Twenty-four responses were received outlining various matters. The most frequent example of institutional autonomy abuse, according to the vice-chancellors, was requests by bureaucracies and authorities for data. However, the council believes that few, if any, of the responses from institutions identified examples of intrusion into institutional autonomy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Teague's comments about the John Curtin School of Medical Research were interesting. One would have thought that that is the most glaring example of an invasion of an institution's autonomy. A particular school of the university was actually removed from the control of the ANU council. It is that sort of example which should cause great concern to all universities, to this Senate and to the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Often I think that this has come about because of a different interpretation of the word `autonomy'. In its report here today, the council believes that generally institutions have a greater degree of autonomy than in the past. It points to a number of reasons for this. It says that less cumbersome procedures are required for accreditation of new courses and that there is a greater capacity to establish new faculties or enter new fields of study and encouragement and support to build research profiles. This conveniently overlooks the other ways in which the federal bureaucracy has been intrusive and, as was mentioned before, John Curtin would be the worst example. I suggest that the council should look at what institutions regard as an invasion of autonomy rather than dismiss them because they do not fit in with the council's definition. </PARA>

<PARA>This report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Project audit: the national Bankcard: who will pay the piper?</EMPHASIS>, by the Australian National Audit Office is a very important report indeed. It is a report on the financial obligations of the Federal Government. The report identifies government obligations in excess of $125 billion. It says that even that figure is underestimated. The report believes that the underestimation is more than $44 billion, made up of guarantees and contingencies of $18 billion, capital and other commitments of $9 1/2 billion and forward obligations of $16.8 billion. In other words, the report identifies government obligations of exactly $169 billion. That is an enormous amount of money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General's report concluded that, whilst Australia is currently able to meet this level of obligations, improvements in existing monitoring and reporting arrangements are needed. The report says that central to these improvements is the development of `whole of government reporting', which is now possible given the Government's adoption of accrual accounting for all agencies. That is a matter on which we had some discussion last week in the Senate. In raising this matter, I welcomed the fact that the Government is moving towards the adoption of accrual accounting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General makes several recommendations aimed at improving the management of these huge obligations and the information available in relation to them so as to better assess the Government's management of its obligations, including whether in the management of its programs the Government has considered the impact on the level of obligations and the consequences to both existing and future taxpayers. I want to quote at some length from a couple of the key sections of the report because I believe that what the Auditor-General has put in here&mdash;by way of comment and explanation and description of the existing situation and the recommendations the report makes to deal with it&mdash;is very important indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bottom line of this report reflects even more strongly than the Opposition has been able to do the Government's gross irresponsibility in its election promises which involve huge increases&mdash;$4 billion worth&mdash;in government spending. It also reflects the gross irresponsibility that flows from the fact that this Government has completely ignored the size and significance of the Budget deficit. It has not pursued the necessary measures to reduce that deficit and the public sector call on the savings of Australians&mdash;savings that are so critical if we are going to get this economy going again. An increase in the Government's Budget deficit&mdash;indeed, any Budget deficit&mdash;requires  drawing on the nation's savings and a consequent reduction thereof. I will come back to that point a little later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to quote some key points in the report. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obligations of the Federal Government exceed $125 billion. While the Government is currently able to meet these obligations, improvements in existing monitoring systems to control the level and impact of these obligations are needed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These obligations include Federal Government borrowings with a market value of $50 billion.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, government borrowings have a market value of $50 billion, which corresponds to 11.8 per cent of our total annual gross domestic product&mdash;our total national production each year. That figure compares favourably with the average over the past 10 years, which has been in excess of 13 per cent. However, the Auditor-General makes a very telling point, with which I totally agree:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The recent deterioration in the budget deficit may, however, put pressure on future debt levels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Treasury's role in managing the Federal Government's borrowings could be improved by regular performance evaluation of the debt management function.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Funding decisions taken by the Government lack the benefit of the information that would normally be available in any well run company which manages the level and impact of its obligations on future cash flows, costs and investment decisions so as to protect its future viability and maximise its return to its shareholders. In government, funding decisions have a direct impact on the Australian economy and taxpayers. Sound financial management of obligations by the Government should ensure that the impact on future taxation rates, the cost of government programs and investment in infrastructure will be balanced with the need to avoid undue obligations on future taxpayers and adverse affects on the living standards of Australians.</PARA>
<PARA>That is quite the opposite of the end result of the Government's recent decisions and actions in its grossly irresponsible fiscal policy. The report goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In this respect, current accountability to the Parliament and the taxpayer is deficient, as:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. available data is not easily accessible and fails to highlight relevant benchmarks</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. no federal agency has a responsibility to accumulate, monitor, manage or report on the total obligations of the Federal Government&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is an extraordinary finding by the Auditor-General&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. budget papers provide only a short term view on the impact of funding decisions&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>we all know that&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. practices adopted in the financial reporting of obligations, including superannuation, are significantly below the standards adopted in the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a very damning comment indeed. The report then states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">More accessible and better information is needed if Australia's medium to long term interests are to be protected.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report acknowledges that the introduction of accrual accounting for departments and agencies by the Government is a significant step forward and that research work has commenced on whole of government reporting on an accrual basis. The Australian National Audit Office (ANAO) considers that whole of government reporting on an accrual basis is critical to disclosure of obligations and recommends that it be introduced by June 1995.</PARA>
<PARA>That is one of the two recommendations made by the Auditor-General. There are 15 recommendations, two of which are regarded by the Auditor-General as essential&mdash;and that is one of the two. In supplementing the points that I have just described, the report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To meet outstanding obligations, the Commonwealth has available liquid assets totalling $57 billion,&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>Remember that the total of its outstanding obligations is $170 billion&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">leaving $70 billion to be met from future government receipts or realisation of non-liquid assets.</PARA>
<PARA>That $70 billion still to be met from future government receipts or realisation of non-liquid assets excludes the $44 billion which the report feels its obligations figure of $125 billion is understated by. The report then says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth's power to tax should ensure that the Commonwealth remains solvent at all times&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>One would hope so. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The obligations presented above represent the financial obligations of the Government prior to the exercise of its taxation powers and impact on the taxpayer through the possibility of:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. the Federal Government being forced to increase receipts by options such as increasing taxation levels or privatising government assets</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. the Federal Government being forced to reduce expenditure in other areas of government, such as infrastructure, thereby lowering the future standards of living of Australians, and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. obligation levels increasing . . . leading to an escalation of servicing costs. This latter option could have wider economic implications such as the possibility of increased dependence by both private and public sectors on foreign debt.</PARA>
<PARA>That confirms what the coalition has been saying time and time again over recent years. If one is looking to strengthen the sovereignty and the independence of this nation, the one thing one does not do is to put this nation continually and increasingly into hock, into debt, to the rest of the world. Yet that is a policy which this Government has pursued stringently and assiduously since it took office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the Government took office, our national debt to the rest of the world has gone up from approximately $25 billion, a very manageable figure in those days, to a figure in excess of $200 billion. That figure means that we as a nation have almost the highest level of foreign debt on this earth. This is an enormous indictment of this Government's policies and it is the highest risk set of policies that a nation such as ours could pursue, particularly when one looks at the prospects for the Australian economy, given the difficult problems in the overseas world, the international economy, and all the implications for our export earnings&mdash;let alone the lack of reform measures that have been taken in Australia to enable us to become more competitive, not just overseas but in our domestic markets as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government's irresponsibility in failing to tackle the Budget deficit&mdash;and, on the contrary, by exacerbating that deficit through a whole series of grossly irresponsible spending promises and bribes during the election campaign&mdash;has put this economy, and therefore all Australians, at even more risk of declining living standards and of going into hock in relation to the rest of the world than was the case before. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has created for itself the totally unenviable task of delivering $4 billion of spending promises per year for the next three years of this Parliament. That results from no less than 138 specific additional spending promises and election bribes that were made in and during the lead-up to the last election, $2 billion dollars of revenue promises and $8 billion of personal income tax cuts. On top of that it has given a commitment of a Budget deficit of no more than $5 billion in 1996-97. That figure compares with a Budget deficit outcome for this year of approximately $16 billion on present indications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has got to try to meet all these commitments, promises and undertakings in an environment of low growth, high unemployment, national dissavings and nil investment. There is not one forecaster in Australia, public or private, who believes that those various undertakings are compatible. Independent forecasters are at one in stating that those undertakings are incompatible. They forecast a Budget deficit of around $13 billion in 1996-97&mdash;not the $5 billion that the Government is talking about&mdash;if the tax cut and spending promises are kept. That means that the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins), and the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) have to come up with $8 billion from somewhere. Personally, I think that that is likely to be a gross underestimate as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All the reports indicate, and I think Treasurer Dawkins yesterday confirmed, that the Government will have to find $2 billion next financial year alone, that is, 1993-94, just to maintain the level of the deficit at its current level for this year of around $16 billion. It means that the starting point for the upcoming Budget is a deficit of $18 billion, despite the Government's claims that recovery is now under way in the economy. What nonsense that statement is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To put into perspective the magnitude of what is required, only twice under this Government has expenditure been cut by $2 billion in any one year. The $8 billion that it will have to find in the period up to 1996-97 is four times that figure. The first occasion when $2 billion was cut was in the midst of the banana republic fever, in the 1986 Budget. The second occasion was in the May 1987 statement when a further $2.6 billion was slashed. What sorts of cuts do we get for $2 billion? In 1986 the cuts included slashing defence, introducing student fees, cutting hospital and medical services, deferring pensions, reducing foreign aid, halting capital works, diminishing road funding, hammering States' payments and massive asset sales. In the May 1987 statement, the cuts went further into defence, roads, payments to the States&mdash;squeezing the States&mdash;local government, primary industry, killing off the first home owners scheme, introducing the controversial pharmaceutical co-payment and large-scale welfare crackdowns. In other words, a cut of $2 billion would hit a lot of people&mdash;so what about an $8 billion cut, which the Government will have to make?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To put that into perspective, the $8 billion is almost the entire Commonwealth expenditure on education and defence. It is equal to all the Commonwealth expenditure on housing and community amenities, transport and communications, culture and recreation and labour and employment. It is more money than the Federal Government spends on the unemployed and the sick. It is more than it spends on assistance to all families. It is, indeed, on the revenue side, equivalent to two-thirds of company tax revenue and 85 per cent of all sales taxes. It is more than we collect in petrol excise; and it is over three times the collection from the Medicare levy. In other words, obviously we are in for some major tax rises and expenditure cuts over the next few years if the Keating Government is to honour its promises. A more savage attack on the Budget deficit will be required than that which has ever occurred under this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the Auditor-General's report is really getting at&mdash;this is the bottom line&mdash;is, on the one hand, the gross irresponsibility that this Government has let itself be drawn into through either an inability or an unwillingness to undertake a responsible budgetary policy over recent years and, on the other hand, the grossly irresponsible election bribing that went on in the run-up to the 1993 election when the Government made well over 130 spending promises that it knows it has no hope in the world of being able to meet unless it abandons all of its tax cut proposals and the like. The coalition is certainly not going to allow this Government to get away with actions which are going to legitimise in any way the totally illegitimate and unachievable promises and commitments that it has made in the last couple of years. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5F4">Senator CALVERT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The first report which I have tabled deals with the construction of 210 dwellings at Palmerston in Darwin&mdash;70 of which will be for service personnel and their families. The balance of 140 houses will be offered for sale to private purchasers. The project will be undertaken in three stages at a net cost of $14.2 million. The committee has recommended that the project proceed as planned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee concluded that there is a need for the Defence Housing Authority to provide appropriate housing to cater for the increased Army presence in the north. The site of Palmerston is ideally located for Army personnel working at Waler Barracks. The proposed construction of facilities for the 2nd Cavalry Regiment, comprising Waler Barracks, was the subject of an inquiry and report by the committee during 1992. This proposal is therefore directly related to that development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Palmerston, which was established in 1980, is located 22 kilometres east of Darwin and currently has a population of 8,000 residents. The houses will be located in the suburb of Driver and will be built on 114 lots. The proposed development has been designed to comply with local planning guidelines. Considerable regard has therefore been given to road patterns and the provision of open space, which are reflected in the civic design concept and the landscape master plan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The houses themselves will comprise 91 detached dwellings, 58 attached courtyard dwellings and 61 medium density dwellings. Features of the designs include: elevated floors; orientation to capture maximum ventilation and louvre windows for cross-flow ventilation; cyclone proof construction; metal wall and roof cladding; solar hot water; and ceiling fans and airconditioning of the living room and main sleeping area. House sizes and the number of bedrooms in each will be provided to meet service requirements. The designs will provide for a range of floor areas, ranging from 115 square metres to 145 square metres. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I mentioned earlier, the Defence Housing Authority proposes to provide 70 dwellings for service families with the balance of 140 being offered for sale to private purchasers. At the public hearing the authority advised the committee that it may be desirable to increase this holding to 50 per cent should demand from the private sector be low. The committee was assured by the authority that it does not intend to establish an estate solely for service personnel but wishes to integrate service families into the general community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second report, which I have just tabled, involves the development of a 53.8 hectare site at Flinders View near Ipswich to improve the standard of housing for defence personnel at the nearby RAAF base Amberley. Mr Acting Deputy President, as you represent the State of Queensland, I am sure this would interest you. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Colston" NAMEID="PF4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5F4">Senator CALVERT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And others, yes. The Defence Housing Authority proposes to construct 180 dwellings, and the balance of 370 dwelling sites will be offered for sale to the public. Service and private sector housing will therefore be integrated within the proposed development. The estimated cost of the proposal is $31 million, of which $18 million will be received from the sale of building lots.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has concluded that there is a need to provide suitable dwellings for those service personnel from RAAF base Amberley who are occupying substandard houses and temporary rental accommodation in the Leichhardt and Amberley areas. The site of Flinders View is well located for a housing development for service families due to its proximity to RAAF base Amberley and existing and proposed local school, shopping and recreational facilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An urban planning concept was developed for the proposal. This aims to achieve a mixed density neighbourhood based on integrated allotment, housing and road planning design principles. Local housing precincts have been designed to have the focus of a small village reserve or landscape feature. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst the committee is generally satisfied with the planning and design of the proposed development, its report makes a number of recommendations in relation to the provision of specific features in the houses. First, the committee has recommended that the Defence Housing Authority provide all the dwellings with solar hot-water systems. This recommendation is consistent with the stand taken by the committee on previous occasions. Solar hot-water systems are a community norm, and the authority should demonstrate its commitment to energy conservation. Secondly, the committee has recommended that smoke detectors and earth leakage circuit breakers should also be installed in the houses. Again, the committee believes that the provision of these features is consistent with community expectations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report also makes a wide-ranging recommendation which involves the authority reviewing its design criteria to ensure that service housing is as energy efficient as possible. However, the committee continues to be impressed by the progress made by the DHA in improving the standard of housing provided to defence personnel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third and final report I wish to comment on concerns the proposed facilities modernisation at HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Waterhen</EMPHASIS> at Waverton, a harbourside suburb of North Sydney. HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Waterhen</EMPHASIS> is the nation's national mine warfare base. The committee has recommended that the facilities modernisation estimated at a cost of $73 million at December 1992 prices should proceed as planned. In arriving at this recommendation the committee gave careful attention to a number of matters such as the need for a modernised mine warfare base, the best location for it and the existing facilities at HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Waterhen</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that the Navy needs improved facilities from which to operate its new mine warfare vessels which are planned for introduction in December 1997. The existing facilities at HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Waterhen</EMPHASIS> would be inadequate to support the new mine hunter coastal ships. The Department of Defence examined a number of possible alternative locations, and the committee has concluded that the location of new purpose-built facilities in Sydney and at HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Waterhen</EMPHASIS> offer cost, support and operational advantages over other options examined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The number of personnel to be employed in shore facilities and attached vessels is expected to be 766. The proposed capacity of the shore element is to accommodate 377 personnel at peak levels of operation during a working week. The balance of 389 personnel will be employed in attached vessels which will deploy and return to the base on a continuing basis throughout the year. The main elements of the proposed work include a new operations and administration building, a supply and clearance diving building, a technical workshops building, waterfront and external works, a car park building and relocation works. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee's report concludes that the scope of the proposed development can be justified on the basis of the functions of HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Waterhen</EMPHASIS> and the number of vessels and support infrastructure it will be required to support. Furthermore, the report concludes that generally the proposed design and siting of facilities and other structures would not detract from the maritime character of other facilities and structures in the area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report does recommend, however, that the final design of the proposed car park will need to reflect its environmentally sensitive location, and that Defence should ensure that personnel to be employed at the redeveloped base use public transport to the maximum extent possible. The latter recommendation takes account of the views of representatives of local residents who appeared before the committee at the public hearing. I commend the reports to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA>On Saturday, 17 April this year, the Governor-General, Bill Hayden, opened the new Army facilities at Waler Barracks in the Northern Territory. On that memorable day it was a very important, symbolic and significant event. It was well presented by the Department of Defence and, indeed, the Army's role in integrating so much of its new activity in northern Australia was very well accepted by the Darwin and Palmerston communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first of the three reports that have just been tabled by Senator Calvert refers to the associated housing development at Palmerston in the Northern Territory. I welcome this report and this initiative not only because of the importance that it holds for my own electorate, the Northern Territory, but also because the Defence Housing Authority is breaking new ground in the way it operates in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the work of the Defence Housing Authority. It has taken a number of very important initiatives in the management of housing for defence personnel, and in the providing of many associated facilities. I would particularly commend the activities of the Defence Housing Authority for its good neighbourly and good neighbourhood policies of integrating into the community. This particular housing project is a very important one. The Defence Housing Authority has been developing a special relationship with the town of Palmerston which is, of course, very close to the new Waler Barracks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to the annual report for 1991-92 of the Defence Housing Authority and in particular the comments in the Managing Director's Review by the Managing Director, Mr Bill Kirkby-Jones. Under a heading of `Defence Environment', Mr Kirkby-Jones says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the past 12 months the Authority has undertaken a major housing construction and acquisition program in Darwin to meet the needs of the 2nd Cavalry Regiment which is scheduled to commence its relocation from Holsworthy in New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA>Further on his comments read:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The relocation of Service units changes the patterns of demands for housing to be provided by the Authority and to meet this changing demand expeditiously there is the need for early advice. This is not always possible since there are many other factors which may drive the timing of relocations and in consequence there is an increased requirement for the Authority to be both responsive and flexible and to consult closely with the Australian Defence Force.</PARA>
<PARA>Since its inception, the Defence Housing Authority has had a good record in the Northern Territory, particularly in the areas close to Darwin, and in concentrating on a focus in rectifying the defects of the housing which was handed over to it at Tindal near Katherine. This new and additional work is very important. I commend the Defence Housing Authority on the design of the construction that it has so far instituted. I am sure from the comments that are flowing through from this report and the evidence that has been given to the Public Works Committee that it will continue with that innovative and very special housing design. I also comment on the degree of consultation that the Defence Housing Authority has engaged in with the various planning authorities, the Ministers and the departments of the Northern Territory Government and the Northern Territory Town Planning Authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To date, the single personnel of Waler Barracks have been accommodated on site at Waler Barracks and the families have been accommodated in the nearby suburbs, particularly Palmerston. It is obvious, as a result of this report and the initiatives that are to be taken, that defence personnel will build up in Palmerston. But it is important to note that the Defence Housing Authority intends to ensure that the service families are integrated into the general community. In particular, the land and housing developments initiated by this project will ensure that that initiative continues. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just before the sitting was suspended for lunch&mdash;which seems so long ago now&mdash;Senator Newman asked a number of questions concerning tuberculosis sufferers. In particular, she asked about the undertakings they give when entering Australia. I thought I would give her a further answer to that question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Effective health measures are required to ensure that tuberculosis does not become a health issue within Australia. However, generally speaking, these rest with State governments. The Commonwealth screens intending migrants and, in appropriate circumstances, the migrant medical clearance unit issues a tuberculosis undertaking. The States are responsible for follow-up action and the Commonwealth has no data on that compliance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While our TB statistics do not indicate a rise in incidence here, a recent World Health Organisation meeting has reported an increase in TB worldwide. Every year three million people die from TB and eight million new people develop the disease. If we are to contain and control the disease in Australia as part of a worldwide effort, we must maintain our vigilance and ensure that our case finding and treatment procedures remain as effective and thorough as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I table data on the birthplaces of all people notified as having TB for 1991. With regard to the countries specifically identified by Senator Newman prior to the lunch break, the numbers are small and are as follows: Cambodia, seven; Yugoslavia, 18; and USSR, five. Given the figures that we were talking about earlier&mdash;Vietnam with 156 and China with 44, et cetera&mdash;these are very small numbers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I am concerned that there is no Commonwealth follow-up on those State responsibilities. This means that there is no proper accountability for what happens with these tuberculosis undertakings. As a result of this matter being raised, I shall ensure that a regime is put in place very quickly to do exactly that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister. I am glad he recognises that it is a serious matter. I did not think that I got very serious consideration at the estimates committee hearing the other night. I appreciate the fact the Minister is apparently not ready to brush it aside. But I take issue with some of the detail of his answer. The Minister said that the TBUs are handed to the States which then have the responsibility for follow-up action. The States may have some sort of responsibility for follow-up action, but the problem is that there is no legal basis for the document that the Commonwealth requires the migrants to sign. The documents are not enforceable. There is no way that either the Commonwealth or the States know where these people are because, although they have undertaken to report in, at the most only 40 per cent of people actually do report in. They disappear into Australia, possibly incubating TB and spreading the infection.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister's department has responsibility for public health policy in this country. Therefore, I hold his department accountable for not having previously put in place a regime whereby these undertakings are in fact enforceable. I ask the Minister: why has that not occurred?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Without having received advice as to why it has not occurred in the past, I can only assume that, in being able to give the answer that our TB statistics do not indicate a rise in incidence here, it has probably not been considered necessary. But I have acknowledged to Senator Newman that, no matter what was considered in the past, I consider it necessary. I will make sure that the regime is put in place.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister. I point out to him that, judging by the figures that were given to us the other night at estimates, there is in fact a trend upwards in the incidence of reported cases of TB in Australia. Added to that, as we receive a high proportion of our migrants from Asia and as we are surrounded by Asian countries which have an extremely high incidence of tuberculosis, I would have thought Australia would be bending over backwards to screen for TB&mdash;particularly people from Asian countries and also people from countries like the USSR and Yugoslavia which also have a high incidence&mdash;rather than requiring the Opposition to draw the Minister's attention to this problem before action is taken.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the Minister to tell me why there has been no action. It is no answer just to say that we do not have big numbers of such cases. The trend is up and we are surrounded by countries which, by world standards, have an extraordinarily high incidence of TB, and we are taking a high proportion of our migrants and refugees from those areas. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did say earlier that I do not have figures for 1992-93, so I cannot say what has happened in most recent times; when those figures come out I will make them available. Senator Newman is not correct when she says the rate of reported cases of tuberculosis is going up. In fact, since 1988 it has trended down. In 1988, there were 925 cases or 5.59 cases per 100,000 head of population per year. That dropped to 902 in 1989. It went up to 979 in 1990, and down to 903 in 1991. So with that recent trend not being up, I can only assume that the answer I gave earlier was correct, and I think those figures bear it out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nonetheless, I am acknowledging&mdash;particularly given that there are now signs of a new strain that is resistant to drugs and therefore potentially can be a big health problem, particularly for those at risk in our society&mdash;that it is necessary to put a regime in place. That of course will involve the Commonwealth and the States. It will involve not only involve my department but also immigration. I am giving an undertaking to put a regime in place as soon as possible. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister. I draw the Minister's attention&mdash;and I will not make a great thing of it now but will leave him to think about it&mdash;to the evidence given to the Senate estimates committee in which it was acknowledged that there was a small trend upwards and that the reduction in 1991, which the Minister just told us about, was treated as not particularly significant. That was evidence given by one of the Minister's officers to the Senate estimates committee and I have the passage in front of me. Perhaps the Minister had better double check his advice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I move to another issue. I understand we are screening migrants overseas by way of X-rays. I understand that is about 100 times more expensive than the Mantoux test, which in many ways is a more useful test of exposure to TB. I ask the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley) why we are not using the Mantoux test, especially in those countries that I mentioned earlier which have a particularly high incidence of TB. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for the answer. Could she explain to me why the only information I was given the other night related to these TB undertakings, which relate to a very small proportion of the people who are coming in. I understand that they are people who have had TB and have had to demonstrate that they have had treatment for it. They get a chest X-ray to show that they are clear and then sign an undertaking to say that they will report in and be monitored. There is a great number of other people&mdash;as the Minister at the table, being a doctor, would know full well&mdash;who can be incubating TB but it is not showing up at that stage in their X-ray, yet their exposure to TB will be shown up by a Mantoux test.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a larger proportion of the vulnerable people coming in with no indication at all that they have been exposed to TB. The figures that I gave the Minister in this committee earlier today show that about 50 per cent of all the notification cases in Australia from overseas born people incubate TB within the first five years that they are here. In fact, as I recall, one-quarter of them develop TB within the first two years that they are here. That was not addressed by the Minister for Health (Senator Richardson) in the precis that he gave me just now in response to all the questions I asked earlier today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact remains that the screening procedure, whichever it is, is obviously inadequate. People are getting through our system and coming into this country&mdash;at this stage, admittedly, not in enormous numbers&mdash;who, as the Minister knows, are able to spread the disease if they are not detected. We have no way of enforcing any follow-up on them at all and we do not know who they are. We clearly did not know that the majority of people who have been exposed to TB after developing it in Australia had been exposed at all. What are we going to do about that? The Minister, as a doctor, must be concerned. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe that Minister Richardson has given an undertaking on the large part of Senator Newman's question. In answer to her earlier question to me after the last answer, I do not believe it would assist at all to use a Mantoux test, which could give false positives and misleading evidence of tuberculosis where exposure had not occurred.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister. I conclude by saying that I find it extraordinary that the Commonwealth has not made it mandatory for people to obey its undertaking. In addition, it has people coming into the country who may well know the whereabouts of such people who may have been exposed to TB, but who refuse to give information to State health authorities to prevent the exposure of other people to TB, all in the name of privacy. I find that extraordinary.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot believe that this situation can be allowed to go on, especially when we are sitting in the middle of an area that is rife with TB and we are taking a large number of migrants from that area. We must have measures in place to protect Australian people from exposure to TB. In my view, it is no justification for the Commonwealth to refuse to give information to those whose duty it is to treat people with TB and to find out who their contacts have been. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When somebody with a notifiable disease comes from another country into this country and spends over two years, five years or whatever it might be here, somebody who obviously has been in contact with a lot of other people, it is absolutely imperative for the health authorities in this country to be able to trace those contacts and to get the help of the Commonwealth in doing so. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the local capital works program was introduced, there was a suggestion that 13,000 jobs would be created. Subsequently we had indications from various Ministers that they were finding it difficult to show where, for the enormous amount of money being spent, any new jobs would be created. The best we got was when it was indicated in this chamber&mdash;I think it was by Senator Bolkus&mdash;that no new jobs would be created; we would just save a few jobs that otherwise might have gone. In the estimates committee hearings Senator Richardson indicated that there would be a formal evaluation. I am wondering when that formal evaluation is likely to come and whether it will include the things I have raised. </PARA>

But in the past I have been told that is wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there is to be a full evaluation, one would hope that it would indicate the number of jobs created. The money was handed out to local authorities initially on the basis of a job creation project. I cannot believe that the Government would have gone into a job creation project without being able to measure in some way the number of jobs that it created. A little later on, the name or emphasis of the program was shifted very skilfully. It became a local capital works program which was just supposed to give out money for capital works rather than create jobs. </PARA>

According to subprogram 6.1, the National Capital Planning Authority is actually divesting itself of $35,000 which it theretofore had spent on the cleaning of six statues at the Institute of Sport. Mention is made that this expenditure is no longer in the authority's program. The $35,000 is picked up in the estimates of the Institute of Sport. So on one side it goes out and on the other side it comes in. Regardless of the accounting refinements, it really means that at some stage along the line $35,000 was allocated to clean and maintain six bronze type statues at the Institute of Sport. I have since had a look at those statues. They are about life size. To an inexperienced eye, they are quite well done. They look to be good statues.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you. The Minister has confirmed exactly what I thought: that in fact she knew all along that it was material aid spent, not dollars raised. There is a very big difference in the amount of money those charities will get as a result of that. Senator Crowley had the hide to stand up and tell me today that in fact the Government and the Prime Minister knew&mdash;the Prime Minister ought to have known when he appeared on that program with Laurie Oakes and said that it was money collected. What he should have said was that all the aid given during a specified period&mdash;money raised in the Christmas appeal and used during that specified period; spent not on administration, but on aid&mdash;would be matched by the Government dollar for dollar. That would have been a clear and unequivocal message to the public about what was going on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the Prime Minister said was not clear. What he said deceived the donors of Australia and, initially, deceived the major organisations. They were enlightened as they got further into it. They were quite surprised, let me tell you&mdash;very grateful for the money, but surprised. It also placed enormous administrative burdens on them to try to spend that money over that period of time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But that is not what the public understood. The Prime Minister and this Government deceived the Australian public. The Minister has just confirmed that by telling us that she knew all along that it was money to be spent on material aid over a specified period of time. It was not what was expressed in either of the Prime Minister's press statements or on the program with Laurie Oakes.

There was a Christmas appeal in 1992. There are officially one million people unemployed; the Minister knows that there are a lot more.

There is the same number of people, if not more, without houses and clothes&mdash;and they need more clothes&mdash;and there are appeals. The people of Australia will give to the Christmas appeal and to the winter appeal. Can the Minister tell me the difference between the situation at Christmas and the situation now, and the difference between the appeals of Christmas and now? Why will the Minister not say to me what the Government is going to give for Christmas in 1993?

We told you that we were going to take you out of the tax system by 1995 but, dear me, that was an error in our platform. We should have said five days after the election that we had something different in mind'.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After Question Time today Senator Evans asked Senator Bjelke-Petersen, who was in the chair, to refer to me the question of whether it is in order to accuse an honourable senator of telling a `monstrous untruth'. Recently honourable senators on both sides of the chamber have been guilty of accusing other senators of lying. Sometimes I have ignored this when it has occurred in interjections or at times of some disorder. My forbearance should not be taken as condoning the use of such terms.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on later to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Interjections such as `Why don't you tell the truth?' are therefore also disorderly.</PARA>
<PARA>There is another statement by the President on 14 December 1992 which is fairly long and I will not try to precis it here. The rule which I adopt, and which I think in general the President would adopt, is probably summed up by saying that it is sometimes suggested that it is not disorderly to use offensive words against groups of members of either House as distinct from individually named members, but there is no basis for this suggestion in the rules of the Senate. On the contrary, offensive words against a group of members of either House may be regarded as a worse offence than directing such words to an individual member. In making those comments, I refer to rulings made by President Givens on 7 December 1916 and by President Sibraa on 10 December 1991. It was under those circumstances that I made the ruling that I did. </PARA>

Perhaps for her edification, I wish to say that for many years councils have given discounts of their own volition and paid for them out of their own budgets.

The Government has provided some money until 30 June 1993, but the councils do not want to give the discounts and they will refuse to do so unless they can be guaranteed that someone will pay for that discount starting 1 July 1994. </PARA>

If the States are to provide it, I suspect some of them would be interested to learn that they have to fund it because they are not getting the money from anywhere else. Some of the States are saying that they do not have too much money these days either. I assume from that&mdash;the Minister gave me an assurance earlier&mdash;that the Commonwealth will somehow provide moneys, whether it be to the States to pass on to local government or whether it be straight to local government, so that local governments can give those discounts with the certainty that they will be compensated. </PARA>

I have received an answer to that and I must say to the Minister that it would have to be one of the most outrageous answers ever delivered in this Parliament. The answer as to why that log of claims cannot be delivered to this Parliament&mdash;and it should be a public document; I must remind the Minister that we in this Parliament are the custodians of the public purse and must be accountable to the taxpayers for the payment of salaries and wages&mdash;is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Unions have advised that the matters they have raised for negotiation under workplace bargaining have been provided "in confidence" to the Department pending the outcome of negotiations, and accordingly should not be released.</PARA>
<PARA>I have to say here quite clearly and precisely that, if the Government accepts that direction&mdash;and I presume it is from the Public Service Union&mdash;that the log of claims is not available for public scrutiny and that it is not to be released, the document should be sent straight back to the union involved.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would just like to take that up with the Minister for the Arts and Administrative Services (Senator McMullan). The Minister has said this is not a government document. This is a letter that has been written by the unions with demands in it. It was pointed out in the estimates hearing by Mr Mellors that the list was 19 to 22 items. To quote from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>:</PARA></TALK.START>

For the Minister to come in here and flick it out by saying, `This is not a government document', surely the Government has some responsibility to the shareholders, who are the taxpayers of Australia, to let this chamber know of the demands on the Government, because inevitably the taxpayer is going to pay the bill, whatever that might be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does raise some other concerns that I have. In years gone by, if a log of claims had been made to the Government, it would have been before the then Arbitration Commission, if it was seen to be a dispute, and that would have been known to everyone. One of the things that is said about enterprise bargaining is, `In going to enterprise bargaining, we can reach agreements at each individual workplace'. It concerns me that it is now taking away the accountability. There is nothing wrong with enterprise bargaining per se. In fact, it is an area where everyone would agree this Labor Party has stolen the Liberal Party's coat. But if claims are to be made&mdash;call them what you like; it is really a log of claims under an enterprise bargaining system&mdash;and if the Government is to come in here saying, `We are not going to tell you what those claims are', then I think there is something very wrong with the accountability or the lack of accountability that is emerging. </PARA>

In relation to performance pay cash bonuses, one can point to documents which have been available in the public arena but they have virtually received no attention and no press.

When the deal is struck with the public service unions, am I right in saying that it will be registered with the AIRC but that body will not have a role in arbitrating on the agreement or in ensuring that the agreement is fully in line with the public interest? Perhaps the Minister could address the more general comments and then give me a specific answer to that question. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will reply in general and deal with the specifics of Senator Kemp's question so far as I can do so. There is talk about secret deals being done. There are two problems with that assertion and in resolving them I will deal with Senator Kemp's question. First, no deal has been done&mdash;somebody has written to us. A lot of people write to the Government and say that they would like us to do this, that or the other. Often we do not do it; sometimes we do; and sometimes we negotiate with them about what it is that we will do. So there is no deal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, as Senator Kemp correctly says, if an agreement is reached&mdash;I assume that at some stage one will be&mdash;it cannot be a secret deal because it has to be registered with the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. If Senator Kemp wants to talk in more detail to DIR about the role of the industrial relations commission in dealing with section 134 agreements, I will be happy to deal with it then on the basis of the advice from the responsible department when we come to dealing with its additional appropriations. It is a legitimate question but is not particularly relevant here. I do not have detailed advice available to me on that. I am happy to get it.

I must also say, without endeavouring to defy your comments at all, that there has been some rhetorical discussion because of the unreasonable stance adopted by the Minister. In answer to the previous question, the Minister said that because it was from the union letter of demand, it was a union document. But surely once that letter was addressed&mdash;I presume to the appropriate Minister, but I could not be certain to whom it was actually addressed&mdash;the ownership of that letter and the demands contained within it became more than the property of the union; they also became the property of those to whom the letter was addressed.

Subsequently, on Friday, 21 May 1993, the Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, Senator John Coates, arranged for the committee to meet with officers of the Australian Taxation Office to respond to the technical issues associated with the administration of taxation law in Australia. Unlike the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> report of the Senate estimates committee hearings, the proceedings of the committee are not distributed as a Senate <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> but are limited in their distribution in an A4-type format. Therefore, I ask that listeners to this broadcast and readers of the Senate <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> who have an interest in these issues contact the Secretary of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, Mr Peter Hamburger, to obtain a copy of the proceedings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The limitation of the distribution of the answers from the various Senate estimates committees obviously limits the benefits of these inquiries in their new format.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We note that in the past the ATO has stated that it will abide by the answers given in the Senate estimates committee hearings&mdash;the Senate estimates hearings have a certain status&mdash;particularly those answers which are responses to questions on notice.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was always my intention that the hearing of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration should in every way have no less weight or significance than those of the estimates committees. I have confirmed that the Tax Office regards them as of equal weight. I was not aware of the problem with the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. I did not pick up all the details of it. Perhaps we can discuss it on another occasion. I would not wish it to have any less status in that regard than the estimates committees.

Some of the same issues would be dealt with by rulings, but my first reaction is that I do not think we would want to generalise about that.

The point that the Minister did not address concerns the limited distribution of the committee proceedings and the transcript. They are available from the secretariat so they are available only on request, whereas all members who subscribe to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> automatically get the Senate estimates transcripts. It is really a question of dissemination of information to a wider section of the audience than just those people who perhaps pay for a particular service through the reporting service of this Parliament.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand that before I came into the chamber my colleague Senator Parer asked some questions of Senator McMullan concerning the allegations that I made&mdash;which have since been substantiated&mdash;about fraud with regard to computer theft and a scam whereby two Australian Tax Office officers had set up a company to supply computers to the department by pretending that officers' existing hardware was defunct, taking that perfectly serviceable equipment and selling it through an outlet, and pocketing those profits as well as taking the proceeds of selling in new equipment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the estimates committee hearings, I said to the tax officers that I would be prepared to give them additional information so that they could identify whether or not they had, in fact, been investigating this matter themselves. My information was that they had already found the scoundrels, if you like. But it did seem to me that the matter was not proceeding in a timely way, as this occurred back in July and August of last year and here it is May of this year and still there has been no prosecution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Nolan did in fact come to see me. I declined to give him the name of the officer, which I still have in my files. I declined to give it to him on this basis: outside the chamber there is no privilege in operation and if I gave the name to him I would be defaming that individual, because I would be publishing his name. On that basis I did not give the name to Mr Nolan. Of course, I could do it here in this chamber tonight, but I do not intend to do that either. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I do want to see an appropriate outcome of this matter; it is a scandal. In the information provided in volume 2 there is an estimate that some $15,000 worth of new terminals were provided through this scam. It provides me with no details of the value of the terminals taken and sold through the outlet which, as I said, was in Double Bay. I understand that those computers, or the hardware sold, were of the Apple Macintosh variety and that they were not on the assets register. I have had no satisfactory answer as to why they were not on the assets register; neither have I had any satisfactory answer as to why the matter has not proceeded in a more timely way to the DPP for prosecution. In the information provided it is said that they are still in the process of preparing the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I simply do not think that is sufficiently timely. Although Mr Nolan said to me that he suspected I would take some credit for bringing this to attention and getting the matter resolved, I can only say that if it had been dealt with properly and expeditiously and charges had in fact been laid, disciplinary action taken and the officer stood aside, then we might be seeing some sort of justice. What we are seeing is one rule for some people and another rule for others. We saw it in terms of those officers who use credit cards in an illegal way as was pointed out by the Auditor-General. They were not penalised or in any way dealt with other than to be patted on the hand and given a little counselling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have thought that perhaps Neil Pickard, who found his use of credit cards spread across the front pages of newspapers, would have thought that counselling might have been in order there too. We cannot have one rule for one and another rule for others. In this country we have the rule of law and we say the same set of principles must apply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this case of computer fraud I want to know precisely the dates that these people were apprehended thieving&mdash;and the word is theft&mdash;those terminals from the Australian Taxation Office, which means from the taxpayer. What date were they found to be doing this? Why has it taken so long for the file to be prepared and sent to the DPP? Why has the matter been so slow to progress? It simply is not good enough when ordinary Australians are suffering and being pressured to see that there is one rule for some and another rule for others. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last few days I have had come to see me a number of people, taxpayers, who have gone through all the proper procedures and to the trouble of having private rulings made concerning undertakings of a business nature that they wished to set up. In some of these cases, it was to deal with providing for education of children&mdash;a laudable aim I would have thought in a country that wishes to be the clever country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The private ruling was given, the modus operandi approved, money spent on the part of the taxpaying organisations to establish organisations in accordance with the private ruling&mdash;and 12 months later what happened? There was a reversal of the private ruling. All the money that had been spent to provide a facility for educating children was rendered useless. The money that has been spent has been wasted, and all this at the whim of the Australian Taxation Office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We hear around the traps the reason for the ATO reversing its ruling. It is a wonderful one: `We are a bit worried', said the tax officers, `that too many folk might get in on the act.'  Then the people who have been subjected to this arbitrary behaviour look at the remedies they may pursue either through the AAT or through the courts. Do honourable senators know what they hear back, what the scuttlebutt is? If they deign or dare to take action&mdash;to uphold the rights that they might otherwise have had&mdash;it may invite retaliatory action from the ATO for all of their undertakings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not good enough. The Australian Taxation Office is seen as a body which retaliates, which wastes taxpayers' money. It can spend a million dollars in one year for its staff to have a nice time getting to know each other, yet ordinary taxpayers, who are trying to provide for themselves, for their families or organisations to which they belong, not only are penalised at the whim of the Tax Office but they are also threatened with being retaliated against if they pursue their lawful remedies. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In contradistinction to what the Minister for the Arts and Administrative Services (Senator McMullan) has just said, I draw his attention to one time-out, one get-together, conveniently timed for 13 to 19 December 1992. Somebody might be forgiven for thinking that was a Christmas party. It was held at the Holiday Inn, Coogee, and 22 people attended. The function cost $28,018. In addition to that, the cost of consultants amounted to $21,000 and TA amounted to $8,285. The total cost of that little Christmas get-together was $57,000. I wonder whether the taxpayer enjoyed that. I wonder whether those ordinary Australians who could not afford to buy Christmas presents for their kids enjoyed the fact that the taxpayer was paying for a time-out to the tune of $57,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When people in the private sector get together&mdash;I will be addressing a conference like this tomorrow&mdash;they pay their own bills; they pay their own way. We are saying that it is impossible for the Australian Taxation Office to have meetings together unless the taxpayer foots the bill to the tune of something in the vicinity of $57,000 for 22 people. Any one of these examples could be gleaned; they seem to take place about every two months. Any private sector organisation that was pruning its management and pruning its cost expenditure would simply not have these meetings occurring at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will have to look at the whole question of the way the public sector uses the so-called training levy and the way the system is abused and perhaps refer it to one of the suitable committees to look into it in detail.

Earlier the Minister said that small sums in the region of $20 were not taken into consideration when calculating FBT. Seeing that those figures given in the Auditor-General's report ranged from $14 to $1,660, do I take it that those activities that I have just mentioned&mdash;horse riding, dance seminars and golf lessons&mdash;would have attracted FBT?</PARA>

The question concerned the assessability for fringe benefits tax of outplacement services provided by employers. Many of us are very concerned that the provision of a number of these sorts of services can attract fringe benefits tax. In times of recession, it seems to be an unfortunate extension of fringe benefits tax law where certain assistance provided by the employer to a departing employee is certainly needed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the response should really come from the Minister to ensure that, as well as counselling and retraining to enable employees to undertake alternative work, there is the provision of other office services to enable retrenched staff to organise interviews and have resumes typed. Training in interview techniques and the preparation of resumes, which are the sorts of things that a responsible employer should do for his retrenched and departing employees, unfortunately now attract fringe benefits tax. </PARA>

Perhaps they were trying to make big men of themselves by shouting someone in the department or by buying someone an expensive present.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, why was section 64A of the Audit Act, which is very specific about abuse of this kind, not brought into play? As pointed out in the estimates committee hearings and, I think, in the Auditor-General's report, the Auditor-General did not clear these people, but it seemed that the Tax Office itself said that this was not a deliberate breach of rules and that no budget holder sought personal gain from any of the expenditure. Irrespective of that, it was an improper use of a credit card and was clearly in breach of section 64A of the Audit Act. So why was that not pursued?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think Senator Parer in the main has answered his own question, although I do have some things to add in response to the specific matters he has raised. Senator Parer has given a fairly clear exposition of why it was that these officers were considered to have misused the cards&mdash;not to have acted criminally; that is not what has been found&mdash;and to have acted improperly in misusing these cards; that is, that the officers used those cards not for personal gain but for things beyond the purposes for which they were authorised to use the cards. They should not have done so, and that is why the use of those cards has been found to constitute a misuse.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to why the Auditor-General was required to come along and discern these problems rather than the department itself picking them up is not something that I can answer with hindsight. It is certainly something that I think the office would want to, and should, take up in its own internal audit function&mdash;I do not know if they are quite the right words&mdash;or in its own internal operations. If its officers have not already done so before tonight, I am sure they will in response to this evening, although I suspect that they have already done so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I say, we need to get this in perspective. These people acted unwisely and sometimes too enthusiastically in what they saw as the interests of the efficient conduct of the Commonwealth's business. But that does not justify their behaviour. They misused these cards and they should not have done so. But they were not doing it for their own advantage; they thought this was the way to get the best outcome in the circumstances. I do not in any way condone people's misuse of these cards or their acting outside the guidelines for proper use or outside the Audit Act, et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the constraints of working within the public sector is that there are fixed rules to protect the taxpayers' money, and we all have to work in accordance with them.

We all have to operate accordingly. I am not trying in any way to say that this is not a matter that should properly be given the attention of the Auditor-General or the estimates committee. I am just trying to put it in perspective. I do not have much more to add. I think Senator Panizza and Senator Parer have essentially outlined the arguments, and I will let the case stand there. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have just one final question. I refer in the attachments to the answer given by the department to what is called `Australian Government Credit Card Guidelines'. It is Commissioner's Direction No. 14 of 11 March 1991, so it goes back some time. I think it is worth quoting from this document in a situation where clear directions are given and are then not pursued. People, quite rightly, expect integrity and principle from all government departments, particularly the Australian Taxation Office which must be perceived by the public to be, like Caesar's wife, totally beyond reproach. In part, that Commissioner's Direction on page 162 states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the card is issued to you on trust&mdash;trust that it will be used properly and strict care will be taken of it. Abuse of that trust will result in swift punitive measures being taken. When the AGCC is issued you will be required to acknowledge in writing that you understand&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise `acknowledge in writing that you understand'&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">-strict care over custody and use of the AGCC will be taken at all times;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">-the AGCC is to be used only for official purposes;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">-misuse of the card (eg unauthorised purchases, whether or not restitution is made) will result in charges being brought under s64 of the Audit Act (which provides for imprisonment or fine if found guilty) and an immediate recommendation for dismissal under the Public Service Act. People charged under s64 of the Audit Act will be suspended immediately; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">-loss or theft of the AGCC must be reported immediately.</PARA>
<PARA>That is just a final point. I am raising this matter because the Taxation Office is so strict in the implementation of rulings and on the interpretation of the taxation law. Yet, when it breaches the law, it says, `Well, this really was not for any personal gain&mdash;although they did buy chocolates, go for horse rides and hire a boat'. The Taxation Office is able to absolve itself. The point I raised earlier with Senator McMullan is that, irrespective of the fact that some excuse was given, there was clearly a breach. It seems that the Taxation Office is not prepared to actually abide by its own directions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a number of questions to raise which follow on from the reservation I made which, in turn, arose from the questions and answers I received during the Estimates Committee D hearings. A number of issues have emerged in relation to this whole scheme of performance based cash bonuses to the senior levels of the Public Service. We have already had a number of debates in this chamber on this issue and Senator Childs has had a chance to contribute to this debate also.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the concerns can be summarised in this manner. First, there was the surprising agreement struck between the Government and the ACTU initially on this matter. That is a matter of history. It was before the election, and it was an agreement which allowed significant cash bonuses to members of the senior officer service and the SES and more limited rises to those at the lower levels of the Public Service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am aware of the stated reasons for these rises. However, whereas the ACTU was able to endorse rises to senior public servants, the ACTU, presumably with the Government's concurrence, was willing to defer rises promised during the election period. Under the accord mark 7, I think it was, senior public servants would become eligible for an $8 a week increase after 1 July&mdash;which, ironically, was the same date at which members of the senior executive service were becoming eligible for cash bonuses of up to $15,000. That is the first aspect on which there has been considerable debate, involving both the timing of these pay rises and the subsequent election promise and the breaking of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point that has come up in relation to the way this whole issue of performance based pay is actually working out is whether it is working out in a manner which will add to the effectiveness and efficiency of the Public Service and fulfilling its own objectives, or whether we are seeing just another way to deliver a pay rise to senior officers as distinct from encouraging, at least according to the theory, a more effective Public Service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third part of the debate relates to what impact this will have overall on both public sector wage movements and wage movements in the wider community. We have had that debate before, but there is a feeling around that the Public Service, under the guidance of Mr Keating and Mr Kelty, is becoming the wages pacesetter, as we saw in the period of the Whitlam Government, which senior Ministers in that period such as Mr Cameron believed was not only bad policy but also bad for the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to get clear in my mind some issues which have emerged. I would like the Minister to assist me with this and I see that officers from his department are present for this debate. A number of public servants have pointed out to me what they see as the practices of their own departments or sections of departments and agencies in granting a single across-the-board pay rise, whether it be at level 4 or level 3. The point has been made to me&mdash;I do not know whether this is correct&mdash;that, for example, everyone in the DPP's office received a performance based pay rise at the level of the so-called level 4, which I understand is described as being of superior performance. My attention has been drawn to an article by Jack Waterford in which he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some agencies have found the process rather daunting. One agency is known to have graded all of its staff four. At Finance, two in every three officers got something; in some Customs areas, it is understood, everyone got something.</PARA>
<PARA>Every day different public servants indicate to me what is happening in their own area and ask whether it is within the philosophy of performance based pay rises that whole agencies or departments should be granted exactly the same performance pay cash bonus. Whereas we can say that everyone has a superior performance or everyone is fully effective, the fact of the matter is when we get past more than a handful of people that is a most unlikely outturn. I would be interested to see whether the Government has any view as to whether an agency deciding it is all too hard and giving everybody a level 4 cash bonus is in line with the philosophy of performance based cash bonuses which the Government has outlined. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not have much to add to my previous response. The officers indicate they are not aware of any examples of where that course of action has been undertaken. Although it would not necessarily be the case, I imagine that they would be aware. If a decision were made to pay people without having made the necessary individual assessments, that would seem to me not to be in accordance with the guidelines as set down. It is a bit hypothetical, as I said before. It may well be that in a small agency an assessment could turn out an extraordinary result. But it would not be in accordance with the guidelines if it were not based on individual assessments, because that is what drives the system. I have nothing further to add.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for that. In the coming months, particularly as the SES officers become entitled to their cash bonuses&mdash;these are the glittering prizes; up to $15,000&mdash;I suggest it will become a matter of community interest and debate. Certainly, as the results of the first rounds come in, there will be a heightened level of public interest to see just how agencies are adapting to the use of performance based cash bonuses, or pay rises as they are more commonly known.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sorry that the Minister could not give me a clear answer. I understand that he is hedging on this, and I understand the reasons why he is doing that, but I put it to him that commonsense would indicate that, where substantial numbers of officers all receive the same performance based pay rise in the same department, that is going to be seen as really another way to give a wage rise. I think that will lead to further debate and concerns in the Public Service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The topic of the next question I would like to put to the Minister was touched on in a number of conversations I have had with public servants. An officer assessed at level 3, for example, gets a cash bonus if he or she is fully effective. Commonsense would indicate that an officer who is fully effective is probably doing his or her job. Senator Burns nods in approval. Therefore, it seems to me an odd thing to be saying to those people, `If you are fully effective you will get a cash bonus for doing your job'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, I ask the Minister to ask his officers, in their assessment of the first round of the performance pay cash bonuses for the Senior Executive Service, whether this concern has been expressed to them; that is, that it is an odd thing to be giving a person a cash bonus for doing the job which he or she was originally employed to do when he or she appears to be doing it in a fully and effective manner. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think that answers my question. I guess that people who are interested in this topic will judge the hesitation of the Minister and the fact that on this particular issue he is not being his usual forthright self. Last night and this morning there was an interesting and in some ways a very productive debate with the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) in relation to the Department of Foreign Affairs in which Senator Evans recognised&mdash;I think that I am being fair to him&mdash;that clashing principles are involved on this issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the one hand, there is a desire to maintain privacy about people's performance and any cash bonuses flowing from that and, on the other hand, there is a recognition that the payment of cash bonuses to unnamed officers, decided by their superior officers, who are also unnamed, could lead to undesirable consequences. Putting it as nicely as one can, it could lead to the favouritism of certain officers at the expense of other officers; putting it somewhat harshly, it could lead to the problem of corruption that was expressed in the debate this morning. Senator Evans recognised this dilemma and said that he would be raising the issue in writing with the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). Senator Evans did not make a judgment on the issue, but he recognised that there was a problem. Maybe this is a matter which should be reviewed to see whether the Government should address these concerns. </PARA>

The answer which came back on that matter was that when the campaign was planned in January 1993 the sum of $750,000 was allocated to be spent on print advertising. The answer went on to say&mdash;and this is the part that confused me&mdash;that, although no final placement schedule has been decided, advertisements would have appeared in almost all newspapers of each State, including the ethnic press.

We would wind up spending more on assessing the program than on carrying it out, which does not seem to be cost-effective. If some objective measurement such as research has been carried out, I will make it available. I think it has probably not been done, because with such a small campaign it would be unlikely that we would do such a thing.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Tambling for his contribution. As he has acknowledged, the questions have been answered to the best of the ability of the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner). The Minister has asked me, on his behalf, to read this response into the record. I hope that it will be satisfactory to Senator Tambling. Where I use the personal pronoun `I', it refers to the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The statement reads as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certain issues of concern have been raised in the Senate Additional Estimates process by Senator Tambling regarding the operation of the Northern Land Council and some associated issues. I would emphasise that I have reached no final conclusion on the accuracy, substance or otherwise of Senator Tambling's concerns. In the interests of my continuing commitment to open and accountable government, however, I have decided to take the steps outlined below. It is in the interests of Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory, including the staff and councillors of the Northern Land Council, that urgent action be taken to clarify concerns and, where appropriate, to remedy any deficiencies and shortcomings. In summary, I propose to take the following action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First, I wrote on 3 May 1993 to the Auditor-General after receiving representations from Senator Tambling on certain allegations made to him. In that letter, I sought the Auditor-General's views as to whether further investigations were warranted. Although I have not yet received a reply to that correspondence, I have determined nevertheless to formally request the Auditor-General to undertake an investigation of the matters raised by Senator Tambling and will ask the Auditor-General to put forward suggestions for any improvements in the NLC's administrative systems and management structure as a matter of priority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, I propose to direct that the Northern Land Council, under section 37 of the Act, henceforth submit its annual reports in the format used by the Central Land Council for its annual reports. This will include the requirement to identify all consultancy agreements entered into by the NLC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, I have determined to withdraw my delegation to the state manager of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission's Northern Territory office to approve payments under section 64(7) of the Act for land council administrative costs. That delegation will henceforth only be exercised by the chief executive officer of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, who will advise me in each case when the delegation is exercised. This is not to be taken as any criticism of the state manager in the Northern Territory, who has always authorised payments strictly in accordance with the requirements set out in section 64(7).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fourthly, after obtaining the agreement of the chairperson of ATSIC, Ms Lois O'Donoghue CBE, AM, I am prepared to release to Senator Tambling a confidential draft report prepared by the Office of Evaluation and Audit on the Aboriginal benefit trust account on the express undertaking that the report is a draft and its contents confidential for a period of two weeks to allow responses to be prepared by ATSIC to the report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would emphasise that the final draft version of the report was only made available to the director of the OEA on 13 May 1993, and the OEA has not yet had the opportunity to obtain responses to the report's recommendations. The draft was only provided to my office late yesterday afternoon and I have not as yet had the opportunity to read the document myself. I have consistently stressed that issues of public accountability are non-negotiable. It is my strong view that it is in the interests of the NLC that Senator Tambling's concerns be investigated.</PARA>
<PARA>I hope that that constitutes a pretty comprehensive response by the Minister to Senator Tambling. It might be possible under those circumstances for us to be detained no longer on this matter tonight. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans), and I thank the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) for the very positive and constructive response that he has given. As I have mentioned, this issue goes back to the September estimates of last year and the unsatisfactory responses by the Northern Land Council in the manner in which it has prepared and provided information to the Senate committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was very pleased today when Mr Tickner initiated the phone calls to me as he had obviously appreciated the concerns I expressed and the issues I raised at the Senate estimates on 10 May and the very great concern of many Aboriginal people regarding this particular matter. I am very pleased that the Minister has now initiated a full inquiry by the Auditor-General into all of the issues that have previously been referred to him and all of the issues that I raised last September, with the Minister in the interim, on 10 May and subsequent to that. I am very pleased that the Auditor-General has been given this specific brief. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I trust that when the reports come forward we will also be acquainted with the Auditor-General's comments relating specifically to a number of very important issues&mdash;in particular, the administration of the royalty trust accounts that are currently administered by the Northern Land Council. Whilst a number of the questions and answers that have been tabled here today are provided by the Northern Land Council, they are totally inadequate with regard to the degree of the problem that has been represented to me by Aboriginal constituents, particularly with regard to the administration of those royalty trusts. The trusts themselves attract millions and millions of dollars in any particular year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst one of the answers, I noted, implied that the funds did not flow out of the royalty trust and into the administration account of the Northern Land Council itself, it has been submitted to me by Aboriginal constituents that in fact many disbursements are paid from the royalty trust accounts on account of</PARA>
<PARA>expenses that would more appropriately be described as administrative costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope the Auditor-General's inquiry will reveal whether or not the proper minuting of all of those royalty trust accounts takes place, whether their administration is strictly in accordance with what would apply to the trust accounts of any solicitor or any person acting in trust, and whether all disbursements from those royalty trust accounts can in fact be properly acquitted to the proper owners of those funds, who are the Aboriginal traditional owners and many other Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory. I am very pleased at the action and the response the Minister has initiated. I am only sorry that it has taken so long. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the report that was mentioned, the Walter and Turnbull report into the Aboriginal Benefits Trust Account, I accept the offer of the Minister to make it available to me on a confidential basis for the next two weeks and for it then to be made publicly available through the Senate estimates committee, together with the responses from both ATSIC and the Aboriginal Benefits Trust Account. It is terribly important that this degree of accountability flow forward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are several other issues that I would briefly comment on that arise from the many questions that were tabled today. As I said, I am basically happy with the answers that have been provided by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission and I will pursue a number of those issues privately with the commission where further action is needed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the answers that have come forward today from the Northern Land Council, it is interesting to note the dates on which they were prepared and the dates on which they were sent. One can always ascertain this, of course, from the dates on the top of the facsimile. I note that the major set of answers, which were forwarded under a letter dated 19 May, was dispatched through a directorate fax of 25 May at 12.34. Subsequently to other representations that I and ATSIC made during the day, further information was provided, again on a facsimile response, dated 25 May at 18.22. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of issues that still concern me that I will refer specifically to the Auditor-General for his detailed inquiry. A couple that I draw to the Minister's attention relate to the fringe benefits tax arrangements for staff members of both the Northern Land Council and the Central Land Council. The Northern Land Council answers identify that some 18 staff currently enjoy employment packages that attract significant fringe benefits tax exemptions. I notice in an earlier answer through ATSIC that the Central Land Council has a total of 17 staff enjoying these exemptions. That is a matter that I have drawn very specifically to Mr Tickner's attention, and I hope that his response in that area will also now be accelerated for earlier consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the principal issues that concerns me in the Northern Land Council's response relates to the personal use of the Northern Land Council as the private bank of the chairman of that commission, Mr Galarrwuy Yunupingu. I asked a number of questions with regard to Mr Yunupingu's personal indebtedness for book-up funds&mdash;funds that he had, in effect, put on account at the Northern Land Council. My initial question requested information as to whether or not these personal debts were in the order of $25,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I asked that question on 10 May. The answer that was first provided said that the chairman was indebted as at 10 May in respect of advances made by the land council, but that the advance had been repaid and the chairman was no longer indebted to the land council. So between 10 May and today, a fortnight later, obviously he has been given the opportunity to remedy this situation. No account has been offered as to the levels of indebtedness. However, in one of the subsequent questions that has turned up with regard to the second dispatch this afternoon from the Central Land Council&mdash;and earlier this morning I sought additional information in this regard&mdash;a table of indebtedness was prepared as a supplementary answer for amounts owing as at 25 May 1993 for both financial years 1992-93 and 1991-92. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that at the end of the 1991-92 year Mr Yunupingu as chairman had an outstanding debt of $4,466, but that does not appear in the answer to the question for the period dated 25 May 1993. What was the level of indebtedness of the chairman? Is this just another rort where the Northern Land Council has been used as a personal bank? At some stage during the year did the sum exceed $25,000? What were the conditions? Was any interest paid? Were any disclosures made to the board or to other appropriate levels? I accept that some of the other people who owe a minor amount are indebted in respect of expenses such as accommodation allowances. That is understandable in the answer, but obviously once again the Northern Land Council has attempted to camouflage the type of answer that it gives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, I note a response to a question about whether or not guidelines of the Public Service apply equally to the Northern Land Council's granting of consultancies. The issues that were outstanding from last September, where it took some four or five months to solicit replies, related to over $1.2 million worth of consultancies. The answer that came in this morning was that the council enters into consultancy arrangements in accordance with its powers under section 27 of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 and that Public Service guidelines do not apply to the land council. It said that the very nature of the council dictates that consultants required by the council have to have particular qualifications, experience and background. It also said that before offering any consultancies, all aspects relevant to the consultancy are closely considered and include, as a matter of course, `obvious matters of propriety'. What waffle! What consideration of Sir Humphrey!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is patently obvious that the Northern Land Council has not set out, as it should have with that answer, the guidelines and the principles that it does adopt; the disclosures that it makes of the consultancy matters, particularly as to the engagement of family of other staff members or of council people themselves directly, to ensure that there are not accusations of nepotism or inappropriate engagement of consultants in this particular area. Very specifically, I hope that this is a matter to which the Auditor-General will give very close attention. I would have thought that the Northern Land Council in the conduct of its business would not have come up with such pious statements as these. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are, of course, many other issues that I am sure have been revealed in these questions and answers that will interest not only the media who have taken a particular interest in this matter, but the Aboriginal constituency generally across northern Australia. This is a matter of controversy within the Aboriginal community. I am very pleased now to note the Minister's action&mdash;even though it has had to be pulled out like a tooth at a dentist's&mdash;to change it. But the fact that there is now a major inquiry by the Auditor-General into the operations of the Northern Land Council I think vindicates the action of this Senate when earlier this week it postponed the consideration of these estimates. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for the promptitude with which the matter has been addressed this afternoon. I wish to clarify the matter a little further because I think it can be quite easily resolved. From the content of the answer given to me, I understand that the arrangements in relation to inspection of imported second-hand farm machinery are handled by the Customs Service with the consent of AQIS. The answer also states that AQIS has no objection to the importer being present when the goods are unpacked. The problem is not with AQIS, it would appear, but with the importer. At the time of the hearing I did draw to the Minister's attention a number of rather strange conditions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps it will be possible for AQIS to give an undertaking to instruct the contractor that it should not prevent people from being present when goods are unpacked for inspection. That would solve the problem. So that there can be no misunderstanding as to the difficulties that are being experienced, perhaps I might just briefly detain the Senate to read into <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> just a few portions of a double-page set of standard conditions. These show the severity of the conditions being imposed by the contractors on the importers which would appear to be unknown to AQIS. For example, at clause 6, which is amongst the 21 conditions that are placed on the customer by the contractor under what are called `standard trading conditions of contract', the document reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All goods are stored and/or carried and all services are performed at the sole risk of the customer. Interport shall not be liable either directly or vicariously for any loss whatsoever, howsoever and by whom it may be caused and wherever it arises whether in contract, quasi-contract or for negligence, inadvertence, breach of statutory duty or any other tort or torts or as a carrier bailee or otherwise.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Without in any way limiting the generality of the foregoing Interport shall in no way be liable for any loss arising from or contributed to by Acts of God, acts of the Queen's enemies, civil commotion, strikes, lockouts, shortages of labour, burglary, warehouse breaking, larceny, theft, pillage, stealing, fraud, malicious damage . . . fire explosion, water, lightning, tempest, rain, earthquake, exposure, flooding from any source, moth, damp, heat, sweat, mould, mildew, decay, deterioration, vermin, rats, mice, insects, leakage, inherent vice in any goods, deviation in route, mode or place of storage, wear, tear, loss of market, loss of profits, negligent advice, rust, oxidation or any other cause whatsoever. This paragraph shall apply whether the loss is due to the goods being stored and/or carried with those of another person or persons or otherwise.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a fairly wide and comprehensive denial of any liability at all. The document contains clauses like the following:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The customer shall be deemed to authorize any deviation from the usual route or manner of carriage of goods which may in the absolute discretion of Interport be deemed reasonable or necessary to the circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA>That is notwithstanding the fact that clause 3 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Interport is not a common carrier. . . </PARA>
<PARA>Clause 15 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Interport does not warrant or admit the accuracy of any of the matters contained in its Receipts for Goods lodged for storage and/or carriage or other documents, or the accuracy of weights, measurements, qualities, quantities, gauges, strengths or values endorsed on the Receipts for Goods lodged for storage and/or carriage or other document.</PARA>
<PARA>The best one is clause 21 which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Insofar as it is possible to do so, all statutes and by-laws which might impose liability on Interport are hereby excluded.</PARA>
<PARA>Again, I find that to be a rather extraordinary clause. I will conclude my comments by seeking some confirmation from the Minister. It does appear that the conditions of contract required by the contractor are extremely onerous. Perhaps the Minister would give an undertaking that AQIS and/or Customs will raise this matter with the contractor and ensure that people are allowed to inspect the goods and, in that way, we can get some progress. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;First of all, I formally table that answer. I understand that is a procedural necessity which I have not complied with. Senator O'Chee has asked that AQIS give an undertaking that it will in effect ensure that no steps are taken to prohibit the presence of the importer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difficulty that AQIS has in giving that undertaking has nothing to do with the policy issue involved, because, as it has already said, it has no objection whatsoever to the importer's presence. The difficulty is that AQIS is not really in a legal relationship with the freight handling contractor, Interport, such as to make it possible for it to give such a direction. The contractual relationship was between the freight handling company, Interport, and the shipping company. There is a difficulty that AQIS wants to take on notice about how to get over that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think there is any difficulty about communicating a clear position on the matter at issue and that will certainly be done. There is just a worry about whether or not we can formally undertake to direct it or ensure that it does certain things when AQIS is not in any legal position to do that. I hope Senator O'Chee will appreciate that difficulty and perhaps allow some further course of consultation to take place as to how that result which is agreed might best be achieved. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have just one question that we did not deal with this morning. During the estimates committee hearing I asked questions about the cost savings that had been introduced through the changes in AQIS, particularly the cost of AQIS's services to its users or producers. We were told that the cost savings had been absorbed by virtue of the fact that the charge has been changed to 100 per cent for the users of the service. I note that, in an answer given by Minister Crean on 13 May to a question in the House of Representatives, it is anticipated over the next year or two there will be an additional $20 million in expenditure savings or even maybe more. Is it anticipated that those cost savings, or a portion of those savings, will be passed on to the industry? May we have some sort of indication of what the Government anticipates the impact will be in cost to inspection services.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0X4">Senator SPINDLER</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Victoria)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP> (12.21 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;Tonight I wish to address the final report of the Democrats' Independent Parliamentary Inquiry into Tariffs and Industry Development. To produce this report, the inquiry took evidence from 129 witnesses in capital cities across Australia and in Victoria's regional centres and received 127 written submissions. I intended to ask for leave to formally table this report in the Senate. However, I have been informed that although the Government is prepared to grant leave, the Opposition will refuse to do so on the ground that I have used the term `parliamentary' in front of the word `inquiry'. It seems rather churlish and, in many ways, it continues the position that the Opposition adopted when it voted against my original motion to have a tariff inquiry established by the Senate. In other words, it simply did not want to know the facts. It still does not want to know the facts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I received advice from the Clerk of the Senate that it was `well within the scope of your duties as a member of the Senate to conduct such an inquiry'. I believe that that entitles me to use the adjective `parliamentary', because I am conducting that inquiry as a parliamentarian. To use that technical subterfuge to now refuse me the option of formally tabling the report in the Senate is a reprehensible action for which the Opposition will be judged. As it is, I will be making the report available to all members of the Senate as well as to members of the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to some of the substance of the report. It is the result of an eight-month inquiry into the effects of current tariff and industry development policies and the action needed to increase Australia's industrial capacity to provide employment for its workers and to achieve a reduction in its foreign debt. The inquiry was initiated, as I have said before, as an independent parliamentary inquiry when both the Labor Government and the Liberal Opposition refused to support a Senate inquiry. The urgent need to find out what was going on in the real world was underlined&mdash;even then&mdash;by the mounting anecdotal evidence that the speed, timing and extent of tariff cuts was decimating Australian industries and that the policy had been largely replaced by reliance on free market forces on a mythical level playing field. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I repeat that the Clerk of the Senate confirmed that an individual senator could initiate and run an independent parliamentary inquiry. I am grateful for the support from industry associations, unions and individual enterprises which enabled me to fund additional staff and other costs not covered by parliamentary entitlements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The evidence from a wide cross-section of industry associations, unions, individual enterprises, community organisations and research analysts established a direct and substantial link between tariff cuts and the abolition of quotas and the steep increase of imports and consequent job losses. The continuing tragic trend was confirmed a fortnight ago with the worst trade deficit in three years and a further 100,000 Australians giving up hope of even finding a job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is difficult to find a basis for this macho `smashing of tariff walls'&mdash;a quote from the Prime Minister (Mr Keating)&mdash;which makes no sense in economic or human terms. Certainly there is general agreement that we should neither maintain nor return to the uniformly high protection of the 1950s or 1960s and that we must develop industries able to compete on international markets. What is at issue is the timing, speed and extent of cuts in the protection and the stubborn refusal to modify them on a selective basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The disastrous social and economic consequences are clear: record unemployment and a record foreign debt for this and future generations. Yet there is little, if any, causal connection between the demolition of Australia's existing manufacturing industries and primary producers and the desirable development of an export culture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Evidence before the inquiry shows that the largely semi-skilled workers retrenched from the textile, clothing and footwear industry and from the manufacturers clustered around the car industry are not being retrained for the industries of the future. In turn, factory owners do not establish high-tech new industries; they go bankrupt, relocate offshore or become importers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The development of export industries depends on innovation and product quality, available venture capital, export incentives and high levels of education, research and management to supply the yeast for this export culture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For existing industries and primary producers the central question is whether consumers are prepared to keep paying prices which enable industries to continue or to phase out at a speed which minimises social costs. Alternatively, they could buy cheaper imports but ultimately pay higher taxes to fund unemployment and other social benefits and to cover lost tax revenue and watch the sale of Australian public and private assets and the continuing loss of economic sovereignty to finance the mounting foreign debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is likely that Australians would have enough of both moral backbone and commonsense to choose moderate, strategically selective and slowly reducing protection over the current scorched earth policy. Unfortunately, Australians will not be given that chance until the community and ultimately the Government recognise the continuing damage done by current policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most frustrating aspect of the Government's intransigence is that Australia has gone much further than other countries to facilitate imports. Thus, we are now the only country with significant TCF and car industries to have abolished all quota restraints. Nor do we use the wide range of non-tariff measures employed by other countries, for instance, by the European Community which applies so-called NTMs to 243 Australian export items. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, Australia does not use the emergency measures available under GATT's article 12&mdash;in the case of balance of payments difficulties&mdash;or article 19 when specific industries are under threat from a surge in imports. Many products now carry tariffs below GATT's `binding' requirements and thus could be increased by a stroke of a pen when the need arises as, for instance, in the current example of orange juice which is landed here from Brazil at a third of our production cost and where the United States protects its growers to the tune of 40 per cent against ours at 15 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As if all this were not enough, we disadvantage Australian producers, manufacturers and workers by poor labelling and inspection provisions which allow inferior products to be sold as Australian product and use anti-dumping procedures which appear to protect importers rather than Australian producers. The Prime Minister would not have had to establish a task force to find solutions to the problem of long-term unemployment had he accepted the key recommendations of the Australian Democrats' tariff inquiry some 12 months ago. The main inquiry recommendations are a 12-month pause in tariff cuts and a selective use of protection and other interventionist measures to stem imports and boost exports on an industry by industry basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If he had pursued these policies during the last 12 months, or even during the eight months of the inquiry, some 200,000 jobless Australians would still be in work. Even if he were to institute these measures now, Australia would be able to avert the gloomy future of rising unemployment, which, paradoxically, will get worse as the economy improves, as the April balance of trade and import figures have shown. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Garnaut proposal to free up trade with China would make it easier to sell Australian wool. That is desirable, but it is the death knell for Australian textile manufacturers and the end of jobs for at least another 50,000 workers. The question must be asked: why should the protection excess of the 1950s and 1960s produce total paralysis in trade and industry policy when confronted with a selective and targeted use of tariffs and quotas as and when the need arises in particular industries which other countries are pursuing?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not surprising that there was one bewildering question that neither the inquiry nor the witnesses before it could answer: why does the Australian Government pursue policies which destroy Australian jobs, devastate Australian industries and increase our foreign debt while other countries are busily tilting the playing field to protect their workers and their industries?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I wish to record my sincere thanks to inquiry secretary and research consultant, Ms Lesley Vick, who made the wheels turn; Mr Ernest Rodeck, the National President of the Institute of Management, who provided valuable guidance as executive secretary; Mr Brian Harrison, the honorary accountant of the inquiry; my staff members, Beverley Irving and Stephen Merrylees, who cheerfully accepted the inevitable additional workload; and all the witnesses and contributors who provided the content for this urgent message to Australia's policy makers. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following the rejection of his proposed Senate Select Committee on Tariffs, Senator Spindler obtained advice from the Clerk of the Senate that it would be "well within the scope of your duties as a member of the Senate" for Senator Spindler to use his parliamentary facilities to conduct an inquiry into tariffs.</PARA>
