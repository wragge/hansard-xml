<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We all know what will happen. The government will get the numbers for the gag. After the Mabo legislation is passed, the government, the Democrats and the Greens will agree it is time to go home. What is the Leader of the Government in the Senate shaking his head for? He does this at the end of every session. The government will get the numbers for the gag. The gag will be put on and a vitally important issue to the veterans of Australia will not be properly dealt with by this chamber. It is just another application of the mismanagement of the process. What a nerve the Leader of the Government has to stand up and say that that will be dealt with sensibly after the Mabo debate. He does not seem to understand that Christmas is just about here. His crowd does not want to come back next week. When will it be debated? The government is not worried about the workers or the veterans.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. All the government is worried about is its fragile consensus for the Mabo legislation. It is looking more fragile every day. That is the big worry. I think the veterans legislation ought to be dealt with first. I cannot see any reason why it should not be. The Mabo debate can go for a long time. There are over 200 amendments. It is very complex and very difficult.</PARA></TALK.START>

We have a normal week's work for the Senate to go. I know and Senator Evans knows that the only way the veterans legislation will be properly dealt with is if it is dealt with now.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government has been confident before and been wrong. It was confident in relation to some regulations on advice from the Solicitor-General, I think it was. It was confident on the advertisement bans that it was right, and it was clearly wrong. It was confident on the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 3). The government's own members of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs agreed that there was sufficient risk that the government was wrong and that we ought not to proceed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason that I intend to pursue this matter is that the question of whether the government can do this&mdash;adopt, through statute, the common law and cover the field under section 109 and thereby lock out the states&mdash;is one of the fundamental constitutional issues surrounding this bill. If the minister's flippant `we're confident we're right' in fact turns out to be wrong, the government loses. Then the Democrats, the Greens and all the people who are agreeing to the processes of this place and who are simply being simply trodden on for the purpose of getting this bill through, come to nothing because the government got bad advice. Is the minister honestly saying that, in relation to such an important bill and an obvious question of doubt that would be raised as to constitutional validity, he has not bothered to get any written advice? Is that what he is saying?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was not a rhetorical question&mdash;not rhetorical at all. Section 109 may well go to the constitutional validity of this entire bill. For the minister to be saying, `Look, do not worry about it; I have got it right', when his record and his government's record of getting it wrong is so lengthy, is almost breathtaking in its arrogance&mdash;for which of course he is well known. Perhaps we could just come back to the issue. We do not intend to leave it just because the minister thinks it is okay. Incidentally, the amendment he refers to is not available from the clerks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are questions as to the operation of state law, the extent to which state law survives. The government may have been dealing with it incorrectly&mdash;in fact, I am quite sure it was by this amendment. But for the minister to say, `Oh, well, we will deal with it later', the government might pull off that amendment and then we will not be able to have the debate, not only as to whether the government can adopt the common law and, through section 109, block out the states but, in doing that, what the consequences are, for example, for the laws of general application. The minister says it is dealt with in some other way, but I have just been given a note saying the amendment he refers to is not available from the clerks. Government members are the ones who say that we should get our act together and that this is all quite simple. Why do they not get their act together? We will proceed with the debate in an orderly fashion when they have. </PARA>

It is not the intent of the Commonwealth native title legislation to cut across those.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, from time to time, there are instances where state laws of general application impinge upon the exercise of some possible area of native title&mdash;perhaps hunting, gathering or fishing entitlements&mdash;and do so in a way which would operate to prohibit the enjoyment of the native title right but in circumstances where the native title right could be enjoyed without in turn, as a practical matter, inhibiting the effectiveness of the law of general application. It is a matter of steering a course through this and trying to identify some circumstances where it would be appropriate for the native title to be able to be exercised notwithstanding state and territory laws of general application&mdash;whether they be laws relating to conservation, commercial fishery, gun licences or hunting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what the 196A exercise is all about. I think honourable senators can see that from the terms of amendment No. 33 in the Greens' list.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand why Senator Gareth Evans looks so embarrassed this morning. I also understand why he has withdrawn the amendment and wants to deal with it later. The original amendment was trying in effect to amend the constitution by legislation, which Senator Evans cannot do and knows he cannot do. He is desperately trying to get some time for people to go away and try to find some way to retain the application of state laws without having to amend the constitution. He cannot do it. Let me tell him why not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Gareth Evans says that the common law shall have the force of a law of the Commonwealth, thereby lifting the words from section 109. That should fail for uncertainty because the common law is unknown in its entirety; it is not written down, as he full well knows. By using that form of words, he is attempting to exclude the operation of all state acts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me give him an example. It is one that has been given to me and is a very good example. Hunting and gathering rights of Aboriginal people include the following: the method of hunting can be to set fire to the bushland so that the animals can run out and be killed. There are laws of the state which prevent and outlaw setting fire to the bush, for very good reasons. If this prevails, the state law banning setting fire to the bushland would be an invalid law, because Senator Evans's legislation purports to cover the field and it would be struck down. So there would be an apartheid situation where one section of Australia is subject to one set of laws and those subject to Aboriginal and native title would be subject to an entirely separate application of laws. It would be true apartheid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one takes into account that Senator Evans has withdrawn the amendment knowing full well that he cannot then say that we are going to change the constitution in its application, he knows that that amendment would fail. Senator Evans can take all the time he likes to try to come up with a solution to that problem, but he will fail. That is why he has failed to answer Senate Vanstone's question as to where the written advice on these highly complex constitutional points is, so that the people of Australia can listen to fair and reasoned debate. Where is the written advice? Senate Vanstone deserves an answer just as I deserve an answer to my question: is the reason why Senator Evans has withdrawn the amendment that he knows it is effectively trying to amend the constitution, and he may not do that?</PARA>

Could he indicate what written legal advice he has with respect to clause 11. He may not have sought advice as to whether the Commonwealth can use section 109 and, by statute, adopt the common law to lock out the states.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, it is not a matter of restating a statute law; it is a matter of overtly recognising that common law can be picked up in appropriate context. If there is otherwise a head of power to support the legislation in question, then one way of defining a subject area of Commonwealth law is to do so by reference to the common law on that subject. That has the effect of giving the federal courts the jurisdiction to deal with the common law area in question in a way that might not otherwise be possible, unless they were expressly vested with that jurisdiction by statutory provision of this kind. So there is no doubt that there is ample precedent over the course of this century for that being done from time to time.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Bishop, please. I understand that Mr Orr from the Attorney-General's Department wrote a letter to the Senate committee addressing this issue in response to a query giving some examples of this kind. We simply do not believe that there is any constitutional problem involved in picking up by reference, as it were, a body of law in this way and making it part of the Commonwealth law. The only constitutional question then becomes the general constitutional question that underlies the whole legislation and that is the extent to which the race power does in fact allow the native title issue to be addressed by Commonwealth legislation. As we have said on numerous occasions, we do not believe that there is any doubt at all about that. So really that is where it stands.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the treatment of this in the amendments, we do not think that this issue is best addressed, on reflection, at this stage of the legislation. It is better addressed by a specific provision later. The provision that is flagged in this respect is proposed new section 196A, and that will have the effect that I indicated previously. Perhaps we can address larger questions of the co-existence of state laws general application with this legislation in that context when we have something specific to bite upon, rather than just a general clause here which does not deal explicitly with this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Might I say further that, as the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) indicated in his second reading speech, the whole question of the applicability of state and territory laws of general application to areas of native title really does need some extensive review on a case by case basis. I do not think that it would be appropriate to try to legislate to cover the whole spectrum of such potential conflict in its resolution in legislation of this kind. It may, however, be appropriate&mdash;and this is what we will try to do with 196A on a cooperative basis&mdash;to identify some relatively limited areas where it would be appropriate to identify those areas where native title can be exercised, notwithstanding the existence of a state law of general application. I am trying to respond in as detailed and constructive way as I can to legitimate queries, but I think that that is as much as I can sensibly say at this stage.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me say a couple more things for the record about this. As to the question of whether there are any statutory precedents for a clause of this general kind, giving the common law of Australia in respect of some subject matter the force of law of the Commonwealth, as I indicated, there are quite a number of precedents. Let me just give two that my advisers have quickly pulled out in the last few minutes. Section 80 of the Judiciary Act 1903&mdash;going right back to the beginning of the century&mdash;states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So far as the laws of the Commonwealth are not applicable or so far as their provisions are insufficient to carry them into effect, or to provide adequate remedies or punishment, the common law in Australia as modified by the Constitution and by the statute law in force in the State or Territory in which the Court in which the jurisdiction has exercised is held shall, so far as it is applicable and not inconsistent with the Constitution and the laws of the Commonwealth, govern all Courts exercising federal jurisdiction in the exercise of their jurisdiction in civil and criminal matters.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a general lifting up of that applicable body of common law and making it part of the law of the Commonwealth so far as the exercise of federal jurisdiction by these Commonwealth courts being created by this proposed act is concerned. Another example is section 4 of the Crimes Act 1914, as subsequently amended, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The principles of the common law with respect to criminal liability shall, subject to this Act, apply in relation to offences against this Act.</PARA>
<PARA>We could hardly find a much more general provision than that lifting up a whole body of common law and giving it the force and effect of Commonwealth statute law for the purposes of the exercise of a particular area of Commonwealth authority. So that is a sufficient answer to the point that has been raised about the apparent oddity or novelty of clause 11 in that respect. It is not novel; there is a body of Commonwealth precedent to support it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one is looking for an academic analysis of these sorts of issues and the received body of wisdom on these matters, one can see that page 691 of the second edition of Pat Lane's book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Australian Federal System</EMPHASIS>&mdash;an authority much quoted in years gone by in various contexts by the opposition; Professor Lane is certainly a very respectable constitutional lawyer&mdash;addresses quite succinctly in half a page of discussion just this kind of point. I will not seek to incorporate it in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> or read it to the committee. The point I am trying to make, for constitutional support of this kind of provision, is that there is a body of accepted law understanding about this sort of thing which does not require such formal advice to be given for us to be confident of our capacity to pass laws of this kind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Chamarette asked me about the reason for this date being as it is. The operative effect of this whole legislation in terms of Commonwealth machinery, Commonwealth rules and, to some extent, Commonwealth overriding provisions is only intended, in effect, to have operation from 1 July this year. We always want to minimise the retrospective impact of legislation. But there are very good reasons, which have been previously debated, for having various provisions of this legislation in force and in effect from that date. We do not think any additional substantive purpose would have been served by purporting to extend this back earlier to 1992, although I can understand the point that Senator Chamarette is making about the significance of the 1992 date when the Mabo decision came down. The provisions of the bill, once enacted, will only have bite from 1 July onwards. That is why the date is expressed in these terms. </PARA>

Whether a court will apply a covering the field test in order to determine incompatibility between a Commonwealth law and a state law on the same subject matter or whether it will employ a line by line inconsistency test is a matter about which there was a degree of uncertainty until we got to the Grzauskas case and the Metwally case. That was part of the evolving body of law as to the way in which section 109 inconsistency issues would be determined by the court. I think, with the knowledge of that case law behind us, the draftsmen can be a bit more confident about the way in which they draft these provisions and a bit more confident in understanding how the High Court is likely to react in applying inconsistency tests for the future.

If that is the case, and even picking up the minister's point about how the law continues to evolve and the fact that the government would hope that it would reach a position of certainty, there have been a number of examples in recent years of the High Court standing conventional wisdom on its head and suddenly finding that section 92 does not mean what 150 cases before it had said it meant.</PARA></TALK.START>

The High Court in Mabo said that freehold extinguished native title. But is it not correct that in Pareroultja v. Tickner the Full Court of the Federal Court said that that was not necessarily so? The minister's very point about the common law evolving means that no-one can say what the common law is at any point in time. That is the magic of the common law&mdash;that it evolves, and that any single judge&mdash;whether it is Denning, Dixon or anyone else&mdash;is capable of suddenly giving a different interpretation, going a little bit further and doing what the government's activist High Court seems to do for a living.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I do contest is the first part of what Senator Alston said when he tried to develop some fairly extraordinary scenario that the law of Western Australia, as interpreted by the courts under the Western Australian legislation, was somehow becoming, by this means, the law of the Commonwealth.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whatever comparability there may be between common law native title and the new form of statutory title invented and put in place by the Western Australian parliament, it is not the same thing. The Western Australian legislation in terms refers to the creation of a new statutory right to replace the common law right. Any interpretation of that new statutory right is, by definition, the interpretation of a different body of law from the one it is replacing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There may well be some persuasive utility about court decisions that relate to the new statutory title. They may have some comparability, some persuasive applicability to the jurisprudence as it evolves elsewhere about Commonwealth native title.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to endorse the remarks made by Senator Bishop and expand on one point. As we know, the common law is not comprised of the words of any particular judge or judgment. It is very much an uncertain doctrine of law. There are two matters that trouble me. This provision runs together in an impermissible manner the judicial and legislative power in taking the decisions of courts and converting them into legislation upon their being handed down. When the minister addresses the question put by Senator Bishop, I wonder whether he could address this query as well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In effect, this provision says that the common law shall apply, and the common law operates on precedent and the decisions of judges. It then says that whatever the judges say is law. That is not the way this country ticks. We are elected, as are members in the other place, to represent the people of Australia. We make laws in accordance with the mandate given to us by the people of Australia in an election. The judges of this country are not elected by the people of Australia to make laws. But this is what this provision would be doing. It would say, `Whatever the judges say in relation to common law, that is the law'. So that even if, tomorrow, the judges said, `We were wrong. Mabo was wrong. We are taking away native title', that is what it would do. It would divest native title straight away because what the judges say is law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what clause 11 is doing. It is disgraceful for a number of reasons. Firstly, it cuts clearly across the democratic process of this country and the basic principle that the parliament is the legislator and the parliament is ultimately responsible for the making of laws. Secondly, it leaves the way open for judicial legislation of the most rampant form so that rights may be conferred by judges or rights may be taken away by judges. I ask the minister to comment on that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also ask the minister to comment on the concept of state laws failing for inconsistency with Commonwealth law. The Commonwealth law is saying that there is this body of uncertain doctrine which is defined by judges and any state law which conflicts with it is out of order. How can the minister say that when we have a certain state law on one side and an uncertain body of law on the other side? The common law, as we have said and the minister has admitted, is not a certain doctrine; it is not definitive. It is a doctrine which has been developed over hundreds of years by courts and by precedents. Therefore, I would like the minister to explain that aspect of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to clause 7, bringing me to my third point, I said yesterday that the phrase `capable of operating concurrently with this act' is a vague one. If we have a state piece of legislation dealing with bushfires and the maintenance of fire breaks, then on any freehold title or leasehold title there is an obligation to maintain fire breaks around that property. This clause says that common law will be a Commonwealth law and it will operate retrospectively; then we look to common law and we see that there is paramountcy of native title. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Bishop's point is a very good one because that then makes any state law subservient because the making of fire breaks would impair native title on that land. It would require the imposition of the making of these breaks&mdash;the grading and construction of them. I put it to the minister that that would be an impairment of native title. That would be a general state law which was not capable of operating concurrently with this piece of legislation. </PARA>

<PARA>Can the bushfires legislation of Western Australia, for example, operate concurrently with this act? There is nothing in this bill to assist us in coming to that conclusion or arriving at a decision. It is completely vague. It will only encourage litigation because people will be going off to court saying, `Can the state force these native titleholders to construct fire breaks? Can the state have legislation which demands the native titleholders abide by certain requirements of health or environment. Can the State Energy Commission build a power line across a part of the native title land?'. Those are the questions I am asking. They are all there for a public purpose.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As to the question of there being a common law of the Commonwealth which exists quite independently of any interpretation of Commonwealth statutes or other evolution of Commonwealth law of that kind, this is an old issue that has been debated for as long as I can remember. I suppose the majority view is that there are probably some areas&mdash;for example, frauds committed by public office holders in certain circumstances&mdash;which are not presently governed by specific statutory provision but in relation to which the common law would be regarded as being applicable if situations ever arose. That is one example that is given. The notion of entirely judge-made law having a status as law of the Commonwealth, other than laws of the Commonwealth which have some statutory foundation, probably has some precedent and some existence other than in this context.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the business of laws capable of operating concurrently, of course it is the case that most other forms of proprietary right in this country do not in any way immunise the proprietary right holder from the application of laws of general application, be they about health, conservation, bushfire protection or anything else. That is exactly as it should be. I would think it inconceivable that in the case of bushfire protection legislation and things of this kind, which manifestly involve some overriding public interest, any court could construe clause 7 in such a way as to say that that kind of law was not capable of operating concurrently with native title. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I said about 25 minutes ago that I am perfectly happy to defer it. Senator Bishop asked to defer it and I say we are happy to defer it until then, but the opposition keeps on pursuing issues and gets very grumpy if I seek to defer. I am trying to respond to as many of the issues that are raised now in the hope that we will not simply repeat all this later. It is reasonable to debate these issues in the context of a particular clause which addresses them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that the only kind of context which has any real practical area of concern at the moment tends to be in that hunting, gathering, fishing area where there are a number of laws of general application which would operate absolutely to ban or prohibit fishing rights, hunting rights or whatever. For example, there are those areas of the law which create commercial fisheries and have a licensing system and one can only fish pursuant to a licence and everyone else is absolutely prohibited. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the South Coast abalone fishermen of New South Wales is a good example of this sort of area because some local Aboriginal people have been prosecuted for seeking to gather abalone for essentially personal family domestic use, not in the purported exercise so far as a native title right is concerned, but it may arise in the future that this does acquire a recognised native title character. Then we would have a square conflict between an absolute prohibition of any kind of abalone fishing combined with a legitimate native title claim to do a little bit of fishing and gathering on a small scale which would not intrude upon the commercial fishery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that kind of dilemma it seems to me that perhaps we can right now give some kind of statutory guidance as to how that issue might be resolved. I hope the clause is about to be circulated, but it is a long way before we get to it. This will address that kind of issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) frankly acknowledged, there are a number of issues that will arise across a number of different areas which do require some thoughtful review of the present applicability of some of these laws of general application. One simply cannot anticipate, as Senator Bishop quite rightly says, all the situations that might arise in future. But it will be some time before we are going to have the processes of determination of native title worked through with proper definition of what the nature and extent of a particular native title right might be in areas that might give rise to these sorts of concerns. So there is a reasonable time for this kind of process of more thoughtful review to take place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the meantime, we simply do not believe that it is remotely likely that courts would act as irrationally as has been suggested in striking down the applicability of obvious laws of public interest relating to health, bushfire protection or whatever, and the language of clause 7 is deliberately designed to give them encouragement not to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the kind of answer I would give it, but if the opposition wants to defer further consideration of this until we get to proposed section 196A, I am perfectly happy to do that. The opposition has asked me to do that. Senator Chamarette has indicated that she is willing to do that and Senator Kernot has indicated that. Perhaps we ought to do just that.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This matter is going to be deferred until later in the day so that we can get the amendments which the minister has kept saying are coming, coming, coming. But there are a couple of points he and the Green senators might like to bear in mind. What has been raised here is the completely novel aspect of proposed section 11.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No-one denies that there are other Commonwealth statutes that purport in some way to pick up the common law. But what we do say is that this is a completely novel clause in the sense that it uses the wording of section 109 and says that the common law has the force of law of the Commonwealth. In other words, the government is quite clearly trying to cover the field completely under section 109 and block out the applicability of any state laws that might otherwise apply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the next breath the minister says, `We are not knocking out anything that could operate concurrently' which is a somewhat inconsistent statement. If he wants to cover the field, he wants to say, `The Commonwealth has the right to make these laws&mdash;all of them, full stop', rather than, `The states have some sort of concurrent power'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Covering the field locks out the states. What we want is an example, which we have not yet been provided with, of where the Commonwealth has purported to cover the field by simply a one-line clause adopting common law. That is the first point we want an answer to. All of the rantings and ravings of the minister have not yet given us that answer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point we want an answer to is whether the minister thinks the proposal in any event could be held to be valid as opposed to void for uncertainty. The common law of native title is not like the common law relating to, for example, unconscionable conduct that we might use in the Trade Practices Act or some other recognised and well-developed body of common law. This is completely new. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Alston gave an example of where the High Court said one thing in Mabo No. 2 and then in a couple of Federal Court cases the Federal Court said, `Well, it might have appeared as though they said that, but they did not mean that'. We have a very uncertain body of law and we want minister's response to the allegation that this should be void for uncertainty. It is no satisfaction to have the minister saying, `We are all pretty sure this is all okay'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am frankly amazed that, with the complexity of the arguments being raised&mdash;not those raised here today, but those raised by senior, well-respected constitutional lawyers&mdash;the Commonwealth basically says, `We haven't got any advice because we don't need it; we are right'. There is a very long list of examples where, by rushing, we have got it wrong and seen later that we have to get it right. Two come to mind from this year that we have had to redo. One was the bankruptcy law and another was the copyright law. Everyone was sure they were right there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third point I make does not relate to the substance of the clause in itself. It relates to the schedule put before us, A to U, the manageable schedule according to the government. The government says that if we follow it and go through it seriatim, everything would be okay. We are only up to D&mdash;we have all the way down to U to go&mdash;and this is the second time the government has not been ready to deal with matters as they should be dealt with, the second time we have had to have a deferral. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not deny that deferrals are a better way to go, but I am saying that, since this is the second time so early in the debate, yet again it raises the question that what we should be doing is deferring this bill until 1 February. This is going to happen again and again as we go through this bill because the minister is simply not ready to answer the detail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We agree to the deferral of consideration of laws of general application until we come to the proposed section 33 amendment of Senator Chamarette&mdash;we are happy to do that&mdash;but this second deferral, so early on in the debate, ought to be advice to the minister that he should defer the whole bill until 1 February and get it right the first time. So early in the debate, yet again, he is not ready to proceed. </PARA>

It simply wants a bill passed, come what may, no matter what, by Christmas time because it can see the fragile consensus for this legislation in Australia crumbling before it. That is not good legislative practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result, the government has already had to acknowledge that its amendments are deficient. It has already had to send the draftsmen away to redraft those amendments. We do not know when the amendments will come into this chamber. We do not know what state the amendments will be in. What opportunity will the chamber have for any sort of independent legal analysis of the amendments that are yet to be produced? What does Senator Evans say? He says, `They will come up in due course. Don't worry about that. With cooperation something will be got through by the end of the night'. </PARA>

The government should have known that as of yesterday. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday, the government had done the deal within the family&mdash;the Democrats, Greens, Labor Party alliance&mdash;that we would go on sitting today.

But thereafter, if the Senate is to be sensible, it will say that we will now take the matter away, think about it, work on these amendments sensibly during January, take proper legal advice and come back here and debate the bill and conclude the bill in February in a way that can produce the best quality outcome.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;So far as the validation is concerned, things that are in the Commonwealth domain would be, for example, offshore fishing and offshore interests which are not within the state territorial waters. Another example would be Commonwealth grants of interests over what has been hitherto defence land or land specifically vested in the Commonwealth that we deal with in some way.

The states have the power to do everything else. The states have the residual powers; the Commonwealth only has those that are vested in it. I do not think even in the most adventurist, centralist spirit one could find a head of power on which to hang a Commonwealth capacity at large&mdash;and that is what we are talking about&mdash;to make grants of mining interests, pastoral interests and all the rest of it in areas of purely state territorial responsibility. </PARA>

It is rather to anticipate the possibility that there may be some such invalid grants and to correct them immediately, at the beginning, at the threshold, as soon as possible, by a stroke of the legislative pen, as it were.

There is no real question mark about the capacity of the occupant to go on exercising the occupancy and engaging in the economic interests and questions so far as past valid leases are concerned. The only residual question mark is whether there is some residual native title right that might bounce back to life once the interest is exhausted or something of that kind, and that is a matter that is left to be tested. </PARA>

By this validation process the government is providing a much more definite and sweeping extinguishment of native title than that which was provided for in the Mabo decision, because that depended on the nature of the grant as to intention and how it operated adversely to native title.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In view of the answer given by the minister, I would like to place my view on the record in relation to these two clauses. I started out by referring to a statement by Simon Crean on 2 February 1993 at the ABARE conference, where he stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In October last year, the government in responding to the High Court decision on native title, made it clear that existing grants of interest in relation to property will continue, and it is wrong to see the High Court's decision in terms of existing land holders losing their land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We remain committed to this principle and the Commonwealth, in cooperation with the states, would, if necessary, act to ensure that the rights of existing land holders are protected.</PARA>
<PARA>That was a principle espoused to reassure people and ensure that existing land titles and interests would be protected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I understand it from the minister, whilst past invalid acts are now validated, and thereby extinguish native title&mdash;I can appreciate how that works&mdash;we still have the problem with valid acts not enjoying the same status. If one was the beneficiary of a past act and wanted to extinguish native title, one would be better off arguing that it was an invalid act so that it would then be validated and extinguish native title completely. However, if one had a valid act, one would be in a lesser position because, as stated by the minister, it may be that there has to be a testing as to what effect past valid acts actually have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have the rather curious position where a past invalid act can enjoy more benefit at law than a past valid act. I just find that inappropriate and it needs clarification. For those who are interested in maintaining native title, these two clauses actually roll back the High Court's decision in Mabo because they say that past invalid acts are now validated and extinguish native title completely, whereas the High Court, as I understood it, said in Mabo that native title is only extinguished with these past acts if there was a clear intention to do so and the act was adverse or contrary to the exercise of native title. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In effect, I see a downside for Aboriginal Australians, pastoral leaseholders and mining leaseholders because I think that those that have a valid act do not enjoy as strong a position as those that were the subject of an invalid act. On the other side of the coin, those who wish to claim native title might not be in as strong a position as they would under the decision of Mabo in the High Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Until I am convinced otherwise and it can be demonstrated accordingly, I believe that these two clauses taken together are detrimental to two areas of interest which, on the face of it, would be at odds with each other. It is strange that we have provisions like this which do not really seem to help anyone. For that reason, I am opposed to them.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just to reinforce the point&mdash;and I am indebted to my adviser for confusing me on the matter&mdash;`valid' includes `having full force and effect', which is what I was saying.

If the terms or the legal nature of the pastoral lease is to give one exclusive occupancy, it means just that: one can exclude other people. If the terms of the mining lease are such as to enable one again to have exclusive physical occupancy and do other sorts of things, one can do all those things and exclude other people, whatever the notional continuing existence of a non-extinguished native title might prove to be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only context in which it really becomes relevant to determine whether or not native title has been wholly or partly extinguished by the grant of the interest in question is when that interest comes up for renewal or extension, or something of that kind.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If, when the interests come up for renewal or whatever, there is an existing native title, under those circumstances there are rights of negotiation and all the rest of the things that are associated with native title.

It is because of the need to introduce some certainty about that that we have proposed later on the amendment to clause 24, which is controversial for various reasons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But let us leave the debate about renewals and extensions and all the rest of it till later. If those opposite are just asking about why we have not got in the legislation more explicit provision defining exactly what the status in detail of valid interests are, vis-a-vis native title, it is because it is not necessary to do so. The very nature of a valid interest is such as to mean that it has its own full force and effect. One just reads it in terms of the legal character of the interest in question. It only matters as an issue when one gets to renewals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps that has explained a little more clearly why the legislation is silent on validity generally.

I do not want to get into it now, but that was also one of the possibilities&mdash;that the government was going to insert this fiction into its amendment to clause 24. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That certainly does not seem to be consistent with the undertakings given by Mr Crean at ABARE, and by Mr Keating and Mr Lee when they met with industry representatives in April. That is why I am just a little perplexed. It is not just the issue of the prior valid grants of interest in land; it is also the issue, of course, of the fiction which is applied to the status of native title at certain future dates, for example, when one considers the renewal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apparently, Senator Evans is coming back and I am sure he will be listening with bated breath to these important comments. But the point is this: it is wrong to say that this bill preserves the status quo. It is wrong to say that this bill, in consequential clause 18, seeks to give effect to the High Court decision when what it does, in fact, is vary it quite dramatically because it creates a fiction about the exact status of native title rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one creates that fiction, it causes all sorts of consequential legal problems because of the inconsistency of the deemed status of native title with the interests of other people. For example, in clause 213(4), the bill says that, when there is a renewal of certain leasehold interests and native title exists, one should consider the native titleholders to be freeholders. If the native titleholders merely have a right to walk across a bit of land, that is really just an easement in the anybody else's language. But here it is native title and then it is deemed, for the purposes of considering certain future acts, to be equivalent to a freeholder's rights in the land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is just inconsistent. It is certainly inconsistent with the High Court decision and it is certainly inconsistent with the undertakings that have been given to industry. I would seek an explanation as to exactly why that is the case because, to us, it certainly does not seem to be terribly fair, and it certainly does not seem as though the government is giving effect to all of the undertakings it has given to people along the way. It just took us so long in the committee hearings to unearth these problems, and it has taken us almost as long to make the point. But I am very glad to see that Senator Evans is back, and I am sure he will be able to give us a much more succinct answer.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the case of pastoral leases which were validly granted, there will be no extinguishment of native title.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the short point is that the reasonable working assumption from just about everyone who has read the High Court judgments and understands the issues is that pastoral leases, validly granted, do produce an extinguishment. If someone wanted to spend the resources in order to test that particular issue, I suppose, sobeit.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have already made the point that there is no particular reason why anyone prior to a renewal or extension situation would want to establish once and for all whether actual extinguishment had occurred because there is no downside risk involved to the pastoralist in non-extinguishment. The pastoralist has rights to fully and effectively enjoy all the rights, all the interests, that are associated with that valid lease. I repeat, if there is an exclusive occupancy associated with that, that means the capacity to exclude people completely from the land in question. So there is no interest that is likely to be served, except by some ideologically minded pastoralist, I suppose, who wanted to test the thing for the sheer hell of it or to make a point or to make himself feel better. </PARA>

The situation with the Court legislation is that it is absolutely clear that the reservations have existed under statute law in the Land Act since 1934 and as a condition of the lease, I believe, almost continuously since Lord Forrest was the Premier of Western Australia or even before that. There seems to me, from the answer that has just been given, to be an enormous inconsistency with what the minister is saying.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to raise the same point that Senator Crane raised. We require clarification of the intention of this bill. One of the stated aims of this legislation is to preserve native title to the maximum extent possible. Yet many provisions in this bill do the opposite and in fact restrict native title more than the High Court ruling does. I believe that this is one of those principles.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The exception the Greens take to this bill is that it extends that legitimate premise that leases should be validated to the extent that there is any question.

That is the appropriate way to deal with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that if people who have native title rights are able by this law to have those rights extinguished, possibly before they even realise they have them, then there is something fatally flawed in the bill. If the position the minister has been placing before us is, `It is all right because they have statutory or equity rights in their present usage&mdash;they will be protected; they will not be allowed to be thrown off a pastoral lease', then that is no different from what the Premier of Western Australia, Richard Court, has just done.

It is the case that for validated, possibly invalid, leases the legislation does go one step further than may be the case as a matter of common law and as is the situation with unquestionably valid leases.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of unquestionably valid interests, leases and so on, the legislation is silent on the impact on extinguishment. It is left to be tested at some future stage as to whether that extinguishment was accomplished. We happen to believe that, on the basis of the statements in the High Court judgment, it is overwhelmingly likely that extinguishment will be held to have occurred, but it is left to be tested, and there is an opportunity to do that so far as valid leases are concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we come to possibly invalid and thereby validated interests here&mdash;this is where this knife-edge balance of judgment factor is always involved&mdash;it was felt that because of the element of uncertainty that was being expressed to us by commercial interests, pastoral interests, mining interests and everybody else about the possible impact of invalid leases having to be validated, they have asked that we address not only the questions of the status of the interest itself&mdash;namely, to validate it, the status of the common law and the statutory reservations and to tell them clearly whether or not those continue with existing rights of practical occupancy and so on, which we have done, but they have also asked us to state with absolute clarity in the terms of the legislation that extinguishment is in fact accomplished. The government, for better or worse, has acceded to that request so that, in the context of creating absolute certainty in areas of possible invalidity, all three of those issues are addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I repeat that the extinguishment issue is believed by us to be likely to be what the High Court will in fact find, if and when this matter is ever tested. It is not as if it was going out beyond what we thought would happen anyway, but it has happened. To that extent, I can understand the Greens' point and I can understand why they are going to continue to push away at this particular issue for the remainder of this debate. And we will no doubt hear some more from them on that. I understand that, but it is a matter of balanced judgment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just introduce one other element into the equation&mdash;and this is an important one. The truth of the matter is that it is essentially a theoretical argument because, as a practical matter, the number of leases and interests around the place that we believe may be actually invalid and have to be invalidated is really very tiny indeed&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not irrelevant, because it is a question as to whether this is a purely theoretical concern or whether it is a real practical one that has a potentially very large impact on a very large number of people. The point of the matter is that the number of interests that are likely, we believe, to be possibly invalid as a result of the Racial Discrimination Act or indeed any other law, breach of fiduciary interest or whatever else, is absolutely tiny.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have discussed this before and I do not want to go over it again, but in the context of pastoral leases post-1975, the best estimate we have had from the National Farmers Federation&mdash;we have not been able to make an estimate ourselves&mdash;is that maybe there is a total of something like 11 leases in one part of the country and that is it. In the case of breach of fiduciary duty and so on, every lawyer I have ever spoken to, except perhaps those involved in testing this matter at the moment on the part of a particular client, believes that that is a no-go zone and is not going to produce a result. So, as a practical matter, the number of interests by Aboriginal people that will actually be extinguished by this validation proposal is likely to be very tiny indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The overwhelming number of proprietary interests over pastoral areas, mining interests or anything else in this country is likely to be in the valid zone. We are talking about 98 or 99 per cent plus of all the interests in this country which give rise to potential native rights claims as being in the zone of previously unquestionably valid grants. It is only a tiny percentage that is to the contrary. As to that 98 or 99 per cent, the question of extinguishment is left to be resolved in due course by the High Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the meantime, as I have sought to say at painful length earlier on, nobody's economic interests are being prejudiced because the existing pastoral and mining interests and so on in those valid areas continue to have their full force and effect. The only question mark arises as to what will be the consequence in the future at the time of renewal and so on. That is an issue to be debated in another context. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope Senator Chamarette will at least understand where we are coming from in this respect, why we are doing it, and in evaluating the significance of our continued position on this, so far as invalid and validated leases are concerned, will appreciate that it really is just trying to tie off an element of uncertainty in one small corner of the canvass and that the vast remainder of the canvass is assumed to be valid leases. I think everybody, as a practical matter, assumes that is so. In that area, that extinguishment is not accomplished by this legislation. </PARA>

Post-1975, because so much of the pastoral area of the country has been granted over previous decades, not many brand new&mdash;as distinct from renewed&mdash;pastoral leases have been granted. It only happens from time to time. There are very few new leases which could even begin to give rise to questions about possible invalidity. In the case of commercial leases, or tourism leases, or other kinds of property interest, however, obviously innumerable such interests have been granted since 1975; therefore, conceivably, they could involve some problem with the Racial Discrimination Act.</PARA></TALK.START>

We will not know that until we have been through a determination process. It is not a matter of consulting people; it is a matter of having to wait for a determination process to occur. To make some reasonable judgment about what might be likely to occur involves a major research effort. The only ones that might be invalidated are those which have been granted since 1975 over some area of land which has a native title claim which is likely to be valid. It is just a matter of making a guesstimate of the number of such things that might be involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a matter of the judgments that have to be made. This is all about a balance of interests. As much as we want to redress the injustice and fix things up for Aboriginal people, as much as we are absolutely determined to do so as far as the future is concerned, and as much as this legislation will produce that result as far as the future is concerned, as a responsible government we do have to weigh and balance all the interests, other than just Aboriginal interests, that are involved in this country, such as those in industry and tourism, as well as pastoralists, miners and ordinary residential property holders.

There was a big kafuffle about that because the Aboriginals reckoned that they had the traditional right to go over it. The owners fenced it off because they had drafted off about 2,000 head of cattle and put them in a paddock ready to go to market, and Aboriginal people coming out of that community opened the gates to go somewhere&mdash;hunting or something like that&mdash;and left the gates open. The cattle all remixed. That was three weeks work down the drain. It is the unwritten law in pastoral areas and farming areas that, when you go into a place, if the gate is shut, you leave it shut, and, if the gate is open&mdash;because stock could be going through it to water&mdash;you leave it open. </PARA>

A group&mdash;I think it might have been visiting politicians&mdash;tried to get into the place to see them, but could not. Why? Because the gates were padlocked. So it was all right for them to padlock their gates but it was not all right for the Christmas Creek station to padlock its gates!</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister said that there have not been many pastoral leases issued since 1975, but I know of a few that were re-issued. In other words, they had expired and been handed back to the lands department. Sometimes the lands department will rest a station for a while and then re-issue it. So there could be more than the minister may think&mdash;some that are validated after having been invalidated and some that have existed all the time. For those reasons, there can be a difference in the value of the property on the market. If the owner does not have the right of transition over the property, it can lead to problems such as cattle mixing. If owners do have that right, they are more secure in the handling of their stock. I think the minister could remark on that and change his view on what Senator Minchin had to say. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not going to allow what Senator Gareth Evans said about the opposition's crocodile tears and its response to the Native Title Bill to go through to the keeper without some comment. Senator Kemp took a point of order. Mr Temporary Chairman, you did not uphold it, but he did seek to make a point. I am the secretary of the coalition's backbench committee on Aboriginal affairs. Senator O'Chee is its chairman and Senator Kemp and Senator Panizza are members of it. There are consistent allegations by the government that, because we are opposed to this Native Title Bill, for a whole range of reasons, we have not had a deep and genuine commitment to Aboriginal issues over many years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been involved in doing policy work on Aboriginal affairs since probably 1980 or 1981. The Liberal Party and the National Party&mdash;the coalition&mdash;have a deep and genuine commitment. We just seem to have a slightly different view on some issues. We do not think the native title legislation will help Aboriginal people fulfil their potential. That is why we bring a slightly different view to this debate. We will have a robust, interesting and long debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To reflect on the coalition's genuine bona fides when it comes to a commitment to Aboriginal affairs, Aboriginal welfare and Aboriginal advancement is quite crass of the minister. It is a gross reflection on people such as Dr John Hewson, who has a deep and personal commitment to it; Michael Wooldridge, who also has a deep and personal commitment to these issues; and Peter Nugent and a whole range of people in the coalition who have a deep, abiding and personal interest in Aboriginal affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The record of previous Labor and Liberal governments in Aboriginal affairs is quite abysmal in what they have been able to achieve for Aboriginal people. It is important for this parliament and all parliamentarians to assess what has happened over the last 15 or 20 years with Aboriginal affairs. We should assess the policies in relation to the Northern Territory lands right legislation and see what it has achieved for Aboriginals. We should also assess the policies of setting up ATSIC and the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation. We need to be a bit objective about what we as parliamentarians have achieved for our Aboriginal brothers and sisters in the past 20 years. </PARA>

That is not to say that nothing has been achieved; I am sure there have been advances.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to ask the minister a question about clause 18 and its interaction with the Racial Discrimination Act. I assume that at the end of the day the five factions of the government will incorporate the Greens' proposed new clause 6A which says, `Nothing in this Act affects the operation of the Racial Discrimination Act'. I assume that the proposed new clause will be incorporated into the bill. I again draw the attention of the Senate to the very useful Parliamentary Library analysis of this bill. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Proposed s. 18 would, however, effectively grant a complying State Government an exemption from the effect of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Racial Discrimination Act</EMPHASIS>, allowing it to validate State titles to land.</PARA>
<PARA>I want to know whether that is the case. Is clause 18 not in effect granting an exemption?

I am asking a general question about the interaction of clause 18 with the RDA. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The first and most important point to make is that the government believes that these validation exercises, whether conducted at the Commonwealth level or the state level, will comply with the Racial Discrimination Act because in particular there is provision for just terms and compensation to be payable as a consequence of any extinguishment that may be involved with that validation process. That is a very important element which distinguishes the validations occurring now under this authority from what might be achieved without provision for compensation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That having been said, as a belt and braces kind of an exercise, proposed new clause 6A(2) makes clear that validation exercises of this kind can stand on their own merits, notwithstanding the value that we continue to give to the RDA.

It disturbs me that assumptions are being made as to whether the particular amendment that the Greens put up yesterday regarding the Racial Discrimination Act is being used to debate matters. I did consent to defer the issue yesterday because no amendments relating to the body corporate were in circulation at the time.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will just recap what the minister said to us, because we were discussing this quite some time ago, about the extinguishment of native title in respect of validation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find it very difficult to accept, where in actual fact one extinguishes the native title, how there could still be on the balance of probabilities a continuation of some other claim. Perhaps the minister could clear up that particular point. I would have thought that the extinguishment of native title would have been just that: the extinguishment of native title. If I could go a bit further as to whether or not it does extinguish native title, the minister in his answer said that there would be a small number, but he was not sure exactly how many. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addressing the question of equity, what the minister was saying is that it was fine because there was a small number and therefore the government could just with the stroke of a pen&mdash;to quote somebody else in this debate today&mdash;wipe that away, yet leave it in as far as valid titles were concerned. I was particularly referring to the Western Australian title where, as we know, there is a reservation in law. It does not matter whether it is a valid title, whether it is a validated title or whether there will be a future title; that statute law will stand in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far as the Commonwealth legislation is concerned, the minister was saying that it is okay to rip it off if there are only a few people. In other words, if there are just a few people, and not 200, 300, 1,000 or even one million people, it is all right to take them around behind the garden shed and give them a damn good hiding. But if the government gets to a certain number then it is not all right. That is, in effect, what the minister was saying. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find it incomprehensible that the government can actually be putting up legislation that will give a few people a good hiding behind the garden shed when other people are okay. As I mentioned before, this creates a double standard situation with the pastoralists. There could be an instance where pastoralists who are neighbours may be faced with totally different situations. That is what has occurred under the Western Australian legislation&mdash;I will not go into it again&mdash;which has been in place for 100 years. Is it really fair to give those few people, to draw on an analogy, a good hiding behind the garden shed?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the minister whether he would confirm that validity of pastoral leases actually extinguishes native title.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let us distinguish between the two situations again. When I was talking about valid leases&mdash;not validated ones&mdash;I was saying that, while we believe the High Court made it pretty clear that that would result in the extinguishment, there is still some room for argument about that. That is something that ultimately will have to be, and no doubt will be, tested by litigation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When it comes to validation exercises of that very small number, I think we all concede, of possibly invalid leases&mdash;and it may be entirely hypothetical but nonetheless it is a problem that needed to be covered&mdash;the bill makes clear that the validation of the lease will result in extinguishment. I suppose there is a question mark remaining where there is a reservation, in particular, a statutory reservation. There is a suggestion in some quarters that an existing statutory reservation that is maintained under clause 15 as a result of the validation process gives a window for the retention of a native title claim to the extent at least&mdash;not going beyond it&mdash;of the statutory reservation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an argument about that and that is what I was referring to in passing, maybe not as clearly as I should have. To the extent that the statutory reservation carves out a notional area of exemption from the operation of the lease so far as it affects Aboriginal people, it might leave room for the retention of some kind of claim that there is a little bit of native title left as a result. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is difficult to predict how the courts will jump on that one. By definition, we are talking about something that will not make the situation any worse for the pastoralists than it is at the moment, because we are talking simply about enjoyment of rights pursuant to an existing statutory reservation. The question is whether it is possible in future for those rights to be regarded not just simply as statutory rights, but as having some of the colour of the native title rights still about them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we are in the realm of pretty abstruse speculation here. I repeat that, in practice, these validation cases are likely to amount to only a very tiny proportion of the total landscape at best. So it ought not to be a matter of practical concern to the people Senator Crane is talking for on this occasion. </PARA>

I repeat: just because there are only a couple of them it does not mean the government can take them behind the shed and give them a hiding; and that if there are a lot, it cannot. We need to go further and examine this on a state by state basis.

We can find out and let Senator Crane know, but I do not think it affects the future of this clause. It will take a little time to find out. The truth of the matter is that in at least three jurisdictions in Australia there are provisions of this kind which make allowances for Aboriginal people's interests to be preserved in this way. Also, I should have added before, the common law, as well, is thought by some people to give possible coverage for some operation for a sort of residual native title right; it is not just the statutory reservations.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister. I also share difficulties on this clause. The Greens have grave concern about it because this is the clause that, as was foreshadowed in earlier discussion, equates validation of a possible invalid lease with extinguishment of native title. It pre-empts a High Court decision that, in some cases, it may well be found that native title is able to co-exist rather than being extinguished and, therefore, it is removing a potential right available to Aboriginal people.</PARA></TALK.START>

I note for the record that, under our running sheet, it was proposed to deal with Greens amendments 48 and 53 in consideration of clause 212 rather than clause 214. Perhaps we can bear in mind debating them cognately in consideration of clause 212 and all the other amendments proposed for debate at that same time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In turn, when considering their position on clause 14, I would ask the Greens to bear in mind that, while they do not like that part of clause 14 which would produce extinguishment in the context of pastoral leases, there is a part of clause 14 that they should like very much&mdash;the part relating to category C, past acts and the validation of possibly invalid mining titles. That is a guarantee of non-extinguishment, which is something that the common law, left to its own devices, may not provide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They should remember there is a real probability that, as a matter of common law, valid grants of mining leases would produce an extinguishment. Here, in a validation context, we are expressly not extinguishing native title in deference to mining grants. It might be a matter of making a judgment as to which principle they give primacy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bearing that in mind, I simply add that in all cases, not just clause 14, this is almost certainly a theoretical rather than a practical issue because of the real difficulty of finding anywhere in the Australian landscape particular provisions which may give rise to a situation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thought we had seen the last of this amendment but now that Senator Spindler has moved it I will need to explain why the Commonwealth, regrettably, cannot accept it. The amendment is designed to extend the protection of Aboriginal rights in the context of validation exercises. As such, we look at it initially with a sympathetic eye. The trouble is that it does go too far in our judgment and undercuts this delicate balance that we are trying to maintain.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The present clause 15 protects, as we have discussed in passing several times, rights under Commonwealth reservations and other rights, whether conferred by way of legislation, common law, equity or usage. But it does not protect native title as such. Clause 15 is aimed at doing other things. The amendment seeks to protect not only other rights, including native title, to bring that specifically into the scope of clause 15. It also seeks to protect existing access&mdash;not rights of access, but actual access&mdash;that might be occurring as a practical matter. I am not talking about legally enforceable rights of access but actual practical access. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In our judgment, this would mean that validated lease rights of the kind that we are seeking to protect in their full extent may be read down, not only by the extent of any native title that might be held to exist. This could cut a considerable swathe into the actual enjoyment of the lease rights in question&mdash;something which we said we do not think should happen. Passed grants of this kind and the economic enjoyment associated with them ought to continue to be able to be enjoyed notwithstanding claims of native title. Native title can only expect to have full force and effect so far as the future situations are concerned. Not only is this going to be read down by native title rights in this context but also by access that might be presently enjoyed. We have the actual lease conditions&mdash;being lease enjoyment&mdash;being read down to that extent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a sense in which, to the extent that there are rights of traverse or other forms of access to land in question being enjoyed in practice, at the moment we would like to see them preserved and not knocked off by a validation process. It is one thing to preserve formal legal rights of a kind that exist under statutory reservations or acknowledged common law; it is another thing to embark upon a much wider enterprise of the kind that is involved in this amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our intention&mdash;this is a response also to something that Senator Panizza raised earlier&mdash;is to support a proposal that is currently being mooted and discussed with the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation, among others, that codes of conduct be developed between pastoralists and Aboriginal people to systematically address Aboriginal concerns in this respect. That is an essentially voluntary regime that is being talked about, rather than something that is rammed down anyone's throats. As a practical way of redressing these concerns and keeping the rather delicate balance between the nation's economic interests and the interests of Aboriginal people, we think that is the way to go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know Senator Spindler will not agree with me but I hope that he will at least acknowledge that sometimes we have had to come down on the side of the balance that does not necessarily have much appeal to him but which is necessary to keep the total shape of this legislation reasonably workable so far as the total interests of the nation are concerned. I do not expect Senator Chamarette will agree with me either but, again, I hope that she will acknowledge that the Commonwealth has reached a firm position in good faith, and I am afraid that is where we have to stand. </PARA>

In not agreeing to that amendment, one would actually be taking something away from Aboriginal people. When he says that the government is prepared to acknowledge contracts, covenants, reservations or whatever else that are in writing, we ignore the cultural context that there is such a thing as usage by Aboriginal people that has existed for decades, possibly hundreds of years.

If there are actual rights that one can identify&mdash;whether created by legislation, which is the easy case, or by common law and whether or not involving rights of usage&mdash;long usage and long adverse possession rights will almost certainly be recognised by the common law.</PARA></TALK.START>

It is just an access that has been granted. Under the terms of the Democrat amendment, we now have a situation that that would produce, in perpetuity, an inhibition on the scope of the lease in question.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a couple of things to say to Senator Chamarette. The first one&mdash;I have to keep repeating this whenever Senator Chamarette starts talking about opposing the bill as a whole because she does not like something associated with the validation clauses&mdash;is to remind her that the validation clauses really deal only with a tiny corner of the total picture of the landscape and so on. It is basically a fairly theoretical exercise anyway because nobody has really been able to identify with any confidence which kinds of interest may be invalid and therefore requiring this validation. The vast mass of other interests relates to valid grants in the past and there is still room for argument about the extent of that impact on native title. I am sorry for being repetitive about that, but I think it is important to make that point when Senator Chamarette starts moving into in terrorem mode about what she will do if a particular clause here is not passed to her satisfaction.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point I would make is that it is one thing to talk about preserving native title and not seeing a validation exercise extinguish native title. I understand her position on that. That is one thing and she is obviously going to support Senator Spindler's amendment to the extent that it does have that effect of giving some possibility of native title not being extinguished. But I ask Senator Chamarette to please recall that Senator Spindler's amendment goes much further than merely preserving native title. It does go to dealing with situations of simple access, maybe entirely current access, not having any particular history or pedigree about it. That does obviously go much further than a clause designed to protect in a further way native title. It is protecting another whole class of interest indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think there is a practical point that is worth making here. If there is a clause like this in the legislation, it might start making pastoralists very nervous indeed about granting access rights to Aboriginal people in the future to come in and fish in a fishing hole or hunt or do something like that, even though that is not really accurate because we are talking here about validation of past acts and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is so much misunderstanding and misinformation about the operation of this act. If there is a provision, even in this particular corner of the bill, inhibiting the scope of a lease by reference to access rights that have been granted out of the generosity of a pastoralist's heart perhaps&mdash;if that is ever possible, but I am prepared to concede that it is&mdash;that may inhibit the willingness to exhibit such generosity on a casual basis in the future. That is something I think Senator Spindler does need to ponder. I do not want to conjure up too many demons about this clause, which is a well-intentioned one, but he does have to think through the consequences of going a little bit further than the balance of interest we are after strictly requires. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know that, but I am glad that the minister brought it to my attention again. I am sure that the Greens and the Democrats would be supportive of that idea too, because that track is a kind of tourist track. I know it is not a track that an average tourist from the soft areas in Australia would use, but it is one that has been there for a long time, it is used by a lot of four-wheel drive vehicles, and certain stations benefit a little when they can sell supplies. So I think the Greens and the Democrats should indicate that they support my thrust to make sure that all Australians would keep such a right. Furthermore, I point out to the minister that I know stock routes are specifically excluded, but the Canning stock route is an abandoned route and I do not think that it would come under that definition. So he may have to extend that definition.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is abandoned as a stock route, so your definition of it as a stock route is out. It was abandoned probably in the 1960s, but it is now used as a tourist track for four-wheel drive vehicles. As I said, it is not everyone's idea of touring&mdash;it is certainly mine&mdash;but I would like to see that track kept open. The fact is that it is an abandoned stock route; it is marked on the map as such, so I think it should be different from other tracks.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I briefly want to say that I do not see it as an act of benevolence to recognise these particular activities currently operating for Aboriginal people on or away from pastoral leases. It is a sheer matter of justice that, if people have been living in a particular way and their culture and way of life involves such an area, this legislation should not be detracting from that point. I am quite happy for the legislation to improve upon it in a way that recognises the rights of other people who might have concerns, but I do not support the idea that it should be a way of diminishing any existing practices that they are currently involved in.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I make the point to the minister that we are not talking about exclusive access or exclusive use; we are talking about co-existing practices&mdash;just as the bill preserves public access but ensures that it does not extinguish native title. So I think in this case&mdash;I agree for once with Senator Panizza, and I am sure that he will be pleased and perhaps a little surprised about that&mdash;that there should be some reciprocity on this principle. I wonder whether the minister could help me on this matter. When we talk about existing access and enjoyment, I imagine that a court would not find this access to exist if it were just a casual one-month use of a fishing hole. For access to exist, the court would have to find that access has been there for some time. I cannot put a time limit on the period of access&mdash;I doubt whether the minister could either&mdash;but I would imagine that a court would apply a reasonable time limit on that.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a question for Senator Spindler, the mover of the amendment. I am trying to grapple with how this amendment fits in with what the parliament is actually trying to do&mdash;and that is to recognise and acknowledge the decision of the High Court in respect of certain very fundamental questions which go to the ownership and occupancy of land&mdash;and with the judgment of the High Court in Mabo No. 2. I cannot see that it does. That is not to say that there are not other things in this bill that do not; a whole host of things do not fit in with Mabo No. 2.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we come to land ownership and occupancy&mdash;and, in a certain sense, management&mdash;it seems to me that this amendment does cut across the Mabo No. 2 decision. As has been pointed out previously in the debate, if the proposition is to talk about the existing access, the current access might have occurred only very recently. Senator Chamarette says that it is up to the courts to determine that. Current means current, I would have thought. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mabo No. 2 establishes the right to native title. It also says that native title can be extinguished by the issuing of leases. The government's clause 15 seeks to preserve some existing statutory rights and reservations of Aboriginals which exist in an area which is now going to be subject to lease because a lease is going to be issued by the government. This clause seeks to preserve some of the benefits and statutory entitlements that Aboriginal people have in that area to which they will lose native title because the lease will extinguish it. It seeks to excise those areas to which Aboriginal people have an entitlement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My amendment seeks to include in that provision existing access and enjoyment. That could be access to a sacred site, to a fishing hole or to a waterhole&mdash;something that has never been made the subject of a reservation, never been put into a contract, and never been put in writing, but does exist by virtue of usage by Aboriginal people. Another point that we debated was how long such access has to exist for this clause to apply and for a court to take account of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the amendment fits within Mabo No. 2. It simply seeks to preserve some existing rights and to give Aboriginal people some certainty, in the same way as the bill seeks to provide some certainty to the pastoral, tourism and mining industries by validating leases which, by virtue of the Racial Discrimination Act since 1975, might be invalid. I understand that there are only about 11 leases in existence in Australia that would be caught by it. The bill seeks to provide that certainty to industries. I am asking that that same certainty about a right that exists by virtue of usage&mdash;access and enjoyment are the words I am using&mdash;be extended to Aboriginal people. </PARA>

It has had all this time to do that. No doubt it has been through this legislation a number of times.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;These are not the world's most complicated amendments. The basic linguistic change involved in just about every one of the amendments in the list I read out involves the deletion of three words only from the relevant clause, the words being `both sides of'. Clause 16 refers to `the land adjoining both sides of, or surrounding, any waters concerned'. The point of the exercise is to make that read `the land adjoining or surrounding any waters concerned'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem before was that the onshore regime, which has a number of different contexts in which it applies in this bill, was clearly applicable to lakes and rivers where there is land either side of them or surrounding them in an onshore context. The offshore regime by contrast, to which different consideration apply in the legislation, clearly extended to out at sea. It left in an ambiguous zone, not clearly defined as either onshore or offshore, the bays, the estuaries, the intertidal area between high and low tide and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So there was a hiatus in the legislation as drafted. One could ask how that hiatus managed to get there. I think it would be fair to say that the states&mdash;which after all are responsible for issuing all fishing licences in the onshore area, including bays, estuaries and intertidal areas that are close onshore&mdash;did not raise this issue with the Commonwealth during the really quite extensive consultations that were involved over last year, which is something that has slipped through the cracks. I think this is an area squarely within the jurisdiction of the states. It is just one of those things that happen. But I do not think the Commonwealth can be blamed for not picking up the existence of a problem. As soon as the legislation was exposed, particularly in the context of the Senate committee inquiry, as Senator Ian Macdonald has said, it did become apparent that there was an industry concern that the onshore regime was not clearly applicable. </PARA>

He has not done really well on that point. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS> The main context in the legislation in which this issue arises is in terms of the definition of future acts and what can be done by way of affecting native title. For things that are clearly offshore, all acts are permissible; for things that are onshore, something can be done over native title only if it is done over a freeholder. That is the basic principle&mdash;the freehold equivalent test and so on. So it is important to sort out whether one is talking about onshore or offshore.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was this twilight zone that was not expressed in the legislation and it gave rise to concerns and uncertainty as to what the particular legal regime would be. Would it be the offshore test or would it be the onshore test? What we are clearly talking about with bays, estuaries and intertidal zones is onshore waters. They are in the same conceptual category as rivers, lakes and so on. So it is perfectly appropriate that the regime that applies to rivers and lakes applies to those particular areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Have we succeeded in producing that result by the drafting? Senator Ian Macdonald worries about that. As I say, it is a very simple little linguistic exercise involved to remove the requirement from the definition of onshore waters that there be land either side. Once we get rid of that restriction, we have to have land on only one side of the water in question&mdash;not both sides. We have got to the stage of being able to embrace waters of this kind. </PARA>

Some of those opposite obviously have not read the bill because they have not come to the definitional provisions which make a lot of these things very clear.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The intertidal zone between the low and high water mark created some question mark because of the way these clauses were originally written which talked about land on both sides of the water in question. By definition land is not on both sides of the water that sweeps backwards and forwards in an intertidal zone; land is on only one side of it. So there was a question mark about whether that was properly captured by this language. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The removal of the reference to land having to be on both sides for it to be onshore waters has obviously solved that particular problem, and ditto with the bays and estuaries issue. The governing criterion then becomes the standard definition of `offshore' and `onshore' in the back of the act, because that is the definition which uses the limits of the state or territory as its criterion. It is well known what the limits of the state or territory are; that is, in this context the low water mark and the straight line point between bays and estuaries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once we got rid of the possible source of confusion created by the expression `both sides of', that definition does its work and the confusion disappears. The industry together with the states who have an interest in this as the regulators of this industry are also comfortable. Other implications, whether it is for location of pipelines or anything else, all fall into place. It does not just have implications for the fishing industry; anything else that might be dependent upon the precise definition of what is in or out of the different jurisdictions onshore or offshore also clearly falls into place. I think that is a pretty reasonable response to the kinds of concerns that have been expressed in this respect. I hope that Senator Tambling will understand it as such. </PARA>

Under this bill, interests can be granted down to that mark in the intertidal zone, provided they can be granted where there was ordinary title&mdash;that is freehold title&mdash;to the adjacent land. So it is subject to a condition in our bill whereas it is not subject to such a condition in the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The law regarding riparian ownership is not that a riparian owner has rights over both banks of a river. A riparian owner has rights over his side of the river but not over the whole river, and not over the river and the other bank. What would the situation be for native titleholders with an interest in land on the New South Wales side of the Murray River? Without this amendment, the clause basically says that they could preclude any activity in relation to those waters, even if it occurred on the other bank, because their rights are equated not only with the rights of riparian owners on the New South Wales side of the river but with the rights of riparian owners on either side of the river. That is, it is assumed that they have ordinary title to the land adjoining both sides of the water. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, if somebody on the Murray River wished to build a jetty into but not extending beyond the middle point of the river, and starting on the Victorian or southern side, this clause, before the amendment, would preclude that happening because the jetty would have to be affixed to the bank on the southern side. If I am wrong about this, Senator Evans can explain where I have made the error. However, I understood that it precluded someone with a lease establishing a jetty on one bank and extending it into the river because it says that if an act is done in relation to an onshore place&mdash;a river is clearly an onshore place within the meaning of this bill&mdash;they are entitled to compensation as though they were holders of ordinary title to the land adjoining both sides of the water concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of somebody building a jetty into the river from the Victorian or southern side, they in no way impinge upon the rights of somebody who is a native titleholder or a freeholder on the northern or New South Wales side of the river. I thought that the effect of this particular paragraph was to say, `Look, you can't build the jetty on the southern side either because they are deemed to have the interests in relation to the bank on the southern or Victorian side of the river'&mdash;I think Senator Spindler can understand what I am saying here&mdash;and that would have had a very deleterious effect. There is a lot of benefit in deleting the words `both sides of' and making those consequential amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question then is whether that in and of itself protects fishing licences or interests that may have been granted in relation to onshore waters that adjoin land over which there are native titleholders. I do not think that is the case. In so far as native titleholders can be deemed to be riparian owners, they only have the same rights as any other riparian owner&mdash;that is, the rights appertaining to their side of the water. It does not give them rights over both banks, only over one bank. I do not think it says that fishing interests that are granted in relation to those onshore waters are protected. I still think there are difficulties to be encountered in fishing interests or any other interests in relation to those onshore waters, and I will deal with what other interests there are on top of fishing interests later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps at this time the minister could confirm that I am correct in that it brings the riparian rights of native titleholders into line with the rights of other riparian owners&mdash;that is a starting point&mdash;and then we can look at whether the fishing interests are protected, whether the onshore regime, which is created even after this amendment, is necessarily a good one and whether it can still jeopardise the interests of people in the fishing industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will try to fairly succinctly respond to Senator O'Chee. My understanding of the effect of this legislation in the particular riparian context that he is mentioning is as follows: if a freeholder on one side of the river could stop or have a say in the conduct of a particular activity, so too could a native titleholder who has native title over the river itself. The test is that the freeholder on one side of the river has that capacity, not the freeholders on both sides. That may or may not strengthen the position of the native titleholder; it all depends on the nature of the activity concerned. It may not weaken it either. In a nutshell, that is what is required. Formerly we had to have that freehold capacity running on both sides of the water in question; now we only have to have it on one side.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The motivation for that particular change was to solve the problem of the estuaries and the bays and those onshore areas where there is only one side of the water. The effect of it is to slightly change the test in a riparian or lake context. I am trying to think of what the practical implications of that change might be. It is very hard to work out whether they would operate to advantage or disadvantage. It is probably pretty neutral. It is a working rule of thumb test as to what an adjoining landowner would be able to do in determining what the holder of the title on the water itself can do. As such, I do not think it ought to be an area of enormous concern. The great utility of this amendment is that it does fix up the other problem that was evident. </PARA>

When the minister answered the question he spoke as though the native title rights were in relation to the water.

<PARA>It is not just as though the native title rights may appertain to a portion of water; they may also appertain to a portion of the land. That would still be an onshore place. One of the problems is a little definitional uncertainty because it does not quite say exactly what portion of the land. I will explain what I mean. Suppose there is a very large lease which fronts a river. A native titleholder may have rights in relation to a portion of that lease. For example, the lease area may be an area five miles deep with a frontage of three miles along the river, having a total area of about 15 square miles. If they have native title rights over any portion of that lease, it would appear to me that they would be able to exercise rights in relation to a portion of the adjoining river, notwithstanding the fact that the area that they may have an interest in may be five miles from the river. They are deemed to have an interest in the whole of that land, are they not?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With respect, that is a misunderstanding. The suggestion is not that the existence of native title or any other rights over the land gives one, by extension, some rights over the water. That is not the context in which this section applies. The context in which we are discussing it is where there are native title rights over the water, to what extent do those rights apply to stop activities taking place on the water? The test for determining whether the native titleholder can stop things taking place on the water is the freehold test&mdash;that is, whether or not an adjoining freeholder would have that same capacity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is because there is a bit of an oddity in ordinary property law about having rights over water as such. There are rights to utilise water and rights of riparian owners and so on to treat with the river in various ways.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know this is tricky, but, as the honourable senator says, it is just a matter of reading the text of the clause carefully. For the section to bite, native title is required to apply to some extent in relation to an onshore place. The onshore place can be either land, water or a mixture of both because of the way that onshore places are defined. They are not defined as land; it can be land or water, including onshore water. That is true. But it is a matter of determining whether the particular native title right in question is one that relates to land, is one that relates to water, or is one that relates to both.

Essentially, an onshore place is an area of state jurisdiction.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The way the bill addresses this is to simply refer to the limits of a state. Therefore, it embodies all the law that exists elsewhere about how one defines the outer limits of a state on the shoreline, including in all these different close inshore islands and exposed drying rocks&mdash;as Senator O'Chee described them&mdash;situations. My advisers do not carry all this information around in their heads because it is not strictly necessary for the interpretation or drafting of this bill. Their recollection is that where the low water mark on the coastline actually extends beyond an offshore island&mdash;I am not sure whether I am explaining this very well; it looks more sensible on the diagram I have&mdash;it does count as part of the limits of the state rather than being offshore.</PARA></TALK.START>

The problem is not that they have to be freeholders, but merely that they have to have a right which is then, by virtue of a fiction contained in this proposed subsection, deemed to be a freeholder's right. Take, for example, Moreton Bay. Suppose a group of Aborigines on Stradbroke Island have certain rights in relation to Stradbroke Island. They are deemed to be freeholders, notwithstanding that the right may merely be to gather mussels on the shore.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Evans would not know this because he is from Victoria, but Moreton Bay, as Senator Boswell well knows, is a very lucrative fishing area and this could substantially affect, for example, the prawning industry, which would come very close to many of the islands in the bay. It may affect the fishing industry and it may affect the crabbing industry. Some honourable senators have in recent times had the benefit of the product of some of that crabbing industry in Queensland. Those industries could be affected if one has what Senator Evans described as the freehold test and what I describe as the freehold fiction; that is, that the freeholders have an estate or an interest in the land which is equivalent to a freehold interest. Because it is there and it relates to all of the onshore waters, I believe the effect of this proposed section is to basically cover large areas of water on the landward side of islands or drying rocks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have already seen the consequences this would have in Moreton Bay. We well know that there are Aboriginal claims over Stradbroke Island.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hope we do not have to repeat all these things every time we get to them, because we are anticipating a lot of things that arise elsewhere in the bill, but what needs to be understood about the freehold test is that, when it is applicable, it does not deem native titleholders to have freehold or even the equivalent of freehold. It is a test of when grants can be made and it is a test of when compensation is payable. It is not a test of the quantum of compensation that is payable. It is a threshold test, a hurdle test as to whether compensation is payable when acts are done which impair the enjoyment of the native title in question. So I think, once Senator O'Chee looks at it in those terms, the notion of a heap of rampant native titleholders possessing freehold equivalent rights and exercising them to the detriment of fishermen or whatever in the areas in question, is not really an accurate characterisation of the situation.</PARA></TALK.START>

But because it catches a whole range of activities which would not otherwise be caught&mdash;it has a fiction in here about what the scope of compensation is&mdash;that then creates a cause of action to apply for compensation. One gets less compensation, admittedly, but an increase in the total amount of compensation is likely to be payable by increasing the number of causes of action for compensation, and I think that then has a detrimental effect on the fishing industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable senators should remember who has to pay the compensation. The compensation is payable by the Commonwealth. Obviously, because of other provisions in this bill, where it is an act which is given by the state, it would appear that the state has an obligation to pay. But certainly in relation to the northern prawn fishery area, which is something that is, in part, managed by the Commonwealth, it imposes a cost on the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know how this government operates. Every time we have something to do with primary industry, every time we have something to do with fishing and every time we have something to do with the resource industries, the government keeps on saying that we have to have full cost recovery. Full cost recovery has been an absolute disaster. This user-pays concept has been an absolute disaster in much of primary industry. Full cost recovery, where the Commonwealth or the state has to pay compensation for the granting of a fishing licence, is going to directly increase the cost to the industry in that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The state government or the federal government will say, `This is one of the costs associated with the granting of this licence, which is the payment of the compensation. We can do one of two things: either we are not going to grant the licences because that involves an additional cost on the government, or in the granting of the licences we have to recover that cost and, therefore, we put an extra burden on the fishing industry'. What concerns me is the scope for putting additional costs on industry by virtue of the application of this section. Senator Evans says that we are not talking about the quantum but about the scope of compensation claims. It is more than that, because it increases the number of cases where the issuing of a licence could be detrimentally affected by the application of a fiction as to what the rights of a native titleholder should be in bringing an action for compensation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I am not an expert on these matters; I hope I will not mislead the Senate. My understanding is that if we have a definition of water, it should be a consistent one, as Senator Panizza pointed out. The usual state boundaries go to the low water mark. The implications, as I believe them, of varying this definition are, in some way, designed to possibly minimise any impact of native title on the particular shore area that is covered by water. As a matter of justice, we have to look at that. It does not mean that there is any incompatibility between practices. It simply means that if we were talking about some freehold right in relation to that water, we would also want the most just, effective and consistent way of noting it. I think there is a matter of principle involved here.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am now a little better advised than I was a couple of minutes ago. The basic problem is that quite a number of fishing activities take place in this intertidal zone. Pools with crabs, barramundi and things such as that occur in that zone. Fishing licences are issued, and properly so, in the interests of the industry and, indeed, the nation over that zone. The trouble is that if we define this as land and not as water, we cannot issue those sorts of licences where native title exists because we cannot issue a fishing licence over land, to put it quite succinctly and self-evidently.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The way in which the freehold test operates is that we can engage in a future activity&mdash;that is, the grant of a licence of some kind&mdash;only if that activity could take place over land held by a freeholder. While that is a perfectly sensible test to apply in the context of native title on land, it is not too smart a test to apply on water. Honourable senators might think it is because native title rights then have the capacity to completely exclude the operation of any commercial fishing licences in that area, but that is not really the sort of balance we are about. It is in everyone's interests that commercial interests be able to occur and that native title interests, to the extent that they are not inconsistent, also occur. We are not in the business, I would have thought, of stopping fishing licences altogether. The effect of the opposition's amendment by not enabling this to be defined as water will stop such licences being issued in the future in circumstances where native title is recognised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have thought that the Nationals might want to think long and hard about the implications of that, just in order to keep a sensible balance in the legislation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no intention from the Greens to inhibit any legitimate rights or licences if some amenable solution can be worked out. However, the problem about it applying only to native title areas is one that may be sorted out or clarified a bit further with the amendments that the Greens are putting up later. The reality is that, in many of these cases, we are talking about the extinguishment of native title rights by other activities. If that happens, it is only appropriate that the compensation should be available. If we define it such that native title rights do not exist by this legislation, we are not in any way able to give compensation to those people whose native title rights have been extinguished for a fishing licence area or some other kind of area.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I make it absolutely clear that, the way this provision is drafted, any native titleholder whose enjoyment is impaired by virtue of a licence being granted would be entitled to compensation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I seek to clarify this because I was requested to do so. The Greens still maintain that they are opposed to amendment No. 74. I have clarified why. I will try to explain it as simply as I can. If we look at the high water mark, then we are classifying a lot of onshore land as water. If we look at the low water mark, we are classifying that same area as shore. From the point of view of native title claimants, they have more difficulty in trying to provide evidence of native title rights in the area of water than in the area of land. The freehold test is one of those factors that comes in at that point. Therefore, it is in the best interests of any native title claimants who have legitimate claims to those areas under consideration to have a just basis for those determinations to be made, not an artificial one that is designed to suit particular purposes.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>This cluster of amendments arises because there are no equivalent rights in relation to an offshore place. Discussion up this point has mainly involved onshore places. The reason these amendments are required is that offshore rights may need to be considered in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 16 is devised to help ensure that compensation is payable to native titleholders in circumstances where past acts are validated but where compensation may not have been payable under the bill's previous test. In particular, clause 16 allows for compensation on offshore places without the similar compensable interest test for the purposes of determining compensation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 22 provides a fairer test for determining compensation for the impairment of native title in relation to offshore waters. Clause 225 has been amended because this amended similar compensable interest test applies to onshore places. Some native title rights to waters may have no corresponding rights or interests. It is important that compensation for interference with that native title right be available. This amendment ensures that any extinguishment or impairment of native title interests held over onshore land and waters are compensated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to explain the reason why the Greens are presenting this amendment. It is one of our responsibilities, if this bill is a native title bill and it is intended to protect the existing native title rights of Aboriginal people, to look at the situations where almost all of their native title rights have been extinguished by the land practices of the last 200 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many people in New South Wales who have had their rights almost totally extinguished apart from their water rights and rights associated with their culture. Basically there are two aspects. Water is significant within the culture and lifestyle of Aboriginal people and there may be a situation where these rights have not been fully extinguished and need to be recognised. Secondly, for many Aboriginal communities this may well provide a resource base. As we are signatories to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights we have to be aware that article 27 of this covenant obliges signatories to protect the culture of traditional peoples by protecting their resource base. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those two elements&mdash;spirituality and culture, and the resource base&mdash;are inseparable and interrelated. This amendment seeks to ensure that we are preserving those special considerations and allowing people like the Bardi people in the north-west and the people that have a reliance within their own communities on water and fishing to have that reflected in this legislation in a more accurate fashion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government accepts this package of amendments. They provide for a fairer regime of compensation for native title rights offshore which are affected by government actions. As Senator Chamarette indicated, at present the bill provides that native titleholders get compensation offshore where so-called corresponding rights get compensation. The trouble is there are very few such corresponding rights. Native titleholders may have rights offshore, but the question is how we define the way in which that is going to result in compensation being payable. Without actually deciding whether there are native title rights offshore the amendment provides that if there are any such rights and they are affected by government acts, and the native titleholders receive compensation, pursuant to clause 49 the compensation is just terms for any loss of their rights.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The addition of the expression `or waters' in paragraph 225(b) initially caused us some difficulties, but I think it makes sense. It means that native titleholders will receive cooperation for impairment of onshore water rights on the basis that they held ordinary title to the waters. For all those reasons we do support these amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am concerned about these amendments, particularly as I do not believe the minister has given us any indication of their economic implications. The minister is accepting that it may be, in his view, a fairer system of compensatable rights. We were given these amendments late yesterday and we have not had the appropriate opportunity to have them checked. They may well have serious unintended consequences not only for the federal budget but also for the states and territories. In effect, the elevating of native title rights offshore to something greater than other interest holders can hold does have a very significant bearing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is worth pointing out that there are examples where mining leases could well be affected and could have their benefits attacked.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Tambling has probably rightly observed that this is one area in which we seem to be gaining some support from the government. I do not regard that as a sweetheart deal. I regard it as paying attention to the issue and dealing with it in an appropriate fashion. This bill, either by error or deliberately, removes or allows to be removed native title rights to waterways and fishing. This could have a drastic impact on coastal communities, particularly those in the south and east of the country which may have only those rights remaining to them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe it is a matter of justice. It is not a question of having elevated any rights for native title claimants. It is simply a recognition that native title has a much more complex and detailed interpretation than that which we would apply to land. I think that ought to be recognised by this bill and it is inappropriate that it is not. I add that, in terms of the spirituality component of water rights, there are Aboriginal communities that have no land rights left. The only rights they have are those over water, which is a very spiritual place for them. I believe that it is in the interests of justice, and justice alone, that we are supporting this. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The short answer to Senator Ian Macdonald's question is that we do not expect the Commonwealth to be paying anything under this particular clause. This clause is about validation of past invalid acts. There is only a very limited number of areas where the Commonwealth itself has engaged in acts that might impinge upon native title. There might be the odd naval base or some particular context like that but this is not a clause which covers the whole compensation field. It is Commonwealth compensation payable in the context of validation of grants of interest that were originally invalidly granted by virtue of the operation of native title and the Racial Discrimination Act, or something of that kind. As I have constantly said to the Greens in response to these validation issues, they are not likely to feature at all prominently in the Australian continent as a whole. The answer is even less so in the context of Commonwealth validation.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am interested to hear the government say that these are only technical amendments. I would agree&mdash;the substance still remains the same. Looking at the original clause 19 in the bill, we see that it imposes a liability on the states to pay compensation. In particular, we have clause 19(3). There is a constitutional principle that the Commonwealth cannot impose an undue burden on the states. So I think that aspect needs to be looked at carefully. A general principle was stated in the case of the Queensland Electricity Commission v. Commonwealth that:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A general law made within an enumerated power of the Commonwealth will be invalid if it would prevent a state from continuing to exist and function as such.</PARA>
<PARA>I believe, for this first reason, that this is an unwarranted intrusion into the states' functions, because it is saying to the states, `You will pay compensation for an act, even if you haven't validated it'. I know the wording has changed; the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) says now that it provides a right of recovery. I will come to that in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is where I understand the minister to say that it is only a technical amendment. The difference is that, if we apply the appropriation principle&mdash;that is where the Commonwealth says to a state, `You will pay this money', and the state then has to go to its consolidated revenue and pay it out of that&mdash;the Commonwealth is forcing the states to appropriate moneys. I suggest that that is contrary to the constitution. This amendment has come about because the government has realised that it is imposing that unconstitutional burden on the states, so it has now said that it gives a right of recovery to the native titleholder. I believe that really is the same principle but expressed differently. The minister said that it was only a technical amendment, and I believe it is just that&mdash;it is a technical amendment, it is cosmetic and does not change the subject of the clause. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An interesting point was made by Mr C.E.K. Hulme QC and Professor Colin Howard, two of the witnesses who appeared before the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. They stated that, if we did take the track of saying that compensation would be the subject of recovery by a person, that could be just the same as saying that the state shall pay compensation. One merely has to look at the expectation that is created by the Commonwealth in reversing the wording. The expectation is that the native titleholder will claim compensation and will be able to. There is no question about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Commonwealth had drafted provisions allowing native titleholders to make a claim, that might be different, but in this clause it is rather bluntly put that the native titleholder `may recover the compensation' from the state or territory. In this case, the word `may' refers to whether they want to recover, not whether they have a right to recover. It is up to them; if they wish to, they can. That amounts to forcing the states to pay compensation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Anyone who does not appreciate the importance of these constitutional provisions might think I am saying that native titleholders should not receive any compensation and that compensation should not be covered by this bill. I am simply saying that it should be catered for in accordance with our constitutional principles&mdash;and the Commonwealth cannot place an undue burden on the states by imposing on them a liability to pay compensation without offending the appropriation principle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this clause is to be workable, it will need rewording because I believe it contravenes the principles espoused in the first garnishee case. It is an aspect of this bill which could expose it to constitutional challenge&mdash;and successful constitutional challenge at that. As I have stated time and time again, it is no good passing legislation with a constitutional flaw because if it is struck down by the High Court it is of no use to anyone, no matter what end of the political spectrum people come from. That is why I place my objection to proposed new clause 19 on the record. I believe that the change is merely cosmetic and in no way changes the substance and effect of the clause. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My comments also relate to clauses 22 and 23, because the same theme runs through them. The government has recognised that it cannot impose on the states to pay compensation so it has twisted the wording around to say that the titleholder `may recover' compensation from the state or territory. By using different words it is hoping to escape the appropriation principle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this clause were to be struck down by the High Court as being bad at law because it contravenes the constitutional principle, that would go to something so essential that the whole bill would be unworkable. In light of other Commonwealth legislation, it could also be regarded as undue interference in the legitimate exercise of land management, which has been the preserve of the states since federation. The government would face great problems in the event of a challenge to this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we review legislation in this place, those are the sorts of points we must take into consideration. It is not good enough to simply let something pass, thinking it will do the job, if it is subsequently struck down. The Bankruptcy Act is cited as a classic example of a federal parliament&mdash;particularly the Senate&mdash;making a real mess of legislation. It certainly left the people of Australia in a sorry state of affairs. It was a classic example of legislation being passed without being properly thought through. That is the basic principle to which the opposition has adhered in its consideration of this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are amendments in this bill which some could argue are reasonable, but my answer to that is that it does not cure the basic defects of what is, to my mind, incompetent legislation and that really what is required here is total surgery and not the application of a couple of bandaids. That is really what we are looking at. We have already had clause 11 deferred, which seeks to impose, retrospectively, the common law on the states. Now, only eight clauses later, we have another basic constitutional principle being challenged. These are not light matters. They are very serious indeed, and ones which we have to have regard to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If those ideals which are set out in the preamble are to be attained, they have to be attained by lawful means. A lot of people have said that this native title strives for justice; it strives to remedy many wrongs of the past. That may be all very well, but I say to the government that unless we get this bill right in the first instance, it will be of no use to anyone. That was what we said in the dissenting report of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs of which I was privileged enough to be a member and to see evidence given by 149 witnesses from Brisbane, Darwin, Perth and Canberra. It was only with a short, but thorough, analysis of the bill that I came to the view that there were just too many problems for this bill to be supported. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can tell the chamber that all sorts of industrial groups and other interest groups have indeed pressured for a change in view and, for short-term relief, see that maybe some amendment is necessary to a few clauses. I believe that it would be hypocritical of me if I were to support some bandaid provisions which helped some interest groups and did not look seriously at other provisions as well which might be headed in the right direction. I take the consistent approach that this bill should be opposed because of the essential flaws that exist throughout it. I point to clause 19 as being one of those essential flaws. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have long since ceased to worry about Senator Ian Macdonald. In relation to compensation rights, the language and substance of clause 19 have been called in issue quite apart from this amendment by Senator Ellison.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to this change in the language from `The compensations payable by the State or Territory' to `The native titleholders may recover the compensation from the State or Territory', I think that is distinction without a difference. It is essentially stylistic, rather than substantive. It is not designed to conceal anything; it is just indicating a drafting preference for expressing this in terms of the rights of Aboriginal people rather than in terms of the liability of state governments, but it does not alter the substance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the substance, I think it needs to be understood that all that is happening here is we are creating a right to compensation in circumstances where the states or territories choose to set in train validation exercises of their own. It is not imposing a compensation liability upon the states; it is simply saying that if they choose to go down this particular path&mdash;and state laws provide for the validation&mdash;then, under those circumstances, compensation should be able to be recovered from the state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps I should say at the outset that here, as elsewhere, I think we are talking more about a theoretical possibility than a likely reality. We are talking about validation exercises of past invalid grants that have been made as a result of native title, together with the Racial Discrimination Act or something of that kind. As I have said now on innumerable occasions, we do not really think there are many, if indeed any at all, such cases which are likely to cause validation problems. Nonetheless, to get certainty to exclude the possibility of concern in this respect, we are providing this validation regime. We are providing, moreover, that not only can the Commonwealth do it in relation to Commonwealth areas, but the states can and should do it in areas that are within their own domain. That is the background. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the question of the suggestion that it is somehow unconstitutional to impose liability upon the states, there are a couple of points to be made. Firstly, I repeat this is not an imposition exercise; it is making plain that the compensation should be payable by the state if the states themselves do the validation exercise. There is some advantage in them clarifying the law themselves in this respect. The second point is that the suggestion in the opinion of my former colleague Dr Howard that there is some necessity for liability of the compensation of the bill to fall upon the Commonwealth is simply misconceived in our judgment. Our legal judgment is that the liability for compensation arising from validations falls on the government which is doing the validating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Howard's argument amounts to an argument essentially, as I understand it, that any invalidation of a grant by the Racial Discrimination Act amounts to an acquisition of an interest by the Commonwealth and thus requires the Commonwealth to pay compensation, not any government that might subsequently do the validating. This was not the view that was taken by the High Court in Mabo No. 1, where this issue was tested, and we have difficulty in accepting the proposition that he advances. The Commonwealth and the state and territory governments have all understood this issue very well from the outset. I do not think any of this will come as any surprise to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the context of another one of these clauses&mdash;it raises the same sorts of issues&mdash;the purpose of the amendment to clause 33, in case one is minded to have reference to this at some future stage, is to simply provide that any liability arising under the RDA in the past will fall upon governments rather than individuals. It does not work as such to place a new burden on the states. In situations where the states set up their own tribunals or courts, the bill will enable native titleholders to pursue claims against the states for compensation. If they do not, they will not have that option. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The suggestion by Mr Reith the other day, in the context of quoting Dr Howard's opinion, that the offer by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) for the Commonwealth to contribute to state liabilities incurred through this validation process was a sleight of hand is not a categorisation that we would accept. We regard the states as genuinely having the liability to pay compensation if it is them that goes down the validation path. It is only them that can do it when we are talking about validation of state grants, for reasons we talked about before. But the Commonwealth has said that it will be prepared to help out. The most I can say publicly in this respect as to the scale of that helping out is what has already been said publicly by the Prime Minister&mdash;that is, that we will pay at least 50 per cent. That is a subject of further discussion and negotiation between the states and that certainly does not necessarily represent a final offer so far as the Commonwealth is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the utmost of respect to Senator Ellison&mdash;I know he is approaching this whole issue in a reasonably serious minded way; he did serve on the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs and has been following the technical stuff pretty closely&mdash;I really think that the foundations of his argument are a little askew because they are premised on the assumption that there is an imposition of liability here and that is simply not the case. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In answer to Senator Ellison's earlier question, I am advised that the reason for proposed section 19(2) was to anticipate a situation where there had been some invalid act bearing upon inhibiting native title. This makes it clear that, in those circumstances, there does not have to be some further demonstration of impairment of native title by way of an act of trespass or something of that kind. The mere act of invalidly interfering or purporting to extinguish native title can itself create a liability. My instinct is to think that that would probably occur as a matter of the ordinary operation of basic legal principles rather than needing a statutory crutch of this kind, but it is a belt and braces exercise, I suppose, in that respect. I missed Senator Ellison's other question while I was sorting that out.</PARA></TALK.START>

There is a difference between creating a liability, whether it is under the Trade Practices Act, the Native Title Bill or anything else, and actually having a piece of legislation purporting directly to bite upon a state treasury appropriation. One of course hopes that the interests of comity and otherwise would prevail and that the state treasury would be responsive to a Commonwealth law imposed liability. But it may be that that is so much an inherent state function that it cannot be the subject of application of a direct Commonwealth law.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to that question is in the explanatory memorandum. I will read what I have. The intention of this technical amendment is to make it clear that the law referred to in that subparagraph does not provide for compensation to native titleholders. The bill gives compensation rights to native titleholders where, under the current law, those rights are available to ordinary titleholders. It becomes a little clearer if one looks at the parent provision. Clause 22(4)(b)(iii) says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the law mentioned in section 225 . . . does not provide for compensation for the act;</PARA>
<PARA>It does not provide for compensation to native titleholders; it clarifies what kind of law is being referred to.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Clause 23, as I understand it, operates as a clearance application. That is, a non-claimant applicant, someone who does not seek to have native title vested in him or her, may apply to have the register cleared as to native title. As I see it, even if the non-claimant applicant were to apply and there was no objection within two months, the tribunal could still make a determination on native title adverse to the non-claimant applicant. I ask the minister to confirm that or otherwise.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9X5">Senator ELLISON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Then, as I understand it, what this clause sets out to do in principle is a good idea. It means that if a developer comes along and wants to develop an area, he will have to find out whether anyone in the area claims native title. That all seems quite reasonable. So this clause says that a clearance application can be made and, if no-one objects within two months, it goes to the tribunal&mdash;the arbitral body&mdash;but it can still make a decision against that person. That still leaves the developer in a quandary. If he goes through the process of issuing the relevant notices and does not get any objections within two months, surely at that stage he could say that that is the end of it and would have the security to proceed with the development. But the application does not end there because it still goes through the tribunal process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst this is going on, developers are unable to finance projects because they are still not sure whether the final determination will be adverse or otherwise. I recall that some evidence given before a committee from some of the mining companies showed that this could prove to be a distinct problem, and it was not the panacea or the answer that people thought it would be. At the end of the day developers could still face adverse decisions, even though they have tried to clear the slate through this process. So that means that the clause is not efficient in that manner. It does not really answer the problem, and the developer who has not got an objector&mdash;someone who is claiming native title&mdash;still has to go over another hurdle. Consequential time delays are involved in getting that application approved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The developer also has to go through state processes such as environmental impact statements and, in Western Australia, Aboriginal heritage impact statements, as well as a whole raft of state requirements. So there is an inordinate delay from the time when the developer decides to embark on a project to the day when he can finally get on with the job and develop it. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to touch on the procedures in other areas dealing with determination of native title and determination of compensation and how that whole process can be drawn out to the complete disadvantage of any development or progress. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to focus on this clause, which is supposed to clear things up and allow a developer to get on with a job when no-one objects. If there is no objector, everyone would agree that that is all fine and good. In that case, why can a developer not go ahead?  Why have the subsequent determination by the tribunal? Why not just leave it at the point of saying, `Issue your notice. If there is no objection within a certain period of time, that is it, you can go ahead, because no-one objects.'?  The minister might like to comment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think that overstates the problem of having native title around when there is a valid grant of an interest, whether it is a mining interest or some other kind of interest. People with valid grants can go off and do their thing pursuant to that grant, and the existence of native title is not going to have much to impact upon them. In the case of a mining interest, for example, a subsequent determination that there was in fact some native title simply means that that native title will revive in its force and effect and have full force and effect after the period of the grant in question.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As this provision and the related provisions are constructed, if the claimant wants to go down this path and put in the relevant application and after two months no-one comes forward to lodge a native title claim, then the act of the granting of the interest can take place and it will be valid. So there is that degree of certainty.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">True it is, as Senator Ellison says, that even after that initial two-month period a claimant might come along and in due course establish the existence of a native title, but it will be against the background of a valid act having occurred and an interest having been validly granted. So the native titleholder who comes along after the event will have to wait&mdash;presumably some considerable time&mdash;before the determination of the existence of the native title is of any utility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the developer, or the miner, or whoever, wants absolute certainty that there is no native title impacting or likely to have any relevance at all to the area in question, he can wait for the completion of all the determination processes&mdash;a longer period than two months&mdash;but it is up to him whether he chooses to wait. Most people would be delighted to proceed on the basis of a guaranteed validity of the grant in question, which they are able to do after two months on the basis of no-one coming forward to lodge a claim. I think that is a pretty reasonable balance of the interests that are involved here. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There was a case put to us during the Senate committee of how one developer in a project was having to report weekly to his financiers as to the state of play in relation to this whole affair of native title. The financier was so nervous because hundreds of millions of dollars were involved and, of course, he did not want to see the investment go askew.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not go into the McArthur River project or things of that matter; I will leave that to others. But what about the situation where there is still the possibility of a compensation claim? That is the point that I am getting at. If there is an adverse ruling and then a claimant comes along at a later stage, the person who sets out to finance the project wants to take into account the possibility of compensation. What that person would like to do is say at the outset, `I have to raise X million for that, Y million for that and then a certain amount for compensation'. The person would do that at the outset and let the financier know what the story was. It strikes me that in this process the developer could be lulled into a false sense of security thinking that it is all clear and okay, when really it is not. One might then find the venture failing, which really would not be of much use to anyone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was also put in the course of the Senate inquiry that, if there is to be compensation payable, one wants to make sure that the compensation is there to be paid.

It is payable in the case of an act attributable to the Commonwealth by the Commonwealth; and payable, in the case of an act attributable to a state or territory, by the state or territory. That is a very important distinction. I think a lot of these banks, financial institutions and businesses are generally behaving in a tremulous way at the prospect of native title being further recognised and accepted.

Another is through the requirement for the establishment of a body corporate in the case of completed determinations. We will have some later provisions about bodies corporate, making clear, as I foreshadowed yesterday, that it is optional as to whether one vests the title itself in the body corporate or just has the body corporate playing an agent role.

For that reason, there will continue to be a requirement for a corporate body to be established to represent native titleholders. What will be optional is whether titleholders will be able to have their native title rights held on trust by that body.

If we have not yet got to the stage of a body corporate being established to act as the representative or the agent of the titleholders which will make notification very easy, then we will use some of these alternative mechanisms that are set out in clause 22.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry, I was caught a little by surprise by this amendment and it was a little bit difficult to untangle the technicalities in the time available. What it amounts to, if I can put it very succinctly, is that, under the existing clause 47 as it is presently drafted, if a native titleholder were to get compensation under a state law provision and then come to the Commonwealth tribunals, courts, seeking further compensation, then it is provided that the Commonwealth will take that into account. Commonwealth tribunals can give compensation only once for acts that are essentially the same but there is no total prohibition on giving compensation again if it has been given in a different system under a different legal regime.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So that is what we provide in the existing clause 47. What amendment No. 18 would achieve is something that really rather undercuts that. The Greens amendment provides that if compensation is obtained under a state regime, from a state tribunal, then it cannot, whatever the circumstances, be obtained at all under a Commonwealth tribunal, under the operation of Commonwealth law, even if the state compensation already received is manifestly inadequate. That is the essence of it. A dollar's compensation might be obtained under the state law and the Commonwealth tribunal might think that the compensation is worth a million dollars, but the way the Green amendment is formulated no additional compensation at all can be obtained under the Commonwealth regime if compensation has been received anywhere else in the system under any legal system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is because of our concern that this particular provision might operate&mdash;no doubt, in a way that was utterly unintended by the Greens&mdash;in a way that would actually prejudice Aboriginal rights that we were concerned about it. It is quite a narrow technical point and a very close reading of the clauses in question is necessary to appreciate the point in issue. But I hope it will be understood that that is the nature of our concern, and that is the reason why we think the Green amendment No. 18 ought not to be pursued. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If I can just clarify. I am sorry, but the aspect of the amendment the minister is referring to is section B of clause 47 and that is essentially unchanged, whether it is the Green amendment or the government's initial version of the clause, so it is not actually that that makes the difference; it is the difference between the phrase `compensation is only payable under this Act once for acts that are essentially the same' and our amendment which has: `compensation is only payable under this Act for damage or loss caused by an act if the damage or loss has not otherwise been compensated;'. It does not affect whether it is a state or a Commonwealth agency.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I do not think it is a big issue. I just wanted to clarify that.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Could the minister confirm that, apart from a few minor exceptions such as offshore and low impact activities, the essential effect of clause 21, apart from once again attempting to ensure that state legislation is not able to interfere with the native title regime, is that a tribunal can effectively prevent almost any form of action with land, such as the granting of new pastoral leases, changes to freehold mining leases and lesser forms of grant, including subdivisions?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not sure that anything in 21 is to do with any capacity of the tribunals to influence the course of events. What is involved is the application of the freehold principle that you cannot do to native title holders what you cannot do to freeholders. That is the principle that runs through the operation of 21 and the definition of impermissible future acts.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the short point is this: state governments cannot grant leases over freehold land that is occupied as such by people enjoying freehold title. To that extent, since the test is a freehold, so far as native title is concerned, state governments will not be able to grant such leases over native title because the same test will be applied. So that is an inhibition but that is something that follows from the recognition by the High Court of the proprietary interest of native titleholders.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I suppose it is fair to say, going back a notch, that Mabo makes it clear that the states can act to extinguish native title, sure, but certain consequences flow from that as a result of the operation of the Racial Discrimination Act, including in particular the need to pay compensation. Any state going down that path from now on has to confront that inhibition, and that is as a result of the exercise of Commonwealth constitutional power, the race power that gives the Racial Discrimination Act that life, that effect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also true that what we are seeking to do in this legislation, again relying on the constitutional authority the Commonwealth has to protect Aboriginal people using the 51(xxvi) race power, is to avoid a situation in the future where such extinguishment of native title can occur in a willy-nilly fashion, as it has in the past.

How does that relate to the constitutional rights of the states to grant and handle land title? I would question very deeply what he is saying in his answer, that one part of the constitution can override another part of the constitution. The part of the constitution that deals with the management and handling of land is specific in terms of what it can do. How does the minister expect this portion of the act to stand up against constitutional challenge, or is the government deliberately going down a course knowing full well that this is going to end up in the High Court?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have already debated this. The short point is this: nothing in the constitution enables the Commonwealth to legislate with respect to the subject matter of state land management as such. However, there are certain heads of Commonwealth power. The external affairs power is one of them, under which the Racial Discrimination Act was passed. The race power under 51(xxvi), which is the main support for this legislation, is another. These heads of power enable the Commonwealth to act in various ways in this context to protect native title, to protect the interests of Aboriginal people. To that extent it may have an incidental impact at the margin on the states' capacity to fully exercise their land management powers, but that is in the nature of a Commonwealth constitution which vests overriding powers in the Commonwealth. To the extent that things are within the Commonwealth's constitutional capacity, to that extent the Commonwealth can intrude in areas that are otherwise wholly the prerogative of the states.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, as I said before, the Commonwealth, under the constitution, cannot get into the business of granting mining title; the Commonwealth cannot get into the business of granting pastoral title in the states. The Commonwealth can, however, get in the business of protecting Aboriginal interests in these particular areas and of establishing liability to pay compensation, and so on, to the extent that those interests are interfered with, or impaired. So that is the balance that is struck; but that is the balance that is within the very text of the constitution. It is not something that we are inventing for the first time in the context of this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;(Victoria&mdash;Minister for Foreign Affairs) (8.36 p.m.)&mdash;If the pastoral lease in question does not in terms affect the exercise of the native title, it can be granted. The problem is, the inhibition is, in granting a pastoral lease to the extent that it adversely impacts on native title. If the two are capable of living together, they can be granted conterminously in the future, and there are some kinds of pastoral lease that do not involve absolutely exclusive occupancy; there are some kinds of pastoral lease that may involve exclusive occupancy, because they carry with them some statutory reservation that might enable some enjoyment of some residual component of native title rights. That is possible. But the basic situation remains that, under the legislation, native title rights are to be construed as having the same effect in law as freeholder rights, just as, under the present law, no government can grant an interest over land that is occupied by existing freeholders. So too, under this law, native title interests cannot be overridden.</PARA></TALK.START>

If honourable senators regard the recognition by the High Court of native title, if they regard the overturning of terra nullius as being one of the outstanding feats in our jurisprudential history of at last giving some recognition to proprietary rights which should have been recognised in the past but have not been and now are for the first time and, if honourable senators are prepared to give weight and value and substance and respect to those proprietary rights, then they should not be prepared to argue for the cavalier overriding of those rights in a way that has been the norm in the past. </PARA>

There is an amendment that we will be dealing with later on, during this debate, which suggests that the extinguishment of native title ought not to actually be accomplished until such time as the public purpose for which the acquisition is set in train actually occurs.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is another way of making clear that, while we perfectly respect and accept the states' rights in relation to land management to be able to compulsorily acquire land for the state for public purposes, we remain a little bit suspicious about that right being exercised in a way that operates to the detriment of Aboriginal people but does not simultaneously serve some other obvious public purpose. We are a bit opposed, and I can well understand the argument of those who worry about warehousing exercises, to employing the notion of compulsory acquisition but without any real intention or effect to convert it to the public purpose in question.

The only qualification of that that we are contemplating is the one that I mentioned&mdash;that the public purpose in question actually has to proceed.

That is a way of moving the exercise forward but, if a particular project is to be pursued by a state in an area occupied by native title, there are certain consequences that flow from that in terms of requirement to negotiate.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me inform Senator Panizza that the big problem is that now what was previously vacant ground land might conceivably turn out to be occupied by native titleholders. That is a new phenomenon which states have got to come to grips with. That is the problem. The old terra nullius thing has been swept away and we now have got the possibility, for the first time, there might just turn out to be some native titleholders hanging around. So that has got to be taken into account before any interests of this kind might be granted. If it is a very temporary pastoral lease, maybe this will be a low impact act&mdash;a bit like beekeeping or camping or an extended picnic or a car rally or one of those things. That might be a very reasonable way of interpreting something of that kind.

Those routes are compulsory acquisition or testing the waters with this claimant procedure&mdash;although that obviously would not be very practical in a situation where we wanted to act quickly in a drought&mdash;or the agreement route that I set out. But I actually think there would be a very strong argument that this would count as a low impact exercise, temporary, transient, for an obviously useful purpose, and as such it would not attract any of these other problems. That is something we would be very happy to have a look at because I know it is a particular problem that arises, but I do not think the legislation needs to be changed to take that into account. </PARA>

I do not know, and I am unable to find out in the time available whether these temporary things that Senator Panizza talks about are actually leases, but I would be much more inclined to think that rather being a form of short-term lease they are a form of licence that is granted.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>These amendments relate to clauses 22, 37, and 38. I do not pursue amendments 15 and 16 relating to clause 25. These amendments are essentially technical in character. They are designed to clarify aspects of the legislation, but they are not designed to change any of it substantively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment to clause 22 involves the insertion of a note. Notes are relatively new in statutes. They are designed as an aid to interpretation. They are a little bit more substantial than traditional marginal notes, but fall short of incorporation in the statute itself. The note that it is proposed be included in clause 22 reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Subdivision B (which deals with the right to negotiate) applies to some acquisitions under Compulsory Acquisitions Acts.</PARA>
<PARA>It has been suggested to us that the wording of clause 22(3) does not make it clear that, by expressly permitting the compulsory acquisition of native title, the native titleholder is nevertheless entitled to negotiate in relation to the proposed acquisition under subdivision B. This note removes any doubt about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment to clause 37, amendment No. 17, was suggested by the states. Their concern was that, as presently drafted, the provision would require the arbitral body to look at all environmental impact assessments, including privately commissioned assessments which might have little or no credibility. The amendment does not prevent the arbitral body from using its powers under the relevant paragraph to look at a privately prepared environmental impact statement if the arbitral body considers that it is relevant to the particular case, but it does not require it to do so. The states seemed to think that would be helpful. I hope it will be acknowledged as such. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment to clause 38, amendment No. 18, is premised on the government's acceptance that there is a need to provide for the greatest degree of confidence in the land management regime applicable to native title. As a result, the amendment is intended to deal, in particular, with sequential dealings in land&mdash;exploration and mining, for example&mdash;associated with resources development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment would limit the capacity of the tribunal to reopen issues previously dealt with in circumstances where there had been a material change in the relevant circumstances, thereby providing companies with greater security. They would know that once matters were settled they could only be revisited in any further deliberations by the arbitral body if, for example, one of the premises on which the matter had been settled changed or proved to be wrong. These are all technical amendments, but they are designed to improve the procedures under the legislation and to remove possible doubt about the application of various provisions. I commend them to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Very well. I will refer to clauses 37 and 38 and thereby amendments 17 and 18. Clause 37 deals with the tribunal and the criteria in relation to determinations. I notice that the government moved to clear up the query concerning clause 37, subclause (1)(b), wherein the tribunal could take notice of the findings of any other body that had made an assessment of the effect of the proposed act on the natural environment of the land or waters concerned. Of course, there was some problem in relation to what exactly a body was. The government seems to have attempted to tighten this up so that the body was defined. Amendment 17 states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any assessment of the effect of the proposed act on the natural environment of the land or waters concerned:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i)  made by a court or tribunal; or</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(ii) made, or commissioned, by the Crown in any capacity or by a statutory authority;</PARA>
<PARA>That part of it may be okay, but the problem is that we still have clause 37(1)(f), which means the tribunal can take note of any matter that it considers relevant. It can also take note, in (a)(vi), of:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The natural environment of the land or waters concerned.</PARA>
<PARA>So what it means is that the arbitral body really has a wide discretion, and really it should stick to matters pertaining to native title. My query is, what qualification will the arbitral body have to look at the natural environment of the land or waters concerned and how far can the arbitral body go in taking into account any other matter? I also note in passing that (1)(d) in clause 37 brings in matters of economic or other significance of the proposed act to Australia and to the state or territory concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My second query to the minister is that surely an arbitral body in this instance should not be taking note of those matters. That should be left to other bodies. The arbitral body really is only concerned with matters of native title. It does not set itself up as an economic expert, or an environmental expert, or an expert as to what is significant for the state or the country. I would suggest to the minister that those aspects, those criteria, are irrelevant in this area. It has to be remembered that, in any process for development, there has to be an environmental impact study; there have to be other considerations taken into account and these other matters could well have been canvassed by other competent authorities. So, really, the amendment in 17 is only shifting the deck chairs on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Titanic</EMPHASIS>, so to speak. It might tighten up the definition of body, but it still leaves open ends for the arbitral body to consider economic, environment and any other matter of significance it sees fit. I would like to hear the minister's comments in relation to that and as to what qualification the arbitral body has to take those matters into account and judge them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course, under first principles of administrative law, a tribunal of this kind can only take into account things which are relevant to the determination of the native title issue that is before it. It cannot use one or other of these heads set out in clause 37 to go off on some frolic of its own and just have regard to environmental considerations, or whatever, in the abstract. There have to be considerations about natural environment, in so far as they impact on, are relevant to, the enjoyment of native title. If they were to do it on any other basis, they would be subject, I guess, to some discipline by court proceedings in the way that I have described under the basic principles of administrative law.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, the open-ended reference&mdash;or apparently open-ended reference&mdash;in 1(f) to `any other matter that the arbitral body considers relevant' is, again, not an open invitation to think about, or apply, any consideration at all. As a matter of administrative law, it could only be things which have some objective relevance to the exercise that is in question. Might I draw Senator Ellison's attention to 1(d), for example, which refers to the economic, or other significance, of the proposed act to Australia and to the state or territory concerned. That was a particular criterion that was suggested to us by the states&mdash;and perhaps by industry as well, certainly by the states&mdash;as an appropriate thing for arbitral bodies to take into account. One might well be led by that to ask: what sort of economic qualifications have they got? Do they have to have a PhD from the ANU, or something, in order to pass upon economic considerations? Of course, they do not. They just have to apply, in a commonsense fashion, criteria that are in fact relevant in the various ways that are here set out to their determination. That is a responsibility that all sorts of arbitral, or other administrative bodies have&mdash;quasi-judicial bodies&mdash;in a whole variety of contexts in Australia.

Assuming they have support from other parties, we will have no capacity to stop these clauses being put into law and therefore the obligation is on those who put them forward to explain what they mean. Does `economic or other significance' mean economic or non-economic significance? If it does, why do those opposite not simply say `significance'. Let me take (f) for example. It says `any other matter that the arbitral body considers relevant'. Accepting the government's  proposition that people are not allowed to wander off whimsically and have regard to the last Ginger Meggs comic they read, the fact is that we still have to take into account certain principles. Presumably the whole of clause 37, under the heading of `Criteria', is an attempt to set out what the parliament regards as proper principles.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government's position is that we are perfectly happy to support the first of the two amendments that have been moved&mdash;amendment to clause 41, which is as Senator Spindler described it&mdash;for the reasons that Senator Spindler spelt out. The difficulty we have about the second amendment to clause 41 is that it introduces into the body of the bill itself, and the future act itself, a reference to the preamble in so far as it says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">overruled in the State or Territory interest or in the national interest on grounds that are consistent with the Preamble.</PARA>
<PARA>As we see it, the difficulty is that this introduces an element of uncertainty into the construction of this particular clause. It is one thing to have a preamble to an act as a general guide to the intentions of parliament and as an aid to interpretation. That is something that is increasingly happening in legislation. It is a very good thing, and it is very helpful to the courts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it is another thing to incorporate the text of the preamble by reference into the body of the legislation itself because, necessarily, preamble language is looser, more general and of a different character to ordinary statutory language. It is not susceptible to interpretation in the same way as the formally, carefully and precisely drafted statutory language is. We see it as opening up quite a difficult process of interpretation. It is introducing an element of uncertainty in an area where it is important that there be maximum certainty. Accordingly, we will vote against the second part of Senator Spindler's amendment. While not disagreeing with the sentiments that underlie it in any way, we do not think the drafting technique that has been employed is helpful. </PARA>

<PARA>Looking at the running sheet, the Greens have now moved amendments Nos 8 and 9 on their list that was circulated in the chamber. I explain that amendment No. 8 refers to clause 33 and simply inserts the phrase `who has negotiated in good faith'. I think that is a right and proper requirement to have in the circumstances. We seek to omit clause 36(2) under `Profit-sharing conditions not to be determined'. We want to omit the following:</PARA>

That means it is not crown royalties; it is negotiation by state governments. I think it is quite extraordinary to say there is one rule for everybody else.

It is simply that people who have some sort of title&mdash;it is a native title in this case&mdash;can negotiate with that. In other words, they are getting another sort of income to let a mining crowd operate on the native title. If I am on freehold land, I can do deals with a mining company. Anyone who has freehold land can do that. It has got nothing whatsoever to do with royalties. All governments in Australia work the same, as far as royalties go.

The government of Western Australia ceded total rights to that particular mining area.

There is nothing on that island and nothing has ever been there except a legitimate area for native titleholders. However, because it has been classified as a town lease, it becomes unavailable. The amendment that I am proposing does nothing to assist the state to gain or lose any security of tenure over the area. It just provides some security to native titleholders that compulsory acquisition powers cannot be used in inappropriate ways that simply extinguish native title without actually being used for the purpose for which they have been stated.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Might I indicate from the government perspective that we are prepared to support Green amendment 6A, essentially for the reasons that Senator Chamarette has just stated. The amendment makes it clear that, in the case of compulsory acquisition, the non-extinguishment principle will apply. What all this means in practice is that, in the first place, native title rights will be able to be exercised to the extent that they are not inconsistent with the acquisition or, in particular, with acts done pursuant to the acquisition. If an act done in giving effect to the purpose of the acquisition&mdash;for example, the building of a road or a hospital&mdash;would at common law have the effect of extinguishing native title, then it would extinguish native title. This does not inhibit that occurring, but we have got to wait until the act is done.</PARA></TALK.START>

There have been too many cases in the past, and there may&mdash;let us face it, suspicious people that we are&mdash;be more such cases in the future. The compulsory acquisition power might be employed to avoid native title being able to be exercised under some purported pursuit of a public purpose, but then nothing actually occurring. It is a bit of a risky task for the states because they are in the business of having to pay compensation but even so, of course, the states are not bound by just terms provisions as we are at the Commonwealth level because of the constitutional amendment that was opposed, among other things, by the opposition at various stages. </PARA>

The point is that you do have to state a purpose and, since the acquisition without this amendment would result ipso facto in extinguishment as soon as the acquisition is accomplished and since that is a draconian impact on native title and since it is perfectly possible that nothing further would happen for the indefinitely foreseeable future and that would be a doubly unfortunate result, we are just supporting the introduction of a precautionary measure which will ensure that the actual extinguishment does not occur until such time as some act is done in pursuit of the particular purpose for which the acquisition is made.</PARA></TALK.START>

But if an acquisition takes place just for the conceivable purpose, perhaps, of locking up and denying a continued role in relation to that land by native titleholders and, perhaps, with the government in question being prepared to pay some amount of compensation under a just terms provision in order to secure that result, we do not think that should by itself be good enough to secure extinguishment. That extinguishment should have to await some step being taken to the implementation of the purpose. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, but if the Commonwealth or a state acquires land for some purpose and then does nothing with it, what does it matter to anybody that native title is not extinguished? Let us face it: in some states, the purpose of a compulsory acquisition can be pretty broadly expressed, and in some states land can be acquired for the purpose of letting it out again by way of lease to private commercial interest. That is one of the things that one can do with a compulsory acquisition in some states.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Commonwealth or state or territory then does something with the acquired land for a public purpose, and that is consistent with the law of compulsory acquisition of the state in question, that would be a step taken for the implementation of the purpose of the acquisition, and so the title would be extinguished and clear title would be taken by the lessee.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I appreciate Senator Evans's comments on that. I want to point out that the purpose of this amendment has nothing to do with certainty of title. That is not the issue here. The concern is a very relevant one to those of us from Western Australia, because often the federal legislation has been provided as the solution to the problem in Western Australia of the state legislation, which has already extinguished all native title. The problem that the Greens WA have expressed over and over again about the federal legislation is that, where there is a lack of good political will on the part of a state, the powers of compulsory acquisition that are available to the states via this legislation actually allow them to do on a bit by bit basis exactly what the Premier of Western Australia was able to do with one stroke of legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without this particular amendment that the Greens WA are proposing, this bill allows state or Commonwealth governments to compulsorily acquire land and pass it on to third parties at a later time. This effectively allows for governments to extinguish all native title by stealth if they are of that bad political will, and we are hoping they are not. However, we should not leave any loopholes. The Swan brewery in Western Australia is a good example of how this can be done. The brewery was purchased by the Western Australian government in 1985&mdash;a Labor government, as Western Australian senators will know&mdash;supposedly so that it could be presented as a gift to the Aboriginal people in the bicentennial year. Instead, some time later it was given to a property developer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is nothing in this bill, without this amendment, to stop that kind of process being repeated by an unsympathetic state government, until no native title land is left. The bill therefore needs to be amended in this way to prevent governments acting in bad faith when compulsorily acquiring native title, and it is in the public interest that that should be so. The public purpose for which the land is acquired, when it is demonstrated and reaches a point where it is inconsistent with the existence of native title, is the appropriate time for native title to be extinguished. There may be times when the states wish to compulsorily acquire land and have native title on that land for very beneficial reasons. There may be other times when the use is incompatible, and that is allowed for within the phrasing of this amendment. I commend this amendment to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Under clause 22 of the bill, compensation has to be payable on acquisition, but the quantum of the compensation that would be payable would depend on the extent to which the interference with native title had occurred.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It might conceivably be that there would be a two-stage exercise: an application for compensation at the time of the acquisition and then, if the thing were in a sense warehoused, and nothing happened pursuant to the acquisition for some time, and there had been no extinguishment of the native title in question, there might be a compensation determination which would be quite limited in scope. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then, if some act were taken to implement the acquisition to apply it for some appropriate purpose which then resulted in the extinguishment of the native title, under those circumstances an appropriately larger quantum of compensation would be payable.

Earlier on we were debating clause 47 and, no doubt, the honourable senator retains a very clear recollection of what the clause says. What it says, among other things, is that compensation is only payable under this act once for acts that are essentially the same. When an act is not essentially the same but consists of two quite distinct component parts, namely, a fact of acquisition and then the taking of a step pursuant to that acquisition, it is only the taking of the step that has consequences for the extinguishment.

In the kind of compulsory acquisition for conditional purchase scheme of the kind that honourable senators are referring to, it is perfectly appropriate to contemplate a situation where the acquisition occurs and then the conditional purchase sales of the land underneath it is set in train in the way that is being talked about. You survey the land; you mark it up; you subdivide it and you start selling it, and that would constitute a step taken for the purpose of implementing the stated purpose of the acquisition.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have already given one explanation. I think Senator Panizza was out doing something, no doubt very important, when I did. The compensation that is payable is not confined, under the legislation, to one bite. You can only get one bite for the same act but if there are different acts that occur, you are able to come back and get successive compensation for each of them. If the acquisition by itself does not succeed in accomplishing the extinguishment of your title, you can make a claim for compensation. But if you can go on fully enjoying your title as a practical matter and it is not extinguished as a legal matter, you are not likely to get very much compensation. However, if the effect of the acquisition plus the act which is taken pursuant to the acquisition is to actually extinguish your title, then you really do deserve a decent whack of compensation and you can come back and get it. In the normal course of events you would expect those two stages to be collapsed together into one, but it is possible to envisage a circumstance where they are spread out over time. If this operates as a disincentive to compulsory acquisitions that do not result in actual action being taken, that is no bad thing.</PARA></TALK.START>

It is generally expressed; it covers public purposes and other forms of compulsory acquisition as well. That is just the way the thing is drafted at the moment. There is still quite a lot achieved by the Democrats' amendment, and it is achieved also in the context of acquisition for third party purposes in those situations where that is permissible. But, certainly, clause 22 is applicable to both situations, as we read it. One would want it applicable to both situations, and one would want the non-extinguishment principle to apply to the last possible minute in those jurisdictions where acquisition is made for third persons. He ought not to resist too much the notion that it is applicable to a section 25 situation.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to go back to the point I was making earlier when Senator Chamarette made the point of clarification. During that non-extinguishment period, between the acquisition and the vesting, the native titleholder gets compensation. If the government then uses the land for a different purpose, the native title is revived. That is triggered because the vesting did not occur: it was not the vesting for the purpose for which it was acquired. So the native titleholder could end up with the full native title, plus the compensation. I think this is a problem and I would like an answer on it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9X5">Senator ELLISON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps I should address my question to Senator Chamarette. I raise this in a manner that is not critical of compensation in any way: that is clearly recognised by the High Court. The question is whether it sets out to do what it sets out to do. In relation to that point on acquisition, the non-extinguishment principle applies and compensation is then available to the native titleholder. The government is then able to pull a swiftie, and use it for a purpose other than that for which it was acquired and the non-extinguishment principle then applies. The native title is then revived because (aa) states that only the act for which it was acquired extinguishes the native title. So if a third person, say, public works, uses it then it extinguishes native title. This amendment is being brought in to safeguard against governments acquiring properties for a specific purpose, sorting out the native title question and then using it for something else.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst it is used for nothing, there is no problem. The native titleholder has the compensation. The non-extinguishment principle applies and native title subsists. But, as soon as anything is done with the land, which is not the acquired purpose, then native title is fully revived. Therefore, the native titleholder could conceivably get the best of both worlds: the native title and the compensation. I do not know whether that was the intention. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think this exposes the problem that this legislation has in terms of the freedom it gives to states to compulsorily acquire. There may be some flaws in the way in which states take up that power. However, if they are in a situation where they have extinguished native title, and paid compensation, and they do not use it appropriately, it is appropriate for it to be challenged. I am sure there is no way in which that challenge, and the revival of native title, will not be able to take into consideration that some compensation has already been paid. It is simply a matter for the state or federal government which handled the compulsory acquisition to account for their behaviour and respond appropriately. Senator Ellison says that the native titleholder may gain twice. I believe it will only be appropriate for them to gain twice if there has been a genuine need for them to gain twice.

If the act in question, the acquisition and the subsequent extinguishment run together, constitute the same thing at the same time, there will be only one compensation payable. If the acquisition occurs and then subsequently extinguishment occurs, it is certainly arguable that that would constitute two separate acts for two successive stages of two successive events. One cannot imagine that the compensation would be the same in each case.

I have to say to the government and to Senator Chamarette and Senator Margetts that they might think tonight that they are going to have a victory, but that victory will be at a cost. The cost will be the economic wellbeing of all Western Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to add a bit to what Senator Crane has said because the agriculture areas in the main wheat belt areas of Western Australia are now on average about 80 to 90 years old. There has been very little land developed in the 1980s. The big development was in the 1960s, adding on to what was done between the two world wars.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that this bill put together on the run to get it through before Christmas will prevent extension. Senator Crane is worried about the Ord River&mdash;and so am I&mdash;but I think the Ord River scheme will result in high enough producing sort of land, contrary to the expectations that were around on some sides of politics when it was developed. It is doing very well now and I believe that the Ord River will return enough for all of that compensation to be afforded in time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The extension of the wheat belt areas of Western Australia has been put in jeopardy because, as I said, the average age is probably 80 to 100 years so we preclude their expansion by this legislation. Eternity is a long time&mdash;not from this day because this bill will not pass this day. It will not pass this side of February the way we are going and justifiably so because we are not getting enough explanations. The enactment of this bill will prevent the development of the wheat belt areas, the agricultural areas. As Senator Crane mentioned, the Johnston Lakes are certainly the only good wheat growing country left to be developed in Western Australia although he extends it to others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are making a very big decision, and I hope that the ones who have put it forward are the ones who are supporting it. I know Senator Chamarette was laughing a bit earlier on but I defy either of the Greens to point it out on the map, let alone to have been there and know its potential or to have read anything appropriate about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a lot of work done by the Western Australian department of agriculture going back as far as the Teakle report in 1927 on that area. It was only for reasons of long distances from rail and other modes of transport that it was not developed in the 1960s. Of course, the non-development of the 1960s was always helped by the Labor government in the late-1950s that had its eyes closed to progress, otherwise it would have been going ahead long before now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All those who are supporting this legislation have to look at what they are doing to the future of Western Australia because, once we put legislation into action, it is there forever and a day, as far as I am concerned, and it is going to bring a very cost not only to Western Australia but to the rest of Australia in the production it will prevent and the tax it will not raise. It will also inhibit the development of potential mining areas. I hope honourable senators will remember this when we remind them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the risk of traversing the same ground once too often, can I simply ask the minister whether he agrees that this amendment seeks to ensure that native title rights are not automatically extinguished by the compulsory acquisition of land but will have to await the subsequent transfer of the land by the Crown to a third party, so that it is only when it is actually transferred for the purpose for which it was acquired that the native title would be extinguished. If that is right, is it not also the fact that this bill does not allow such a grant unless native title has already been extinguished?

There are lots of other situations, public purposes and so on, where it remains vested in Crown control.

<PARA>This is quite an important amendment. It is all about providing certainty. We have given a clear commitment that the rights of existing property holders would be protected, and, consistent with this, this amendment will ensure that valid interests will be able to be renewed on a similar basis as invalid interests which are being validated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment makes it abundantly clear that any compensation obligations arising from the renewal of such leases will be recoverable from the relevant government. The amendment will ensure that the holders of valid interests are treated no less favourably than the holders of invalid leases which are subsequently validated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment does also provide protection to native titleholders. Clause 24, as amended by this government amendment, does not operate to extinguish native title. That is something I want to emphasise particularly to the Greens and the Democrats, who I know have some particular concerns about this amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me just explain why that is so. To the extent that native title was extinguished by the original grant, the renewal obviously will not affect native title. Indeed, it does not, in that sense, come within the ambit of the bill at all. Note 1 to be attached to clause 24, as to be inserted by this amendment, makes that clear. Note 1 says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because of paragraph 218 (1)(c), an act that does not affect native title cannot be a future renewal act and therefore is not prevented by this Act.</PARA>
<PARA>However, in the event that native title rights were not extinguished by the original grant and do happen to coexist with the lease in question, say the pastoral lease, the renewal of the grant will not extinguish that native title.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will just make that clear again for the benefit of Greens and Democrats: the renewal of the grant, to the extent that it has not previously been extinguished, will not accomplish that extinguishment. What will happen is that the statutory rights in question under the lease, or whatever is in question, will prevail for the term of the interest. The native title right will not be extinguished. It will not be able to be enjoyed to its full extent, or perhaps at all, for the duration of the renewed interest in question, but it will not be extinguished. It will be able to be effectively deployed at the conclusion of the period in question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key point to notice about all this, as I began by saying, is that this is all about certainty; the amendment does provide certainty to holders of valid interests who, under most credible interpretations of the High Court decision, will already have extinguished native title. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final point is that this amendment has not just come out of nowhere; it was the product of concern expressed to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, as Senator Ellison will no doubt recall. Recommendation (c) on page 26 of that Senate committee report said that the bill should address the concern that there may be impediments to renewals or re-grants of valid leases&mdash;for example, pastoral&mdash;where the renewals or re-grants are in the same terms as the original lease. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a degree of anomaly felt that, while the legislation was very explicit indeed about what the status would be when renewals came up for validated grants, there was no similar precision or certainty about what would happen with renewals or extensions of valid grants. Of course, many more cases are valid grants than there are ever likely to be established of invalid ones.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate committee was concerned to establish some certainty here. This is an issue about which the NFF and the mining industry have been particularly concerned. The government regards their case as a valid one. We support it and accordingly we do support this amendment. We hope and trust that those on the other side of the chamber who have hitherto been reluctant to support clear-cut provisions designed to be in the interests of industry and to achieve an appropriate balance in the overall shape of the legislation as a result will take this opportunity, even if they have not taken the other opportunities that have been presented to them today, to improve the bill from an industry perspective. I invite them to do so. </PARA>

They would like this amendment not to proceed. I understand that that is Senator Kernot's position. I understand that that is the Green's position. I understand why. However, at the end of the day this bill has to produce an appropriate balance of all interests concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are talking about here are not future grants in the sense of new things that will happen. By definition, we are talking about renewals or various kinds of extensions, in different contexts, which are not necessarily pursuant to a formal legal right of renewal. In the real world of business, commerce and Australian national interest, it is important that, for example, a mine that has not completed resource extraction be allowed to conclude that task. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a competing interest here. It is a stark and obvious competing interest. I am not pretending for a moment that native titleholders who still possess their native title rights, if they have not been extinguished, are going to be well off in this particular situation. I am not suggesting that they are going to be much better off than they are at the moment while the right continues to be enjoyed. That is something we have to acknowledge. It is pointless to try to deny or hide it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the point that I put as strongly as I can on the part of the government is that there does have to be an overall balance. That has been accepted by Aboriginal leaders. It has been accepted by others in the context of the whole question of acting to remove concern about the possible invalidity of the need for validation and the extinguishment that flows from that. It is not especially palatable, but it has been accepted as part of the overall balance of interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are very real national interests involved in the pastoral industry and the mining industry to ensure continuity of expectations in the future. We believe this particular legislation should address those sorts of interests, those sorts of concerns, as well as doing the job that we basically want it to do, which is to bring some justice and morality and recognition to Aboriginal people's rights for the first time in 200 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a question of a knife-edged balance of interests. The government has had to make a hard decision about this one. It is not going to be a very popular decision. I know that very well from the discussions I have had in the last few days, but that is the government's position and I have explained the reasons for it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) said that the government has made a knife-edged decision and that it is looking at balancing the interests of various parties. I think the balance is too far one way. An example that has been given to me is of leases at Gove where there is a 42-year lease and a 42-year option&mdash;a total of 84 years. During that time, native titleholders will have absolutely no say in what happens on their land. They will have no entitlement to approach the mining company to seek any form of negotiation. That postpones a very important part of the whole process that we have to look at in this country in terms of sharing the land.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, this amendment does apply in situations where the formal, legal right of renewal has been exhausted. What we are talking about is simply a presumption of continuity. That is one of the effects of this lease. Again, that has perhaps a tough impact, and that point has been made to me very strongly by some of the Aboriginal leaders, rather in the way that Senator Kernot has just put it. When a mine has had a life of 84 years, is it not about time the Aboriginal interest came in and had its proper or legitimate say?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand the point. All I can say is that, when we are talking about vital national resources and interests and we are talking about a right that has not been enjoyed because of a grant that has been made in the past, this is one occasion where the balance comes down the other way.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Evans told us when he withdrew government amendment No. 15 that government amendment No. 14 had the same effect. That is not the case; it is not the case for two reasons. The first is that government amendment No. 14, in so far as it is concerned in subclause (4) of the new clause 24, only applies to acts that took the original act which took place before 1 January 1994. That is not the same as the rights which were proposed under paragraph (c) of the amended clause 25 because it related to the extension of a right which could have been created after 1 January 1994. So No. 14 is a much more curtailed version, in that respect, of No. 15.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendment No. 14 is also a much more curtailed version of amendment No. 15 because, in subclause (5) of the new clause 24, paragraph (d) excludes from the operation of subsection (4) a right which arose out of an earlier act or a later act which was `the making, amendment or repeal of legislation'. That is different from paragraph (c)(ii) of amendment No. 15, where `an option or a right of extension or renewal was created by the lease, contract or other thing whose grant or making created the right'. Under amendment No. 15, I believe it would have been possible to renew a mining right created by statute, or a right created by statute that facilitated mining, but that is not possible under amendment No. 14. I think that the government is failing quite substantially. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other reasons why amendment No. 14 to clause 24 is beneficial. They relate to the renewal of valid pastoral leases where co-existence may occur.

Subclause (3) of the government's amendment clause says, first of all, that this clause covers `a legally enforceable right created by the making, amendment or repeal of legislation before 1 July 1993'. So that statutory rights created are caught by that provision and can be renewed.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;First of all, I will respond to Senator O'Chee's question. I will then respond to what Senator Spindler has said. The first thing to appreciate is that, under amendment No. 15, clause 25(2)(c)(ii), which we are no longer proceeding with, the subject matter is effectively preserved in clause 25(2)(c). So whatever was substantively achieved by the amendment, subparagraph (c)(ii) is still there in the existing paragraph (c) of clause 25.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the reference to the rights existing on 1 January 1994, that is to be compared with the language of amendment No. 14 which mentions in clause 24(4)(a) acts taking place before 1 January 1994. For all practical purposes, that amounts to pretty much the same thing. Rights existing as at 1 January 1994 are pursuant to the reference in the proposed new clause 24(4)(a) to acts taking place before 1 January 1994. In terms of Senator O'Chee's concern about the abandonment of amendment No. 15, the points I made earlier about the substance of that proposed amendment being sufficiently incorporated in the proposed new clause 24 still hold. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to Senator Spindler's point about the particular business of options, to the extent that he was concerned about the provision in subclause 3(a)(ii) about offers, commitments, arrangements or undertakings made or given other than in legislation in good faith before 1 January 1994, and of which there is written evidence and so on, let me frankly say that I understand that concern. That is a rather widely drawn provision. It is important that in practice it be construed and applied by the courts in a way that reflects commercial reality and not sham transactions, but I believe that the courts would be perfectly capable and willing to so construe it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The courts will be assisted in that respect by the reference to `in good faith' in terms of the subparagraph in question. I think that will be construed to reflect commercial reality. What this whole amendment is about is reflecting and protecting commercial reality. It is expressly designed to serve an industry or a national interest purpose in this respect. It does not particularly help Aboriginal native titleholders, but nor does it hinder their interests. I go back to the point I made in introducing the clause: whatever else this clause does that people do not like, it certainly does not do anything to extinguish native title rights. To that extent, we believe we have preserved and maintained the balance. </PARA>
