</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5K4">Senator FAULKNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Charter of the United Nations Act 1945. The amendments will allow the Governor-General in Council to make regulations allowing for more comprehensive implementation of Australia's obligations under the United Nations Charter than existing legislation permits. They also provide for the imposition of fines for breach of the regulations and allow the Attorney-General to seek injunctions to restrain such a breach.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the Cold War era, the rivalry between the Soviet Union and the Western powers meant that the Security Council was seriously hampered in addressing international crises. The end of the Cold War has seen the Council begin to function in the way the founders of the United Nations envisaged it would. It has taken action in regard to a number of the world's most troublesome conflicts&mdash;in the Persian Gulf, in Cambodia, in Somalia and in the Balkan conflict, to name some of the most prominent. In some cases the Security Council has determined that the imposition of economic sanctions is necessary in order to bring to an end a breach of international peace and security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent times, such sanctions have been imposed against Iraq, Libya and Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro). A failure by member states of the United Nations to implement those sanctions would inevitably erode respect for, and the authority of, those decisions. It is therefore important that Australia play its part in strengthening international peace and security by placing itself in a position fully to implement obligations that may arise from measures mandated by Security Council decisions. Further, Australia, as a member of the United Nations, is required as a matter of international law by Article 25 of the Charter to implement those decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Security Council resolutions imposing sanctions generally decide that `states shall prevent' specified transactions with the offending state. Australia's obligations under such resolutions have previously been implemented by way of the making of regulations under the Customs Act 1901, the Air Navigation Act 1920, the Banking Act 1959 and the Migration Act 1958 and by way of appropriate directions issued by the Treasurer to the Governor of the Reserve Bank. Up until now, the Australian Government has been able to use those methods to implement, directly or indirectly, sanctions mandated by the United Nations against Iraq and Libya and those mandated against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and  Montenegro) last year. However, recent events have shown that this ad hoc utilisation of legislation designed to be used for other purposes is no longer adequate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Security Council adopted Resolution 820 on 17 April 1993. The Resolution provides for the imposition of strict new sanctions on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia as from 26 April. The Government has been advised that Australia lacks a legislative basis by which it could ensure compliance with the obligations imposed by the Resolution in a number of important respects&mdash;for example, the freezing of funds held in Australia by the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia or companies based in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Nor, under existing legislation, can the Government prevent Australian individuals or firms from providing services&mdash;such as accounting services or the installation of computer software&mdash;to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The High Court held as long ago as 1973 that the Commonwealth did not have the executive power to cut off the telephone and mail services of the "Rhodesian Information Bureau" in Sydney, pursuant to a Security Council resolution. A failure to comply with the Resolution would place Australia in breach of its international obligations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In examining its options in relation to the implementation of those sanctions, the Government had regard to the ways in which other countries have done so. The United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and New Zealand have had facilitating legislation in place since the 1940s designed to allow a quick response to an obligation to implement Security Council sanctions. The Canadian and New Zealand legislation is particularly close in its wording to that proposed in the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The central provision in the Bill before honourable Senators is the insertion of a new section 6 in the Charter of the United Nations Act 1945. The section will enable the Governor-General in Council to make such regulations as are necessary or convenient for applying measures adopted by the Security Council pursuant to Chapter VII of the Charter. The Government will thereby be able to implement promptly by way of regulation economic sanctions introduced by the Security Council. As Honourable Senators would be aware, the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances agreed in its Ninety-third Report of December 1992 (Scrutiny of Regulations Imposing United Nations Sanctions) that it was appropriate that Australia's obligations under Security Council resolutions be implemented by way of regulation. The reason for their conclusion was the need for speed and flexibility in the implementation of the sanctions and the fact that the regulations merely filled out the details of Australia's existing international legal obligation to comply with the sanctions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation will be based on the external affairs power of the Commonwealth. It is not intended that the legislation replace existing regulations: rather, it will enable the Governor-General in Council to make regulations dealing with  situations which fall outside the present regulatory framework. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation will not have the effect of taking away from the Government or the Parliament the power to decide whether the imposition of sanctions against a particular foreign state is in Australia's national interests. It would only be after the making of regulations under the legislation, which would be subject to the normal provisions regarding disallowance in the Parliament, that sanctions would be implemented. It would be open to persons aggrieved by a decision to make particular regulations to claim that their making was neither necessary nor convenient for applying measures adopted by the Security Council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, the other amendments to the Act are directed to ensuring that regulations made under the Act as amended will properly implement Australia's international legal obligations. The proposed Section 3 will ensure that regulations implementing Australia's obligations under the Charter can be enforced in Australia's external territories. The proposed section 4 makes it clear that the Crown in the right of the Commonwealth and of the States and Territories is bound by any regulations made pursuant to the Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Security Council resolutions may provide that member states of the United Nations shall prevent their nationals from engaging in specified conduct. Section 7 will allow the Government to implement such provisions effectively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wording of Section 8 reflects the fact that the sanctions introduced by regulation are those currently mandated by decisions of the Security Council. Once the Security Council decides that sanctions against a particular state are no longer necessary, it would obviously be inappropriate for the regulations implementing those sanctions to remain in force. Whilst prompt action will be taken to repeal or amend the regulations formally in line with the decision of the Security Council, this section will make it clear that they cease to have effect as soon as the sanctions are lifted by the Security Council. It also makes it clear that the Government may decide, consistent with the position regarding the introduction of sanctions, that the continued implementation of particular sanctions is no longer in the national interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consistent with the position that we are obliged by international law to give effect to decisions of the Security Council, the proposed new sections 9 and 10 are intended to guarantee that regulations implementing sanctions are not read subject to existing legislation nor later found to have been accidentally repealed by subsequent legislative action. Unless such provision is made, Australia could inadvertently  find itself in breach of its international legal obligations and be subject to international criticism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I stated earlier, Mr President, the Government has previously implemented, and will continue to implement, United Nations sanctions by way of Regulations under the Customs Act, the Air Navigation Act, the Banking Act and the Migration Act. Doing so confers substantial advantages in regard to the administration of the regulations and the imposition of more appropriate penalties than are available under this Bill. This Bill is intended to supplement, not replace, that existing pattern of legislation and regulation. Section 11 makes it clear that regulations made under the legislation referred to above will continue in force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill includes provisions for penalties for breach of regulations made under it and for the Attorney-General to seek injunctions to prohibit prospective breaches of the regulations. The Bill will come into force on Royal Assent. I commend the Bill to honourable members. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP AMENDMENT BILL 1993</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill provides for amendments to the Australian Citizenship Act 1948 to incorporate a preamble, which gives proper recognition to the significance of Australian citizenship as a common bond which unites all Australians, and to introduce a distinctive Australian "pledge of commitment as a citizen of the Commonwealth of Australia" to be made by persons acquiring Australian citizenship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the past year, the Government has sought to promote community discussion of issues relating to our national identity. The Government's view is that there is strong and growing support for ensuring that our national symbols effectively express our distinctive identity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Citizenship proclaims and defines national identity. The Government believes the time is right to change our citizenship law to reinforce the place of Australian citizenship as a defining element of our national identity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current Australian Citizenship Act 1948 is principally concerned about the process of acquiring and losing citizenship. This is inadequate. The Act should also contain a preamble defining the meaning which the Parliament and the people of Australia accord to citizenship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is what the preamble will do. The preamble explains that Australian citizenship is a unifying factor, in our diverse society. It states that citizenship represents "formal membership of the community of the Commonwealth of Australia". </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The preamble also makes it clear that citizenship involves both rights and obligations, which are enshrined in the constitution and our laws. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is a parliamentary democracy committed to providing equality before the law, freedom of the individual, freedom of speech and religion, equality between men and women and equality of opportunity for all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is one of those few countries which actually relishes its diversity. Under the umbrella of an overall commitment to the nation and its uniting values and institutions, a society of great richness and variety as well as remarkable harmony has evolved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the multicultural society we are, it is proper that the pledge of commitment be one which will be equally meaningful to all our people. It is therefore time that individual citizens be allowed to make a commitment of loyalty to Australia in embracing Australia's democratic beliefs and institutions, respecting others' rights and liberties, and upholding and obeying the laws of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To reinforce this commitment to national unity, we must continue to develop the special Australian identity. We need strong national identity to give us more strength of purpose. We need it abroad to leave no-one in any doubt about who we are and what we stand for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is of the view that the process of nation building is enhanced by reinforcing the notion of an "Australian" citizenship. Australian citizenship, with its attendant rights and obligations, is part of the glue which binds the nation and its citizens in a manner that gives adequate recognition to the reciprocity of that bond. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, most importantly, this Bill proposes a "pledge of commitment as a citizen of the Commonwealth of Australia" to replace the current oath or affirmation of allegiance taken by applicants when acquiring citizenship. The pledge gives effect to the intent of the preamble, and is distinctively Australian. Some residents are reluctant to apply for citizenship partly because they do not see the present oath or affirmation as being adequately Australian in character. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The pledge calls upon applicants to make a commitment of loyalty to Australia, the nation and its people. This contrasts with the present oath or affirmation of allegiance, which is made to a sovereign by a subject and has its origins in feudal times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Alternate versions of the pledge have been included, allowing one to choose either the version using the words "under God" or the version with no religious connotations. This approach properly reflects our diverse society, with its commitment to the fundamental principle that people should have the right to express their faith and to celebrate it. The fact that a significant number of people will want to express their deep commitment to this country in religious terms is therefore specifically catered for and formalises a choice currently available at other solemn occasions, for example, in courts and at swearing in ceremonies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The oath or affirmation of allegiance has evolved over the years, reflecting changed community concerns, since it was first introduced in 1949. The pledge captures the current way in which the Australian people view their national identity. It also reflects a sense of national identity that can be readily identified with by citizens of Australia, not just applicants for citizenship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The pledge is specifically designed for use at citizenship ceremonies, to enable new citizens to affirm their commitment to Australia but it is also quite appropriate for use on public or formal occasions and in schools. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To ensure the concepts in the preamble and the pledge are widely understood, and to promote the pledge to potential new citizens and its wider use in the community,  the Government has provided some modest funding for an information program involving advertising, posters in schools and the provision of a quality printed pledge, as a memento of the citizenship ceremony. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In dealing with this amendment, I wish to refer briefly to the high court decision relating to the Wills by-election. That decision clearly has very important implications for those Australian citizens who are dual citizens and their ability to fully enjoy the rights of other Australian citizens. The Government has already made clear that it intends to pursue these issues with the Opposition with a view to changing the current constitution requirements for eligibility for Parliament. In our view Australian citizenship should be sufficient qualification. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill introduces changes to Part 7 of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992&mdash;the provisions dealing with subscription television broadcasting services, or Pay TV.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As you may be aware, on 29 January this year, I announced changes to defer the allocation of licences under section 96 of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 for subscription television broadcasting services delivered on multipoint distribution systems (MDS).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the Government was aware that mandating digital technology for the satellite services could provide a window of opportunity for MDS, it was never intended that MDS should take the dominant role in providing subscription television broadcasting services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In fact, in mandating digital technology, the Government seized the opportunity to place Australia at the forefront of world developments in broadcasting technology and to present exciting opportunities for Australian industry with employment and export potential.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following the calling of tenders for the remaining MDS channels, it became clear that major commercial interests had developed plans to provide extensive subscription television broadcasting services through MDS.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">MDS had been seen by the Government as providing a useful competitive ancillary to a national satellite or cable system, but because of its inherent limitations of audience reach it was not envisaged that it would provide the backbone of a national subscription television broadcasting service.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is concerned that the early development of an extensive MDS subscription television broadcasting network may prevent the subsequent provision of high quality subscription television broadcasting services on a national basis through satellite transmission or a cable system. Because of the head start enjoyed by MDS technology, MDS systems could corner markets in a handful of major population centres. This would affect the commercial prospects of any national service to be  delivered by satellite.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government considers that if MDS services were to provide the basis of a national subscription television service, they should be subject to the same sorts of rigorous controls on concentration of ownership and cross media ownership or the Australian industry development requirements which apply to satellite subscription television broadcasting services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, the development of widespread MDS based subscription television broadcasting services could prejudice the ability of the ABC to provide an effective nationally available service as was expressly provided for under the provisions enacted late last year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government therefore decided it will delay the provision of subscription television broadcasting services using MDS so that services delivered by other delivery technologies including the satellite services expressly provided for in Part 7 could commence commercial operations on a more equal footing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 29 January, the Government announced a policy in relation to the use of MDS for delivery of subscription television broadcasting services that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">no licences should be issued for subscription television broadcasting services relying predominantly on MDS for delivery prior to:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">a) the award of licences for satellite Pay TV services and the determination of the digital transmission standard for satellite subscription television broadcasting services; or</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This policy was notified to the Australian Broadcasting Authority under section 161 of the Act. Further, the ABA was directed to act in accordance with that policy in exercising its licensing powers. No applications for subscription television broadcasting licences had been lodged at the time the policy was announced and the direction given to the ABA. However, applications were subsequently lodged by one company which then challenged the policy notification and direction to the ABA in legal proceedings brought in the Federal Court.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The uncertainty created by those proceedings, with the prospect of subsequent appeals, can be cut short by the proposed legislation. The Government's intention to  introduce the legislation was announced before the applications were lodged or proceedings commenced.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill reflects the policy notification and direction. New section 3A provides for the government's policy, and new section 3B gives guidance to the ABA in deciding for cable what is a national service.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT BILL 1993</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of this Bill is to clarify doubts concerning the interpretation of Section 135AA of the National Health Act 1953, requiring the issue of guidelines by the Privacy Commissioner relating to information obtained under the Medicare Benefits Program and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under these two programs the Government receives annually claims for approximately 157 million medical services and 94 million pharmaceutical prescriptions. Over $6 billion annually is spent on these services by the Government. Efficient and accurate processing of this huge quantity of information requires the use of large computerised databases.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Legislation provides for the privacy of all information gathered as part of the administration of these very large and complex programs. Section 135A of the National Health Act 1953 and Section 130 of the Health Insurance Act 1973, require officers to observe secrecy in respect of all information obtained in the course of their duties. The Privacy Act 1988 also applies to the collection, storage, use and disclosure of personal information which is obtained in the administration of the Medicare Benefits Program and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Program. In addition, the agencies responsible for administering these programs have agreed to be bound by the Privacy Commissioner's Data Matching Guidelines.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 135AA of the National Health Act 1953 complements this general framework by expressly providing that the Privacy Commissioner shall develop, in consultation with affected organisations, privacy guidelines relating to information obtained under the programs. This section was enacted in 1991 following an amendment moved by the Opposition in the Senate which was accepted by the Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Privacy Commissioner's subsequent consultations on the guidelines, and advice from the Office of General Counsel in the Attorney-General's Department which was provided to the then Department of Health, Housing and Community Services, revealed a number of problems relating to the wording of that section. For example, on one reading of the current provision, personal identification information held in the eligibility enrolment databases (i.e. name, address, Medicare card number and Pharmaceutical entitlements number) would need to be deleted and reconstructed each five years thereby necessitating the issue of new eligibility cards at considerable public expense for no net benefit. Similar problems may relate to databases containing the names, addresses and qualifications of all approved providers of services and goods. A further difficulty relates to uncertainty as to whether the section applies only to information received after the commencement date of the Health Legislation (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Amendment Act 1991 (i.e. 27 June 1991).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The various difficulties were identified by the Privacy Commissioner in his report to Parliament of 28 May 1992. The Privacy Commissioner has deferred issuing privacy guidelines under the existing section pending the proposed legislative amendments contained in this Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The provisions in this Bill have been developed in consultation with the Privacy Commissioner. Officials have also discussed these issues with members of the Opposition and the Australian Democrats.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this Bill is to clarify Section 135AA to overcome the problems identified during the consideration of the draft guidelines. It repeals the existing section and substitutes a new Section 135AA with, subject to the differences identified below, the same general structure. The Privacy Commissioner will still be required to issue privacy guidelines for the management of information stored in computer databases and to conduct consultations with affected organisations. The guidelines will also have to be tabled in the Parliament as a disallowable instrument.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To avoid the need to delete and reconstruct eligibility enrolment databases every five years, the new Section 135AA makes it clear that the guidelines to be formulated by the Privacy Commissioner do not extend to information contained in databases maintained for the purpose of identifying persons eligible to receive benefits. For similar reasons information simply identifying the practitioners and pharmacists who provide goods and services or issue referrals in connection with claims are also excluded.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill restricts the scope of the proposed guidelines to databases as it is not practicable to cover information held on paper files (e.g. otherwise the guidelines would require the removal of patient names from general files containing Ministerial correspondence). However, the Bill does require the guidelines issued by the Privacy Commissioner to specify the circumstances in which creating paper copies of information in computer databases is prohibited.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Notwithstanding those exemptions, the disclosure of such information will continue to be regulated by the general secrecy provisions under the National Health Act 1953,  the Health Insurance Act 1973 and the Privacy Act 1988.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new Section 135AA also specifies that the guidelines will cover information held by an agency whether or not it was obtained after the commencement of the new section.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new section also specifies the content of the guidelines. In particular, it requires the guidelines to cover the ways in which information may be stored; the circumstances under which the making of paper copies of the information in the databases is prohibited; the uses to which agencies may put the information (e.g. to process claims, to investigate fraud); the circumstances in which agencies may disclose information. It also requires that information obtained from claims for medical benefits must be stored in a separate database from information obtained from claims for pharmaceutical benefits; and prohibits linkage of such information except in the way specified in the guidelines. It also requires the guidelines to make special provisions in relation to the storage and retrieval of information that is more than five years old.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any complaint about breach of the guidelines will be regarded as a complaint under the Privacy Act 1988, enabling the Privacy Commissioner to exercise the powers available under that Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a transitional measure, consultations on guidelines already conducted by the Privacy Commissioner in 1991-92 will remain effective under the new section to avoid unnecessary duplication of effort.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also provides for a number of consequential amendments to the National Health Act 1953 and to the Privacy Act 1988.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend this Bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">HEALTH INSURANCE COMMISSION  AMENDMENT BILL 1993</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill amends the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973 to allow the Health Insurance Commission to plan, establish and administer the Child Care Cash Rebate scheme for expenses incurred for work-related child care as announced by the Prime Minister on 9 February 1993.Under current Health Insurance Commission legislation, the Health Insurance Commission is restricted to undertake preparatory work in relation to health insurance or other health related matters only. This amendment to the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973 provides for additional functions for the Health Insurance Commission in respect of rebates for child care costs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the new arrangements, the Health Insurance Commission can plan and establish a scheme which will allow the payment of rebates for child care costs to parents who are working, studying or training or seeking work. Such an amendment to the Act is required to enable the Health Insurance Commission to devote resources to develop and establish systems and procedures to register carers, register eligible families and make payments under the scheme from 1 July 1994. The new arrangements will also enable the Health Insurance Commission to administer a Child Care Cash Rebate as specified by an Act. Such a scheme will be specified in amendments to the Child Care Act 1972 which is scheduled for amendment in Autumn 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Child Care Cash Rebate is part of the Labor Government's comprehensive child care policy which recognises that most parents need quality child care at some stage of their working lives and that they need help with the cost of child care.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Child Care Cash Rebate recognises that the cost of child care is a legitimate expense for parents in earning an income. The rebates will significantly improve the affordability of child care for working parents.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From 1 July 1994, parents using child care while in employment, training, studying or looking for work will be able to claim a rebate for part of their child care expenses. An estimated 230,000 families with 358,000 children will benefit from the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After the first $16 of weekly child care expenses, eligible families will be able to claim 30 per cent of their child care costs up to a ceiling of $110/week for one child in care and $220/week for two or more children.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The maximum Child Care Cash Rebate will be $28.20 per week ($1466 per year) for one child and $61.20 per week ($3182 per year) for two or more children.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Child Care Cash Rebate will be paid for any work-related child care expense for children aged up to twelve years old. Child care expenses incurred in formal child care (eg Long Day Care Centres, Family Day Care, Outside School Hours Care) and in informal care arrangements (eg relatives, nannies) will be eligible for the rebate. Child care expenses incurred in informal care have been included in recognition of the fact that almost two-thirds of working families use informal care, either by choice or because formal care is not available.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Families will be able to claim the rebate by mail or in person at one of 240 Medicare offices around Australia.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During my second reading speech on the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1992 on 16 December 1992, I gave notice that the Coalition would review in government, Division 18 of that Bill relating to unrealised capital gains on listed securities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation's inquiry into Divisions 16-19 of this Bill, a number of important organisations including the Council of the Ageing and the Australian Stock Exchange expressed very significant concerns about this initiative which is due to come into effect on 20 September 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From the start, the Coalition has doubted the validity of the principle underlying the government's proposal. However we were effectively prevented from opposing these amendments due to the political difficulties entailed in disaggregating this proposal from other beneficial measures in such a social security omnibus bill. However we have adhered to our commitment to review this legislation after the election.  After undertaking this review, we have decided to seek to repeal these amendments to the Social Security Act.  This Private Senator's Bill is the first step in that process. A companion Bill which will make similar amendments in relation to the veterans' affairs portfolio will be introduced at a later date.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At present, the value of share dividends is regarded as income for pension purposes. However capital growth is ignored. The effect of the government's proposal was to extend the current rules applying to managed investment to capital gains and losses during the previous 12 months on shares and other securities listed on the stock exchange.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">According to the Explanatory Memorandum for the Bill, this measure would realise estimated program savings of $44.5 million in 1993-94 emanating from reductions in pension payments. On the basis of material provided to the Shadow Minister by the department of social security last year, it is estimated that annual savings would be in excess of $60 million although annual estimated savings as high as $85 million have been quoted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government's main argument when introducing this measure was that it would mean that listed shares and securities would be treated in the same way under the social security income test as managed investments. Central to the government's argument was the fact that in 1988 the parliament had moved to prevent pensioners from circumventing the income test by treating unrealised gains from managed investments as income.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From its consultations with affected groups and individuals, it has become obvious to the Coalition that this measure will neither result in the estimated savings claimed by the government nor introduce any greater degree of equity or fairness into the income and assets tests for pensioners.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">According to Budget Paper No. 3 1992-93, the ongoing assessment of capital gains and losses of listed shares and other securities would result in net savings of $44.1 million in 1993-94, $61.8 million in 1994-95 and $64.1 million in 1995-96.  The Explanatory Memorandum for the Bill estimated that net savings from the initiative in 1993-94 would be $44.5 million.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Information provided by departmental officials to the Shadow Minister late last year indicated that 60,000 social security pensioners would be affected by the measure with an average pension reduction of about $1,100 a year. These assumptions indicate that annual savings would be in the vicinity of $66 million a year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However none of the financial estimates for this proposal include an assessment of the inevitable impact it would have on investment behaviour. The Senate Select Committee on Superannuation quoted the chief economist of the Australian Stock Exchange as stating that a "significant number of pensioners" would sell, adding that he doubted the government's ability to reach its projected savings of more than $85 million a year, "because no-one will have the shares''.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given the angst in the pensioner community about this proposal and the very high effective rates of tax that it would impose on affected individuals, the Coalition contends that it would result in a very significant movement of pensioner assets  away from listed securities to less productive and less liquid investments such as real estate and collectibles.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition believes that this proposal, if allowed to go ahead, would have a similar end result as the government's luxury car tax.  That is, the disincentives against pensioners' investing in listed securities would become so great that the benefit of any savings derived by the government would be more than offset by the detrimental impact on the Australian securities industry. What is more, this measure would encourage both current and future pensioners to dispose of productive assets to maximise their pension entitlement.  This is a highly undesirable scenario at a time when Australia's savings ratio is at a record low level.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government's argument that this measure would result in the more equitable treatment of pensioner investments is fundamentally flawed.  Not only would the government's proposal mean that listed securities would be treated more harshly than investments in other areas such as real estate, art works, antiques, non-listed securities and offshore securities. It would also result in the bizarre situation whereby identical investments in identical listed securities could result in different pension entitlements under the social security income test.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is important to point out a number of the unforeseen consequences of this hastily conceived government proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, this proposal perpetuates the questionable practice in the social security area whereby unrealised capital gains are treated as income under the income test rather than being assessed under the assets test. This approach is in stark contrast to the treatment of capital gains under taxation law.  The proposal runs counter to the Senate Select Committee for Superannuation's recommendation "that the Treasurer and the Minister for Social Security form a working party to examine income tax and social security legislation with a view to maximising the consistency of definitions and treatment of matters of common concern to the two systems and that the report be tabled in Parliament by the end of 1993." (December 1992: page 50)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is important to recognise that unrealised gains on shares are often largely illusory and based on short term, extraneous matters rather than underlying value.  More than any other group, pensioners and retirees place great importance on achieving a maximum degree of certainty in relation to financial decisions. The Coalition contends that this proposal would seriously undermine the certainty in investment decisions relating to listed securities for pensioners. We contend that this erosion in investor certainty, resulting from pensions being increased or reduced on a quarterly basis due to temporary fluctuations in the share market, would be the primary reason why significant numbers of pensioners would divert their financial assets away from listed securities into other often less productive avenues of investment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If a government was putting forward such a proposal, one would think that, at very least, it would ensure that capital gains and capital losses would be treated on an equitable basis. Pension entitlement should not change if capital losses offset capital gains over the assessment period. However the formula proposed by the government maximises capital gains (and hence pension reductions) while minimising capital losses (and pension increases).  This means that a pensioner may have his or her pension entitlement reduced even though there has been no net change in the capital value of the share portfolio.  It also means that identical managed and unmanaged investments are treated differently under the social security income test.  Also of concern to the Coalition is the fact that pensioners with identical portfolios would be subject to differing outcomes simply as a result of the arbitrary assessment dates.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not only would this measure result in the inequitable treatment of listed securities compared with other investments such as real estate and collectibles.  It would also mean that pensioners who invest in publicly listed companies would be subject to this additional income test while those who invest in non-listed companies would not. For example, the Chairman of the Australian Stock Exchange has argued that a pensioner who invests in TNT (listed company) would be subject to the unrealised capital gains income test while a pensioner who invests in Linfox (an unlisted company) would not.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is also a strong argument that this proposal could have the effect of moving many small investors offshore. The Australian Stock Exchange has pointed out that unrealised capital gains on investments on overseas stock exchanges would not be subject to the social security income test.  The Australian Stock Exchange has made considerable headway recently in attracting small investors into the local share market. This proposal has the potential to discourage small scale investment in Australian companies at a time when such investment is desperately needed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition contends that the government's proposal to treat unrealised capital gains and losses on listed securities as income under the social security income test is ill-conceived, fundamentally flawed and poorly researched. It is questionable whether the estimated savings from this initiative would ever be realised and it will not result in any greater equity or fairness in the social security income and assets tests which the Coalition contends are in urgent need of a thorough review. After carefully considering this proposal in line with our pre-election commitment, we intend to move expeditiously to ensure that it is repealed prior to the government's proposed 20th September 1993 start-up date.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Australian National University Act 1991 to ensure that the Council of the University is solely responsible for the application of money appropriated by the Parliament for the purposes of the University and for the management of the University.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian National University is established by an Act of Parliament which specifies that there will be a research school in the field of medical science and that it is to be known as the John Curtin School of Medical Research. It also states that the Australian National University Council should have the entire control and management of the University.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any attempt to actually separate these powers of management and control from the ANU Council would certainly  be against the spirit of the Act. Any attempt to do this without the full knowledge of the Parliament is an attempt to circumvent the will of the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yet this is what the then Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin) has done. This Bill that I have introduced is structured to prevent this blatant abuse of Ministerial power.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the arrangements as intended by the ANU Act 1991, the Australian National University receives its funding from the Department of Education, Employment and Training and then distributes it accordingly. This preserves the autonomy of the University and the integrity  of the John Curtin School of Medical Research, as was originally intended by the founders of the ANU.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the Baldwin plan, the John Curtin School will be singled out and funding responsibilities transferred to the Department of Health. Thus the Department will be able to determine the funding levels for the School, and will be able to influence the research profile of the School. The Department may very well decide that the School's activities should be wound down. Research in Australia has already suffered enough through the machinations of the Australian Research Council and the education profile process. Handing the funding for the John Curtin School over to the Department of Health is paving the way for even more centrally-determined research priorities. This stifles research, particularly that research in which the John Curtin School excels.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There needs to be a plurality of effort and funding in research. In this way money is provided for a variety of projects, including pure and applied research. This allows expansion into different fields that may produce a variety of benefits. Centrally-funded research leads to a blinkered vision of where research should be heading.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is this invasion of the autonomy of a university that must be prevented. Government interference with and intervention in higher education institutions have been both disruptive and destructive. We now have a bureaucratically administered system dominated by ministerial discretion. Independence of the education system has had to make way for bureaucratic favours while the Government enforces policy with the threat of withholding funds. Now this ruinous policy has gone as far as threatening the John Curtin School of Medical Research.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The John Curtin School of Medical Research is a world class biomedical research institute. Its greatest strength is that it nurtures and tolerates long-term research on a diverse range of problems. It is one of the few institutions left that still continues this research&mdash;research which is not politically motivated but which ultimately yields the most beneficial results.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The John Curtin School of Medical Research is part of the Institute of Advanced Studies within the ANU. The Institute is an entity that consists of various research schools which interact with each other. It is that interaction that is very important. The burgeoning areas of science are the interdisciplinary areas. The interaction between the various research schools is therefore becoming increasingly important in joint projects. If these corporate ventures are to succeed then it is essential that the John Curtin School be a full corporate member of the Institute and not be separately funded.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The unique qualities of the John Curtin School should be treasured and nurtured. It is through institutions such as the School that Australia can stay at the cutting edge of scientific advancement. The John Curtin School was not established to be just another arm of government policy. This was clearly not the wish of its founders, who include such eminent Australians as Sir Howard Florey, Sir Mark Oliphant and Dr H.C. Coombs. The latter two have objected strenuously and publicly to the proposed changes. The Government has tried to gain control of the School by circumventing the authority of the Parliament through manipulating the ANU into delegating its powers. This cannot be allowed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister's actions in relation to the John Curtin School of Medical Research have put all Australian universities on notice that the Federal Government will not hesitate to intervene at any level in their internal affairs. We cannot allow the Government to continue this interference in our higher education institutions. The Government has inflicted its policy on the ANU and the School against the wishes of almost all concerned. These actions must be rejected.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill I present for the Senate's consideration today will ensure that funding for the John Curtin School, or for any other section of the University, stays under the control of the University. It will also ensure that the Minister is unable to abridge the autonomy of the University where it is provided for in the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The John Curtin School of Medical Research must remain under the auspices of the ANU as has always been intended. Taking the responsibility for funding the School away from the University and giving it to the Department of Health will compromise its independence and detrimentally affect the world-class work being undertaken there.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This action by the Government will also set a worrying precedent for intervention in our other institutions of higher education. Once the Government feels that it can get away with this invasion of the autonomy of a university they could undermine other universities in a similar way, changing the education profiles of the various institutions. This would be detrimental to the development of the knowledge and expertise that will be essential if Australia is to have any future in a competitive internationalised world marketplace.</PARA>

This action by the Government must be reversed and prevented from recurring. The passage of this bill by the Parliament will ensure that.</PARA>

<PARA>I note that Senator Patterson has introduced a very similar Bill and the debate on it has been adjourned. I suggest that we proceed with this motion now, for the sake of efficiency, because there is no need to rehearse the arguments again in this chamber. In fact, the coalition has made its position public. According to convention, I would incorporate in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> my second reading speech, and Senator Lees and I would not speak to the Bill. The matter of convention arises because, normally in this situation, a private member's Bill cannot be guaranteed the support of the chamber. But we know, as Senator Patterson has just demonstrated, that there would be support for our Bill. I suggest that, to save a lot of time and to have cleared up a matter which the coalition is on the public record as stating that it supports, we could do it right at this moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be ridiculous if, later in the day, Senator Patterson were to introduce a similar Bill to achieve exactly the same purpose. If the coalition really believes in what we are attempting to achieve here, then its members will not play political games but will actually debate this matter now. In fact, if anybody suggests an adjournment of this debate, as convention would require, what they would be doing would be denying the passage of something which is held to be quite dear by, and very important to, a number of people who have contacted me on this matter. I invite coalition senators to make any slight amendments that they think are possible or necessary, I invite them to do anything they like to this Bill, but I invite them to pass it now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Lees and I are not being precious about the content of our Bill at all. We would be quite happy if the coalition were to move to delete the words in our Bill and replace them with its words but we should debate it now&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill is a very straightforward piece of legislation: by repealing Division 18 of the Social Security Legislation Amendment (No.3) Act 1992, it has the effect of reversing the Government's decision to treat unrealised capital gains on listed shares as income for the purposes of obtaining a pension.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats have consistently opposed this move since the Government announced its intentions in last year's Federal Budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind Honourable Senators that the Australian Democrats voted against the relevant provisions of the Social Security Legislation Amendment (No.3) Act 1992 when it came before the Senate in December last year. Senator Meg Lees (the Democrat spokesperson on Social Security) had closely studied the Government's proposal and had consulted extensively with pensioner and retiree organisations and concerned sections of the finance industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She concluded there were serious questions hanging over the Government's proposal and, in conjunction with Senator Cheryl Kernot, she referred the issue to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation for further consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Kernot subsequently submitted a detailed minority report from the Select Committee which recommended the relevant clauses be rejected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, the Coalition (despite public comments from several Opposition Senators and Members condemning the measure), voted for the clauses&mdash;claiming they would "review the legislation when in Government".</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is now May 1993 and the Coalition are not in Government, but the changes to the treatment of unrealised capital gains remain on the statute books. The Democrats want it removed and this Bill does precisely that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I set out our specific objections to the proposal in some detail&mdash;and, in doing so, acknowledge that much of the substance of these comments comes from Senator Kernot's minority report from the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Essentially, the Government proposes to change the way in which pensioner investments in shares are to be treated from September this year. At present, only the dividends paid to shareholders are taken into account for the purposes of the income test for social security payments, while the actual capital value of the shares is included in the assets test.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Until now, the capital growth on listed shares has been disregarded. The Government wants to change all that and provide for net unrealised capital gains on listed securities (other than bonds and debentures) to be taken into account under the income test. Under these changes, losses accrued on listed shares (or similar investments) can be offset against the capital gain over the same assessment period, but cannot be carried forward. When it introduced these changes, the Government claimed it was bringing listed shares into line with managed investments&mdash;where capital growth on the investment is treated as income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are several aspects of the proposal which are highly unsatisfactory. Firstly, it continues the questionable practice in the social security area (which is at odds with taxation practice) of treating an unrealised accretion to capital as income, rather than assessing it under the assets test.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, it discriminates against shares as an investment, because similar treatment is not meted out to other investments (such as antiques, art work, collectibles and other less liquid investments where there could also be an unrealised capital gain which is not to be treated as income).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, shareholder pensioners in similar assets and income positions will be treated differently because of the type of share asset owned. In a submission made to all Senators last year, the Chairman of the Australian Stock Exchange, Mr. Laurence Cox, pointed out this would mean shareholders in a publicly non-listed company (such as Linfox) will not be affected by the change, but investors in a listed company (such as TNT) will be affected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fourthly, it is possible that investors will be encouraged to invest overseas and not in Australia, as those investments are unaffected by the proposed change. For example, Mr. Cox has suggested investors may elect to invest in IBM shares listed on the New York Stock Exchange purchased through an Australian broker, rather than invest in BHP. Accordingly, this move may well discourage small scale investment in Australian companies at a time when such investment is desperately needed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The likely outcome of the Government's move is that many, if not all, of the 85,000 pensioners presently holding share portfolios will sell their shares. Mr. Michael Heffernan, the Stock Exchange's chief economist, stated his belief last year in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> (5 December 1992) that a "significant number" of pensioners will sell, adding that he doubted the Government's ability to reach its projected savings of more than $85 million a year "because no-one will have the shares''.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fifthly, the formula to be used in assessing gains and losses is seriously flawed which, when operating in the volatile world of the share market, will result in substantial inequities. The potential for inequity is graphically illustrated by the examples Senator Kernot used in her minority report&mdash;examples which a large number of pensioners and retirees have informed me are a precise reflection of their own situations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Example 1: A share portfolio increases in value from $10,000 to $12,000 over the 12 month period prior to the day of assessment and pays a dividend of $500. The return (for social security purposes) is $2,500: the increase in capital value ($2,000) plus the distribution ($500). The return expressed as a percentage of the value of the asset at the start of the review year is 25%. Under the formula, the past rate of return is applied to the current assets value. So the past percentage value is applied to the asset value on the day of assessment&mdash;that is, 25% of $12,000, or $3,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this situation, the DSS calculated income figure of $3,000 is $500 more than the actual return.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Example 2: Where share prices fall, the dollar amount of the loss relates to the value of the assets at the start of the review year and the resulting percentage is applied to the lower closing price. For example, in the situation above, if&mdash;in the subsequent year&mdash;the asset value reverts to $10,000, the $2,000 capital loss is related to the $12,000 opening value and the result is a negative rate of return of 16.67 per cent. That percentage is applied to the closing value of $10,000 and a negative return is calculated ($1,667) which may be offset against gains on other securities, but not other source of income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What these two simple examples illustrate is that the formula magnifies gains and minimises losses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the example above, a $2,000 gain was assessed as $2,500; however, a $2,000 loss attracted a credit of only $1,667. This problem is exacerbated where a shareholder has two parcels of shares, one of which rises in value and the other falls in value. If the shareholder's two parcels are each valued at $10,000 and one goes up by $2,000 and the other falls by $2,000 (assuming no dividends are paid), the shareholder's DSS calculated income will be $800 ($2,400 income offset by a $1,600 loss), despite the fact there was no capital gain across the entire portfolio.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The greater the variation in the price, the greater the calculated income (irrespective of whether or not any actual gain has accrued). In other words, pension losses caused by share price increases cannot be fully offset by the same drop in share prices. The Democrats do not believe this can be construed, in any way, as being fair.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it also demonstrates another inequity in the treatment between a person with an "individual" share portfolio and a person who has invested in a managed investment with an identical shareholding. Each gain and loss on the individual's shareholdings are going to be separately assessed and will result in assessable income even if there is no overall net change in the asset value. But the managed investment will have no assessable income where there is no net capital gain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also quite clear that, unless DSS reviews are all carried out on the same day (and there has been no suggestion this will occur), pensioners with identical share holdings and the same dividend income could have markedly different pension outcomes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The operation of the formula makes a mockery of statements by the Government that the move is "fair" because reductions in share values will be able to be offset against gains. That is clearly not a strictly accurate statement&mdash;as many pensioners, retirees, financial journalists and investment advisers have been pointing out since August last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another concern we have is that the unrealised gains are being assessed on the basis of a market assessment and that assessment could actually bear very little relationship to reality&mdash;for example, individual shareholders may not be able to obtain the quoted market price. We are, after all, talking about relatively small shareholders who are likely to be holding unmarketable parcels or parcels of unusual sizes. There may also be family or personal reasons as to why a small shareholder could be restricted in their ability to divest their shares.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, this measure may not only fail to realise the expected savings for the Government (because many pensioners will move to divest their shares prior to the commencement date), it may in fact result in significant additional administrative costs for the Department of Social Security as it tries to keep abreast of market fluctuations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In short, the Government's proposal is poorly conceived and manifestly inequitable. It did not, and does not, deserve the support of the Parliament.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats will be supporting this suspension, as would be consistent with the position I indicated earlier in trying to get this matter resolved today. We would suspend Standing Orders because to bring this matter forward now is to recognise the importance of a sad event which occurred last December. The events on 16 December, just before the dinner adjournment, made that a very sad day: the Government proposed to introduce some penny-pinching legislation which would take advantage of pensioners who happened to hold a few shares and to deem that they had made a profit, made an income on them, if their value rose in the stock market. That paper profit would be called income and applied against their pensions. The coalition at that time, surprisingly, voted for that legislation, saying that it opposed it but would vote for it. That was a very sad day indeed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that today, however, by supporting the suspension of Standing Orders we will bring about the resolution of that very strange situation. At last we have an Opposition that has recognised that it has the balance of power in this chamber, that the Government can propose something&mdash;the Labor Party proposes to take money from pensioners&mdash;and, if the Democrats oppose it, the coalition has to make up its mind, to make a decision. It has done so today and has decided that it will actually resolve this unfair imposition on the 86,000 people in Australia who are affected by this. At last the coalition has recognised that it has the balance of power in this matter. Having voted against the proposal through some contrivance of its political strategy, with the arrogance of thinking it might be in government at this stage, it is now deciding to vote against it. Of course we support the suspension of Standing Orders and we support also the bringing on of the Social Security Amendment (Listed Securities) Bill 1993. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government will not be extending the debate on the question of suspension of Standing Orders. I will be the only government speaker. I want to place on record this view: it has been traditional on a Thursday for the Opposition and the Democrats to use the provisions of the Standing Orders in general business to deal with private members' Bills, as every honourable senator would know. It is true that government business this morning has been hijacked. The Government was not aware of Senator Bell's proposal. The Government did allow Senator Bell to read his second reading speech on his Bill, even though Senator Patterson and, I think, Senator Tierney incorporated second reading speeches.

It is not a question of a courtesy to allow a Minister to incorporate a second reading speech; the tradition is that Ministers in the Senate read their own second reading speeches.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, be absolutely clear that the appropriate time for this debate to take place is this afternoon during the consideration of general business when there is an hour and a half to bring on a private member's Bill. This can be interpreted as nothing more than a deliberate attempt to derail the government business program that is before the chamber at the moment. That is not to say that the issues contained within Senator Patterson's Bill and Senator Bell's Bill are not important; I am not going to the substance of the issues, but I am going to the argument of the capacity of both the Opposition and the Democrats to utilise their own time to do this as is ordinarily adopted in this chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>

It does not mean that the issues raised are not important; I am sure that all honourable senators would agree they are, but there are opportunities to bring forward this debate in a way that does not derail all the processes of the chamber and government business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would suggest to Opposition and Democrat senators that that is not an appropriate way to go. We will be opposing and dividing on the issue of this suspension. I do not want to prolong the debate on the motion for suspension, but I do point out what I believe is a very significant breach in the conventions that have operated in this chamber for a long period of time. I am disappointed that the Democrats, particularly Senator Bell, did not at least have the courtesy to communicate to the Government through the Government Whips in this chamber what was being proposed. I would say to Senator Bell that I think that is just a modicum of decency and courtesy which would be expected. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, some of that needs to be answered. I find it quaint to hear Senator Faulkner talking about the conventions of the chamber, but I shall leave that aside. He has to recognise what has been done here this morning, in that the Democrats not only did not tell the Government what they wanted to do and achieve this morning, but also they did not tell us. They are accusing us of not being serious about the Social Security Amendment (Listed Securities) Bill 1993 that Senator Patterson brought into the chamber earlier. The Democrats could have at that time indicated that they wanted to pass our Bill immediately and they did not do so.</PARA></TALK.START>

I agree with Senator Faulkner that this is not the time to be doing it, but I believe that the Democrats are putting us in a position where we are being forced to deal with it at a time that we recognise is not the appropriate time. </PARA>

What we have here is a Minister of the Government saying, `We cannot debate this matter now because we, the Government, with our largess have given you this time and you should use that time'.

It is an urgent matter, and I would remind honourable senators that it is well within the capability of this Senate to determine that this is an urgent matter and that it will deal with it now and not when the Government wants to deal with it.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I set out our specific objections to the proposal in some detail&mdash;and, in doing so, acknowledge that much of the substance of these comments comes from Senator Kernot's minority report from the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Essentially, the Government proposes to change the way in which pensioner investments in shares are to be treated from September this year. At present, only the dividends paid to shareholders are taken into account for the purposes of the income test for social security payments, while the actual capital value of the shares is included in the assets test.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Until now, the capital growth on listed shares has been disregarded. The Government wants to change all that and provide for net unrealised capital gains on listed securities (other than bonds and debentures) to be taken into account under the income test. Under these changes, losses accrued on listed shares (or similar investments) can be offset against the capital gain over the same assessment period, but cannot be carried forward. When it introduced these changes, the Government claimed it was bringing listed shares into line with managed investments&mdash;where capital growth on the investment is treated as income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are several aspects of the proposal which are highly unsatisfactory. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, it continues the questionable practice in the social security area (which is at odds with taxation practice) of treating an unrealised accretion to capital as income, rather than assessing it under the assets test.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, it discriminates against shares as an investment, because similar treatment is not meted out to other investments (such as antiques, art work, collectibles and other less liquid investments where there could also be an unrealised capital gain which is not to be treated as income).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, shareholder pensioners in similar assets and income positions will be treated differently because of the type of share asset owned. In a submission made to all Senators last year, the Chairman of the Australian Stock Exchange, Mr. Laurence Cox, pointed out this would mean shareholders in a publicly non-listed company (such as Linfox) will not be affected by the change, but investors in a listed company (such as TNT) will be affected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fourthly, it is possible that investors will be encouraged to invest overseas and not in Australia, as those investments are unaffected by the proposed change. For example, Mr. Cox has suggested investors may elect to invest in IBM shares listed on the New York Stock Exchange purchased through an Australian broker, rather than invest in BHP. Accordingly, this move may well discourage small scale investment in Australian companies at a time when such investment is desperately needed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The likely outcome of the Government's move is that many, if not all, of the 85,000 pensioners presently holding share portfolios will sell their shares. Mr. Michael Heffernan, the Stock Exchange's chief economist, stated his belief last year in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Age</EMPHASIS> (5 December 1992) that a "significant number" of pensioners will sell, adding that he doubted the Government's ability to reach its projected savings of more than $85 million a year "because no-one will have the shares.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fifthly, the formula to be used in assessing gains and losses is seriously flawed which, when operating in the volatile world of the share market, will result in substantial inequities. The potential for inequity is graphically illustrated by the examples Senator Kernot used in her minority report&mdash;examples which a large number of pensioners and retirees have informed me are a precise reflection of their own situations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Example 1: A share portfolio increases in value from $10,000 to $12,000 over the 12 month period prior to the day of assessment and pays a dividend of $500. The return (for social security purposes) is $2,500: the increase in capital value ($2,000) plus the distribution ($500). The return expressed as a percentage of the value of the asset at the start of the review year is 25%. Under the formula, the past rate of return is applied to the current assets value. So the past percentage value is applied to the asset value on the day of assessment&mdash;that is, 25% of $12,000, or $3,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this situation, the DSS calculated income figure of $3,000 is $500 more than the actual return.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Example 2: Where share prices fall, the dollar amount of the loss relates to the value of the assets at the start of the review year and the resulting percentage is applied to the lower closing price. For example, in the situation above, if&mdash;in the subsequent year&mdash;the asset value reverts to $10,000, the $2,000 capital loss is related to the $12,000 opening value and the result is a negative rate of return of 16.67 per cent. That percentage is applied to the closing value of $10,000 and a negative return is calculated ($1,667) which may be offset against gains on other securities, but not other source of income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What these two simple examples illustrate is that the formula magnifies gains and minimises losses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the example above, a $2,000 gain was assessed as $2,500; however, a $2,000 loss attracted a credit of only $1,667. This problem is exacerbated where a shareholder has two parcels of shares, one of which rises in value and the other falls in value. If the shareholder's two parcels are each valued at $10,000 and one goes up by $2,000 and the other falls by $2,000 (assuming no dividends are paid), the shareholder's DSS calculated income will be $800 ($2,400 income offset by a $1,600 loss), despite the fact there was no capital gain across the entire portfolio.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The greater the variation in the price, the greater the calculated income (irrespective of whether or not any actual gain has accrued). In other words, pension losses caused by share price increases cannot be fully offset by the same drop in share prices. The Democrats do not believe this can be construed, in any way, as being fair.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it also demonstrates another inequity in the treatment between a person with an "individual" share portfolio and a person who has invested in a managed investment with an identical shareholding. Each gain and loss on the individual's shareholdings are going to be separately assessed and will result in assessable income even if there is no overall net change in the asset value. But the managed investment will have no assessable income where there is no net capital gain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also quite clear that, unless DSS reviews are all carried out on the same day (and there has been no suggestion this will occur), pensioners with identical share holdings and the same dividend income could have markedly different pension outcomes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The operation of the formula makes a mockery of statements by the Government that the move is "fair" because reductions in share values will be able to be offset against gains. That is clearly not a strictly accurate statement&mdash;as many pensioners, retirees, financial journalists and investment advisers have been pointing out since August last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another concern we have is that the unrealised gains are being assessed on the basis of a market assessment and that assessment could actually bear very little relationship to reality&mdash;for example, individual shareholders may not be able to obtain the quoted market price. We are, after all, talking about relatively small shareholders who are likely to be holding unmarketable parcels or parcels of unusual sizes. There may also be family or personal reasons as to why a small shareholder could be restricted in their ability to divest their shares.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, this measure may not only fail to realise the expected savings for the Government (because many pensioners will move to divest their shares prior to the commencement date), it may in fact result in significant additional administrative costs for the Department of Social Security as it tries to keep abreast of market fluctuations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In short, the Government's proposal is poorly conceived and manifestly inequitable. It did not, and does not, deserve the support of the Parliament.</PARA>

It should not be too long&mdash;perhaps a week or something like that&mdash;and then we should bring it back and deal with the committee stage. The Bill, in fact, is very brief.

The full operation of this legislation will not occur until later on in the year. Nonetheless, right at this moment pensioners are selling shares or being advised to sell shares in anticipation of the way in which the law will operate, and those people are being very significantly disadvantaged. I think it is also for that reason that it is important that we get this to a vote at the second reading stage; so we get on the record in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> that there is solid support from the senators of the Opposition and the Democrats for this Bill, and so the matter will proceed and cannot just simply disappear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only are pensioners selling their shares or being advised to sell their shares because of the imminence of the application of this legislation, but also the legislation does not apply to foreign shares. It applies only to shares in Australia. We want pensioners with small amounts of excess funds to invest in Australian companies, not to go and invest in foreign shares. We want them to invest. We want that money put to productive use. The fact that they may be selling shares in Australian companies and shifting that money elsewhere is something that needs to be addressed urgently. </PARA>

The pensioners themselves have remained confused and concerned. </PARA>

There have been people who have taken their much needed extra capital from Australia and invested it in foreign companies. That effect is starting to happen. On the strength of that, any examination by the Government of the effect of this measure would probably show that it is revenue neutral: we are going to lose as much as we are going to gain. It is going to cost us as much to administer it as we will gain, or even more. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as notice is concerned, and with regard to knowing what is going on and being aware of this legislation, on 16 December the argument was well rehearsed. Senator Lees, in her contribution to the debate in this place on that date, made sure that honourable senators all knew and were fully informed about what the effect of this was. In spite of that full exposition by Senator Lees, the coalition decided in favour of a faulty strategy, to vote with the Government. I would have thought that honourable senators who then were interested in the debate would have informed themselves by looking at Senator Lees's speech at that time. That speech, by the way, incorporated a large slice of the dissenting, minority report made by Senator Kernot when the matter was considered by the Senate committee.

In writing to the newspapers about that float, I made the observation, and I think it should be taken on board by the Government, that, as with the partial float of the Commonwealth Bank, the sorts of investors who are attracted to longstanding institutions&mdash;major retailers in Australia and major components of our economy such as the Commonwealth Bank&mdash;and who are relied upon to take up a significant proportion of that float, are the so-called mums and dads of the investment community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I warned in my communication on this matter that the mums and dads will not be there in this Woolworths float. The mums and dads are the very people to whom such an investment will be most unattractive because of what this Government has done and because of what the coalition has done in supporting the Government. I think there is an urgency to pay regard to that and not to distort our financial community by removing such a significant and relied upon component of major floats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not suggesting that it be done for the benefit of the Woolworths float, but I am suggesting that the further selling or abrogation of responsibility by the Government is typical. The further 19 per cent sale of the Commonwealth Bank will be affected in exactly the same way. They are the two significant factors which I think the perpetrators of this penny-pinching crime against pensioners were obviously not fully cognisant of. However, they jolly well should have been because it has a huge effect. As Senator Coulter said, and quite rightly, a clear, strong indication should be given today to those who are interested in this area. It can be given when we vote on the second reading. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Lees and I understand the concern for the procedures of the Senate and for the disruptions. I do not apologise for any of that. This matter had been well worn and well rehearsed when we brought it in here today. Senator Lees and I believe that, while paying some regard to the propriety of conventions here, conventions need to be kicked occasionally, not for the sake of not being boring but for the sake of getting something done. We are actually trying to resolve this situation. If it means that at a later date, not too far hence, we need a committee stage and a third reading stage, that is fine. But let us get it clear now what is going on here today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;While I understand what Senator Chamarette and Senator Harradine said earlier, I do not think the Government is in any position to accede to the honourable senators' wishes. If we do, I think we will get rolled, and one wonders whether it is worth another procedural vote. I would suggest that it is not. I think we should wrap up the second reading today&mdash;I will make some remarks on the issue before that&mdash;and proceed to the third reading next week. That is probably the only course of action left to us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to say to the Senate that I have not yet read Senator Patterson's brilliant contribution, as she suggests. I shall do so and attempt to answer it next week&mdash;that is, if there are any points she has raised in that contribution that are not covered in the note I was given this morning. I will go into some explanation on this question of foreign shares which has been raised today by both Senator Coulter and Senator Bell. Hopefully, I can go into some more detail next week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to come to why we are here. When income and assets tests are designed for a pension system such as ours, the design is done with equity in mind. It is not always perfect; it is not always easy, but that has to be the underlying principle. The assets and income test that pensioners now must face has stood the test of time pretty well. We managed to get it pretty right when we first introduced it and, over time, when anomalies have come up we have acted to get rid of them. That is all that this legislation does. What we had was a situation where pensioners could be treated better by investing in shares than by, say, putting money into managed investments. All that we have sought to do in this legislation is to make sure that, no matter what the pensioner might care to invest in, he or she can expect the same treatment. So one investment is not better than another; they are all supposed to be treated the same. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While it has been claimed that those who are pensioners with shares are being singled out, I think the real truth is the exact opposite. For a number of years shares have been treated concessionally. In the past, pensioners who have had shares have been able to be treated singly, and now that anomaly disappears. What the change does is bring the treatment of shares into line with the treatment of most other kinds of investments. For example, equity trusts where people invest in shares indirectly should be treated&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not sure how many pensioners own them. I suspect that, of Australia's l.4 million pensioners, there are not too many worried about the price of antique clocks. I am certainly not. To get back to what I was attempting to say, however: if we look at equity trusts, where in fact people invest in shares indirectly, there is absolutely no reason why pensioners who are in those now should be treated differently from those who invest in shares directly through the share market.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been suggested that it is also unfair to assess unrealised capital gains. We have to look at what has been underlying the assets tests since they began, and that is that those pensioners with assets are able, if they choose to do so, to realise them. The problem is for those without assets. They are going to be treated pretty unfairly if we simply allow the accumulation of assets by those who have got the resources to accumulate them. The gains represent an increase in resources that can be used by pensioners to provide income support for themselves if they so wish. If we are going to have a needs based social security system&mdash;and that is what we have got&mdash;it is only fair that they utilise those gains before they call on the taxpayers to give them support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does not mean, as I think Senator Bell and Senator Coulter were suggesting, that shares suddenly become a bad investment for pensioners. What it does mean is that the pensioner-friendly treatment of shares will be removed so that investment in shares is based on the intrinsic merit of the investment and not on some concessional treatment by the Department of Social Security. It means that pensioners who invest in shares do not have an advantage over those who are using their savings to generate some income rather than simply generating unrealised capital growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whether pensioners do sell shares to access this growth and supplement their income or whether they just retain the growth as an increase in the value of their investment will be a personal choice, but taxpayers should not be called on to provide a higher level of income support than necessary to such people if they choose not to utilise the gains. I doubt very much that all pensioners will sell their shares, as is being claimed today. They are not all going to race out and sell their shares. Some of those pensioners have been holding them for decades and they have held them through all sorts of changes in the way shares were treated before they were pensioners. They are not going to change the way they do business now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rules that will apply to shares have applied to most managed investments for five years. A pensioner with funds in a managed investment knew that there would be gains taken into account and that his pension would be reduced accordingly. Over that time, some 128,000 pensioners have invested in managed investments on the basis of their merit as an investment. Those 128,000 pensioners have managed to do it with managed investments, and we will find that those who hold shares will do exactly the same thing. Let me tell the Senate the numbers so that we get the argument into some perspective. There are about 60,000 Department of Social Security pensioners and about 24,000 Veterans' Affairs pensioners affected by this change. Overall, less than 3 per cent of the pensioner population will be affected. I hope this debate does not become a replica of the first assets test debate nearly a decade ago, when the Opposition sought to frighten all pensioners although only a tiny percentage of them were ever going to be affected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also has to be noted that those most affected are those with large shareholdings. Some pensioners have $100,000 invested in shares. When the vast majority of pensioners have nothing invested in shares and precious little invested in anything else, we have to ask ourselves whether it is fair for pensioners with $100,000 invested in shares to be able to avoid any kind of pressure to realise any of the gains. If they choose not to realise the gains, should the people with absolutely nothing have to subsidise them? The Government came to the conclusion that the answer to that was, clearly, no. Pensioners with a small number of shares&mdash;and that is the vast number of the 60,000 who are affected anyway&mdash;are hardly going to be affected. The change is not going to affect them to any significant extent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Savings of some $80 million in a full year are going to be raised by this measure. I think that $44 million was claimed by the Opposition, but I am advised that the savings in a full year will be $80 million. That amount of money deserves serious consideration. I would think it is in the interests of all pensioners, when that kind of money is available to be collected from those who have been treated concessionally over the years, to want to see the Government do it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can be judged by what we do to help those who are in the greatest need. That includes the increase in pensions that was provided in January of this year and the extension of eligibility for fringe benefits that was implemented in April to pay for those kinds of measures. The money does not come out of the air. It has to come from somewhere. I cannot think of too many more appropriate places than this place. Over 50 per cent of pensioners affected by the share change will benefit from the change I have just mentioned, receiving benefits of up to $20 a week. Pensioners with shares will benefit also from the accompanying measure to allow reductions in the value of shares to be offset against gains on shares or managed investments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not certain whether these matters are to be raised in Senator Patterson's as yet unread speech, but there was a press release from Mr Ruddock yesterday in which he raised a number of matters that I think ought to be cleared up. Firstly, he claimed that pensioners will redirect their savings to overseas shares because the change does not apply to those shares. But, of course, it does. In saying that it applies to overseas shares, it should also be noted&mdash;as I am sure Senator Coulter and Senator Bell would be well aware&mdash;that there are not too many pensioners with great company structures set up in the tax havens of the world to avoid taxes. It is not going to be a difficult task to locate the vast majority of those who seek to do it and to take it into account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, there is a claim that the measure will impact on the floating of shares in public enterprises. Senator Bell has added his weight, if that is the correct term, to this by referring to the Woolworths float which is about to take place. But, as I said previously, the change will ensure that pensioners wishing to invest in shares make their decision based on the intrinsic merit of the investment, not on any concessional treatment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I for one would not be prepared to say that there is no intrinsic merit in investing in a Woolworths float. Woolworths is a great company and its management has achieved such an increase in market share in the course of the last decade, to the detriment of some very well-known competitors, that it would be difficult to see pensioners walking away from the intrinsic merit of that investment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has also been a lot of comment about the method that will be used to implement the measure. Most of that comment is based on a misunderstanding of the way in which the income test works in practice and has worked for years. That method has been endorsed as the appropriate way of operating the income test by the High Court. The basic principle is that the income test is intended to measure the financial resources available to a person at a given point in time. It does not and it should not assess past dollar gains or compensate for past dollar losses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It ought to be noted that pensioners with shares are around five per cent of all shareholders. Most of them have got small holdings. It ought not be the case that pensioners who have had experience with these investments for years are simply going to run away because of a change in the treatment. It will make the investments marginally less attractive but it will make the tests that are applied to pensioners more equitable across all pensioners&mdash;those who have got the funds to invest in shares and the vast majority of pensioners, the 97 per cent, who have not. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I regret in some ways that we have had to debate the Social Security Amendment (Listed Securities) Bill in this way, on the second reading speech. It has occurred as a result of, maybe, some misunderstanding between the Democrats and me about the order in which the formal motions were put this morning. We did not actually run in the order on the paper and I think Senator Bell thought that I had jumped to my feet a little earlier than he had. He missed the fact that Senator Tierney had actually moved his formal motion, the President was looking around to see whether there was another formal motion and I stood. That was not meant to gazump Senator Bell, but that was the way it may have been interpreted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find it interesting that Senator Bell has entered this debate at this stage. Obviously he got some pressure from some pensioners during the election campaign, but he did not speak on this Bill when it was going through before. We had been having negotiations with Senator Lees's office about the passage of our two Bills and we had hoped that we would have a smooth passage of them, being able to debate this Bill in a manner which gave the Independents time to see it. But that was not what happened and we are now in the second reading stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I reject the comments that the Democrats made about our having had some sort of vision on the road to Damascus and changed our view about this. When I spoke on this Bill, taking the Bill through on behalf of the then shadow Minister, Mr Connolly, I expressed our concern and said that after the election we would be looking at reviewing that Bill. We were not in the position to review it from government but we decided that, since we had made that commitment, we would review it from opposition. That is the reason we have taken this action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats have said that we should have done so at the time, but it was in an omnibus Bill and there was a gun being held at our heads that, if we did not agree with this, the other benefits flowing from the measures in the rest of the Bill would not go ahead. So we were in a cleft stick, or between a rock and a hard place. Because that provision was not coming in until September 1993, we agreed with that part of the Bill in order that the other benefits would flow, and gave a commitment to review it. So I reject the assertion that Senator Bell makes, that we had not actually taken an interest in this and were not concerned about it. We expressed concern and I expressed concern in that speech. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I listened to what the Minister for Health, Senator Richardson, had to say. I believe that there ought to be a total review, so that equity is established; but patching it up or trying to do things in the way he has done does not make it equitable. I do not agree with all his assertions that people will not change. Also, there are other pensioners coming on stream, many of them with superannuation payouts that are not sufficient to live on but are sufficient to invest. They will be discouraged from doing it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also have to look at the future. I do not believe, nor do many other people in the community believe, that the Government will make the savings that the Minister claims. Let me say that the social security department has had a very poor record on estimating what gains it will have, and Senator Richardson knows that. I will not reiterate them all here in the chamber, though I could; but the department has been a long way off the mark in its predictions of savings, and so has the Health Insurance Commission. For predictions of savings, I would give the Department of Social Security about two out of 10 at the moment&mdash;not a pass&mdash;so I do not believe the savings in this. I believe the Minister needs to put a much better argument. He needs to put up a review of the whole area, because there are anomalies. We know about the Auditor-General's report on land. Is the Government going to look at unrealised gains on land? Is it going to look at unrealised gains on art works? The Government needs to get its house in order and make sure that we have some standard and that we have some equity in the system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to take Senator Richardson up on the fact that he said this will come on next Wednesday. There are a lot of older people who are affected. Despite the fact that the Minister says the figure is only five per cent, there are a number of them. He makes out that they seem to be the rich, but they may be the more frugal: those who have saved and saved and saved to have that $100,000 to invest. He should not make out they are running around with huge amounts of money. Some of those people have been very frugal and put that aside through their savings, and that is what we are trying to encourage Australians to do. We need every bit of saving we can get in this country. I hope that the Minister will bring it on as he has promised on Wednesday so that we can deal with this issue and so that there can be some predictability for those pensioners who have been concerned about this issue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, but I think the Minister said that it had been circulated. I do not think it has been. I have got several concerns regarding this particular change to the procedure. To begin with, it sets out very clearly that the Senate will never again have the right to debate the reports of the Senate committees. I cannot imagine why the Government would want to cause that to occur except that it seems imbued with a sense of power over there, even though it has got only 30 senators in the new Parliament. We will have 36. It still believes that the estimates committees should not be entitled to full debate about expenditure and what goes on in the estimates committees. We have in the past had a watered down system that the Government does not seem to think has worked. It is still wanting to cut time. I know that some of my colleagues would agree with that and would be voting the opposite way to me on that issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I foreshadow an amendment to the motion that the Committee of the Whole should be permitted to debate the committee reports in the Senate. In that amendment I am not looking to debate all the expenditure in the Estimates. I have a feeling that Senator McMullan may agree with me in the end. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator McMullan" NAMEID="5I4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UJ4">Senator WALTERS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am just about to be. I am not asking for all expenditure to be debated. I am not asking for all the parts of the motion to be debated. But in the past we have had reports chastising a department for late answers, for wrong answers or whatever. All sorts of comments come up in the report from an estimates committee that must be brought to the attention of the Senate. There is nowhere for them to go if they are not. So if the estimates committee believes that the department has been obstructive, it says so in its report. If the committee believes that perhaps the chairman has not carried out the full obligations of the chairmanship as the committee believes they should have been carried out, that can be contained in the report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the report cannot be debated in the Senate, there is absolutely no place for it to go so that the Senate as a whole can agree or disagree, as the case may be, with the report and say that the department was negligent in doing whatever the report claims it has done. I believe it is very important that those reports of Senate committees not be disregarded, as is presently suggested by the Government's motion that we are looking at. That is only one of the many concerns I have but that is one to which I foreshadow moving an amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing is that, since this Government has been in power, many of the rights of honourable senators have been taken away. We used to be able to speak for an hour. Some people would remember Senator Cavanagh. On a very technical Bill, when he and Senator Wright were in the Senate, an hour was a more appropriate time for people of that quality to debate a Bill. I am sure that the Deputy President would remember many occasions when Senator Cavanagh and Senator Wright were debating something. They often tangled in the Senate. Those debates would take considerable time, and rightly so. As a result of a speech going for over half an hour, some good amendments would come out of the debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But that time has been cut from an hour to half an hour. Our estimates committee procedures in the Senate have been cut considerably. Many of the rights that honourable senators had previously have been cut. We are gradually getting to the stage where the Government says that we cannot even debate the estimates committee report. That is over the fence. We know that the Australian Labor Party does not approve of the Senate, to begin with. It has had that in its policy for many years. While it is no longer in the written policy, Senator Coates, Senator Evans and many others on that side say that it is of no value. Indeed, Mr Keating has said that there is no value in having a Senate. That would put all the power into the hands of the Prime Minister of the day, and that is where the Australian Labor Party, when it has been in power, has said it should be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has to be understood that the Government does not have the numbers in the upper house. Therefore, it must respond to the wishes of the Senate, not of the Executive Government. It is most important that the Senate does not allow the Government to take away the right to debate reports of the estimates committees here. At the moment, it is allowing only amendments and requests to be debated and is refusing to allow debate on the reports themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In my view, the downgrading of the Committee of the Whole is wrong&mdash;and this has nothing to do, let me stress, with my amendment. It ought to be maintained as it is&mdash;but then I was disappointed when it was changed from the original intention and procedure to what it is at the moment. Again, I am disappointed that the intention of the Government is to downgrade that even further and not allow a full debate. I know some of my colleagues disagree with me on that particular issue, but I am sure that they would agree that the report itself should be debated, and that they will not give up gladly the opportunity of debating the committee report. I hope the Government agrees that is an important thing to abide by and will agree with my amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to oppose the motion and to support Senator Walters's foreshadowed amendment. The abolition of the Committee of the Whole is but a further step in reducing the capacity of the Senate to scrutinise the expenditure and outlays of Australian taxpayers' funds. It will be argued that the debate of the Committee of the Whole which has thus far taken place will be transferred to the supplementary or additional debates of the estimates committees. Of course, that is just not the case. There is a vast distinction between debating in this chamber and the questioning of Ministers here and that of inquiring of them certain information in the estimates committees. It is not only a truth in reality, it is also a truth in perception.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not without consequence to observe the distinct difference in the demeanour and attitude of Ministers when they are being asked questions in this chamber, from that in the estimates committees. Very rarely can a Minister sustain the position of simply refusing to answer questions put to him or her in this chamber for any length of time. In the estimates committees, however, if the Minister thinks that a question does not deserve a response, there have been numerous occasions when they have declined to answer the question and suggested the questioner move on to the next item. Also, while a chairman presides over the meetings, contributions are made by a number of other senators, invariably because of the multiple combinations of political parties of partisan persuasion. So the general conduct, the general environment and the general attitude in the estimates committees are vastly different from those of the Committee of the Whole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effect of abolishing the Committee of the Whole would be, of course, to limit the debate. I have always had the view that it is a fundamental trampling upon the democratic processes and the functioning of the Parliament to reduce the speaking time available to members and senators. I have never supported the reduction in speaking time on any occasion and I shall not be doing that in the future. I think it is fundamentally wrong in principle for any member or senator to make a judgment&mdash;which is inevitably subjective&mdash;about the quality of the debate and the contribution and the relevance of the debate of any other member or senator. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If that is to be the case, the strength of that argument can only be sustained by moving a gag in this chamber. The fact is that there is grave reluctance to do this on the part of any particular political party, except in extreme circumstances. Invariably, that only prevails at the end of the session when we are running into a deadline and there are a number of Bills to get through. There has always been a grave reluctance on the part of any political party to move a motion to deny any member or senator speaking time. The reason for that grave reluctance is because it is an imposition on one of the fundamental purposes for which senators are elected to this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note on page 7 of the report, `Estimates Committees and Appropriations Bills', 19 December 1991, under option (4) it is suggested that these additional hearings could be held outside the Senate's sitting times, but the sitting of the Senate could be suspended to allow the hearings to take place if the Senate's program of business allowed. The report goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It would be open to the Committees to prescribe in advance specified time limits for the hearings.</PARA>
<PARA>Given the quite natural partisan nature of estimates committees where there are those on the committee seeking to scrutinise&mdash;for altruistic or political purposes, probing and testing and questioning&mdash;we have an equal number, on some occasions, who see their primary function to preserve the Government and to protect the Minister. So to suggest that these additional committee hearings would have a specified time limit would, of course, be at the behest and at the pleasure of the majority and the majority inevitably would be the Government. So we are making a partisan decision about the level of contribution that the chamber as a whole can make. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is some question as to whether or not the Bills would proceed past the second reading stage prior to the supplementary hearings. On page 8 under the heading, `Progress of the appropriation bills', it is claimed:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After the second reading, the further stages of the proceedings on the bills could be adjourned until the supplementary hearings had concluded, and the bills could then be speedily passed</PARA>
<PARA>It would be open to the Senate, as it is under the current procedures, to pass the appropriation Bills before the estimates committees had concluded their deliberations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, that has the effect of formalising the marginalising of the supplementary hearings and, inevitably, unless there are amendments or requests regarding the appropriation Bills, the legislation will proceed through the chamber to its conclusion while the additional estimates committee meetings are being held. So they will be marginalised and once they are marginalised their irrelevancy will become apparent and the purpose of pursuing them will, of course, diminish. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that under `preferred option' the committee observes that it believes that these proposals will overcome the problems identified in this paper without diminishing the rights of senators or the ability of the Senate to scrutinise thoroughly the Estimates and appropriation Bills. I have to say, with respect, that is an absolute nonsense. I can see no justification for that argument. The truth of the matter is that these proposals are not intended to make the process more efficient. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course it is. But for the time being, I am prosecuting my argument. We have healthy debate over here. I do not recall the last time I saw any Labor senator cross the floor on debates on Standing Orders, notwithstanding the fact that convention has it that it is a free vote. Senator Ray always used to proudly skite that it was a free vote over there, but that they all had the brains to make sure they voted as one. That leaves us in the absurd position of some of my colleagues exercising their right and, inevitably, losing. However, be that as it may, the object of this report is not to make the process more expeditious or more efficient; it is simply to cut down the time available for the scrutinising of the expenditure and outlays of government revenues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The net effect of that will be to ensure that the level of scrutiny by the Parliament will be significantly reduced. As I said yesterday, I would have thought the findings of the Western Australian royal commission, in which Senator McMullan presumably has more than a passing interest, would be a salutary lesson to those who believe that there is something clever, something slick, and something smart about expediting government business through the chamber with the least amount of impediment or the least amount of objection by what might be described as a recalcitrant opposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The facts are not getting in the way of the argument. The truth of the matter is that, if the Government managed its affairs and the business of the Parliament properly, there would not be a problem. Senator McMullan is now saying to the chamber that it is more important for legislation to be passed than for legislation to be scrutinised. If there has to be a conflict between whether legislation is scrutinised properly, examined carefully, and subjected to second deliberation, and whether it is a question of getting the damned legislation through because the result of the legislation is more important than the scrutiny, we will always go for the latter proposition. That is the object of the argument. The contempt in which this Government holds the Parliament is shown by the way we are now governed by fear. We are now governed by public press release.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Treasurer wants to change the legislation fundamentally, that happens as a result of him issuing a press statement. The legislation becomes effective from the date of the press statement and then when it is introduced it is made retrospective. That is because of the contempt of this Government for the parliamentary process, in no way better manifest than in the observations of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) that this chamber&mdash;this States house, this house of second deliberation and consideration, this chamber of sober reflection, this chamber which has more time to scrutinise the legislation carefully&mdash;is, in his words, `unrepresentative swill'. It is no secret that if the Prime Minister had his way he would abolish this chamber. This comes from a political party that argues that the level of corruption alleged in the States comes from a bicameral system in one circumstance. The truth of the matter is that because of the vanity and the arrogance of this Government, its members are much more concerned for their legislation than they are for having it scrutinised or having it right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Madam Acting Deputy President, it gravely disappoints me that we are confronted with this proposal. I take it that the Democrats will be supporting the Government, for reasons which I definitely do not understand. The Democrats have always very properly argued that the forum of the Parliament is the proper forum for the scrutiny of the Government. As a minor party not likely to have to concern itself with the treasury bench, the contribution the Democrats make, as Don Chipp always said, is to scrutinise legislation. Perhaps he put it in a more crude way; he said, `Keep the bastards honest'. One of the fundamental instruments available to the Democrats is the proper scrutiny of the Government in its conduct and in its legislation. To that extent, the Democrats quite properly have never been reluctant to use select committees whenever an issue has come up which they have considered deserved further attention; to the point that the then Minister for Finance, Senator Walsh, threatened that he would cut off funding if the legislation was inhibited as a result of further scrutiny and further examination by a select committee of this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To that extent I find myself in a state of confusion as to why the Democrats will support this, why the Democrats propose to reduce speaking time from 20 minutes, why the Democrats are supporting the reduction of the number of standing committees from nine to seven, and why the Democrats chose not to support my commendable amendment yesterday to increase the number of estimates committees from six to eight. I just hope that the Democrats will do as they always claim, give this proposal the serious consideration it deserves, and support Senator Walters' amendment. To do otherwise would be simply to reduce the capacity the Democrats have in this chamber to maintain their relevancy. That is true of us, and that is true of all parties other than the Government. To accept these nonsensical proposals is simply to hand a further instrument to the Government to disguise, to camouflage and to hide its legislation and its outlays from public, proper and careful scrutiny. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as the substantive motion goes, the Procedure Committee on 19 December 1991 adopted a report into estimates committees and the virtual re-running of estimates committees in the chamber in the Committee of the Whole. I was a member of that committee at the time&mdash;I still am&mdash;and I thought it was a very good report. I think we would all have to agree that substantial time is spent on looking at appropriations, and so it should be. It is a very big Bill. It is basically the estimate of the amount of money the Government is going to spend in the next year and what it is going to spend it on. It is very important, and it should be scrutinised closely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, we have to keep in mind that we have been sitting now for a day and a half and we have had no government legislation before us yet, and it does not look like we will get any today.

This is not monumental but I recall that in the Procedure Committee it involved quite a bit of discussion, which was quite interesting. At one point somebody asked what happened in the House of Lords, I believe. We have decided to take out the hyphens from `Deputy-President' and from `Deputy-Clerk' and `Clerks-Assistant'. I am really pleased to see that we are doing that. I do not think there would be any disagreement around the chamber about removing this hyphen. I think this is an excellent point and I am glad to see it in there. I will be voting for it, as will all other Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a real problem with standing order 61 regarding the consideration of government documents. As everybody in this chamber would know, if a government document originates in the other place we often do not get to see it until just before we have to speak on it. That is something we were looking at fixing. I believe that Senator Vanstone, on the Opposition benches, was doing the same sort of thing. We put up a proposal to the Procedure Committee to have a look at this. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On a trial basis, yes. The first report of the Procedure Committee stated, concerning the proposed amendment suggested by Senator Kernot on behalf of the Democrats, that the effect of the proposed amendment would be that, when government documents are not presented until after 12 noon&mdash;as is always the case on sitting Mondays and Tuesdays, when the Senate does not meet until two&mdash;consideration of those documents under standing order 61 would be deferred until the following sitting day. If there were deferred documents to be considered on any sitting day as well as documents tabled on that day, the time for consideration of both groups of documents would be 60 minutes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That would allow time for honourable senators to examine documents which were not tabled until after 12 noon before the documents were debated. The rationale applies particularly to those documents which are not made available to honourable senators by the government before they are tabled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem that the Procedure Committee established with that proposal was that sometimes topicality of these documents is very important. We agree that sometimes it is. The committee suggested that, as an alternative, it be provided that, when the Senate sits at two, government documents may be tabled before Question Time. There would then be at least the 60 minutes taken by Question Time and usually the 90 minutes taken by Question Time, petitions and notices for examination of those documents not made available to honourable senators before tabling, before the documents were debated under the standing order. To prevent the tabling of government documents delaying the commencement of Question Time, it could be provided that documents may be tabled by a Minister by handing them to the Clerk without any announcement to the Senate. The Chair would announce the earlier tabling of the documents when government documents were called on for consideration under the standing order. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to address the matter of the cost of justice. It is an extremely topical item to be discussing this week, which is Law Week. I believe that all legal practitioners, judges and politicians should consider the rising cost of justice, which has put the legal system beyond the reach of most Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I gave notice of my motion yesterday and when I sought its formality today, to its credit, I received support from the Government, even though some of the measures that I proposed, no doubt, implied criticism of what the Government has or has not done in the area of containing the cost of justice. The coalition parties, however, saw fit to oppose the measures that I suggested should be taken to make the legal system more accessible to all Australians rather than to perpetuate the present position in which only the very rich or the very poor have access to the courts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us now look at some of those measures which the Opposition obviously thinks are not worthy of consideration. The first measure which, I believe, is absolutely essential if we are going to get anywhere with the containment of costs is to have independent tribunals with consumer representation to fix lawyers' fees and court charges. The legal profession must be just about the only profession that is able to fix its own remuneration. It is quite clear that, if we are to have any confidence in the need to have certain costs charged and certain fees imposed on people seeking legal advice and legal representation before Australian courts, the fees charged by lawyers should be subjected to impartial analysis. Yet there seems to be a great reluctance to accede to that request and there seems to be a great push from the profession to retain the privilege of fixing its own fees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other proposition that I wish to put forward is closely allied to that. It is the establishment of independent complaints tribunals for the legal profession and, for that matter, for judges. Various inquiries of the Parliament&mdash;most particularly the cost of justice inquiry carried out by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs and the Joint Committee on Certain Aspects of the Operation and Interpretation of the Family Law Act&mdash;have received a number of submissions and a lot of anecdotal evidence. No doubt every honourable senator in this chamber has received correspondence from members of the public who have been charged enormous amounts and who have had to suffer the consequences of mistakes made by members of the legal profession who have represented them. They have found that, if they want to do something about it and complain about Caesar, they have to go to Caesar to complain about what has happened to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had quite extraordinary cases brought to our attention. I have had one where a member of the public had a dispute over $1,900 in a building industry case and the legal bills within 18 months or so amounted to $65,000. Yet when that person sought intervention from the Law Institute she was told that she could go before the Law Institute tribunal but that the most she could expect in terms of damages or satisfaction was $2,500. The other choice she had was to go back to court and sue the legal practitioner who had represented her and whose mistakes of judgment, she felt, and I tend to agree, had&mdash;</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0X4">Senator SPINDLER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There was no fraud and no real negligence, but there were mistakes of judgment which I believe have made the legal practitioner culpable in allowing clients to run up that sort of a bill. I believe it is intolerable for a person like that not to be able to go to an independent tribunal and bring that complaint, and to then be faced with the choice of either getting very inadequate compensation or risking yet more money to go to court and be represented by yet another member of the legal profession.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have also had, I believe, a number of cases where people have alleged bias on the part of judges. It is time that we recognised that the judiciary has certain responsibilities in our community and that they should be subject to scrutiny. It is also time that we recognised people who feel that they have had&mdash;to put it bluntly&mdash;a raw deal on the basis of bias by a judge or even negligence where a judge has totally disregarded evidence that he or she should have taken into account. Those people should not be forced to go to yet another appeal, which very often could be to the High Court at tremendous expense, but should be able to have such a complaint scrutinised by an independent tribunal. These are matters that I have brought up repeatedly in both the family law inquiry and in the cost of justice inquiry but, as yet, the other members of those inquiries have not seen fit to support such measures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now turn to the question of legal aid. In this time of rather limited government finance it must be said, yet again, that both State and Commonwealth governments have the prime responsibility to ensure that members of the community who cannot afford, of their own means, to retain lawyers, must receive legal aid. We find that, currently, more than 50 per cent of applications for legal aid are rejected. For most of them, it is not because the case has no merit but rather that the funds are inadequate. In relation to that situation, I find it rather strange that that particular source of funds, which is under the control of the legal profession, is strangled and is not allowed to flow freely into the legal aid coffers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now refer to the interest being derived from solicitors' trust accounts. In all States, except Tasmania, there exists legislation which allocates the disbursement of interest collected, at a lower rate, I might say. The banks are getting some profit out of that, too. That is collected into a guarantee fund. Part of that fund, in the first instance, certainly is allocated to legal aid. However, what I call the mistakes by the black sheep of the profession are also compensated out of that fund. When solicitors, due to fraudulent behaviour, have caused losses to people who have put funds with solicitors for investment, or simply in their trust accounts, these defalcations are made good out of the interest on solicitors' trust accounts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That money does not belong to the legal profession. It belongs to the people who are members of the community and who have come to solicitors as clients. The legal profession claims to be self-regulating. If that is so, it must look after its own black sheep and it must not use money that belongs to the public. That money should go in toto to legal aid commissions to assist people in getting access to our legal system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These and other matters are of great importance. The attempts of the profession to retain all manner of privileges, which can be described only as restraint of trade, make it imperative in my view that the Trade Practices Commission should be given the power to supervise the legal profession and to hold it to account. Other examples of why I think that is absolutely essential include the advertising of fees. We are told that there should be a free market in all goods and services to get the best service at competitive rates, yet there is clearly no knowledge on the part of consumers when it comes to legal services. Even where it is permitted for solicitors to advertise their fees&mdash;and barristers certainly are not permitted to do so at this stage&mdash;there seems to be a cultural barrier. I have yet to see widespread advertising of comparative fees and costs by members of the legal profession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe it is clear that in this day and age we can do without Queen's counsel. That is a title which almost automatically results in a capacity to charge a higher fee, and in many jurisdictions to employ a junior and thus have two counsel. It is not two counsel for the price of one, it is really two counsel for the price of 2 1/2. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are obviously other measures that can be taken. The legal profession is not the only factor that affects the cost of justice. I think parliaments might wish to look at legislation in simple English. I regret that the work of the Victorian Legal Reform Commission, which through its chairman, Professor David Kelly, has devoted a great deal of time to path-breaking work producing legislation in simple English, has been so brutally curtailed by the Kennett Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another area is the contribution that judges can make. Clearly, increased case management by judges is needed to ensure that issues are identified early, that documents and evidence are provided quickly, and that the delays of the court are not used as a tactical measure to starve out the less financial party to a dispute. I am glad to say that during the inquiries of which I have been a member various representatives of the judiciary have expressed willingness to engage in more decisive case management, and are in fact already doing so. Finally, there is the alternative that our legal system should offer to people who are faced with a dispute or who feel they have suffered an injustice: the mediation process, which should be fostered as an alternative to the legal profession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by expressing again my regret that the Opposition has seen fit to oppose the motion putting these measures on the table. I trust that in future days the Senate as a whole will contribute to the pursuit of these measures to bring down the cost of justice to a level at which every Australian can have access to our courts. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. One can find 50,000 definitions for ministerial responsibility, and Senator Hill knows it. The one I like and support, because I think it is the one that is the most sensible, is the one I quoted yesterday which was espoused by Waterford. But I will go over the ground again. In a modern parliamentary democracy&mdash;and I had this view in opposition&mdash;the only sensible, reasonable and responsible definition of ministerial responsibility is this: a Minister has to behave with propriety and responsibly, in the true sense of the word&mdash;in other words, those two conditions, as I said yesterday, cover things like deliberately misleading the House on an issue which, of course, is an instant hanging offence&mdash;and a Minister has to behave competently.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The charge of which I was accused yesterday was in fact of being deficient in not sitting down and reading this particular tender document. I have just discovered that I signed seven determinations last week for about $50 million worth of roads contracts. I will not go back and second-guess and sit down like a corporate secretary and read all those again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, to conclude, a Minister is rightly held responsible for the administrative failure of a department when there has been a systemic failure of administration while he has been the Minister and he has failed to correct it. For example, where a report from the Auditor-General indicates that there is a serious failure in the department, it has been brought to public attention, and the Minister does nothing about it; he should correct it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I will tell honourable senators what the facts are in the midst of all this hyperbole&mdash;and everyone is having a great time with this. I came into this portfolio three years ago as a junior Minister in its transport side. In the whole time that I was in that portfolio there was not the slightest evidence to me, or indeed the public, of any systemic failure. Furthermore, it is a matter of fact that, not in terms of process but in terms of the advice I received from the department, that period has resulted in successful massive changes in shipping, aviation, road and rail transport that have provided enormous benefit for this country and will provide significantly more in the next three-year program in transport.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first occasion on which I became aware that there was a serious problem of administration in the broadcasting division of my department was last Friday. I immediately took action. I asked the secretary to the department to commence an investigation into that breakdown. I have now moved to set up an inquiry into that. The investigation has been going on since Friday. I took instant action the minute I knew that there had been a breakdown; the first one that has occurred since I have become a Minister in this portfolio.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PF4">Senator COLSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I refer to the expense in providing security to the joint US-Australian facility at Nurrungar during the recent Easter protests. Given that the expense was incurred by the Australian taxpayers, is it reasonable that those taxpayers be made aware of the importance of the Nurrungar facility?  If the Minister agrees with this proposition, can he outline to the Senate the continuing importance of these joint facilities?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="248" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very happy to do so. The general purpose and function of the joint facilities at Pine Gap and Nurrungar were, of course, described by the then Prime Minister in his statement to Parliament on 22 November 1988, but it may be very useful, in a post-Cold War context, to explain again their continuing importance. The original impetus to establish Nurrungar during the Cold War was, of course, to provide early warning of ballistic missile attacks and that vital role did help to prevent nuclear war. While the threat of nuclear confrontation is now hugely reduced as a result of recent developments, hundreds of ICBMs with thousands of nuclear warheads do still exist, so the original early warning role of the defence support system remains, to that extent, entirely valid.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The end of the Cold War has brought new international and regional uncertainties of which we are all acutely conscious, including the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the means of delivering them, such as shorter range missiles. During the Gulf War, Nurrungar played a very large part in helping to defend civilians in Israel and Saudi Arabia from attack by such missiles. Maintaining this capability will help to deter the proliferation of ballistic missiles around the world, including in our own region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moreover, the facilities make a vital contribution to the increasingly important post-Cold War agenda of collective security. Nurrungar and our other facility at Pine Gap continue to make a really quite critical contribution in monitoring and verifying the arms control agreements which have transformed the strategic landscape in recent years. A clear opportunity now exists to build international cooperation to prevent war. The US, Russia and others, including Australia, have been exploring in recent times a global protection system, with one option being to share data on ballistic missile launches. Nurrungar would be a key element in such a system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the regional level, Nurrungar may yet have a further significant role. Australia may conceivably come to rely more than ever on this facility if a ballistic missile threat were to develop in our neighbourhood. On the other hand, the early warning capabilities of Nurrungar offer possibilities for new orders of cooperation with direct benefit to our neighbours' own security. The monitoring of arms control agreements, the discouraging of ballistic missile proliferation, the probabilities for defence of cities against missile attack and opportunities for new forms of regional cooperation are all on our agenda in the post-Cold War era.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is also worth making clear that Australians are fully integrated into all aspects of operations at Nurrungar, because there continue to be claims to the contrary. Of the approximately 450 personnel at the site, slightly more than half&mdash;240 at the moment&mdash;are Australian. Australians also fill at least two of the four crew commander positions&mdash;at the moment they fill three&mdash;and a RAAF wing commander is the deputy commander of the facility. We participate fully in all aspects of the operation of the facilities, including tasking of them, to provide information in Australia's particular security interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, those like Senator Spindler who argue, however sincerely, for the closing down of these facilities have yet to explain how world security or regional security would be better without them. The Government has absolutely no doubts in this regard. We need to be prepared to back up our strenuous efforts internationally to achieve and develop support for arms control measures by demonstrating that we are also willing to support active measures, such as the missile launch detection capability served by Nurrungar, which help to guarantee compliance with international arms control obligations and to promote non-proliferation objectives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government also recognises the increased opportunities for the United Nations, particularly the UN Security Council, to play a constructive role in securing peace and enhancing collective security in the post-Cold War era. We have encouraged the UN to enhance its collective security role, including through peacekeeping and preventive diplomacy. Again, the joint facilities support these and all our other initiatives to secure a more lasting and durable peace in the post-Cold War era.</PARA>

A number of people and a number of international media are recognising the significance of what Australia is doing and it is contributing to starting to change the international image of Australia.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Everybody&mdash;most honourable senators here have had the opportunity to travel overseas&mdash;will have been frustrated at the image that so many people have of Australia as more of a backwoods country than the high-tech country that we are entitled to be regarded as.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Transport and Communications. I ask the Minister the question that was not answered when I raised it in yesterday's debate on the pay television tender farce: did the Minister's department tell him at any stage of the high level advice that I know it received long before the closing of tenders for satellite pay TV licences that the process was going to be corrupted by a series of collapsing bids from shonky applicants?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The short answer to Senator Baume's question is no, that advice was not given to me. It is interesting to have a look at the debate yesterday. Opposition members were saying, `Oh, well, it was perfectly proper for the Minister to be apart from the process after it started';  my `negligence' was that I did not sit down and go through the determination and second-guess the department. But it would have been perfectly proper after the process started, when the box was open and the bids started going in, to have involved myself in what the bids were, whether they were shonky or whether they were fair dinkum.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I asked the secretary to my department to speak to the officer concerned this morning, after the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> article appeared quoting her. The departmental secretary has advised me that the statement attributed to the head of the broadcasting division of the department is accurate. But nothing hangs on that, and the public record shows it, for the simple reason that the entire bidding process, from start to finish, has been knee-deep in speculation about who was going to bid, whether the bids were going to be of this nature or that nature, or what. After the process started, I kept apart from that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As they say in this business, history will judge me on whether I made the right decision. This is not very pleasant, of course; but, as I said yesterday, and I meant it, I would rather be in here being attacked for not intervening in the process than be in here being attacked for intervening in the process. I personally would have had great difficulty defending that in terms of my own views on these subjects. I said yesterday, and I repeat it, that not only did I decide that I was not going to have any involvement in terms of this tender process but also I told the senior staffer in my office that he was not going to either. I also spoke to the departmental secretary last year and said that this would be an arm's length process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All I am saying in response to Senator Baume's question is that the officer has confirmed that the statement she has made is accurate, that is, that approaches were made. Months ago&mdash;and this was revisited on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS> last night&mdash;I had representations on the central policy issue of whether it should be a price-based or a merit-based process. All those arguments were run again last night.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by saying that there has been confusion in some reporting that the criticisms that are now being made by these people are criticisms of the five per cent deposit not being put on. They are not. The criticisms are that they thought this was going to be a disaster because a beauty contest was not entered into. In all the examination I did of this issue, and it was extensive, before the Bill came into the House last year, if on balance I had come to the conclusion that a government or a government agency was a better test of a company's financial viability in the marketplace, I would have gone for that merit-based system. If I had come to the conclusion that a merit-based system was better in terms of not burying the process in litigation, I would have done that. The classic example is the third commercial television licence in Perth; but there are hundreds of examples, not just here but around the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difficulty with merit-based processes, with respect, is this: does a price-based process, on balance, on the records that one can look at, produce a better return for the asset? The honest answer to this is yes, it does. Does a price-based process, at the very least, produce as good a result in estimating the future financial viability of a company as a government or government agency? The answer to that question is, on balance, yes, it does. It certainly produces no worse a result, because there have been failures in both.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The history of this industry, and Senator Baume knows this, is that it has been buried in litigation, not just here but around the world. This has been a feature of the industry for 20 years, and I want this inquiry to investigate it later, as I said on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS> last night. That does not go just for this administration. All the concentration at the moment is on this Government, rightly, and this Minister, but licence issuing for broadcast licences has been absolutely deluged in litigation going back 20 years. As I said, the former communications Minister, Tony Staley, a man for whom I have the highest regard and respect, and I deal with him in his role as a public broadcaster, had a decision taken against him by the High Court of Australia.</PARA>

Secondly, the user of the child care shall have to produce a receipt as evidence of actually having bought or, if you like, paid for that child care.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to the question on notice from Senator Boswell regarding the level of access to RAS in Queensland</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Support for farmers under the Rural Adjustment Scheme takes account of the realities of operating a rural business in Australia. Over time there will be movement of producers into and out of the industry and the RAS is aimed at smoothing this processes so that the competitiveness and efficiency of the industry is not reduced.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consequently RAS support is targeted at those farmers who have long-term prospects for profitability, but who require some short-term support to improve their productivity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the exceptional circumstances provisions, support is available for carry-on purposes when a farmer is facing difficulty due to certain exceptional circumstances. The recent national allocation of $50.6m is directed at producers suffering hardship from the exceptional circumstances of the prolonged drought in parts of Australia and by the depressed prices for wool.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In Queensland, under the exceptional circumstances provisions, additional Commonwealth funds of $11.3m have been provided under the RAS to provide interest subsidies of up to 100% for farmers</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">this $11.3m consists of $6.3m for specialist wool growers and $5.0m for drought. This is in addition to a further $9.5m provided to Qld for drought since Sept last year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In answer to the Senator's specific questions, I can advise him as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">1. I have been advised by the RAS administrators in Qld that for the period 1 July 1992 to 31 March 1993, the approval rate for all RAS applications is close to 65%, whilst the approval rate under the existing Special Drought Assistance is 95%</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">clearly this indicates that the assistance is meeting its target because the majority of applicants are being assessed as eligible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">2. The Senator's question assumes that if 40% of producers are not receiving assistance, then they will all leave the industry. I should point out that people are assessed as ineligible for RAS for two principal reasons.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">One is that they have the capacity to support their debts and operations out of their own income or assets&mdash;a situation in which it is inappropriate for the Commonwealth to be providing subsidies.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The other is that they are found not to be profitable in the long-term. In this case, farmers may be eligible for Farm Household Support, which provides support to farmers either while they arrange the sale of their property, or supports those farmers who believe they have a future in the industry but are unable to obtain further commercial support. Farmers who move out of farming may also be eligible for the increased re-establishment grant of up to $45 000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">3 &amp; 4. The number of producers who will be assisted under the package will depend on the number of applicants who are assessed as eligible and the level of interest rate subsidy offered to each successful applicant. Funding was provided to each State Government on the basis of an independent assessment of need by the independent RAS Advisory Council after consultation between the Commonwealth and each State Government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">5. Producers who are assessed as eligible for Farm Household Support will not also be eligible for RAS support. However any producer who has previously received RAS support may be eligible for Farm Household Support if they cease to be eligible for RAS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">6. It is difficult to forecast just how many producers will actually receive interest rate subsidies for the first time under the exceptional circumstances provisions. However, Queensland report that an increased number of producers received assistance last year for the first time and they expect this trend to continue.</PARA>

<PARA>Today in Question Time I asked the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins), by way of a supplementary question, whether he was aware that the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet received similar high-level advice, as his department did, of the prospect of collapsible bids corrupting the tender process, and that this advice was received after tenders opened but in plenty of time before the close of tenders to allow this potential shambles to be corrected. Maybe the Minister was too busy chatting with his colleagues to listen. I then asked whether the Prime Minister's department informed the Department of Transport and Communications of this advice that it had received. I will go through it slowly for you. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad you got it this time, because your answer in Question Time showed that you had no comprehension whatsoever of the significance of the question. Will you table&mdash;through you, Mr President&mdash;whatever advice the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet received from high-level people in the industry that this corruption of the tender process would proceed; that is, if PM&amp;C advised your department, or indeed advised you?  Why did the Prime Minister not go over your head once again to intervene to fix up this mess, or did his department not tell him either? Here we have a situation where it is not simply that your department did not tell you&mdash;according to you&mdash;but that the Prime Minister's department told neither you, nor the Prime Minister, nor, apparently, your department, because you had no preparedness to respond to the question I asked you.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not for you to say, `Don't hold me responsible for the actions of the Prime Minister's department', which was your response to the supplementary question, when you were eventually required to answer the substance of it by the President, because you had no intention of doing that at all. Having said that you are not responsible for what the Prime Minister's department does, I simply ask you, and the Opposition requires an answer: did your department receive such advice from the Prime Minister's department? If so, will you table it? Is that too complicated for you to answer, Minister, because it was at Question Time?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a right to know what was going on in this area. In the past, the Prime Minister has been only too willing to interfere when you have made a mess of things in your department. He would move straight in. Even when the permanent head was away, he would ring up the deputy secretary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, there was a major shambles. Before tenders closed, you had an opportunity to correct the situation because at that point you had not received tenders. At the time you were advised of the shambles, tenderers had not committed themselves to an irreversible situation. You had an opportunity, and your department had an opportunity which it decided not to exercise, to correct a shambles. Your department did not think it was worth telling you because you said that you did not want to know. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the classic bottom-of-the-harbour answer. The people in the bottom-of-the-harbour situation were told, `Don't ask and you won't be told any fibs'. You did not want to know what the situation was. The simple fact is that this shambles could have been corrected before tenders closed and before any tenders were submitted. If that had happened, you would not now be threatening to put before this Parliament retrospective legislation changing the rules after the game has started. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You could have fixed it, Minister, had you had the knowledge and the desire to have the knowledge. You had no desire to have the knowledge. You admitted today in this place that you had advised your office that you did not want to know about anything or change anything, even when it was inevitable, had you known, that there would be a shambles. You had the power to fix it&mdash;not by intervention in the sense of damaging intervention, but by intervention to restore the normal tendering process that you say you had inadvertently changed. By your act of commission, which was signing a document changing the normal rules, you had changed the rules. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before tenders closed you had the capacity to fix it up. You instructed your office that you did not want to know anything and, clearly, your department was aware of the fact that you did not want to know anything. Apparently, your department then did not convey to you the views of senior members of this industry that this farce was going to proceed&mdash;that there were going to be collapsing bids put in by shonks. Despite your department knowing it, and despite the Prime Minister's department knowing it, nothing was done to fix it up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You, Minister, are where the buck stops.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Collins has had heaps of time to give us his erudition. We have not had any to date, so perhaps he will have the courtesy to listen in the chamber to the verdict of this place, instead of showing his total and utter contempt for his ministerial responsibility by marching out. He is marching out because he does not want to know, in the same way that he did not to know what was happening in his portfolio.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Collins has told the Senate on numerous occasions that he was not at fault because his department did not tell him. But he has also told us that he did not want to intervene. So it follows that, even if his department had told him, he still would not have done anything. As Senator Baume has said, he did not want to know, so it was irrelevant whether or not he was told. He had already made it clear to the department that he did not want to know about these things. He wanted the department to handle it so he did not have his hands dirtied. So whether he was told or not is no defence, given that he has already stated very clearly that he did not want to intervene. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, even if he had been told, he would not have done anything about it. That is the problem. Even if he had been told, he already told them that he was not going to do anything. So, at that point in time he had created the very opportunity for this situation to occur. By sticking his head in the sand, by saying, `I don't want to know what is going on in my department in case I get blamed for it', he has created a situation where this nation has been laid open to spivs and con men to perpetrate frauds on the public and where we are an international laughing stock&mdash;all because he did not want to assume the ministerial responsibility that comes with the red leather. That is the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If he had been willing to say, `If there is a problem, come and see me', then it might be an excuse that he was not told. But it was very clear he did not want to know. So whether or not he was told, the responsibility lies with Senator Collins. His contemptuous treatment of this Senate today matches the contemptuous nature in which he has dealt with his ministerial responsibility. He has stuck his head in the sand and it follows, as night follows day, that if his head is in the sand, his backside deserves a kick. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) in response to a question without notice asked by Senator Colston this day relating to the Nurrungar defence facility.</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister offered a number of reasons why Australia should continue the so-called joint facility arrangement at Nurrungar. I say `so-called' advisedly because I believe that it is well and truly on record that the base is under effective United States control. The Australian personnel, including the deputy commander, play an extremely subservient role, and there are a number of cases on record where not only were we not consulted before a decision was made and were not involved in the decision but also, very often, we were not even told about it. I shall return to that point shortly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the reasons that the Minister advanced as to why Nurrungar, in its present form and organisation, is still useful is the contribution it can make to collective global security. I am quite ready to admit that this may well be a useful contribution but, if that is so, it should not be under the control of one particular nation; not the US or even the Australian nation, but the United Nations. Australia could do nothing better than to further and strengthen the role of the United Nations and its current peacekeeping efforts and the growing responsibility it accepts in that area. Australia should transfer control and supervision of Nurrungar to the United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other reason offered by the Minister was regional security. If regional security is a concern, surely it should be under the control of the Australian Government rather than a government that is rapidly withdrawing its forces and its concerns from this particular region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I return to the point I made before. It is quite clear that the United States has effective control of Nurrungar and if it is true, as the Minister says, that there is an early warning role against nuclear attack from other quarters of the globe, by other nations, then the truth is that Australian citizens are likely to be the target of a first attack. If people wish to launch a nuclear conflict&mdash;a conflict that involves the United States&mdash;the first thing they are likely to do is to knock out United States' communications facilities. That should be very obvious, as has always been acknowledged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that our Government is exposing Australian citizens to that particular risk in the potential conflict which we would not originate, which we would not know about, and which we certainly would not have a part in. It is for all those reasons that we should review our participation at Nurrungar and should either abolish it or radically change its organisational structure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth is that the Australian taxpayer currently contributes $30 million to the upkeep of the Nurrungar base. My question to the Minister is: what do we get for it except risk to Australian citizens? Not only do we get risk to Australian citizens, we are also apparently prepared to accept the very</PARA>
<PARA>serious infringement to our sovereignty by allowing a foreign base on our soil over which we have no control and which puts our citizens at risk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At a time when the Government is moving very rapidly towards establishing a more independent form of government for Australia&mdash;a republic, which the Australian Democrats support as a general principle&mdash;it seems extremely curious that we are prepared to give up effective sovereignty in this particular way. I will not raise the question of economic sovereignty and the way we open Australia up to overseas imports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by saying that I believe it is untenable and not worthy of a nation that seeks total independence, and rightly so, to allow another nation to infringe its sovereignty by having a military base on our soil over which we have no control. </PARA>

<PARA>Accepted with modification. While direct monitoring of kangaroos is a State Government responsibility, the Commonwealth sees itself as having a role to assist the States, where feasible. The high cost of aerial surveys already places heavy demands on the resources of State agencies and the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service (ANPWS). Rather than to arbitrarily assign survey frequencies, surveys should be more frequent in States where harvests take a high percentage of the population and less frequent where harvests take low percentages.

The Government agrees that there is scope for expanding export control over kangaroo products and sees inspections at fleshing works to fall within the responsibilities of the National Wildlife Protection Unit (NWPU). The issue of controls on the export of native wildlife had been the subject of comprehensive reviews of the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1982. Recommendations contained in this review together with those of the Senate Select Committee will form the basis of operations for the NWPU. The development of uniform containers for export and the process of sealing would however require more detailed investigation along with other alternatives such as tattooing to identify individual skins. The NWPU will give a high priority to investigations to consider the most cost effective means of preventing illegal exports.</PARA>

<PARA>Accepted in principle. The Commonwealth notes that fleshing works are currently licensed under relevant State legislation. The benefits of additional Commonwealth licensing need to be investigated further by the National Wildlife Protection Unit but the proposal could provide an appropriate means of regulating the export and preparation for export of kangaroo products. Licence control regulations would provide the means for establishing any packaging or skin identification requirements determined from the above investigation.</PARA>

Depending on the results of that research, a decision should be made by the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Tasmanian National Parks and Wildlife Service on the future use of poison to kill wallabies in Tasmania.</PARA>

<PARA>(17, 18 and 19) Accepted in principle. While the Government agrees that the most humane means of harvesting kangaroos should be employed it notes that no currently approved export programs involve poisoning. The Government also notes that the determination of control methods outside the export harvest is a State responsibility. As Tasmania currently has no approved export program, the issue of wallaby poisoning is a matter to be decided by the Tasmanian Government. The Government does however support research being undertaken by Tasmania, or in association with Tasmania (under the proposed Kangaroo Research and Survey Supplement) to quantify the impacts of 1080 or any other poison on wallabies in areas where it is currently used.</PARA>

<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Government Response</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>Accepted. In signing the National Strategy for Ecologically Sustainable Development, Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments have agreed on the objective of improved kangaroo management at the national level. Governments have agreed to work towards an integrated and co-ordinated kangaroo management strategy which is based on development of national guidelines for kangaroo management, the use of market mechanisms and the early finalisation of National Game Meat Standards.

<PARA>Accepted in principle. This is a matter of State responsibility and is essentially already in place. While the Commonwealth accepts the principle that property inspections should be made wherever possible, it recognises the limitations to State resources and believes that the need for inspections should be assessed by local State officers.

<PARA>Noted. This is a matter of State responsibility which is not generally supported by the States. The Commonwealth accepts the principle of the recommendation but believes that the idea of subsidising a commercial shooter requires more investigation, with States mostly viewing the proposal as being impractical. In the first instance, States may consider expanding the role of local officer advisory functions to facilitate contact between landholders and commercial shooters. A commercial arrangement could then be made by the landholder to subsidise the operations of the shooter directly.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make a few comments about the Government's response to the report of the Select Committee on Animal Welfare. I believe that the response comes as a result of the actions of the Chairman of the Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs, Senator Burns, who queried the Government in recent times as to why we had not received a response some five years after the report was handed down. I suspect that that is why this response has come forward.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of the recommendations and replies put forward from the Government are only accepted in principle. Most of the matters referred to are matters which relate to the States. It seems to me that a delay of five years in replying to this report certainly rests with the Minister concerned, and it is something that the Minister responsible for that portfolio should have taken in hand long ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I was appointed to the committee in 1987, it comprised such famous names as Senator Cooney from Victoria, Senator Morris, Senator Brownhill, Senator Devlin, and Senator Norm Sanders from the Democrats. Prior to that we had Senator George Georges, who was the original chairman of that committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This inquiry into kangaroos started in 1983 and it took five years to put the report together. It seems coincidental that it has taken five years for the Government to respond to it. If it was relevant in 1983, I guess from what I have seen in the media over recent weeks and months that the matter of kangaroo culling is just as relevant today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the time of the development of this report, all sorts of claims were made by animal liberation and animal welfare groups around Australia. I remember the first accusation made to us in the early days was that we had been nobbled by farming groups and lobby groups and that the report we brought down would not reflect the true views of all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One major concern of the Australian Conservation Foundation was that we develop national legislation to cater for the proper management of kangaroos and other wildlife populations. I am pleased to see in this response that the Government has accepted that recommendation. The Committee's recommendation to the Government was that the Commonwealth and States and Territories work out on a cooperative basis over time a system for the national management of kangaroos. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last five years prior to this response being presented, the national strategy for ecologically sustainable development was signed. Part of it involved the State and Territory governments agreeing on the overall objective of improved kangaroo management at a national level. The major concerns of the major animal welfare groups that were shown in the early days seem to have been answered through the Government's acceptance of responsibility in that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also interesting to note that Senator Georges was heavily involved in the committee in those days. Of course, he is no longer a member of the Senate. I noticed just the other day that he and his wife featured on the front page of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Telegraph Mirror</EMPHASIS> as having clocked up $33,000 worth of travel. I note further in the article that he is the coordinator of the national kangaroo campaign. It is pleasing to see that, even after all this time, Senator Georges is still showing a keen interest  in  the  kangaroo problem  within Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to see that recently in Canberra our Governor-General fell foul of the animal welfare lobby in dealing with his problems with kangaroos. For some reason or other, the legislation in the ACT seems to be a little different from that of the other States and from the committee's recommendations. A reading of the Governor-General's problems shows that he certainly got into hot water, if not kangaroo tail soup, when he suggested that he would cull the kangaroos and have a kangaroo feast afterwards. That comment certainly brought upon him the wrath of some animal liberation groups.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems that the Governor-General has an oversupply of some 150 kangaroos at Government House, which is obviously creating many problems. The multiplying of the kangaroos at such a rate makes it easy to understand why we have such a problem all around Australia. As my colleagues Senator Cooney and, particularly, Senator Burns, who is chairman of the rural and regional affairs committee, would know, the overabundance of kangaroos was manifesting itself when we had inspections around Australia to look at the effects of the drought on the farming communities and what could be done about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">European settlement and the provision of more pasture and water have combined to vastly increase the number of kangaroos in Australia&mdash;to huge numbers. Figures in the report of five years ago&mdash;I suspect they would be much higher now&mdash;indicate that the number of kangaroos in Australia was then reaching 32 million. The effect of kangaroos on the degradation of land through their competing for pasture with the few sheep that are now left is quite obvious when you move into the back blocks of the western districts of Queensland and New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Burns would recall, one of the farmers on one of the farms we visited had become insolvent and had moved to Sydney. He left his son on the farm, but the son earns a living shooting kangaroos rather than making his living from tending sheep. In recent times, kangaroo culling and the use of kangaroos has become a very important industry in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Kangaroos are a great source of high protein, low fat meat. The hides of kangaroos are sought after for their leather. I am pleased to see in the Government's response that the committee's recommended method of culling kangaroos by shooting has been accepted. If this method was accepted in the Australian Capital Territory, Mr Hayden would not be faced with a bill of $40,000 to sterilise a few kangaroos. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is ridiculous in this day and age, when it has been accepted that sheep and cattle can be slaughtered for human consumption, that kangaroos, which are in plague proportions, cannot be culled. Because of public reaction, at Yarralumla the Governor-General is required to spend $40,000 out of his budget to give vasectomies to a few male kangaroos. It is ridiculous when the Government could employ some professionally trained shooters who would solve the problem in one night. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no surprise to me that we still see, in the media, reports of well meaning people who are pushing the point of view about perceived cruelty to kangaroos. I note in a letter to the editor from Jacqui Kent, who is a member of the National Kangaroo Campaign in Queensland, that she criticised Tasmanians. That is one of the reasons I am on my feet today. In this letter she stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a new World Heritage Management Plan has been passed which will permit packs of dogs to rip into wallabies on the high Central Plateau of Tasmania. These animals may also be blasted away by shotguns. Neither of these can ever be considered as "humane" methods to kill our wildlife.</PARA>
<PARA>If one takes that article as it is, one would be gripped by those very stirring words. In reality, shotguns are used in Tasmania because of the topography of the State. To say that we use high powered rifles particularly in built-up areas where the major problems with kangaroos occur is quite unrealistic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This evidence came out in the committee's kangaroo report. I think it is a pity that these people who are making so much noise and criticising the Governor-General in what he wants to do do not read the report because it took five years to collect all the information. The response we have today has taken five years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee spent quite a deal of time assessing the most humane way to cull kangaroos. The decision to use centre-fire rifles with professionally trained shooters was unanimous until Senator Sanders changed his mind on the day when the report was presented. It was thought that this was the most acceptable way to cull kangaroos. The committee recommended:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that commercial shooters kill kangaroos for the carcasses and not for their skins only. . .</PARA>
<PARA>I am pleased to see that the Government has accepted that recommendation. The committee took the view that allowing the shooting of kangaroos just for their skins would be a huge waste of a very valuable product&mdash;high protein, low fat meat. This meat is being used only for pet food at the moment. I am pleased to see that some States are now allowing kangaroo meat to be used. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Tasmania we have always used wallaby meat. In recent times a new export industry for wallaby meat has opened up in Tasmania. This is along with all the other wonderful food and wines exports that come out of Tasmania. We are exporting prime cuts of wallaby meat to many areas of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent times, when the Tasmanian Government moved to bring in regulations that would complement the kinds of things we recommended in our kangaroo report and which the Government has been trying to get all State governments to accept, once again the old furphy started to surface about cruelty. I cannot understand why everybody in Tasmania, particularly Ms Peg Putt, is getting so uptight about the method of shooting kangaroos down there. After all is said and done, the regulations they were bringing forward were to limit shooting of wallabies to certain times of the year and to tag the animals, which is exactly what happens in Queensland, the State from which Senator Bjelke-Petersen and Senator MacGibbon come. It has been going on for many years up there. It is Queensland's way of controlling the numbers of kangaroos being culled. Even so, we still see emotions running high, with people writing to the papers and getting uptight about the killing of our national emblem. I can understand that but, as I said earlier, killing kangaroos, as opposed to cows or sheep, for consumption seems to engender much more discussion amongst certain groups in our community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to see that at last the Government has answered these recommendations. I have looked through the answers in the brief time I have had them, and I am pleased to see that most of the recommendations have been accepted either in total or in principle. I am also pleased that the Government has accepted some of the innovative ideas we put forward in our report, such as funds being made available by the Commonwealth for research into kangaroo-proof fences, which would provide protection for farmers and other sensitive areas kangaroos have invaded, as an alternative to the final solution of culling. I am also pleased to see that the Government has accepted that we continue commercial shooting of kangaroos where damage mitigation is required. As I said earlier, this problem has been evident over the last few years, particularly in Senator Bjelke-Petersen's State. I know that the drought there is causing all sorts of problems, but it certainly has been exacerbated by the huge numbers of kangaroos. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now these Government responses are through, I hope some more sensible debate about this emotional subject can go ahead. If the fuss and bother that has occurred in Canberra over a few kangaroos at the Governor-General's residence is any evidence of the feeling in the community, the culling of kangaroos in Australia will always be something people will get upset about. I hope this report, and the responses that have come through at last, will quieten some of the more extreme elements of the animal liberation lobby in our community. </PARA>

<PARA>In speaking to the erratum to the annual report of the Australian Tourist Commission, I am glad to have the opportunity of drawing the Senate's attention to the fact that tourism is now one of Australia's largest and fastest growing industries. This is borne out by the following statement in the managing director's report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia moved back into strong, sustained growth during 1991/92, with short-term arrivals growing by 13 per cent to a record 2.5 million.</PARA>
<PARA>On page 10 I noted that the Australian Tourist Commission's prime task was to market Australia internationally as a tourist destination. In fact, on that same page it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Australia has been rated as the most desirable holiday destination in Japan, the US, Singapore and Sweden.</PARA>
<PARA>On page 13 the report goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tourism's developing relationship with the aviation industry and the environment emerged as important policy areas for the unit outside its core planning and evaluation role.</PARA>
<PARA>The aviation part of our tourism industry is something which I wish to draw to the attention of the Senate. Successive federal governments have for decades promised Brisbane an international airport befitting the city's stature as the international gateway to the State's tourist attractions. But unfortunately this has been put off time and again. When we think about the growth of tourism in Australia, we need to recognise that Queensland is a very important tourist State and the money that comes from tourism is of great help to the economy. In view of this, I think it is very important that the Government does do something as soon as it can to help get the new airport facility built. An editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS> the other day said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first and most damning observation to be made is that the present international terminal is a disgrace. It is cramped and substandard compared with similar terminals in other States.</PARA>
<PARA>It is something we would expect to see in the Third World rather than in a thriving capital city. Indeed, Queenslanders have often complained that Brisbane international airport is little more than a shed compared with the world-class domestic terminal that is sited across the runway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Queensland depends heavily on its reputation as a popular tourist destination, it is very important that something be done. When we realise that Queensland's economy is set to lose $27 million in visitor revenue unless the international airport is completed before its scheduled opening date of January 1996, it is very important that action be taken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apparently, the main stumbling block to a revised schedule is that the Federal Government will have a shortfall of $8 million. However, when we consider that Queensland's economy stands to gain at least $27 million from an expedited completion date, it is hard to understand why the Federal Government hesitates at all. The Federal Government is, in effect, turning down a 350 per cent return to the economy. When we acknowledge the fact, as I said earlier, that tourism is one of this country's largest and fastest growing industries and may indeed hold the key to an economic recovery, surely it should be one of the main priorities of any government at this time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1991 alone, tourist expenditure in Australia amounted to $25 billion and tourism's contribution to GDP exceeded 5 per cent. Tourism accounts for approximately 450,000 jobs, either directly or indirectly. Indeed, some 1,000 jobs are likely to be created should the Government see fit to fast-track this project. I ask the question: how can the Government afford not to encourage this industry? The continuing growth in our tourism industry has contributed to the fact that Queensland has had one of the lowest unemployment rates in Australia. The fact that our economy has such a large tourism base largely accounts for this. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the correction to the Australian Tourism Commission report. I do so simply to support the call of my colleague Senator Bjelke-Petersen for urgent attention to be given to the state of the international airport at Brisbane. As Senator Bjelke-Petersen has said, and as has been reported fairly widely in the Queensland press, the current facilities are a disgrace&mdash;and for Australia's premier tourist State, that is simply not good enough.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we talk about tourism matters, I always indicate with some pride that the airport at Cairns in Far North Queensland is a great example of what can be done when local people are given the opportunity to direct how an international airport should be built and operated. Indeed, the international airport at Cairns was constructed by the Cairns Port Authority, a semi-government authority made up principally of prominent people in business and government in Cairns. The authority constructed that airport many years ago now and Cairns has not looked back since. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been enormous tangible benefit to Australian tourism from the building of that airport. Cairns is now the tourist gateway to Australia. It has many more international flights than, for example, Adelaide and the number of flights continues to increase all the time. This has occurred because the tourist people in Cairns have supported the airport as well as the other infrastructure and development that needs to be implemented to attract overseas tourists to our land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am aware of the expansion in recent times of activities run by Cairns tourist operators. These are not major corporations but little one-, two- and three-people businesses. These established businesses are now looking to expand their activities. I know of a tourist operator involved in whitewater rafting who is now taking people into New Guinea. He is even going further afield into the Pacific islands. This business, which is all generated from Cairns, is assisted by the fact that the Cairns airport is so good and so popular. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tourist area in the city of Cairns has a boom feeling about it. I might say that this tourism capital of Australia would have benefited substantially from the Liberal-National Party proposals for the tourist industry that were put forward in the run-up to the last federal election. It would have benefited quite substantially from the additional money that we would have made available for advertising and promotion, particularly in Europe and America from where we attract a lot of tourists to far North Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I say, I concur with my colleague's remarks about the Brisbane airport. I urge the Government to have a look at this matter and give it a bit of urgency. In looking at ways in which that can progress, the Government should consider what happened in Cairns many years ago and possibly learn something from the advancements that have been made there. </PARA>

This activity, which employs quite a large number of people, will be totally destroyed if that power station is built. Senator Macdonald then went on to say that tourist operators in Cairns are taking visitors from Cairns to experience whitewater rafting in New Guinea.

<PARA>The significant thing in this report of the Australian War Memorial is the reference to the 50th anniversary of the opening of the museum in 1941. I will deal with the routine part of the report first. The most significant part is in the new acquisitions list which includes the acquisition of a P40-E aircraft for the collection. The museum has sought this type of aircraft for many years because of its great Australian military relevance. It is a worthy addition to the collection of memorabilia in the museum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy President, you will remember the problems we had in the Senate estimates committee hearings, both the main estimates and the supplementary estimates, where the $550,000 cost of this aircraft was to be paid for in part by disposing, in quite a reprehensible way, of an equally historic aircraft. It is not without amusement that I see the statement in the report:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The aircraft's $550,000 cost is being funded by disposing of appropriate collection material.</PARA>
<PARA>I am sure that slipped past the editor of this report. It is quite wrong to be disposing of what is appropriate material in the collection at present. That is a matter we will raise at one of the estimates hearings in the near future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Senate should reflect on the great achievement in setting up the Australian War Memorial. It is a memorial that in my experience is unique in the world. It is a very fine memorial to those Australians, men and women, who served this country in all the wars that we have been involved in. The memorial has a budget of $15 million. The great difficulty that the museum faces, and which it refers to very politely in the report, is shortage of funds. There is nothing new about that. Governments of all persuasions since the museum was opened have failed to come up with adequate funding. But, as each year passes, the collection gets larger, the responsibilities of the museum and its obligations thereby increase and so the gap gets wider between what is required and what is provided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One sees that critically in the curatorial services and their inability to maintain the collection. Some of the material in that collection now goes back over 100 years. It requires highly skilled curators with sophisticated techniques to keep it in a condition whereby it will survive not only for another 100 years but for times beyond that. The memorial also needs considerable storage space. This report does refer once more to the difficulties of inadequate storage and the problems that that brings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The other great difficulty that comes from lack of funds is the inability to change displays. Whether it is an art gallery, a museum or a memorial, to maintain public interest one must be able to rotate a collection. The actual collection in a facility like the Australian War Memorial is many, many times the number of exhibits that are on display at any one time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian War Memorial is an institution which I think attracts more visitors than any other similar institution in Australia. There is a huge throughput of Australians and overseas visitors going through the war memorial. As the war memorial report says, the system works against getting repeat visits from visitors because of its financial inability to change the displays that it would like to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only about 10 days ago, I was fortunate to be in France for the 75th anniversary celebrations for the battle of Villers Bretonneux. While I was there I met the director of the Historiale de la Guerre, the new museum at Peronne. It was very interesting to see what is being done there with respect to new display techniques. It is a great pity that because of shortage of funds the Australian War Memorial, which actually loans some material to that museum, cannot avail itself of the modern display techniques, including modern videos and the simple format of the displays that are being used in France at present in that museum. </PARA>

<PARA>I wish to speak briefly to the Anti-Dumping Authority annual report and in particular advert to page 11 of the report which provides a brief run-down on the legislative amendments made to the anti-dumping legislation last year. One achievement that we can record is the reduction of time in the prima facie decision stage, which came down from 35 to 25 days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was rather disappointing. Originally, the Australian Democrats had an amendment before the Senate to reduce it to five days and the Opposition had a similar amendment. That amendment was passed in the Senate, but when it went to the House of Representatives the Government rejected it. When it came back the second time before the Senate, the Australian Democrats were deserted by the coalition. We stood alone on the question of the five days and obviously that amendment was defeated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was an important amendment for Australian industries which are being hit to leg by a rising tide of cheap imports, as we have again seen demonstrated by the recent balance of payments figures, the worst for three years. It is important that we make it easier for Australian industries to fight the dumping of cheap goods. Other countries are doing it. The United States accepts a prima facie judgment and when it finds an industry is facing what they call `disruptively high levels of imports', the United States authorities do not hesitate to slap immediately emergency countervailing tariffs of up to 100 per cent on these imports to make sure that their industries do not go down the drain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not seem to have that same concern. At the moment it seems to me that the Anti-Dumping Authority should be renamed as the `importers authority' because it helps importers. It helps people who compete with Australian products because it is taking a very sharp stance against Australian producers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another aspect that needs to be looked at is the interpretation of the legislation by the Anti-Dumping Authority. The provisions of the legislation require that an industry shows that not only are the products being dumped at prices below their production cost in their own country, and not only is damage being done in general terms to the Australian industry, but also that a causal relationship is established between the damage that the applicant has experienced and the dumped goods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two celebrated cases, Caford Castors in Melbourne and Greenseas cannery in Eden on the New South Wales coast, were able to show the first two, but the authority rejected their claim for the second. I have read some of those reports. It is beyond me how it is possible to say, in general terms, that the industry is suffering damage; yet the applicants are judged not to have shown a direct link between that damage to the general industry which has been linked to the dumped goods and their own particular difficulties, despite the fact that these companies are experiencing a drop in turnover and consequent retrenchments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is high time that this chamber looked again at the anti-dumping legislation. At the very first opportunity the Australian Democrats will move amendments designed to protect Australian industries rather than overseas importers, and we look forward to the support of the Opposition for those amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to the annual report of the Anti-Dumping Authority, I wish to raise very briefly and very broadly some of the problems with the authority and some of the proposals that the Liberal and National parties had for making the Anti-Dumping Authority far more effective.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Acting Deputy President, you would know, as we all do, as we have moved around Australia over the last couple of years, particularly in the pre-election period, that people were very concerned about the Government's proposals to reduce tariffs&mdash;proposals which, in some instances, the Liberal and National parties agreed with. We do live in a more competitive world and we have to realise that on many occasions tariffs, while they benefit one industry, are quite substantially paid for by another industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When people demand level playing fields, they do not seem to understand that under the anti-dumping and countervailing measures there are proposals to stop goods coming into Australia and being sold at a price lower than their cost of production; or goods and services being sold in Australia that have been subsidised by their government in their country of origin. If we were effectively able to stop those goods coming in with those unfair advantages, a lot of the concern that is expressed about removal of tariffs would dissipate. The coalition recognised that. It had a very good plan to improve the Anti-Dumping Authority to ensure that goods that were coming into Australia unfairly would be stopped and penalised by the imposition of anti-dumping duties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Fightback proposals, we indicated that we would ensure a fairer trading environment by introducing effective anti-dumping and countervailing procedures. We proposed to reduce the preliminary inquiry period to 65 days, after which provisional measures could be imposed. We would then allow the Australian Customs Service five working days to determine whether a complaint lodged met with formal requirements. The ensuing preliminary inquiry would, in normal circumstances, take a maximum of 60 days and up to another 30 days in exceptional circumstances. Provisional measures would be available after a positive preliminary finding. The preliminary inquiry would be followed by a final inquiry of up to 90 days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To ensure that a fully informed decision was made within these time limits, the coalition, if in government, intended to provide adequate resources to both the customs service and the Anti-Dumping Authority. We would ensure that the injury tests currently imposed would not require the virtual decimation of an industry before action is taken, as can happen under the present legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We urged the Government to take up our proposals to reduce those time limits quite substantially, and also to look at the injury test to make sure that an industry does not have to be down and out before it can get some relief. Hopefully, in the term of the current Parliament, the Government will take up the proposals. I hope that, in its next report, the Anti-Dumping Authority will be able to report that the Government has adopted our proposals and that, as a result, Australian industries are given a much fairer go against subsidised and less-than-cost-of-production imports. </PARA>

<PARA>The Australian Heritage Commission is the Commonwealth's chief agency for identification and assessment of areas of conservation and cultural significance. Over the years it has performed an extremely vital role in establishing and maintaining the register of the National Estate and in providing information and advice to the Commonwealth about areas entered on the register. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable senators may remember that last year during Question Time I asked a question about the AHC. I referred to the perceptions in the community that the commission was becoming increasingly remote from the community and from environmental groups. I had heard from environmental groups that significant concern existed about the role of the commission in the regional assessment process. I had also heard that concern existed about the general direction in which the commission was heading; that is, away from more open community involvement and community organisations and towards a greater interface, specifically with the forestry industry. Concern was expressed that the commission was being co-opted by State forestry agencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After I asked this question, I was contacted by staff of the commission. We had a very productive meeting at that time, at which we discussed the changing perceptions of the community in relation to the AHC and what action the AHC was taking to counter these perceptions and to increase the community participation in the working of the commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have always been a vocal supporter of the AHC, as have the Australian Democrats. We have always advocated a very strong and independent role for the AHC. Our concern centres very much around this changing role for the AHC and, specifically, the direction the Government seems to be giving it. We still have many of these concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In March 1991, the former Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, announced his commitment to provide, for instance, resource security legislation for the timber industry. As part of this commitment, he promised to establish a process of integrated regional Commonwealth-State assessment of environmental and heritage matters. The AHC was to be responsible for the implementation of this joint assessment process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In March 1992, the Prime Minister, Mr Paul Keating, announced in the One Nation statement that he would initiate resource security legislation for the forestry industry. This was supposed to be done without compromising environmental values. This totally unrealistic commitment was, as every senator knows, defeated in the Senate last year by the Democrats and the coalition although, as everyone knows, the coalition's opposition to this Bill was not based on its concern for the environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The commission established a regional assessment group to cope with the increasing workload created by these additional responsibilities. The commission has worked on two major regional assessment projects, one in south-west Western Australia, which has been completed, and one in the East Gippsland region of Victoria. The Western Australian agreement has been criticised by environment groups because it has led to a situation where the State forestry agency has legitimised and entrenched its role in the logging of native hardwood forests. In fact, logging activities in the karri and jarrah forests have increased in intensity since the agreement was finalised. A regional assessment in Tasmania has been proposed. However, I understand that there is very little cooperation with the Tasmanian forestry agency and suspicion from conservation groups in relation to this process has also meant that the process has not got very far. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My main concern is not with the Australian Heritage Commission itself but with this new role adopted by the AHC that is being driven by government policy. There is a real perception in the community that the AHC is working more closely with industry and less now with the public. I appreciate that the staff within the AHC are very concerned about this perception and that they recognise that community participation is still highly valued. In fact, the AHC has recently completed two major studies into the enhancement of community participation in the National Estate. But my main concern, I stress, is about government policy, and that concern remains. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I commend the work carried out by the AHC in identifying and assessing those areas that deserve to be listed on the Register of the National Estate. However, I believe that the Government must redefine its forestry policy and thereby redefine the role of the Commission vis-a-vis State forest agencies and, in doing so, restore public confidence in the Commission. </PARA>

<PARA>I commend the annual report of the Central Land Council for 1991-92. This 80-page report very comprehensively covers the activities of the Central Land Council. I am certainly one to criticise at times much of the administration of land councils in the Northern Territory, but, as honourable senators will appreciate from my comments in a few minutes on the next two reports, the reports of the Anindilyakwa Land Council and the Tiwi Land Council, and on this one, the report of the Central Land Council, I extend a compliment to those three land councils on the way they have carried out their activities.

The paper gave it the same tenure and status that it afforded to a number of other Northern Territory Government, local government and Federal government initiatives in that year.

It has been, as it acknowledges, involved in negotiations with Telecom, organising telephone services. It has negotiated with the Australian Maritime Safety Authority concerning lighthouses. It is involved in negotiations with BHP, which is very important as the manganese miner, regarding mining agreements. Of course, as anyone would expect from an Aboriginal land council, it is deeply and sincerely involved in discussions about sacred sites, sea closures and other issues. This first report is commendable. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA>The Tiwi Land Council is that area of administration that is generally known to many people as encompassing the Bathurst and Melville islands to the north of Darwin. It is also an important small land council and a breakaway group from the Northern Land Council, which has been so controversial and which has obviously not met the aspirations of Aboriginal people. The Tiwi Land Council has been operating for some time. It engages in a number of commercial activities on behalf of Aboriginal people. The report highlights many issues. I wish to comment on three. The first issue is&mdash;and I quote from the Chairman's report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the growing interest and academic success of our younger people at diploma and University access level. Sixty-seven Tiwi students, comprising 4.5 per cent of our population, are studying at tertiary level. . . Ten years ago we recognised the future required proud and secure Tiwi people. The welfare net may save our bodies, but our hopes were drowning. We still have much to do, but there is now evidence of a belief in our future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second issue relates to what the Tiwi Land Council believes to be a census anomaly. The census has identified a declining Tiwi population in the area and the Land Council is taking steps to ascertain what is happening to the population. I note that there are particular illness problems on the Tiwi Islands. Further in the report mention is made of the incidence of kidney disease in the Tiwi Islands and the important work that is going on there by the Menzies School of Health Research. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third issue that the chairman has drawn to our attention is that of the mining views and the views of others who seek to influence the Tiwi people. Again I quote from the report of the Chairman, Mr Kerinaiua:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we . . . were very surprised at the determination of non-Tiwi people to tell us what we should do. Stories that our land would sink and disappear or blow-up in an atomic explosion, were told to frighten us. Our visits to existing mineral and sand projects allowed us to see just what goes on.</PARA>
<PARA>There are important prospects for sandmining on the north of Melville Island and the Tiwi Land Council will have to deal with those matters very intricately, and I know they are doing so very responsibly. It is a pleasure to note the keenness, the determination, of this particular community and the fact that their accounts are unqualified. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>Unlike the comments that I have made, very pleasingly, on the Central Land Council, the Tiwi Islands and Groote Eylandt, this report of the Northern Land Council is very concerning and ought to concern every honourable senator. The activities of the Northern Land Council need almost a royal inquiry. Next week, at the Senate estimates committee hearings, I certainly intend to pursue a number of issues very keenly. The point which requires our most urgent attention is the auditors' report for the year ended 30 June 1992, which is qualified by the following:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Expenditure on land claims exceeds the approved budget item by more than 20%. This contravenes Section 34 of the Aboriginal Land <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Rights (NT) Act 1976.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Total expenditure is in excess of the total approved budget. This contravenes Section 34 of the Aboriginal Land Rights (NT) Act 1976.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Note 12 to the financial statements states the intention of the Northern Land Council to distribute $546,003 pursuant to Section 35(1) of the Aboriginal Land Rights (NT) Act 1976 and sets out the <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> distribution made in 1991/92. We are unable to express an opinion whether these distributions are in accordance with the provisions of Section 35 of the Act.</PARA>
<PARA>The Northern Land Council needs to be condemned for its profligacy and its total inattention to the proper standards of good administration on behalf of its Aboriginal constituency. It has obviously become a very political and involved organisation. For a number of years it has relied on the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, Mr Tickner, and the former Minister, Mr Hand, propping up its annual budgets and throwing more money at the problem rather than seeking decent solutions. I have put three very important issues before Minister Tickner since early this year. The first relates to very severe allegations of rorts of fringe benefits tax by senior management personnel within the land council itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the trust accounts and mining royalty funds which the Northern Land Council administers on behalf of its own constituency are not even covered in this annual report, other than to get gobbled up as two one-line items in the annual balance sheet. There is no listing of the trust balances as there were previously; there are no statements of income, revenue and expenditure, as should properly be set out in these particular accounts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third issue that I have raised with Minister Tickner is the excessive use of consultants to carry out anthropological, legal and administrative functions of the land council. This has amounted to in excess of $1 million in the last year as a proportion of its budget. Many of these consultancies have been going to former employees of the land council who have retired or taken redundancy packages, or who are relatives of senior executives within the organisation. There have been jobs for the boys. There have been all sorts of pay-offs. Certainly, in the Senate estimates committee hearings next week I will be demanding and looking for explanations. I am concerned that, in the comments by the chairman on page 1 of this report, attributed to Galarrwuy Yunupingu, is the statement arising from and following the Mabo decision we all deal with in so many areas. Mr Yunupingu says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On first hearing the news of Mabo I said the Federal government should quickly negotiate a treaty and implement national land rights. That would be a good start. The alternative is plenty of court cases around Australia, but this is not the best answer.</PARA>
<PARA>That second paragraph of the chairman's annual statement in the NLC's report highlights how political this organisation has become and how much it has moved away from the good and proper focus that it needs to give for the constituency it should and ought to be serving. The administration and finance of the NLC are a disgrace. The budget blow-out is totally unacceptable and this matter needs a major inquiry at the earliest possible date. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>I bring the 1991-92 annual report of the Department of Employment, Education and Training to the notice of the Senate because of the outrageous claims it makes in relation to government education policy. The report quite correctly notes that the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 has been amended to implement the policies outlined in the report. However, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley) and his department then go on to claim that the changes to the Higher Education Funding Amendment Act 1988 increase the autonomy and flexibility of our universities. It is important for the Senate to know that this statement is complete rubbish and, in fact, the opposite has occurred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes to this Act which the report refers to actually has resulted in all universities in Australia being placed under the direct control of the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. This completely bypasses the role of the States which are constitutionally responsible for our universities. Up until 1987 there was a reasonable degree of cooperation between the Commonwealth and the States on policy formation for the universities. This State authority has been eroded severely since 1987 and now has been eliminated altogether. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report reveals an even more disturbing change. There is a big difference between the funding of the universities of Australia through the appropriation of Parliament and funding them through ministerial determination. Under the new arrangement, the appropriation is not subject to scrutiny. There is no debate in the Parliament and amendment is no longer possible. Under a ministerial determination, the whole decision is left up to one person's discretion&mdash;the Minister's. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also point out to the Senate that this ministerial determination has not as yet been presented to the Parliament and that universities are still obviously operating with funding. The question therefore arises: why has the determination, which is a disallowable instrument, not been tabled?  What is the Minister hiding?  Why is public comment being hindered by the Minister's delay in presenting his determination?  In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> on 12 February, Crispin Hull says that the new funding arrangements:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . will have a huge impact on the independence of universities and ultimately academic freedom, which is one of the important legs of our democracy.</PARA>
<PARA>He also says that the new legislation is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">divisive, can wreck universities' autonomy, will eliminate the states' role and put unnecessary power in the Minister's hands. It has the potential to be an insensitive, centralised and dangerous power. The universities in Australia are too important to be placed under the ministerial thumb.</PARA>
<PARA>This opinion was supported by the editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> on 14 February and letters to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> signed by seven professors of the Australian National University, including one of its founders, Sir Mark Oliphant. It is therefore clear that, contrary to the claims of this report, the higher education sector has lost autonomy and flexibility under the policies of this ALP Government. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government is continuing to centralise control of the higher education sector, and our universities are losing their autonomy and their independence. As higher education funding now stands in Australia, the Minister of the day has the power to determine how much funding each university will be allocated and the Minister will base his determination on a set of criteria which universities have met through his insidious profiling process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only real scrutiny the Australian Parliament has over the higher education funding sector is in the global amount for the entire sector. This means that the universities may be forced to abandon their own research and teaching agendas and follow the social and economic vision of the Labor Government.

<PARA>It is with pleasure that I rise to speak to the annual report of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission for 1991-92. ATSIC has done a very credible job in the time that it has been established. It now has the bipartisan support of the Liberal and National parties. Initially, we were a little concerned at the establishment of this commission but have acknowledged its worth and support it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In speaking to another related report yesterday, I mentioned that the commission has now recommended changes to the Government which will, in effect, take on board many of the policies which we proposed for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission prior to the last election. I am very pleased to see that ATSIC has adopted those proposals and recommended them to the Government, which is also intending to adopt most of those major proposals and reforms. </PARA>
<PARA>The commission has done good work. It is not perfect, but then none of us are. I look forward to a continuing role for the commission and an even more progressive adoption of the work and the policies that it has set out to implement. One of the aims of the commission&mdash;there are several&mdash;is to promote the development of self-management and self-sufficiency among Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait islanders. That role is a very important one for the commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also note that one of the roles of ATSIC is to ensure coordination in the formulation and implementation of policies affecting Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait islanders by Commonwealth, State, Territory and local governments. I am very pleased to say that the Australian Local Government Association is working with ATSIC to enhance the role of Aborigines and Torres Strait islanders with local government. </PARA>
<PARA>I think we are all desperately anxious to overcome many of the disadvantages that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait islander people suffer. There is very widespread support within the Australian community to improve the health, education and housing disadvantages that face many Aborigines and Torres Strait islanders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I issue a warning to the Government and also to ATSIC. I ask them to look carefully at the fact that a lot of the programs that ATSIC and the Government become involved in do not seem to be nearly well enough explained.

<PARA>There is much in this report of the Automotive Industry Authority that we can be pleased about. The quality of cars produced in Australia is judged to be equal to that produced overseas. The price that we have to pay here for the six-seater family car is approximately equal to the prices that are charged, for instance, in the United States. Our exports in the automotive industry are up by eight per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, there is also another story. Table 2.5 of the report shows that from June 1988 to June 1992 imports of passenger vehicles rose from 65,000 units in 1988 to 147,000 units in 1992, an increase of 82,000 units&mdash;over 100 per cent. Table 25 in Appendix 1 shows that during the same period 10,756 jobs were lost in the industry. The accelerating trend of imports in recent years is highlighted by the import figures for the period 1991 to 1992 when there was an increase of 23,698 units. During the same period&mdash;the link is very clear&mdash;the producers of cars, the assemblers of cars and specialist component producers shed 5,113 jobs. </PARA>
<PARA>When jobs are shed because of increased productivity, in one way we can be pleased about that so long as we ensure that provision is made for retraining and relocation of the people who are affected. However, when jobs are lost to imports, despite the fact that a level of prices and quality has been reached which on the face of it makes us competitive, I believe this calls for a second look at our policy as it relates to the car industry. </PARA>

<PARA>I will briefly go through this motion. Basically, paragraph (a)(i) states that the wool industry is in the worst situation since wool production began in Australia nearly 200 years ago. In fact, each woolgrower today is losing approximately $30,000 per year. The people and towns that rely on individual woolgrowers, especially those in areas where nothing but wool can be produced, such as some pastoral areas of Australia&mdash;some pastoral areas can run cattle, but some are limited to producing wool as they cannot run cattle or grow cash crops&mdash;are in a very extreme financial situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make particular mention of the towns and industries that service those areas. If the woolgrower does not survive or make a dollar, neither will the corner store, the ever decreasing number of doctors, nurses or pharmacists, the small business people who service and sell machinery or the supply stores in those remote communities. Everyone in those areas will suffer badly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When debating this motion we must recognise what the wool industry has done since its inception in Australia. Not only has it supplied massive amounts of income tax to the Treasury but also it has employed people, and provided an opportunity for dealers to sell their machinery and service people to sell their services. We have to recognise that when looking at establishing a system for the future. That is one reason why we have to recognise the woolgrowers and help them to survive the situation that they are now in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I, like most woolgrowers, and everyone else in Australia believe that there is still a long-term future for the wool industry in Australia. In the last 40 years I have known at least three sharp downturns in the wool industry. Each time, the industry has revived and prospered and then prepared itself for the time when wool prices again drop. It happens in most service industries and the other industries that keep Australia going. Successive governments have recognised this by making special contributions or allowances available when they occur. It happens to all industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, not the least affected are the present one million unemployed. The Government is attempting to do something to alleviate their suffering. I believe that it should do the same for the wool industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have always said in my statements on the wool industry, especially since the latest severe collapse, which probably started last November, that we should be taking a bipartisan approach to this issue. There is no need&mdash;it will not do anything for the industry&mdash;for political point scoring. We have to move forward in a united way because this problem will require more than a six-month solution; I am looking at a five- to seven-year solution, if not longer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have twice asked Mr Crean, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, to come to Western Australia to address the growers. I know that he talks to the peak bodies of primary industry around Australia. It would help if he spoke to growers person to person so that they could hear what he has to say and he could hear first-hand what they have to say. Amongst other things, woolgrowers need some personal commitment to, and understanding of, their problems as well as financial help in these extreme circumstances. I am very disappointed that, as at this time, Mr Crean has not seen fit to travel to Western Australia, even though he recently travelled to the drought areas of Queensland, after which he came home and recognised that there is a problem there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thought that in the Governor-General's speech the other day there might have been mention of the problems that exist in the wool industry and some measures by which the Government would assist the woolgrowers in such circumstances. Unfortunately, there was no mention of it. I believe that every other group in Australian society got a mention. The woolgrowers certainly did not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will digress for a moment. I have listened to a few first speeches in the last few days. I took particular note of the speech by our new Labor senator from Victoria, Senator Kim Carr, and the speeches of two new members in the House of Representatives&mdash;Mr Smith, from Western Australia, and the member for Capricornia. They had the common theme that Australians have shared responsibility and that we share the wealth of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that principle of sharing wealth with industries remains true of the Labor Government, except when it comes to the rural industry. Rural industries have certainly shared their wealth by paying massive taxes when wool prices have been high. I believe that it is time that the Government recognised the situation that woolgrowers are in and did something to help them in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because we have quite a number of speakers on this subject, I will briefly explain what the situation has been in recent years. Senators may remember that in 1988 the then Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin, agreed to lift the reserve price from 700c a kilogram to 870c a kilogram. That was the beginning of the disaster. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Government had its own representatives on the board of the Australian Wool Corporation to investigate the reserve price scheme. The Minister was fully aware of what was going on at that time. There were a lot of woolgrowers around Australia who were not at ease with increasing the reserve price. But the Minister agreed with the Australian Wool Corporation's recommendation. That was the wrong thing to do at the time, but that is water under the bridge. If the present Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and Mr Kerin want to wipe their hands of the situation, they must remember that they were part of the decision that was made to lift the reserve price. They must also realise that they caused the disaster. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nobody needs me to tell them again what has happened since. Even though the scheme collapsed in February 1991 because of rising debts and massive production rises, the corporation still operated the reserve price until 30 June 1991. As a result of that collapse we have a massive debt. Australia now has a debt of $2.1 billion and a stockpile of 3.9 million bales. As woolgrowers we must take responsibility for that debt; no woolgrower wants to walk away from that debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were a lot of inequities, which I will point out, in having this unreal reserve price scheme. These inequities led to overproduction. In 1985-86, 173 million sheep were shorn in Australia. In 1990-91, due to the unreasonably high reserve price, 212 million sheep were shorn. Production in greasy kilograms went from 813 to 1,030 million during that period. That was far too great a production to sustain such a price. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government was part of the decision to introduce a reserve price for wool. I know the industry was at fault, but the Government was also because it agreed to the scheme. Mr Kerin was running around the world giving guarantees which upset our relationship with the other trading nations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose one could ask why I am standing in this chamber outlining all the problems and indicating what the Government has not done. In the brief time I have, I will outline some solutions that are available. Various solutions have been put forward by others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One solution put forward is the destruction of the stockpile or dumping the stockpile in the ocean. This would mean that the stockpile would not act as a dampener on prices. I do not believe that is the way to go. I believe that if we left the present debt for future generations, or even the present generation, to deal with, it would still not be the way to go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been suggested that the stockpiled wool could be given away as foreign aid. I do not think that solution is very practical. One could suggest that the stockpile be sold at a premium, but I cannot see the stockpile moving. The stockpile has moved very little in the last 12 months. The idea of putting a floor price on the stockpile does not seem to work either. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At least 1.8 million bales of wool in the stockpile are made out of locks, bellies and pieces that never, at any stage, should have been in there. They should have been sold at the price offered at the time and the reserve price should have been used only for premium wool. I believe that that wool should be put out to tender immediately and got rid of. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the long term solution lies in more aggressive marketing and in developing markets in places where wool can be used but is not being utilised at present. The main thrust, and the Government's thrust, should be towards eastern Europe where mills have been sold off at bargain prices for government enterprises, as eastern Europe enters a new found democracy. If we could exchange our raw material for equity in those mills&mdash;we are allowed up to 51 per cent equity in those enterprises&mdash;we would have those mills captive forever for Australian wool. That is the way to go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some mills that are not on the market whatsoever but, as those countries do not have the hard currency to buy raw material, we should give them raw material in exchange for equity towards the finished product that goes on to other markets. I was with a parliamentary delegation to the region, led by our own President, Senator Sibraa, and we could see the opportunities that lie there. So the solution lies in creating long-term demands, because we have lost our market share with the high prices that we have had in the past. Cotton and synthetic fibres have increased their market share, which we will find very hard to get back. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But other speakers will outline further our belief and the way that the Government, or everyone in Australia, should attack the wool crisis. But in those five or seven years it will take to rectify the position in Australia, the Government has to do more than the various superficial measures it announced last week. One of those measures was to extend debt repayment simply for another year. The Government has to do far more than that to make sure that those viable woolgrowers can remain in position to take advantage of the situation when the wool industry revives, hopefully by these measures that will be put into place with a bipartisan approach. I will leave it at that, and let my colleagues further the argument. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Speaking in this debate today in my capacity as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Crean, I will firstly say that in terms of the motion that Senator Panizza has moved, and in fact most of his contribution, there is much with which the Government can agree. I think his points (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e), which recognise the problems the wool industry is facing and outline the particular contribution of the wool industry to Australia's economy, are quite valid.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point at which the Government would take issue is point (f), which calls on the Government to take some small measure of relief in addressing the suffering endured by various individual growers. I will outline a little later the details of the package that was announced last week. Before I do so, I will deal with a couple of matters on which I disagree with Senator Panizza, the first one relating to the personal commitment by the Minister, Simon Crean. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister did visit Queensland. His primary purpose in doing this was to look first-hand at the effects on the wool industry, and also because that area is stricken by a terrible drought. Senator Panizza expressed concern that there had been no visit to Western Australia. Frankly, even though I am sure that the wool industry in Western Australia is suffering similar problems, it is very difficult for the Minister to visit every wool region in Australia. The Minister did not visit Tasmania, and personally I would have liked him to do so. But it is a bit impractical to expect the Minister to visit every wool region in Australia. The important thing is that the Minister visited a representative area of the industry as quickly as he could, analysed the situation and put together a package, which in a moment I will briefly outline, to deal with some of the problems faced by the wool industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No-one pretends that this is an easy issue or an issue that will be resolved very quickly. I take issue with Senator Panizza's analysis of what he referred to as the cause of the disaster; that is, the lifting of the reserve price by the previous Minister, John Kerin. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZW4">Senator SHERRY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, shared responsibility. That may have contributed to the current problems being faced by the wool industry. Senator Panizza referred to the former states of the Soviet Union and eastern Europe. I agree with him, but I do not think anyone could have predicted the collapse of the Soviet Union, the way in which it was going to occur or the terrible effect it would have on the wool trade.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our outstanding wool debt with the former Soviet Union now totals some $260 million. I do not think anyone in this place seriously suggests there is much chance in the short term of collecting too much of that $260 million. The wool arrears have been rescheduled and are to be repaid in 10 equal and successive six-monthly instalments. The first repayment is to be made on 1 January 1995 and the final one on 1 July 1999. I think it will be very difficult to collect the existing debt, let alone sell any significant amounts of wool to Russia and expect the payment fairly quickly. I think that is a very important part of the wool debate that Senator Panizza did not touch on in any detail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One other matter that does cause me concern&mdash;and the Opposition does like to perpetuate myths&mdash;is the reference to the Governor-General's speech. I draw pages 20 and 21 of the speech to the attention of honourable senators. There are a number of references to primary industry and various programs in that speech. I want to put to bed the accusation that we have heard continually for the last two days that there was no mention of primary industry issues in the Governor-General's speech, because there was. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Wool is not mentioned on page 20 or page 21, and it is not mentioned in the speech. Wool is not alone in that.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have already referred to the very rapid response by the Minister in visiting Queensland, in the context of both the wool problems and the severe drought being experienced there. On his return the Minister was able to put together and have Cabinet endorse in a remarkably short time&mdash;a matter of only a couple of weeks&mdash;a quite reasonable package to deal with both the short-term and the long-term issues that are fundamental to the future of the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The package included funding by the Commonwealth of up to $44.6 million under the exceptional circumstances provisions of the rural adjustment scheme, commonly known as RAS, for specialist woolgrowers. It will cover the period from May 1993 to June of next year. The package includes $5 million from the Commonwealth to provide support under the exceptional circumstances provisions of the RAS to drought affected woolgrowers in Queensland and New South Wales. It also includes the maintenance of the wool tax at 8.5 per cent from 1993 to 1994, and that will mean 3.5 per cent for wool promotion. I hope no-one in this debate will suggest we should not be having some sort of financial contribution for the industry for wool promotion, because that is part of the long-term answer to the industry's problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The package includes 0.5 per cent for research and development&mdash;my previous comments apply to that issue&mdash;and 4.5 per cent for the management of the debt and the stockpile. The package also includes extending the Australian Wool Realisation Commission's debt repayment schedule from seven years to eight years and introducing more flexibility to the setting of those repayments. Also, a committee has been established to review the wool industry structures and the operational arrangement. It is to report back to the Minister within the next three months. The Minister will be visiting a number of the key international markets. </PARA>

I listened with interest to Senator Panizza, and I will be sitting through the whole of this debate and listening with interest to the contributions of other Opposition senators in the hope that they will detail&mdash;and I mean detail&mdash;the sorts of things that Senator Panizza called for in his motion but did not detail. In particular, I refer to the sort of financial contribution that the Opposition, as an alternative government, would be willing to make over and above what this Government has committed. I will be listening with particular interest to details of the proposed costs of what such an alternative government would be prepared to provide. </PARA>

It was largely responsible for opening up this great nation of ours. This is the industry which the Keating Government has absolutely failed. In fact, the Australian community has ridden on the sheep's back for so long that it is now time the rest of Australia gave a little bit back to the industry which has helped them so much over all those years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his reply a moment ago to Senator Panizza's motion, which I strongly support, Senator Sherry basically said that the Government has done a fair bit, that it has done enough. I tell the Government that it has not done anything yet. It does not realise the enormity of the problem. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) rushes out to Queensland for a couple of days to look at things and thinks he is an instant expert, but he is not. He does not realise the enormity of the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Wool prices at the moment are at their lowest ever in real terms. There is a stockpile of 3.9 billion bales. Only four years ago the Australian wool industry earned the Australian economy some $6 billion in exports; it now earns only $3 billion dollars.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The average woolgrower will lose nearly $34,000 this year.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a mountain of problems out there. There is a mountain of problems which were actually created in the first instance by Senator Sherry's Government putting interest rates up so damned high that people could not jump over them. Interest rates were at 20 per cent plus. The Government drove farmers to the wall before the commodity downturn came. They were driven to the wall before they even had a drought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just one year ago with the drought inquiry of the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs, on which I had the honour of being deputy chairman and on which Senator Sherry has served, we heard some of the most tragic stories of people in the western divisions. They have had some rain in western New South Wales since we were out there. However, the problem is even worse now because they have had a commodity downturn, they are still paying off debts caused by those high interest rates that the Government foisted on them, and they are not getting the help and assistance they so justly deserve.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was talking to some people in the western division this afternoon and two agents from the Broken Hill area cited some interesting figures which I believe are pretty correct. The on-farm price for a bale of wool is now about $185; that is about $1 a kilogram. In round figures, 30 fleeces go into a bale. Shearing costs for that bale of wool are about $3 a head. So that is $90-odd for that $185 net on-farm bale of wool. Drenching of each sheep costs about $1.50; that is fly control, dipping, et cetera. So basically, by the time we have paid our costs, interest rates and debt, and looked after ourselves, we are well out of pocket on that net on-farm bale of wool. There is really no money left to feed the family or send the kids to school. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is where I do not think the Government has addressed things quite well enough.

If a farmer becomes redundant and has to leave the land, what does he get? He gets $45,000, but that is still subject to the income and assets test. The Government is looking after the waterfront guy&mdash;giving him 100,000 bucks&mdash;but it is not really looking after the people who are being forced off the land because of a lot of the problems associated with the Government. </PARA>

My last point is this: the other area that the Government has not looked at is helping the shire councils with the rates that are not being paid by the woolgrowers and other people suffering from the drought and the wool decline. It is not helping with the alleviation of government charges, and it is not helping with the levy alleviation because it is still making those farmers pay their 8 1/2 per cent levy. If the Government had given them a bit of assistance with that, it would have given farmers a little money to put food on their table. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The motion moved today by Senator Panizza is quite straightforward. In Senator Panizza's language, it lists various things which it asks this chamber to recognise and note. I will not waste the time of the Senate by re-reading them but, on behalf of the Australian Democrats, I find it quite easy to agree with those things which Senator Panizza has asked us to recognise, because they are self-evident.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a situation in the wool industry which is worse than any other situation since that industry's inception in Australia. It has reached the stage of a truism. It has reached the stage where words are not sufficient to redress this problem. It has reached the stage where, in agreeing to define the problem, we are not actually doing anything to resolve it. In essence, that is what I want to spend a few minutes today speaking about. While we can stand here and agree with this, and while we can pontificate about what the problem is and what the potential solutions might be, until we actually act, we have done nothing for which we should be admired. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The motion itself is bland enough and it can be agreed with. It contains enough platitudes to be readily acceptable to all, and of course we accept it as a statement to be agreed with. But I am afraid that it does not propose any action. In some ways we can be thankful for that, because ideas to solve the problems of the wool industry abound&mdash;in almost every newspaper we pick up, in the letters to the editor, et cetera. The so-called solutions to the ills of the industry do abound. But what does not abound is action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that the Government was rightly criticised for its failure to make particular detailed, precise mention of wool in the Governor-General's speech. The Governor-General's speech would give little hope to those who are struggling to resolve the actual problems which are being faced by woolgrowers today. It was not a speech which inspired us to action. Indeed, for some of those in the chamber, it was such a somnolent sort of arrangement that it inspired quite the opposite. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In listening to Senator Panizza, I was pleased to hear that he is not one of the `burn the stockpile' brigade. That is a suggested action which would have disastrously negative results, not the least of which I would have thought was patently obvious. One of the many letters to the editor about this particular subject observed that it would be interesting to watch Mr Wayne Goss of Queensland actually trying to burn the stockpile; he would need a few packs of matches to do that. Mr Merrylees of Euroa, who wrote a letter observing that, is to be congratulated because the sort of superficial, glib action that is proposed in that way is a bit harder to deliver. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As honourable senators would know, the stockpile is not a bunch of bales of wool stuck beside the wharf in Melbourne. What we have is wool distributed throughout Australia in various places, and at one stage there was even a considerable amount of it overseas. The cost of administering, safe-guarding and storing that wool stockpile is considerable and has to be borne by those very people who have produced it. To go along with a match and set fire to it is, frankly, physically rather difficult. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The day we need to be advised on our wool stockpile by the French will be a very sad day indeed, and I know Senator Sherry thinks that too. I was pleased to hear Senator Panizza speak of the quarter of a million bales of locks and bellies that actually comprise a significant part of the stockpile because it is with regard to that section that I propose some action ought to be taken. I was pleased also to hear Senator Panizza talk about aggressive marketing because I think that is precisely what ought to be done. As a matter of fact, Senator Panizza said a lot that I agree with and on which he is to be congratulated. Selling on the basis of exchanging equity in some projects in our traditional markets is also an idea on which he should be congratulated. I agree with Senator Panizza on all those remarks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that we need to be looking at a very large part of the stockpile to be marketed not in the traditional way that wool has been marketed&mdash;not necessarily as a textile, not necessarily recognising all the fine qualities of wool, but recognising some of the other qualities. I have already mentioned wool's innate resistance to being easily burned, its elasticity and its insulation properties. The fact is that wool that has been bought at 700c or 870c is wool that is not readily seen as being the raw material which it in fact is. It is an insulator; we should be promoting it as that. I have insulated my home with it and, as a competitor to synthetics, it is miles ahead. Those who have worked hard to establish it as an alternative insulation product should be supported. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Wool is not only a heat insulating product but also a sound insulating product. We import a lot of synthetics to stick in cars to deaden the noise under the bonnet and to do all sorts of things in sound deadening, but wool is remarkably good in that sphere. We are still importing synthetics and we are still making wool bales out of synthetics. It has been demonstrated that some of the sorts of wool that Senator Panizza was talking about would be eminently suitable for manufacturing into wool bales themselves. It would have the side effect of reducing the contamination which is such a problem in the wool industry. This contamination is sometimes added to during core sampling when some of the synthetic fibres become mixed in with wool. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These sorts of propositions are not easy to come up with when we do not have action by this Government&mdash;a government that has the philosophy of reducing intervention. I must say that the coalition also supports most aspects of a non-interventionist government. The Democrats want to see more direct intervention by the Government in this area and a lot of other areas. The Government should be taking the lead, whether through tax subsidies or through the Government actually going ahead and buying some of that wool and proposing to do some of it itself. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think Professor Garnaut will be proposing any government intervention. That would be entirely opposite to his stance on any other aspect that he has proposed. That is why criticism should be made here. I would like to see a recognition that the Government accepted responsibility for creating the problem and also now accepts the responsibility of solving it. To accept that responsibility is to act. Senator Coulter earlier today suggested that action could be taken by increasing Australia's foreign aid. A lot of people have proposed giving it away to somebody.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Coulter's suggestion is that foreign aid could be served by the Government actually buying the stuff. It could then be provided as development aid to developing countries. It would not compete with our traditional markets. It would be raw material used by developing countries. In fact, the provision of raw materials could well be a stimulus to the establishment of industries which would at some stage in the future be seeking further raw materials from Australia. If it is imaginatively dealt with, government action could recognise the responsibility as well as create a solution to the problem in the future. That is the sort of thinking that is required by Government&mdash;actual government actions and actual interventions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from the marketing that Senator Panizza has mentioned, with which I agree, the other area which begs for direct government intervention is the area that was touched on by Senator Brownhill in much more detail than I propose to do in the time remaining. I refer to government intervention in accepting responsibility for direct financial assistance. I too was on the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs which examined the drought problems. At that stage I supported the concept of the Government providing transaction based subsidies for those who were suffering from the drought. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;While most Australian people and industries continue to suffer under the recession inflicted on them by the mismanagement of this Government, it is beyond argument that rural people, and wool growers in particular, are suffering much more than most. That is why it is entirely unacceptable, as has been mentioned by Senator Bell and earlier speakers, that there was absolutely no mention of the wool crisis in the Governor-General's speech opening this Parliament last Tuesday.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is nonsense to suggest, as Senator Sherry did a few moments ago, that many other industries were not mentioned in that speech. That may well be true. But it is also undoubtedly true, as Senator Sherry failed to mention, that many other industries are also suffering under this recession. No other industry is in the crisis situation that the wool industry faces today. That is why it should receive particular attention in this re-elected Government's program over the next three years. Of course, such attention ought to have been mentioned in the Governor-General's speech opening this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems that the only thing we can agree on about wool in Australia is that we do not agree about the extent of its difficulties, and in particular about how the problems of the wool stockpile should be solved. The longer the argument goes on, the more the industry continues to suffer. There is no argument that some of the problem is not of Australia's making, but it cannot be argued that it is not our problem. Australia must find the solution to this problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have great difficulty accepting the arguments of some farmers that the stockpile should be frozen. One can understand the concern behind that reasoning. Many farmers feel that unless the stockpile is frozen, they will be left insecure and that it is a gamble. Perhaps 10 or 20 years ago that view may have been correct. But I believe that freezing the stockpile simply leaves that insecurity hanging over the heads of the industry, and of growers in particular. As long as that stockpile remains, it will have a depressing effect on the international demand for current production and therefore a detrimental effect on the current price of wool. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> We have to recognise that the world of trade is now a vastly different place from what it was many years ago and that a 3.9 million bale stockpile of wool, which represents 85 or 90 per cent of the current annual production of the wool industry, will continue to depress wool prices. By its continuing existence the stockpile will create a necessary increase in the wool tax to pay for both the storage and the interest costs of that stockpile. Those costs are simply a burden that wool growers can no longer afford to carry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It currently costs about $240 million per year to maintain that stockpile through the interest payment on the debt and through storage costs. Growers simply cannot afford to pay that in the current situation where they are receiving such historically low prices for their raw wool. There is no other way forward but to aggressively market that stockpile, cut the industry's losses and move forward without crippling the future financial ability of the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A focus on increasing demand and creating demand must be the highest priority for the industry. Unless consumers are willing to buy, changes to the wool tax, to industry structures and to selling systems are unlikely to reduce the stock to manageable levels. We must aggressively market the stockpile overseas and also apply some lateral thinking to its marketing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been clear for many years that we have to develop new and alternative uses for wool. For consumers worldwide, paying for wool and caring for wool has rendered it a luxury item when compared with man-made fibres&mdash;synthetics. While that has been addressed in advertising terms, we have been tardy in researching what can best be described as the big picture of where wool is heading. This has resulted in the current crisis, which is the culmination of many different difficulties peaking at once. We have lacked the managerial skill to deal with that crisis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> It may also be time to halt the mind-set that Australian wool is a glamorous commodity and accept that it is a commodity, full stop, which we must sell overseas whether it be as wool for use in the textile industry as is traditionally used; for items such as wool insulation batts; for soaking up oil spills; or for whatever other non-traditional uses entrepreneurial minds and some lateral thinkers may come up with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The are two difficulties confronting us are the short-term difficulty with the stockpile, and the long-term viability of the very industry itself. Both stand a good chance of being part way solved if we can take wool in new directions, not just for now but permanently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While it is possible that we can reduce and probably eliminate the stockpile in a controlled fashion, it appears impossible thus far, when considering the views that have been put forward, for all interested parties to agree that this is the way we have to go. Perhaps aggressive marketing will convert the doubters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to accept that we are at the crossroads for this industry which is of such great importance to Australia. If the industry, and therefore Australia, which still remains heavily dependent on its prosperity, is to move forward and prosper, we have to find new uses for wool and new wool users within the world textile industry. We must assume a much more aggressive and entrepreneurial approach to achieve these goals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A wide range of possible initiatives have already been put forward by wool industry bodies. They include placing wool in markets where access to hard currency is restricted, using wool from the stockpile to establish equity in joint venture processing facilities in specific mills or in those countries with hard currency problems, using stockpile wool for the development of domestic processing facilities in Australia, using stockpile wool for specific foreign aid programs and to cement Australia's relations with specific countries, and ensuring that more aggressive marketing of the stockpile is done in a way that does not damage the selling of new wool from current production. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The overriding consideration of all of these initiatives is the need at all times to isolate stockpile sales from existing ongoing demand. In my view, the best way to get an urgently needed substantial reduction in the size of the stockpile, while allowing its eventual use in any or all of the ways that I have just outlined, is to call tenders for the purchase of specific quantities and types from the stockpile on the condition that wool so purchased must not find its way back into existing uses and markets, which would only further depress the market and price for wool coming onto the market from current production. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There may be some practical difficulties in policing this requirement. However, I understand that, for example, it is possible to chemically treat wool to make it impossible to be used in textile manufacturing. This would ensure that purchasers would have to find new uses for the wool that they have purchased by tender, whether it be for insulation, oil spills or any other alternative use that might be developed. I believe there would be entrepreneurs willing to punt on their capacity to resell wool for such alternative uses, if the tender process was initiated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry should at least take the steps of researching this option and the practical difficulties of it, which I certainly do not underestimate, and also try to find ways of overcoming those practical difficulties. Should the Australian Wool Realisation Commission decide to develop any or all of these marketing initiatives, the Australian Wool Council and the IWS have indicated their commitment to make available the resources and personnel to assist in that task. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The task of stimulating demand for Australian wool for traditional uses, however, hinges on three critical elements&mdash;quality, improvements in selling methods and international wool promotion. Customers continue to point to quality failures in the fibre we supply and we must address this seriously, not only to safeguard our future but also to give us an added marketing advantage compared with other exporting countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Wool Corporation recently addressed this need through the establishment of a contamination task force. The task force investigated quality systems for the wool industry, and its report recommended the adoption of total quality management. We can market successfully only if we have a quality product to sell. This has been echoed by the international retailing community, most recently by the Managing Director of Country Road, Mr Stephen Bennett, and also Peter Glover from Marks and Spencer in the United Kingdom. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the light of other colleagues wishing to speak in this debate, I conclude by simply reiterating that the Australian Wool Corporation must have three clearly defined goals as essential characteristics of future profitable wool marketing. Firstly, there must be a higher quality product; secondly, there must be efficient channels of distribution and market information; and, thirdly, there must be cost-effective promotion. The current crisis of the wool stockpile must provide the catalyst for appropriate action to be taken in the future to ensure that this industry remains a viable one, not only to the benefit of woolgrowers, but to the benefit all Australians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I have a limited time in which to speak, I will get to the basic points that I wish to make. I congratulate Senator Panizza for moving this motion. I would also like to discuss a few things which I believe could be done to improve the current situation. I express my dismay that wool was not mentioned in the speech made by the Governor-General the other day. One must justifiably criticise the Government and the wool industry for not having in place a long-term strategy for handling the stockpile and the production of wool in this country at the time the reserve price collapsed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We on this side of the chamber made our position absolutely clear. We even went so far as to suggest a slaughter scheme, but we were knocked all over the place. At that time, we said that the production of wool would have to get down to 700,000 kilos a year if there was to be any chance of our handling the stockpile without crunching the market. We now know that production is still over 800,000 kilos a year, and that is a fundamental problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having rejected the option of reducing production, the thing that the industry and the Government must now do&mdash;and it is the Government's responsibility to rural Australia and to the infrastructure which exists in this country to take the lead&mdash;is reduce the size of that stockpile. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This can be done in a number of ways, as long as it is pursued with vigour and a little bit of vision. Other uses of wool have already been mentioned. I particularly want to mention the utilisation of wool as an insulator. Like Senator Bell, our house in Perth is insulated with wool. It is cheaper and better than alternative forms of insulation, but one never sees it advertised or promoted. With the right promotion, effort and marketing, this area can expand, and the Department of Trade must assist with this. China, for example, is utilising only 60 per cent of its production capacity. We have a wool scouring operation in Fremantle, which we visited recently, that is working three days a week. That could be utilised in part of the process. It needs some leadership, promotion and effort. Hopefully, at a later time, I can enlarge on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second issue I wish to mention in respect of utilising wool and addressing the stockpile situation is the importance of upgrading the overseas marketing of our live sheep and mutton, which is something that has been forgotten. That is the other side of the equation. It will be a real challenge for us to go back to the situation we were once in, but I do not believe it is impossible. It is not only a challenge to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean); it is also a challenge to the new Minister for Trade (Senator Cook). We need to market in the Middle East, Asia and these other countries. We need to carry out proper promotions and trade negotiations so that we can get rid of the surplus sheep that have nowhere to go. That is another option we have which has not been pursued. I understand that we still have only three agricultural attaches in the whole world. Looking at the agricultural production in this country, that is certainly an area that needs to be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As other speakers wish to participate in this debate, I have had to restrict my time to five minutes. The challenge to the Government in this motion which we are supporting is to take a bipartisan approach to solving this problem. Pain and suffering are occurring in rural Australia now. Every woolgrower in this country is losing $5 a sheep every year. That cannot be allowed to continue. In fact, it is a disgrace that it has been allowed to go as far as it has. No other section of the community has ever been put under so much pressure, in terms of its social wellbeing, its financial wellbeing and its contribution to this country&mdash;after all, it did put $3.8 billion into the economy last year&mdash;and been neglected for so long. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was a disgrace that in a very long speech the wool crisis was not even mentioned once. I must say, having read so frequently about the Governor-General's newly found rural pursuits of riding horses, shooting kangaroos in his bottom paddock and even eating kangaroos, that one would think he personally would have some influence.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More seriously&mdash;I mentioned this in a debate yesterday&mdash;some specialist woolgrowers I met recently at Boyup Brook, south of Perth, were not happy that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Simon Crean, was dealing with the problem. They thought that the crisis was now so serious and so deep that it required the imprimatur of the Prime Minister to state that he believed personally in the future of a wool industry, that he believed personally in maintaining Australia's rural infrastructure and the small country towns and larger regional centres which are being destroyed by the crisis afflicting the wool industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During my meetings over the last couple of weeks with specialist woolgrowers two matters were brought up time and time again. Senator Sherry has asked us to be more specific in our contributions about the sort of assistance that is required. I cannot&mdash;and I do not think it is appropriate in the sort of broad brush policy speech we are making at the moment&mdash;go into those sorts of details but I can tell Senator Sherry, and I hope he takes it back to the Minister, that these woolgrowers, to whom I have spoken at some length over the past couple of weeks, have said that the rural assistance scheme, or RAS, as it is known colloquially, and the RAFCor. are seen as totally inadequate schemes for delivering the sort of assistance that is required in this crisis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The criteria for viability and assistance and the bureaucratic method of processing assistance through RAFCor. and RAS are seen to take too long and to have, to use the words of these specialist woolgrowers, too narrow a window to enable farmers to become eligible for assistance through those means. I must support the concept of some other survival-type assistance being delivered to farmers with some sort of viability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Take the position of a specialist woolgrower in Queensland, in the south-west of Western Australia, or in Senator Sherry's home State of Tasmania, which is also your home State, Mr Acting Deputy President, who has no other form of income and who has lost his farm, income and lifestyle. It would be of little difference if that woolgrower's homestead were perched on a rolling green hill or in a dust bowl in drought-stricken western Queensland. When one loses ones farm, family, lifestyle and income, it makes little difference what view one has out of ones homestead window. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With those words I would encourage the Minister for primary industry, the Prime Minister&mdash;and I am thinking on my feet, suggesting that this might be an act of bipartisan or non-partisan faith with the woolgrowers of Australia&mdash;and perhaps the Leader of the Opposition, Dr Hewson, to tour, together, for a day or two some of the regions where the wool crisis is hitting deepest to show to the people that there is a commitment at the very highest levels of our democracy to the survival of a wool industry and a recognition of the contribution which the wool industry makes to the very fabric of Australian society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very popular to talk about a sense of national identity and coming to grips with multiculturalism, gender balancing and all the sorts of concepts the Governor-General went through in his speech two days ago, but the balance between the country and the city, the very fabric of Australian society, is based on the foundation stone of our very strong outback community, the concept of the pioneer. It would be helpful if the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition were to join together in a non-partisan affirmation of the importance of the wool industry and in a genuine commitment to seeing the industry through this crisis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to conclude&mdash;in time for Senator Boswell to make a contribution&mdash;by supporting the remarks of all senators who have said that we need more active and aggressive marketing of wool. It is easy to say that but if I had a stockpile of any product&mdash;be it, say, motor cars; for example, Ford Capris&mdash;the last thing I would do to sell it or to try to get rid of it would be to set up a series of bureaucracies like the Australian Wool Corporation and the Australian Wool Realisation Commission. The way to run down the stockpile and to market wool more aggressively is to ensure that we get the process in the hands of small entrepreneurs and sales-based people and out of the hands as much as possible of bureaucrats sitting in offices earning set salaries, regardless of how much wool they sell in a particular year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have also met a number of entrepreneurs in Western Australia in the last couple of weeks. One of them I met last Friday, a fellow by the name of Felix Smith, who has a company called Envirofirm, one of the biggest wool insulation providers in Western Australia. He has told me of the frustrations he has had dealing with the Australian Wool Corporation. He is not allowed to use the Woolmark on the houses in which he puts the insulation. When one has a house that has wool insulation in the ceiling, the very minimum one could do is put a Woolmark on the front door; it actually becomes a trendy idea to let people know that one has wool in one's roof. </PARA>

This industry supplied $6 billion worth of export sales only a matter of a couple of years ago. It is in a desperate situation. I do not think I have ever seen a more desperate situation than in the western areas of Queensland, where there are dedicated woolgrowers, and the western area of northern New South Wales.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to approach this debate in a bipartisan way because this industry deserves the support of the total parliament. The Crean package was welcomed. It provided $15.6 million in drought relief for an industry on its knees. The rural adjustment scheme, worth $170 million, takes the figure up to about $200 million. That is a lot of money. I accept that and I acknowledge it. But I want to contrast that amount of money, a little over $200 million, with the amount that the Fraser-Anthony Government provided in drought relief in 1982&mdash;$400 million in 1982 dollar terms or $700 million if that figure is carried forward. So this Government has put $200 million into the wool industry, as against what the Fraser-Anthony Government put in for the 1982-83 drought. I want Senator Sherry to accept those figures as accurate because they show the total commitment that these two parties have to the wool industry of Australia. </PARA>

It came in and got a free kick with an economy that was moving up on the sheep's back. I point that out because I do not believe the Labor Party is mean or penny-pinching; I just think it does not understand the gravity of the situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I saw Mr Crean on television going out to see Mrs Greer. In front of the television audience she prayed to Mr Crean to understand the situation. The $200 million given in the drought package, the RAS package, fades into insignificance when compared with what was given to Kodak, to BHP, to the steel industry and to the waterside workers. One has only to look at the new foreign affairs building on which $190 million is being spent. It has a gazebo and everything that goes into making it a pleasant place for Canberra people to work in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Frasers and Anthonys of this world were great men for rural Australia. I think Mr Fraser has been terribly maligned by a lot of people. He was one of rural Australia's greatest friends. I am prepared to stand up in the chamber and acknowledge Mr Fraser as a great friend of rural Australia. The achievements of Fraser and Anthony must be compared to the eight lines given to rural matters in the Governor-General's speech. Therefore, I repeat that I do not believe the Labor Party understands the gravity of the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Forty per cent of the woolgrowers in the western division of New South Wales and 40 per cent of the woolgrowers in south-western Queensland are not eligible to receive assistance because they cannot prove they are viable. How can anyone be viable when the wool indicator is 389c per kilogram in the middle of a terrible drought?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The very wealthy woolgrowers who have inherited wealth and who have got a bit of money put away in the sock&mdash;and there are very few of those left&mdash;will be viable next year. The growers who are viable now will be marginally viable next year, and the borderline cases this year will be unviable next year and will be forced to get farm household support. Once a grower gets his feet on that sticky paper, it is only a short time before he is removed from his farm. Once he accepts that farm household support, which is equivalent to the amount of the dole, he must pay it back at commercial interest rates if he stays on the property for over nine months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Farmers are fighting desperately not to accept the farm household support because they know that once they accept it they are on the ropes and will never escape. So they are working twice as hard. They are sending their wives out to work, sending their kids to school without adequate food and money for lunch. All these things are happening out there in the bush at the moment. Fifteen thousand growers are currently receiving interest rate subsidies; 6,000 to 7,000 of those growers will come off contracts at the end of this year. Some of the contracts will be renewed, but where do those 6,000 or 7,000 growers go? They go on to the RAS and they will end up exiting their farm. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nothing will help woolgrowers in the long term unless the price of wool returns to a market price that will give some returns at sustainable levels. I know it is important to give the aid, and I know that RAS is accepted. Every dollar is accepted; every dollar is necessary out there. But unless we can find a solution to increase the price of wool, every bit of aid, the $200 million&mdash;I hope Senator Sherry is listening to this&mdash;will not go anywhere. We will have to think laterally to provide a way of increasing the floor price. I know that `floor price' have become dirty words, but we will have to think about it. I know that other people wish to speak and Senator Panizza is giving me the wind-up signal. I think the Senate should debate this issue at a later time in greater depth. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the wee small hours of the last occasion that we sat before Christmas, Mr Punch, the former Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, tabled the Midford Paramount report. We were unable to do that in this chamber on that occasion because we were engaged in long and lengthy debate; we rose at 6 o'clock in the morning. So, in effect, the report was presented to the Senate whilst we were not sitting. This is the first opportunity that I have had to address this very important report which is the result of two years' work.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts into Midford Paramount is the tale of the punishment of defendants who were not convicted of any crime. The inquiry arose out of a Senate estimates committee investigation into the Australian Customs Service and a reference to the Public Accounts Committee upon a resolution of the Senate. It was a reference that the Government opposed but, in the end, a bipartisan report was brought down unanimously by all members of that committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The matter revolved around the directors of Midford and its tariff adviser who were charged in June 1988 with $4.5 million of Customs fraud. A year later the committal was discontinued soon after the DPP withdrew the charges. In February 1989, costs of around $365,000 were awarded against the Commonwealth. Despite the withdrawal of charges and the award of costs by the magistrate, the committee noted that the defendants suffered enormous financial losses through unreimbursed legal fees and diminution of the value of their businesses. Others involved in the case also suffered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After an exhaustive two-year investigation the committee generated a report and 134 recommendations concerning the Midford Paramount case&mdash;and we said it was indeed a paramount case of a failure of Customs. Many of the 134 recommendations are simply sensible statements, either of commonsense or of basic good management. It is a terrible indictment of the Australian Customs Service that such fundamental matters needed to be raised in the report. I will give an example of some of those recommendations. Recommendation 1 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The defendants in the Midford case and others be compensated for their unrecovered material and legal costs.</PARA>
<PARA>The committee found that the Australian Customs Service was at best incompetent or at worst conspiratorial and deceitful. An excessive number of inconsistencies, inaccuracies and contradictions was found in evidence by key witnesses from government agencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Importantly, the committee concluded that the Comptroller-General cannot be held personally responsible for every action of individual subordinate officers, but he must accept responsibility for the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the performance of the Australian Customs Service, the prevailing culture in the service and the changes that must be made. </PARA>
<PARA>The report shows a constant refusal of the customs service and the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce to accept the verdict of a court of law and demonstrates what some would call a vendetta against innocent parties. It was best summed up by the statement made to the committee by the Australian Customs Service's National Manager of Investigations, who said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Magistrate's summation has been studied carefully. It is his opinion. The Australian Customs Service does not share his view and in fact strongly disagrees with it.</PARA>
<PARA>One of the DITAC witnesses before the committee said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Maybe the court got it wrong.</PARA>
<PARA>At every turn, there was no willingness to accept the rule of law. But the findings of the report are totally consistent with the findings of the magistrate, who said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As was disclosed from Cabinet papers and other confidential papers, a cover-up permeated throughout the department (that is, DITAC). I find it totally unbelievable that (the DITAC witness) knew very little of the Cabinet paper disclosures. In my opinion, the two officers&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the one from DITAC and the one from the Australian Customs Service&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">were totally discredited. These witnesses departed sufficiently under cross-examination from their sworn statements tendered to the committal proceedings. Their evidence was incorrect and insupportable.</PARA>
<PARA>The Public Accounts Committee hopes that the Australian Customs Service will view the recommendations in the report positively and improve its operations to regain the trust of those it is meant to protect. Challenging the committee's findings is not a good start. </PARA>
<PARA>The committee found it necessary to recommend:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that the powers of the Customs officers be limited; increased emphasis be placed on protecting the rights of individuals through improved mechanisms for investigating and resolving complaints against the customs service; the expertise, training, qualifications, supervision and management of the Australian Customs Service investigation officers be improved; investigations be conducted into apparently false representations made by ACS officers to Ministers; and allegations that an Australian Customs Service officer forged evidence during a recent Crimes Act prosecution.</PARA>
<PARA>Since the release of the report, to date bureaucratic wranglings have done little to progress the matter. It is understood that initially it was proposed that Customs and DITAC would determine what compensation should be paid. Naturally, the intended recipients rejected major involvement of ACS and DITAC in the process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) recently agreed that an interdepartmental committee be formed which would have a DITAC and Australian Customs Service observer. However, it now appears that the observers chosen by those two agencies are at the deputy secretary level, far outranking all other members on the interdepartmental committee. </PARA>
<PARA>Justice cannot and will not be seen to be done under an arrangement where there is a potential for undue influence from the two offending agencies, especially given repeated demonstration of recalcitrant attitudes by those agencies. Further still, latest advice is that the IDC now proposes to re-examine the whole of the Midford affair rather than undertake the task intended of simply determining the quantum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The court and the Public Accounts Committee have already conducted extensive examinations and found that the defendants have already been severely punished, even though not convicted of any crime. What the IDC proposes is a severe insult to the Public Accounts Committee and borders on a contempt of parliament, it being inappropriate for an IDC to retry this matter. </PARA>

Throughout this inquiry witnesses from the Australian Customs Service have constantly maintained that Midford had not been cleared of the charges, that it was guilty of crimes and that the magistrate was wrong. Despite both the legal system and the parliamentary committee process laying the fault at the feet of the bureaucrats, the agencies involved are still defending their original positions and they are, in effect, maintaining that they are above the law and the Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>On Tuesday the new Minister responsible for the Australian Customs Service, Senator Schacht, announced a review of the operations of the service. The Minister's press release stated that he will review and examine issues of responsibility and accountability, the relationship of the service to other agencies and the public overseas developments and Customs administration. This appears to be a bland statement. We do not know who will conduct the inquiry, we do not know the role of the Parliament, if any, and we do not know who will head it. But I do welcome the statement and I do welcome the fact that the Minister says that the Government is committed to ensuring that the shortcomings identified by the Midford report and other reports are corrected. I can assure the Minister that he will certainly have the utmost cooperation from me and, I am sure, from other members of the committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before dinner, I was speaking about the report by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts into the Midford Paramount case and the Australian Customs Service. As the new Minister responsible for Customs, I explained that I had thoroughly read the report. Although I do not accept automatically all the criticisms contained in the report, I indicated that Customs had overwhelmingly accepted most of the 130-odd recommendations that related to it, excluding the issue of compensation; that is being dealt with by an interdepartmental committee chaired by the Department of Finance, which is in accordance with government administration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two days ago, I announced a major review of all the operations and aspects of Customs. I did so after consultation with the portfolio Minister, Mr Alan Griffiths. We believe that it is necessary not just because of the Midford report, which dealt with only one aspect of Customs operations, but also because of the very important nature of Customs itself. It collects over $13 billion in revenue for the Commonwealth government and employs nearly 5,000 people throughout Australia. It also delivers a number of bounty program payments to the Australian public. Of course, it is responsible for maintaining the integrity of Australia's international border controls. It has a particularly onerous and difficult task in fighting the illicit drug trade and smuggling. At times, that means it has to exercise powers that do not make it popular with some members of the public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overall, Customs, which is one of the oldest public service departments in the Commonwealth, has performed an outstanding role. But, like all departments that deal with a multitude of services, nothing is ever 100 per cent perfect; they occasionally lapse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Midford report dealt with some of those areas. Of course, the Government will bring down a response to the Public Accounts Committee report by the middle of the year. In the meantime, I thought it would be appropriate for the Government to conduct an independent review of all the services of Customs, particularly because there has been no overall review of it since 1985 when it became a statutory authority. There have been many individual inquiries. Many of them were at the parliamentary level and dealt with specific areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last three years, a major work has been done by the Australian Law Reform Commission into the Customs Act. The Customs Act is one of the oldest Acts of the Australian Parliament; it was established in 1903. I am informed that there has been no major review or rewriting of that Act since then. Of course, it has been substantially amended piecemeal over the decades. The Australian Law Reform Commission review recommended a major rewriting of the Act. While those recommendations are before us&mdash;I have certainly had discussions with Customs about a timetable for rewriting the Act and when it could be introduced into the Australian Parliament&mdash;it seemed to me to be opportune to combine the work of the Australian Law Reform Commission and the rewriting of the Act with a review into the administration of the customs service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have certainly encouraged Australian Customs Service officers to see the review in a positive and constructive light that puts forward the very good work that they have been doing and the good service that they have provided to Australia. The Australian Customs Service has a very good story to tell in many areas. It is at the cutting edge of any world customs service in the introduction of electronic procedures to make it easier for importers and exporters to deal with customs with the minimum of inconvenience. Other customs departments elsewhere in the world are looking at taking up a number of the new initiatives in this area that the Australian Customs Service has developed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All in all, I believe that the Midford case should be put into perspective. It was a major review by the Public Accounts Committee of a particular case. But there are many other areas of Customs where the customs officers should be given congratulations for the energy and enthusiasm with which they have adopted many new reforms and procedures to help Australian business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the review is timely. I look forward to having it completed by the end of this year. In the next few weeks, I will announce the full terms of reference for the review and who will conduct it. I can assure the Senate that it will be an independent review to which the public will be able to make submissions. As I said before, I encourage Customs to make its own submission about its activities. I am sure that it will. I also believe that the review is part of the public debate about public administration. No government department should escape the need to have an independent review of its activities from time to time, because that means that we will have better administration and better quality in the performance of government departments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I realise that the Public Accounts Committee report has made a savage attack with scathing criticism on a particular area of customs activity. The Government will respond appropriately in the next few months to that report. In the meantime, the review will get under way. I believe that that is the best way to deal with ensuring that, as we move towards the 21st century, we have a customs service that is capable in every way of meeting the needs of the Australian community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was a member of the community affairs committee that produced the report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Employment of people with disabilities</EMPHASIS>. I have not yet had an opportunity to see the Government's response to this report. I know that the committee members had some very grave concerns about the way people with disabilities were actually being affected by the limited access to certain things they required for their disability. Recently, the committee has had further submissions relating to other disabilities. The committee's current reference relates to mental health.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem we discovered in this report was addressed in our minority report. The problem was that the Government was not looking at ways in which to improve the delivery of services to those with disabilities. I am particularly concerned, when referring to people in the electorate who have various disabilities, whether they be mental or physical disabilities, to find that the services being provided to them are inadequate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is for that reason that Senator Lees from the Australian Democrats has made a reference to the committee about the facilities for those affected in terms of mental health. As a parliament, we have to look at ways in which we can deliver these facilities far better. My colleague Senator Walters, who wishes to speak on this report, has also been a member of that committee. We need to be able to assess the facilities that are being provided. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me return to what I was saying earlier about the intellectual disability access program. One of the recommendations on that program was recommendation 17, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Commonwealth public sector be <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">required</EMPHASIS> to provide more employment places for people with disabilities, including people with severe disabilities. Strategy plans are to be developed by each department, authority, etc. to demonstrate how such employment policies will be implemented.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that is of particular concern to a number of people because in a hard and tough economic climate there is great difficulty in getting employment for people&mdash;full stop; period&mdash;let alone for those who have disabilities. The concern that was constantly raised with the committee was how people with disabilities would be able to compete with those who were ablebodied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that the Government's response to the report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under Section 33 of the Public Service Act, entry to the Australian Public Service is to be based on merit and is to be without patronage. Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) in the APS has its basis in the merit principle which requires that people seeking appointment, promotion and transfer to jobs in the APS must be assessed in fair and open competition, taking into account abilities, skills and personal qualities and without discrimination, patronage or favouritism.</PARA>
<PARA>It is of great importance that we look at some of those areas, because we have been concerned for a number of years that this will discriminate against those who are able bodied yet not give an opportunity to those who have disabilities. The further requirement for the private sector to put on extra staff members to cater for those who have disabilities is also a barrier to employment, which we discovered in that committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was just saying that the Government and the Democrats between them have determined that this change should be passed tonight&mdash;and that is a change that will abolish an opportunity for the Senate to require financial accountability through the examination of Ministers.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that the alternative that the Procedure Committee has put is that, instead of coming in here for a debate in the Committee of the Whole, matters such as unanswered questions by Ministers should be referred back to the estimates committee which should then hold a supplementary hearing to deal with those matters rather than honourable senators being given the opportunity to question Ministers directly in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, when I looked at the drafting of that proposal, it seemed to me that there was no obligation upon the Government to ensure that such supplementary hearing takes place before the Bill is returned to this place for what will simply be the third reading stage of the process. I have had drafted a very simple amendment which is designed to ensure that the estimates committee hearings do in fact take place and are completed, in accordance with the design that the Procedure Committee has put to us tonight, before the Government brings the Bills back in here for passage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It might be said that the Government would not do this; it would not seek to curtail the procedure.

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"An appropriation bill authorising proposed expenditure referred to estimates committees shall not be proceeded with until estimates committees have completed their consideration of the proposed expenditure, including consideration in supplementary hearings, and presented their final reports on the proposed expenditure.".</PARA>
<PARA>I cannot imagine any argument that the Government, let alone the Australian Democrats, would put against the passing of an amendment in those terms&mdash;an amendment which, presumably, would simply ensure the implementation of the process in accordance with the spirit in which the Government has brought these procedural amendments to us tonight. I therefore commend this amendment to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I received this amendment only about five minute ago; I have read it. Even though I am very fond of my brain power, I do not think it is so brilliant that I can get through all the possible implications of this amendment in five minutes. As a result of that&mdash;because the Democrats like to look at things for a little while, because we do not like to be given amendments five minutes before we are asked to vote on them and because we do not and will not do that to other people&mdash;we will not be voting in favour of this one.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Senator Hill wishes to refer this to a Procedure Committee for it to look at it, then we are happy. The Procedure Committee looked at these procedures that were put up by the Manager of Government Business in the Senate which we are now looking at and voting on. This discussion paper came out with all our names on it. Senator Hill knows as well as I do that we went through this in the Procedure Committee, and we came up with the best discussion paper we could. So here we are with the discussion paper; this has been gone through by all parties. I believe that it is the best way to do it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not vote for something that was given to me five minutes ago which would change this. If Senator Hill wanted that in, either he could have come up with it while we were discussing the Procedure Committee report or he could now refer it to the Procedure Committee and we would have a look at it again.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy President, might I ask for clarification from Senator Bourne. Did I understand her to say that she would support referring the matter to the Procedure Committee? If so, do I take it that by doing so she would be prepared to defer the Government's proposal&mdash;because to not do so is simply to pre-empt the motion&mdash;or, alternatively, move that the debate be adjourned to give her a proper opportunity to examine the amendment? I would have thought that course of action eminently sensible. If it has merit, it should be referred to the Procedure Committee. I am simply trying to find a sensible way of dealing with this matter. Senator Bourne seems to have a legitimate complaint when she says that she did not have the opportunity to consider it until just now.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;Last night I spoke about what I considered to be the gross hypocrisy of the Opposition in trying to erode the powers of Parliamentary Secretaries that were established in this chamber during the last Parliament. I pointed out that the hypocrisy of this move by the Opposition is manifest and obvious when one considers the fact that, in the case of the Government, there is only one Parliamentary Secretary in this chamber, Senator Sherry. But, in the case of the Opposition, which wants to curtail the powers of Parliamentary Secretaries in this chamber, Dr Hewson, the temporary Leader of the Opposition, has seen fit to appoint five shadow Parliamentary Secretaries in the Senate out of nine shadow Parliamentary Secretaries overall.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order. I draw your attention to the irrelevancy of this debate. The truth of the matter is that, notwithstanding their great ability, none of our secretaries will be appearing before estimates committees. This is a debate about the apprentices appearing before six estimates committees when the Government has 10 Ministers; it is not about the quality of our wonderful front bench.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are so many shadow Parliamentary Secretaries that they cannot all sit on the front bench. There are so many shadow Parliamentary Secretaries that half of them are halfway out the door. There are not enough seats in the chamber to accommodate the number of Parliamentary Secretaries that the Opposition has. So what gross hypocrisy it is.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is being proposed in this motion is no different from the sessional order that was in place during the last Parliament. There is not a skerrick of difference. While this debate was ensuing yesterday, we heard so many eulogies and so much praise about how well Senator McMullan did his job as a Parliamentary Secretary. One would think the Opposition would have been convinced. Apparently, times have changed. It was good enough for the Opposition to support this arrangement then. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberal and National parties have a very good and a very long record of supporting Parliamentary Secretaries.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is worth remembering that the Fraser Government enacted the Parliamentary Secretaries Act. It is under that Act that the Parliamentary Secretaries operate. Again, it seems to me nothing short of gross hypocrisy for the Opposition to oppose this sessional order. There is no reason for not following previous practices in this House and there is no reason, in relation to the Parliamentary Secretary issue in general, for not following previous practices in both Houses.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us be absolutely clear about this. Why is it not better for a Parliamentary Secretary, who has responsibility in a particular portfolio or ministerial area, to appear before an estimates committee as opposed to a Minister who represents a House of Representatives Minister in this chamber. I would suggest to those opposite that the Parliamentary Secretary may well have a more immediate and closer understanding of many of the issues that Opposition and Democrat senators would want to explore before the estimates committees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is absolutely no justification for the amendment that has been moved by Senator Calvert. On this occasion the Government is doing nothing more than putting forward a sessional order that worked well, effectively and in the best interests of the Senate during the last Parliament. I believe that any reasonable person would support the proposed sessional order in its entirety. I ask the Senate to reject the amendment, as moved by Senator Calvert, and to support the motion standing in my name. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I want to address Senator Calvert's amendment, which is a very sensible change to the Government's proposal. I take the opportunity to remind the Senate what this debate is all about. The Government now has 10 Ministers in this chamber, yet feels that 10 Ministers are unable to fulfil the normal duties and responsibilities of Ministers&mdash;so much so that it has to have an extra Parliamentary Secretary to whom it wants to give similar responsibilities and powers. No case has been made out at all by the Government as to why it is necessary for Senator Sherry to carry out these functions in this chamber when the Government already has 10 Ministers to do the job.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As my colleague said, the Government had only six Ministers last year. It has expanded the number to 10. There is no reason why it now needs an eleventh. Government members have not really even sought to make out a case. It is rather one of those examples which we experience so often in this place where the Government moves a motion and we are just told that we should basically support it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What are the functions that Senator Sherry must carry out in this chamber that are so necessary and that cannot be performed by other Ministers? One of the functions, we are told, is that he is to take the place of a Minister before the estimates committee. There are only going to be six estimates committees. There are, as we have said, 10 Ministers but yet the Government still says that one of those Ministers should be avoiding the responsibility of appearing before, and taking the appropriations through, the relevant estimates committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this instance it seems that it is being specifically provided for the benefit of Senator Cook, because Senator Cook has the representational functions in this chamber which cover exactly the same areas that the Government is giving as a responsibility to Senator Sherry. Why cannot Senator Cook carry out that function before the estimates committee? Has the Minister sought to explain to the chamber why Senator Cook cannot meet that responsibility? If he had sought to do that and convinced us of a sound reason for doing so, he would have made his case, but he has not put before this chamber one single reason why Senator Cook cannot do the job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We might have our doubts about Senator Cook's capabilities, but I presume that we are not intended to interpret this as a vote of no-confidence on the other side of the chamber in relation to Senator Cook. Certainly we know that in relation to primary industry Senator Cook had all that experience in the last session with the AQIS debate&mdash;experience that he will not forget. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is that what it is all about? Was he found to be so inadequate in relation to that debate, so failed in his responsibility in relation to that debate, that the Government has decided that Senator Sherry, its newly appointed Parliamentary Secretary, should take over Senator Cook's responsibilities in relation to that estimates committee? Is that what it is all about? If that is what it is all about, the Minister who has the responsibility for managing government business certainly did not have the courage to put that argument before us tonight. He has put no argument in support of his case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, there is no reason why the amendment put by my colleague Senator Calvert&mdash;that Parliamentary Secretaries should not have a responsibility in relation to the estimates committee, that Parliamentary Secretaries should not take the role of Ministers in relation to the estimates committee&mdash;should not be accepted by the chamber. I presume, because there has been no argument put by the Government, that the Australian Democrats will finally, on this occasion, support us in this amendment and that Senator Calvert's amendment will be successful. So I have pleasure in supporting this amendment and look forward to this vote. </PARA>

We cannot see any problem with Ministers turning up to all the estimates committees. We cannot see any problem with Senator Cook turning up for the estimates committee. As Senator Hill said, I am sure that Senator Sherry is a very able and apt person to turn up in place of a Minister for estimates committees. But we do have 10 Ministers here, all of them very able, and we would really like them to turn up to estimates committees. We would like to be able to question them about their own responsibilities, in particular, and about the responsibilities of those people whom they represent each day here in Question Time.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If ever there were evidence of a need for a time limit on answers to questions without notice, it was the performance of Senator Collins yesterday and today. This is a very useful reform. It was a reform that the Government resisted with all the vigour it could muster during its last term. I must say that the sort of grudging acknowledgment by the Manager of Government Business (Senator Faulkner) that some form of discipline can be useful is overdue; nevertheless it is recognised and appreciated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the previous session of Parliament, Ministers demonstrated that they were unable to impose self-discipline and provide sensible answers that concentrated on answering the question. Instead, Ministers were making long statements that should have been made after Question Time in the form of ministerial statements. It was really an abuse of Question Time. Ministers, particularly Senator Collins and Senator Cook, were giving us answers that went for many, many minutes. As I said a moment ago, Ministers often failed to even answer the question during such extended periods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It became apparent to those of us on this side of the chamber&mdash;and, I have to say, to the Australian Democrats&mdash;that it was necessary for the Senate to impose some discipline upon Ministers. You will remember, Madam Deputy President, that we carried out a number of experiments to determine the appropriate time for a Minister to adequately answer a question without encouraging that Minister to speak in excess of what was necessary. We had an experience with a four-minute time limit on answers, which is the time limit contained in Senator Faulkner's motion. We also tried three minutes and&mdash;Senator Kemp might remind me&mdash;I think we had a go at two minutes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of the last session, I thought the consensus was that about three minutes is the right length of time. It is an adequate amount of time for a Minister properly to answer a question without encouraging him or her to speak for an unnecessarily long time. It is therefore disappointing that the Government, being dissatisfied with that experiment that worked reasonably well&mdash;after we tried three separate periods of time&mdash;feels it has to come in here tonight and have another go at extending the period for answering questions to four minutes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are really trying to do, apart from cutting out the unnecessary expressions of Ministers, is get more questions asked and answered during the time allowed for Question Time. Unfortunately, the record of this Government has been poor compared with that of previous governments. It has taken less questions and therefore answered less questions. The opportunity presented to this chamber to require accountability during Question Time&mdash;which some might say is the principal opportunity presented to an Opposition in the Parliament to require accountability&mdash;has been unduly limited. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to the constraint on the time in which a Minister can answer a question, we suggest that a minimum number of questions should be asked and answered. So far, regrettably, that has been rejected not only by the Government&mdash;which is not surprising because it objects to answering any questions&mdash;but also, surprisingly, by the Australian Democrats. I say `surprisingly' because I cannot understand any argument by which the Australian Democrats would wish to limit their opportunity to ask a reasonable number of questions and to get answers. In fact, because of their very small numbers in this chamber, they have limited opportunity to do so in any event. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Government were required to answer a reasonable number of questions, the Australian Democrats would have the opportunity to ask more and, therefore, presumably, better fulfil their responsibility to the electors who put them here. For some reason that I do not understand, they have been unwilling to accept that very reasonable reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a debate for another day, but it brings me back to the principal issue we are debating here&mdash;that is, whether our approach, the three-minute option, the more successful of the options, should be re-endorsed tonight or whether the Government should be extended further liberty than that previous time constraint which seemed to operate quite well at the end of the last session. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would hope that the Australian Democrats will realise not only that three minutes is an adequate time in which a Minister can answer a question, but also that by constraining Ministers to three minutes they hopefully will again have more opportunity to ask questions themselves. If we add the minutes allowed for asking questions to the four minutes that the Government proposes for answers, plus the two minutes for supplementary questions and answers, we are up to a maximum of seven minutes per question. In an hour&mdash;the Australian Democrats can work this out by simple arithmetic calculation&mdash;very few questions might be answered if the Ministers decide to take their full time. On the precedent of today, it looks as though these Ministers will take every second that they are allowed to answer questions. I ask Senator Kemp how many questions that would bring us down to. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some very interesting figures have been pulled out to see just what happened when we had one minute for a question and four minutes for the answer, followed by one minute for the supplementary question and one minute for the answer. Those figures showed that we might as well have no limits, because that arrangement brought us right back to the average experienced in this chamber when there were no limits on questions and no limits on answers.

So there was the same average over a four-week period, irrespective of whether there was one minute for questions and three minutes for answers or one minute for questions and four minutes for answers.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, I want to speak for a few minutes on the matter at hand. You might remember that I moved the first notice of motion that led to the trials last year. I did it because I was sick and tired of sitting in here at Question Time waiting weeks on end to ask a question while Ministers abused the procedure. At that time I thought the biggest abusers were former Senator Button and Senator Collins.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Generally Senator Button, as then Leader of the Government in the Senate, was asked the first question. He would spend the first five minutes bucketing the questioner, the next five minutes bucketing the Opposition and probably another five minutes answering the question. Some 15 or 20 minutes were taken up before the answer to the first question was finished. We would then hopefully get a few shorter answers to other questions. But then as soon as Senator Collins was asked a question, time got away again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having had enough of this, I went around to the Clerk's office and got some advice on how to stop this abuse of Question Time. The first suggestion was to have one minute for the original question, two minutes for the answer, one minute for a supplementary question and one minute for the subsequent answer. We must remember that that proposal got off the ground with the help of the Democrats. They at least saw the need to give it a trial. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Bourne has just pointed out, we averaged 31 questions while that trial occurred. It was rather fast and furious, but I thought that questions were being answered to the best ability of the Government Ministers at the time without the usual bucketing of the questioner and the Opposition before the questions were answered. I thought it worked fairly well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But then we tried having one minute for the original question, four minutes for the answer, one minute for the supplementary question and one minute for the supplementary answer. We also tried having one minute for the original question, three minutes for the answer, one minute for the supplementary question and one minute for the supplementary answer. I believe that most of those trials were fairly successful. As Senator Bourne has said, there was no difference in the number of questions asked as between a time limit of four minutes or a time limit of three minutes for answers. She reckoned the number was the same. I think she said 23 questions were asked within those time limits, if I am correct. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason for that result&mdash;there being no difference in the number of questions asked with a three-minute or four-minute answer limit&mdash;is that it stopped the Ministers abusing the available time. It stopped them using the first 20 minutes of Question Time to answer one question, so that both those trials virtually had the same effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot understand the Democrats not supporting the three-minute answer limit, because it gives people a chance to ask a question. One minute for the original question, three minutes for the answer, one minute for a supplementary question and one minute for the answer adds up to six minutes. So our proposal should allow for at least 10 new questions an hour. Under this proposal, eight or nine questions per hour could be asked. Therefore, our proposal would mean a chance for senators to ask an extra question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that Senator Kemp has already asked Senator Bourne why she cannot support that sort of situation. I believe that the Democrats have as much right as we have in this Senate to question the Government. I cannot really see why the Democrats would turn down the opportunity of being able to ask an extra question of the Government. As I said before, the Democrats helped us before. We would not have got the proposal up without their help. I forget who I dealt with at the time; it was probably Senator Coulter, the defrocked leader of the Democrats. Certainly the Democrats helped us with the experiment. It worked in stopping the abuse of Question Time. I cannot see why they would want to give up the chance of asking an extra question. </PARA>

When I first came into the Senate, there was unlimited Question Time. We then went to having one-minute questions and two-minute answers that Senator Panizza talked about. I could see that some Ministers were struggling under that time constraint, because it was quite obvious that their staff were well used to preparing five- and six-minute answers and that Ministers were trying to get them through in two or three. We could see the difficulty that that was presenting to some Ministers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We then came to a reasonable conclusion of three minutes and one minute. I fail to see Senator Bourne's logic when she says we have the same number of questions whether it is a three minute limit or a four minute limit; therefore, we should go for the four-minute limit. Surely if three minutes is the average, the most sensible thing to do would be to have three minute answers to questions. This would mean that Ministers would then be confined to answering questions in three minutes instead of spending four minutes plus one minute to answer supplementary questions which are sometimes dorothy dixers from their own back bench. This sometimes limits the answers the Ministers give to Opposition backbenchers or shadow Ministers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was told when I entered the Senate that the opportunity for asking questions, particularly from the back bench, was somewhat limited. I came in at a time when lengthy answers were being given by Ministers in response to questions.

This was because of the time constraints that were placed on Ministers answering questions. </PARA>

Of all the proposals we tried last year&mdash;we tried the whole gamut of no time limits and two, three and four-minute answers to questions&mdash;it seems that the three minute time limit was the most satisfactory both for Ministers to answer questions and also for Opposition, Democrat and Independent senators to ask a greater number of questions. </PARA>

This means that there is then the possibility that fewer questions would be asked than there would be if a three-minute time limit were applied to the answers of Ministers. I hope the Democrats will see their way clear to support this amendment so that all senators may be able to meet their obligations in the Senate and have far more opportunities to ask questions on matters they feel are important. </PARA>

<PARA>This reform seeks to ensure that the sessional order that was in place at the end of the last Parliament remains in place for calendar year 1993. I really believe that most honourable senators would agree that this limit on speeches at the second reading stage worked to the benefit of all honourable senators and the chamber as a whole. I believe that anyone who cannot deliver a speech on the second reading in 20 minutes should not be a member of parliament. Most of the effective speeches that I have heard in this chamber&mdash;and none of them have come from the Opposition side&mdash;have been a great deal more limited than 20 minutes in duration. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator O'Chee, of course, is the most longwinded person in the chamber. In his entire life as a senator he has never laid a glove on the Government. In his case it would not make any difference whether he made a speech on the second reading&mdash;or any other speech&mdash;for 20 minutes, 30 minutes, 40 minutes or 40 hours. Even though he may have been fourth-placegetter in the world schoolboy debating championships, he is no good in here&mdash;and all his colleagues know it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This sessional order took effect on 25 November last year and I do not think there was one complaint from the Opposition after it came into being. I stress with this motion&mdash;as I have done with a range of other motions that we have been debating&mdash;that, with the exception of one or two or perhaps three honourable senators on the other side of the chamber, everyone in the chamber agrees that this motion is a necessary reform. Although a whole range of honourable senators on the other side of the chamber will be dragging their feet to vote against this motion, they will all hope like hell that it gets up, because there are one or two or three of their colleagues whose contributions they want to have constrained by a sessional order limiting speeches on the second reading to 20 minutes. </PARA>

It worked in the best interests of honourable senators themselves and the whole chamber. Let us be clear: it saved absolutely oodles of time in the Government's legislative program. The situation is that interminable, boring, convoluted, irrelevant speeches on the second reading came ad nauseam from the other side of the chamber about every possible red herring and bearing very little relevance to a matter before the chamber and they were used as a filibuster in a deliberate ploy by Opposition senators to ensure that the processes of this chamber bogged down. We all know it. Those opposite all know it. Most of them want this to get up. Look at the smile on Senator Calvert's face. He just hopes like hell that this gets up because he no more wants to listen to Senator Bishop or Senator O'Chee for 30 minutes on a speech on the second reading than I do or Senator Loosley does.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have never heard anybody debate an issue in a way that actually supports the Opposition's case as Senator Faulkner has in telling us how many people actually speak for less than 20 minutes. It indicates that we do not need this rule. This proposition is typical of this Government in that it interferes with those concerned and tells them how to run their lives when, in fact, they can run their lives quite well. We can run this chamber quite well with people speaking for about 20 minutes or less.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to put to the Senate today that many people, as Senator Faulkner has demonstrated with the figures that have been produced for him, speak for 20 minutes or less, but there are occasions on which people need to speak for up to 30 minutes. That would be when the Government jams legislation through this chamber or, for its own purposes, debates Bills cognately, when shadow Ministers or backbenchers find themselves trying to discuss three or four Bills in half an hour&mdash;what the Government now wants to make 20 minutes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to see us at least consider the possibility that when two or more Bills are being debated cognately we have a 30-minute time limit rather than the 20-minute time limit. I would ask the Democrats to consider that as a possibility&mdash;as a compromise for what I think is a stupid decision to have the time limit reduced to 20 minutes. If we were to do that, at least issues could be debated properly here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find it somewhat offensive that Senator Faulkner would stand up here and say that debating issues in this chamber is a waste of time. He may think it is a waste of time and it shows his attitude towards the role of parliament and the opportunity for representatives of the people to debate Bills and debate issues.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support Senator Patterson's amendment because it is a fall-back position. I am certainly opposed to reducing time limits for speeches in second reading debates from 30 minutes. Only a short time ago the time limit was an hour, and I go along with that being a bit over the top. Senator Faulkner spent 15 minutes illustrating why we should speak for 20 minutes. In his own words, he should have been able to do that in three or four minutes but he had to extend it to 15 minutes to point out to the chamber why we should speak for 20 minutes. If that is an indication of why we should have 30-minute speeches&mdash;to accommodate people such as Senator Faulkner who cannot get their point across&mdash;then I think we ought to take that into consideration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> This particular chamber should have time to examine very thoroughly and make our point on legislation that needs review. To reduce our time from 30 minutes to 20 minutes would be to erode this chamber's necessary rights. I was going to make the point that Senator Patterson did, that an average of 76 per cent of speakers could make their point in 20 minutes. If 76 per cent require only 20 minutes, then the majority is speaking in 20 minutes or less. I think Senator Faulkner would agree that I am not someone who gets up here and speaks on every Bill on every occasion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I said Senator Faulkner would agree. When I do want to speak and make a contribution in this chamber I want sufficient time to be able to put down a case in a manner that people can understand. Last time I spoke during a second reading debate I had to seek leave to go three or four minutes over my 20-minute time limit. That speech was prepared, it was culled, reculled and culled again to get a 30-minute speech down to a 20-minute speech. Even then, I had to ask Senator McMullan to extend me the courtesy of another three or four minutes, which he did.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am totally opposed to this reduction because it is an evasion of our rights, a cutting down of what is meaningful in this Senate, and that is, being able to get up and debate a case thoroughly. I know that when we get into cognate debates towards the end of the session, we jam up to eight or nine Bills together, but surely to goodness we can appeal to the Democrats for a bit of commonsense on this. They did display some commonsense on an amendment about four or five minutes ago. I do not know what the Democrats are up to. This certainly would not have happened in Senator Chipp's time or Senator Haines's time, and I am not sure that the previous leader of the Democrats, Senator Coulter, would have let it happen. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am also opposed to the proposal that reduces the speaking time for speeches during second reading debates from 30 minutes to 20 minutes. I implore the Democrats to think very seriously about it. I suggest this particularly to Senator Bourne, who gave us an argument a short time ago in relation to the reduction from four minutes to three minutes for the answering of questions during Question Time. She said that we really end up with the same number of questions being answered even if we reduce the time from four minutes to three minutes. The argument she used&mdash;and clearly the Senate agreed with her&mdash;was that most of the Ministers would answer in three minutes anyway.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think Senator Faulkner has quite sensibly and adequately outlined to the Senate that on a clear majority of times, senators' contributions are indeed 20 minutes or less. There are very few occasions&mdash;and he has, with his statistics, shown us that it is roughly 24 per cent over a couple of years&mdash;where speeches have exceeded 20 minutes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know personally&mdash;I have only been here for coming up to three years now&mdash;that on only three occasions in my memory did I speak for 30 minutes. The first one was my first speech&mdash;and I did not enjoy that 30 minutes one bit. I see Senator Sherry, who is wearing his liquor and allied trades outfit, nodding in agreement. I think Senator Sherry has been down at the Hyatt moonlighting as a butler to make up for the lack of pay of Parliamentary Secretaries; Parliamentary Secretaries do not get paid&mdash;I had to slip that in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Faulkner in his argument has put before us&mdash;and clearly gets some agreement from senators who do not like to sit here listening to so-called windbags&mdash;that this is really to constrain windbags. He has agreed during his contribution tonight that this proposal does constrain people. But I put it to the Senate that it does not just constrain windbags; it constrains everybody. This is why I am opposed to it and why I think the Democrats should be opposed to it&mdash;because it imposes a constraint that is not necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have already all agreed that most speeches during second reading debates are made in less than 20 minutes, but  there are other occasions. I just mentioned my first speech; we heard a contribution from Senator Carr yesterday, and I do not think he would have wanted to reduce his contribution to less than 30 minutes. Another good example of a long speech in this chamber this week was of course the Governor-General's speech, and I think many of us would have liked to have constrained that to 30 minutes. But, again, it is a good example of a speech where there is detailed policy and arguments to be conveyed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second example I remember when I spoke at great length was my speech on the so-called political ad bans package of legislation on which many speakers spoke for a long time. I am sure that members of the Government would have called that a filibuster, most unkindly. That is a good example of a package of Bills which contained many philosophical, intellectual and policy arguments which required very earnest reflection and some consideration and development of arguments. Indeed, the High Court of Australia, if one reads its judgments in relation to the constitutionality of those laws, would spend a lot longer than 30 minutes developing its arguments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third occasion on which I gave a speech longer than 30 minutes&mdash;if I remember correctly, on that occasion I actually success</PARA>
<PARA>fully sought an extension of time&mdash;was in relation to a package of corporations laws amendments which were extremely detailed. It was just simply impossible to cover all the points that the Opposition needed to make in a contribution of 20 minutes or less. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I plead with the Democrats to allow the flexibility for senators to use 30 minutes on the occasions they do; to, of course, exert natural pressure on our colleagues to make concise contributions; but to recognise that there are many occasions when senators do need that full 30 minutes. None of us like getting up here and wind-bagging for 30 minutes, except for a few notable exceptions, but they are the exceptions. I implore the Democrats to apply the same logic to this debate&mdash;that by limiting contributions from 30 minutes down to 20 minutes we will not actually shorten the time the Senate devotes to second reading stages of Bills. Therefore, by keeping it at 30 minutes we are not constraining senators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should not be constrained. We are very much the only legislative chamber in this Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia. The other place, of course, is not a legislative chamber; it is merely a rubber stamp for the Executive. This is the only chamber where one can properly deliberate upon legislation. For the Democrats to agree with the Government to restrict our time for speaking on second readings is, of course, in contravention of the fundamental reason for this chamber and for us being here. It is, therefore, against the very principles of democracy for which we should stand. I urge the Democrats&mdash;indeed, I urge all senators&mdash;to oppose this restriction, restraint and constraint upon senators' contributions to second reading debates. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7U4">Senator BELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Without interruption from Senator Boswell, it will take much less time. The first matter I wish to raise concerns the attack on certain small business enterprises by the Labor Party through the Federal Airports Corporation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In August last year the assistance of my office was sought by Tasmanian car rental companies to oppose a proposal by the Federal Airports Corporation to impose on them a particularly severe contract and set of charges. The contract was and is designed to get money out of hire car operators who meet customers at airports after having arranged a contract with them either through a travel agent, by mail or over the telephone. It is not business which is in any way won or touted at the airport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Of course, having become a public corporation and being directed by the Labor Party that it should raise its own revenue, the FAC is understandably on the lookout for every little device that it can dream up to make a dollar. I suppose it should not be criticised for that. We should be, and we are, critical of the Labor Party&mdash;each and every Labor senator and member of the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To meet this corporatisation philosophy and profit seeking goals, the FAC proposal was to impose a three tier structure of charges, with tier one being a staffed desk, tier two an identifying sign and car space and tier three the right to meet customers outside the terminal and no designated car space. For this privilege the operators would have to pay $6,000. That was the first proposal the FAC came up with. Understandably, the car rental operators rejected that proposal outright; understandably, they felt that they were seen as a threat by the major car rental companies which were wanting protection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In October a new four tier proposal was put up and that was no better. It still attempted to impose a massive fee increase on small car operators. I said at the time, `It particularly penalises the small businesses who meet only their pre-booked customers at the terminal'. It certainly did. The proposed 11 per cent turnover fee was outrageous compared with the five per cent to be imposed on larger operators. This was at a time when we were still talking about level playing fields. That particular concoction would also mean for the smaller operators a considerable increase in record keeping, audit fees and accountant fees. It was a proposal that the operators were never going to be able to afford. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At that time I called on my Tasmanian colleagues to stand up for small business and for operators to continue to resist the proposals. The operators have held the line. Most Tasmanian politicians&mdash;I say with deference to Senator Calvert who is intently listening to this&mdash;have been conspicuously silent. It can only be because they agree with taxing small Tasmanian businesses out of existence. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen correspondence that Senator Sherry has also addressed to the Minister. What I would like to see as a result of my raising the matter here tonight is a little more backbone in our combined approach to the Minister on this matter. At that time, when I was asking for support, a subsequent motion in the Senate by myself on that subject got nowhere. It is all very well to sing and dance and wave arms around but when the opportunity presented itself by a motion in the Senate, begging for support, it was met with silence. That demonstrates what action and what real support was given.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In November I wrote to the Tasmanian Minister for Tourism thinking that he would be interested in supporting Tasmanian small business, particularly because it was providing a service to tourists. I suggested to him that the Tasmanian Government might consider establishing Tasmanian welcome centres at the airports. He did not think the idea was very practical. Since then, despite requests from operators, he has shown no interest whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In February this year the operators received a new set of contract proposals involving an access fee, a designated meeting place fee, a car parking fee and a booking fee. For the operators this all added up to an increase in costs of over 100 per cent. The proposal succeeded in creating a new national grouping to oppose the FAC. That group has become known as the Licensed Off Airport Car Rental Operators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In February this grouping met with the FAC. At that meeting the FAC led the operators to believe that the proposal would be reconsidered. It was, but the FAC did not change anything. Operators are not to be permitted inside terminal buildings unless they agree to pay 11 per cent of their turnover derived from customers who use FAC terminals. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That 11 per cent is in excess of the rate of profit that they make. The operators wrote to the FAC to express their opinion on this particular offer. I quote from a letter written by Mr Theo Coppens, spokesperson for the Licensed Off Airport Car Rental Operators, and addressed to Mr Brian Maxwell, the Manager, New Business, at the FAC head office. In part the letter reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without exception all operators reject the proposal in its entirety.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What you are proposing is almost with total disregard of the points raised at our meeting in Sydney on the 24th February.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not one Off-Airport Car Rental Operator will subscribe to this proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You have totally alienated this sector of the industry and we will now seek every assistance from all avenues to get the necessary support to have this totally unfair and financially crippling proposal abolished.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You will so severely effect the livelihood of so many people that all affected will take drastic action in this matter and are totally unified for the first time in the industry's history.</PARA>
<PARA>I cease quoting from the letter to point out that we are talking about a group of people who are quite notorious for the intensity of the competition that they engage in with each other. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are people who are engaged in private business. They are seldom able to come together on any issue, because if they are not in competition with each other, they are seeking different markets and have little in common in terms of a professional association. But the FAC succeeded in uniting them. To that extent, forceful and sincere language was used in that letter. The upshot is that the letter does not seem to have evoked any meaningful response from the FAC, despite it being fairly clear that the negotiations had reached a stage of mutual stand-offishness&mdash;I can only call it that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the FAC decided that the new contracts, signed or not, were to operate from 1 April. I just wonder what sort of authority the FAC thinks it has to do that. Magnanimously, the operators were given 45 days by the FAC to agree to the proposal. It seems to me that the options these particular people had were a bit like being asked, `Do you want to be throttled, strangled or hung?'. None of the options presented to them were able to be accepted by the operators if they wanted to remain in business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of April I received yet another plea for assistance from a beleaguered operator. This letter sums up the frustration and belated hope for a fair deal. I might add that we do not agree with the operators. We do not think that they should have to pay anything. We do not believe that the FAC should be corporatised and that we should be trying to extract a dollar out of every government activity. We thought that was also the Labor Party position, but it seems as if that has been lost in the mists of time. It is no different from the present conservative position. The letter that I was talking about reads as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After months of negotiations with F.A.C. the new contracts are about to be signed by car rental operators. The conditions have been in force since 1st. April.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a Tasmanian independent operator who is seeking to continue meeting pre-booked clients at the Hobart and Launceston Airports in the same friendly way we have been doing for 10 years, we are appalled at the petty barriers being enforced by F.A.C. since 1st. April. Because we consider our business falls below the 2% of total turnover generated from the airport, we have been prepared to sign the Alternative A contract which demands an airport access fee and $5.00 per booking. But, we cannot accept that our staff can be excluded from entering the air-conditioned/heated terminals to personally greet our pre booked clients. With the Tasmanian winter fast approaching, our staff are being forced to stand outside exposed to the elements to meet our tourists.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our alternative, if we wish to enter the building, is to sign the contract Option 3 which according to F.A.C., is designed for operators whose business exceeds 2% of airport turnover. By going with option 3, we could meet our clients inside the terminal but instead of $5.00 per booking our charges would be 9% of our airport turnover. This would be financial suicide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the member of LOARCO (Licensed Off Airport Car Rental Operators) we would welcome a revision of the Alternative A contract that would allow us to meet our pre-booked clients inside the terminals. This would allow us to be supporting and promoting Australian tourism in a manner conducive to the hospitality industry, thus saving our clients from any stress and embarrassment at the commencement of their Tasmanian holiday.</PARA>
<PARA>That letter speaks very well for itself. It does not need any glorification from me to prove its point. Since the beginning of April, the Federal Airports Corporation at both Launceston and Hobart airports have been acting as if the contracts are in place. Security personnel have been physically preventing representatives of the car rental companies from entering the terminal buildings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have issued a press release calling for these hired thugs of the FAC to be called off. The only response was from the General Manager of the Federal Airports Corporation in Tasmania, Mr Bernard Lynch. He said on radio, and he is reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Launceston Examiner,</EMPHASIS> as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The companies inside the terminal&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and that refers to Avis, Thrifty, Budget and Hertz&mdash;none of which are Tasmanian companies&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">are paying handsomely and need to have their business protected.</PARA>
<PARA>There we have it. That is exactly what the FAC is really about&mdash;creating a limited and cosy market for its big business clients. It seems that that is also what the Labor Party is about. I have not had any recognition from the Minister or any other spokesperson on behalf of the party that it is unacceptable for the FAC's General Manager in Tasmania to be considering that that is his proper role and duty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps he is being led to think that. I read with interest the latest newspaper of the Federal Airports Corporation. On the front page of volume 1, No.1, of April 1993, we are told `A Big Mac and corporate culture'. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">McDonald's was used as an example of a corporate culture the FAC might emulate at a conference of the corporation's senior management in Brisbane.</PARA>
<PARA>If that is the sort of game we are in, no wonder we cannot serve our clients; no wonder we cannot provide airport access to people. They are in there for the buck. That is what is what it is all about. To charge people for the simple exercise of meeting customers as they get off the aeroplane is one thing, but to justify that exercise as providing protection to businesses is well and truly beyond what I would expect of the Labor Party, and it is certainly does not seem to describe properly the role of the Federal Airports Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To make it worse, the restrictions that we have seen so far have only really been applied to the Tasmanian car rental operators. Why is it that Tasmania is being singled out? Senator Sherry would know. It is because Tasmania is an easy target. It is because it is only Tasmania where these smaller operators have a significant percentage of customers who they meet at airline terminals. Why? People who travel to Tasmania have to cross the water. A lot of them do not bring their cars with them on the aeroplane. They like to hire cars. So they are sitting ducks for this manipulation,  this  bullying tactic,  by  the FAC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If that is not the case, I wonder whether any instructions have been issued to security personnel at any other airport. That is a question I have addressed to the Minister. I have addressed a couple of questions to the Minister. I have received no answers yet. I just wonder whether he really knows what is going on here. If he does and endorses it, I am disgusted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If it is only Tasmania, the practice will have a severe effect on Tasmania's image as a tourist State. The companies do expect to lose business if they cannot meet their customers in a civilised manner and they cannot afford the rates being demanded by FAC. They cannot afford to pay that sort of money just to meet somebody&mdash;just to stand on the carpet for five minutes&mdash;with whom they have already done business, with whom they have already made an arrangement and with whom they have a contract which they wish to fulfil by showing the person where the car is. The whole episode is a sad, sorry and unAustralian saga that must be brought urgently to a sensible and amicable conclusion. I seek a conclusion which is much less greedy and much less heavy-handed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I apologise for monopolising the time, but it is important that I raise tonight another matter that is also Tasmanian-oriented. As senators, we are here to represent concerns in our own States. I draw the attention of the Senate to recent activities of the Tasmanian Forestry Commission. Constituents of mine living and farming organically around the Lorinna water catchment were horrified to learn that the Tasmanian Forestry Commission had gone ahead and sprayed the herbicide Atrazine in the Lorinna area, after much pleading and after the residents had pointed out how residual Atrazine is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As of today four residents of this sparsely populated area have been arrested so far, fighting to protect their right to uncontaminated water. For five years, the residents have been fighting to protect their water catchment&mdash;firstly from logging, which resulted in significant siltation of the water supply, and now from being sprayed with a very persistent herbicide. This herbicide, Atrazine, in its various forms is recommended by some manufacturers to be applied at the suggested minimum rate of 55 litres per hectare and up to 110 litres per hectare. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">General instructions on the label of one brand of Atrazine warned that rain immediately following an application can concentrate the chemical in soil depressions at rates of more than 3.6 litres a hectare. As Senator Sherry would know, Lorinna receives over 1,000 millimetres of rain per year. It rains frequently. If Atrazine is applied at a rate of 6.5 litres per hectare, it will persist in the soil for 18 months. Higher rates of application will persist a great deal longer, perhaps several years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people of Lorinna have until now enjoyed what should be the right of every human being&mdash;the right to uncontaminated water, food and air. In that particularly peaceful setting of Tasmania, this is something which has until now been readily available. I call on the Tasmanian health authorities to provide a written guarantee to these people that the chemical will not turn up in the local water supply. Further, I call on them to provide a guarantee that the State Government will compensate these people if they are denied `Level A' organic producer accreditation from the National Association for Sustainable Agriculture Australia. If that certification is not available due to the actions of the forestry commission, I believe that the State Government of Tasmania is liable for having caused that certification to be unavailable to those people. Until now, they have certainly been able to attain that accreditation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this area, unemployment is up in the order of 90 per cent. The local Commonwealth Employment Service should seriously consider starting up an employment scheme which offers the opportunity to remove manually the weeds which are the subject of this application of Atrazine. If that could be done, in conjunction with the forestry commission, we might be seeing an alternative which would be very useful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this area, five families have been planning and working for three years to convert their productive areas by using organic farming principles. They are doing so for some very good and commonsense reasons. Australia is following the movement towards chemical-free foods, in line with the trends that are well documented overseas. For example, in the United Kingdom and in Europe in general, demand for organic produce has grown considerably. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Forestry Commission of Tasmania, by wilfully causing a residual herbicide to be sprayed in the catchment area that organic farmers use as a water supply, has behaved in what could only be described as a disgraceful way. Section 17(1)d of the Tasmanian Environment Protection Act 1973 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A person shall not cause or knowingly permit to flow, put, or knowingly permit to be put, any pollutant into any river, stream, watercourse, lake, pond, or marsh.</PARA>
<PARA>The Tasmanian Forestry Commission&mdash;or indeed any person the Minister looks favourably upon&mdash;can be exempted from this Act. That effectively makes the Act hardly worth the paper it is printed upon. The situation can only be described as a disgrace. The legislation to protect Tasmania's environment must be amended to do what it is supposed to do&mdash;protect the environment. As it is, the people of Tasmania are faced with legislation in the shape in which it might have been in the 1940s. What is accepted as best environmental management practice in most of the developed world just does not exist here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of the people of Lorinna have chosen to make the valley their home due to its cleanliness and proximity to pristine world heritage areas. But the Forestry Commission, by spraying herbicide in the local water catchment, has put at risk a valuable and potentially growing export market. The export market for Tasmanian organic food is set to boom. Rainwater from Tasmania is already sold overseas because of the demand for a pure product. That is an image which has rested easily upon Tasmania until now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The food grown organically and exported will undoubtedly grow in volume in successive years partly, I must say, because on 3 May this year the Commonwealth Government commissioned the advertising agency Mojo to develop a clean food export strategy, at a cost of some $5 million. Quite rightly, the Commonwealth Government believes that it is worth investing that sort of money. Yet that sort of investment is jeopardised by the activities that have gone on under the auspices of the Tasmanian Government. Clean green Minister Crean quite rightly identifies with this push. I dare say that he should be offended by actions which compromise that clean green push. In Australia, in 1990, the Australian domestic organic market was worth some $28.7 million. In that year, in the United Kingdom, sales of organic produce were estimated to be worth $217 million&mdash;representing two per cent of total expenditure by British citizens in food shops. The West German health food cooperative Neuform sold $750 million worth of organic health food in 1985. The potential has been recognised by Minister Crean. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the United States, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Supermarket Business</EMPHASIS> publication estimated that organic produce accounted for some $350-odd million of national retail sales. A share of this market, indeed access to this market, for a community like the one at Lorinna is vital if the community is to prosper sustainably and unemployment is to be affected favourably. But the actions of the Forestry Commission in splashing a residual herbicide around the catchment has put this budding sunrise Tasmanian industry at grave risk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This market is particularly sensitive. Any food that has lost its organic accreditation status due to contamination by chemicals will not be sold on the sorts of markets that I have been describing. The market is an informed market. It is a market which seeks the certification, the signal, that the food has been properly accredited, and it is a market which is prepared to pay for that accreditation. Consumers of organic food usually are quite happy to pay 10 or 20 per cent more, with premium quality produce perhaps even commanding 40 per cent more, than conventionally produced foods. Things like organically produced chickens will command perhaps even 80 or 100 per cent above other retail prices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A telephone poll of a thousand voters conducted on 1 May and 3 May 1989 established that 83 per cent of people would prefer food grown without chemicals even if it cost more. Only 16 per cent of those people polled said that it was sensible to use chemicals. The organic food producers of Lorinna are well aware of the fact that so many modern consumers feel very strongly about the food they eat and are prepared to pay considerably more for what they see as necessary for their wellbeing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The organic producers at Lorinna are poised to gear up to cater for this growing industry. It would be extremely difficult to qualify for venture capital to start these organically sustainable projects on a larger scale if a bank or other leading institution perceived that there was a risk of them losing their accreditation due to circumstances beyond their control. That is really the crux of what I have been getting at tonight: the Forestry Commission has, despite protestations, gone ahead in its usual red-necked manner and put at risk the necessary accreditation that producers of organic foods must have in order to gain access to those organic markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whatever senators may personally feel about organically grown produce, the fact is that there is a growing demand for this clean food. That demand must not be jeopardised by the actions of the Tasmanian Forestry Commission. If the Tasmanian State Government is to have any credibility in protecting the environment it will amend the Environment Protection Act to allow for the prosecution of government departments that are found</PARA>
