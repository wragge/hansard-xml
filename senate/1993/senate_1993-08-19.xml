<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has come to our notice that two documents have been inserted into Australian law by a notice in the Gazette on 13th January 1993 and 24th February 1993. They relate to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (HREOC) Act 1986 with the "United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child" and the "Declaration on the Elimination of all Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion and Belief".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We understand that a notice of motion to disallow them must be given in the Senate by 17th August or the House of Representatives soon after. We ask that you do all in your power to oppose the United Nations Religion Declaration to ensure the continuance of religious freedom in this country. We also ask that Parliament also please do all in its power to disallow the Child's Rights Treaty as it could have disastrous effects on the family and also on society generally.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Surely the responsibility and accountability for bringing up children should rest with parents' loving discipline, not with the government. Laws already exist to safeguard children's welfare. Why do we need laws to allow licence and rebellion to multiply? Apparently Article 15 gives the child the right to associate with whomever he/she pleases and parents' rights stated in Article 5 are worded in legally weak and qualified terms.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of equal concern is the ability of a Government to change laws merely by publishing a notice in the Gazette without a full debate and vote in Parliament. I trust that you will be able to take steps to stop such an insidious abuse of power by disallowing these Gazetted notices from becoming law without full parliamentary debate and vote by members.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ordinance amends provisions in five laws that have been applied to the Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Land Act 1933 (W.A.)(C.K.I.) is amended by the addition of ss.176, 177 and 179 providing for the creation of easements for public amenities, the dedication of streets and the acceptance of plans of survey respectively. There is no explanation in the Explanatory Statement of the effect, if any, of these provisions on the rights of private land owners or lessors in the Territory. For instance, the creation of an easement by s.176 could possibly reduce the value of a parcel of land. Amendments of the Local Government Act 1960 (WA) (CKI) may also raise similar problems.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ordinance regulates the importation of arms, ammunition and explosive in the Islands. The commencement clause provides for the ordinance to take effect on the gazettal of a notice by the Minister. This is a departure from the usual practice where, if there is no fixed date, there will be automatic commencement after a set period, normally six months. No reason has been given in the Explanatory Statement for this departure from current practice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sections 8, 11 and 12 respectively confer discretions on the Commissioner to grant or refuse a permit, to vary a permit and to revoke or suspend a permit. Sections 8 and 12 provide only for subjective criteria to control this power; section 11 provides no criteria at all. Sections 8 and 12 provide for an appeal to the Minister against an adverse decision, but there appears to be no such appeal from a s.11 decision. Perhaps you could advise the reasons for this.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 13 provides that the Minister's decision on appeals is final. There appears to be no provision for the Minister to delegate this power and we would be grateful for your confirmation that this is the case and that all s.13 appeals must be decided personally by the Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, there does not appear to be an appeal from a decision under s.14 to refuse to grant a temporary import permit or to grant such a permit subject to unacceptable conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 27 confers wide powers of delegation on the Commissioner, who may delegate all of his or her powers to any person at all. Furthermore, any person to whom the Commissioner delegates power may, in turn, subdelegate all of such power to any person at all. These powers of delegation and subdelegation are unusual.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 24 provides that unless seized firearms are returned within 60 days, they must be taken to court to be dealt with according to law. This appears to be a long period.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Importation of Arms, Ammunition and Explosives Ordinance 1992 . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">of the Territory of Cocos (Keeling) Islands. Mrs Kelly has asked me to respond on her behalf. I regret the delay in replying.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Local Government (Transition)(Amendment) Ordinance 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee was concerned that new sections 108, 111, 115, 122 and 133 of the applied Local Government Act 1960 (W.A.)(C.K.I.), which require a returning officer or other electoral official to be satisfied of various matters, do not contain an indication of what would happen if a person is not satisfied with the official's decision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Ordinance enabled the former system of voting on Cocos (which involved voters affixing a stamp on the ballot paper next to a photograph of their favoured candidate) to continue to be used for the first elections under the applied WA Act, held on 1 May 1993. This allows Territory residents to become familiar with the electoral provisions in the WA Act, under which subsequent elections will be conducted. The sections of the Act to which the Committee refers are amended only to the extent necessary to achieve this objective and the basic framework of the Act, including the provisions covering challenges to decisions made by electoral officers, is not changed. This is in line with the overall objective of applying WA laws to the Territory with a minimum of modifications.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The WA provisions do not give individual electors a statutory right to object to decisions by an electoral officer. Section 150 of the Act does, however, allow a candidate or a group of six or more electors to bring a complaint to a Court of Disputed Returns alleging that the result of an election is invalid. In view of the overall objective, I believe these provisions are adequate and should not be changed. . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Land Legislation Ordinance 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As requested, I can assure the Committee that this Ordinance will not be prejudicial to any private landowners in the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. New section 176 of the Land Act 1933 (W.A.)(C.K.I.), which relates to easements, only applies to land where the Commonwealth already possesses the rights set out in the section. The Ordinance simply provides for these rights to be brought within the WA land tenure system, which was introduced to the Islands on 1 July 1992. In addition, the Commonwealth is the only landowner affected by new section 177 of the Land Act and section 286 of the Local Government Act 1960 (W.A.)(C.K.I.), relating to the property in land dedicated as a public street.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Importation of Arms, Ammunition and Explosives Ordinance 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Before addressing the Committee's queries about this Ordinance, I would like to explain that it was necessary to make the Ordinance at the earliest possible date to remedy a deficiency in the Territory's laws which arose because the former law restricting the importation of arms and ammunition was inadvertently repealed when WA laws were introduced. The import restrictions had proved to be the most effective means of controlling the poaching of protected seabirds in the Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I accept that commencement of an Ordinance by Ministerial notice is unusual, however it was not practical for the Ordinance to commence on gazettal because the Regulations and forms necessary for it to operate effectively had not been finalised at that time. A specific date could have been set for the Ordinance's commencement, but this might have enabled persons to take advantage of the deficiency in the existing law to frustrate the Ordinance's purpose. The Ordinance was in fact commenced on 26 February 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The criteria in sections 8 and 12 of the Ordinance are based on those contained in the Firearms Act 1973 of WA. This Act has been applied to the Cocos (Keeling) Islands and sets out criteria for granting a firearms licence but does not regulate the importing of arms and ammunition. Adoption of these criteria reflects the general policy of following WA standards and also ensures that the criteria used for granting import permits and issuing firearms licences are consistent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The principal intention of section 11 of the Ordinance is simply to allow the Commissioner of Police to make minor variations to a permit where, for example, the date on which importation is permitted needs to be altered due to a transport delay. It is obvious, however, that the wording of the section is far broader than this. Consequently, I am prepared to undertake to the Committee to amend this section by inserting criteria to be followed for varying a permit and providing for a right of appeal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee is correct that there is no provision for the Minister to delegate the power to decide appeals under section 13 of the Ordinance. As a Parliamentary Secretary I am, however, authorised to exercise this power on behalf of the Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 6 of the Ordinance imposes penalties for intentionally or recklessly importing a firearm or ammunition except under a valid permit. Section 14 of the Ordinance is intended to cover situations where a person imports a firearm or ammunition due to ignorance of the requirements of the Ordinance. The Commissioner can issue a temporary entry permit to exempt such a person from liability under section 6. Consequently, a refusal by the Commissioner to issue a temporary entry permit involves a determination that the circumstances of importation justify a prosecution under section 6. I do not see it as desirable for a determination of this type to be Ministerially reviewable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I acknowledge that the powers of delegation and subdelegation contained in section 27 of the Ordinance are unusually wide, but I believe that these powers are necessary in view of the remoteness of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. Powers will be delegated principally to the sole police officer permanently stationed in the Territory, but this officer may require assistance at short notice, for example to carry out a search of a ship. A situation of this type occurred in January 1992 when it was necessary to appoint Administration employees and other Territory residents as special constables to seize a large quantity of illegally imported shotgun shells.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 24 of the Ordinance, allowing a 60 day period before seized firearms must be brought before a court, also takes into account the isolation of the Territory and the fact that court officers are based in WA. I intend, however, to monitor the operation of this section and am prepared to amend the Ordinance if 60 days proves to be excessive.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I thank the Committee for drawing my attention to the drafting errors contained in the Ordinance. These errors will be corrected when the Ordinance is amended. . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I trust this information explains to the Committee's satisfaction the approach adopted in the Ordinances.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your letter of 7 April 1993 in which you request advice on why regulation 37G of the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employees) Regulations (amendment) requires employers to retain for 30 years records of accidents and dangerous occurrences which are reported to Comcare Australia. The delay in responding is regretted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the course of the development of the regulations the need for better information about gradual onset disease was addressed. There was concern in particular about the uncertain health outcomes of the use, for example, of some chemicals and other hazardous substances in the workplace. Unions highlighted the need to record and maintain information about accidents and incidents which could lead to the development of gradual onset diseases. Consequently they requested that the regulations require employers to retain accident records for 30 years. Employer representatives agreed to this proposal on the condition that records could be stored electronically.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is envisaged that the retention of this information will be valuable in monitoring and responding to the less obvious and emerging trends in occupational injury and disease in Australian Government employment. This in turn will lead to financial savings by reducing workers' compensation costs.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is a most important motion. The Australian Labor Party has obviously sought to prostitute the principles and practices of the parliament. We have seen recently many instances of the Labor Party, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and various ministers of the government showing disrespect for the institution of the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister has referred to the Senate as `unrepresentative swill'. He has taken actions and has made suggestions with regard to our national symbols and our flag. Now, when the Prime Minister's party is selling off seats in the parliament and access to members of his ministry for $3,000, we have indeed reached a new and total disrespect for the parliament. We need to ask a number of very important questions that arise from this action of the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 13 August that 20 senior business figures were alleged to have paid a $3,000 fee for access to the parliament on budget night on special terms and conditions. The article by Mr Tom Burton referred to the fact that the ALP was seeking to raise funds by offering special access to ministers to be used at the official release of the government's budget and by selling off time with ministers, including the Prime Minister. After watching the budget from the privileged, specially selected, $3,000 seats in the House of Representatives, there were to be direct briefings on the budget by the finance minister, Mr Willis. The brochure went on to outline a whole array of ministers who were then obviously to give special rights and special privilege to the people who took up this offer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ministers named in that article who had agreed to participate where Ministers Crean, Cook, Brereton, Richardson and Collins. The Senate has a particular interest in the terms of the motion, because some of those ministers&mdash;Ministers Cook, Richardson and Collins&mdash;belong to this chamber. We need to ask very explicitly: what on earth could the taxpayers of Australia gain from the ministers' involvement in these special budget briefings? When did the ministers learn about the events that were to be planned, or even when they were subsequently cancelled? Senior Labor figures now seem to be terribly confused over the dates and the activities that were to take place. Why was it finally called off? Was it because it was discovered that it may have breached parliamentary privilege or was it because of lack of interest by business community groups in wanting to participate?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This attempt by the government is nothing short of an unethical and dishonourable way of raising money for the Labor Party's purely partisan purposes. It is concerning that three ministers from this chamber would participate in such a scam. It is terribly important to know what prior access to the budget papers through the ministers' offices had been given and was available in the preparation for the briefings that were to take place at this level. If one considers the particular ministers from this chamber that were to have participated and looks at their portfolios, one can see that the budget implications had special relevance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Richardson, as Minister for Health, obviously had a special interest in the areas of this budget that would have affected many wide ranging commercial interests in the community. Senator Cook, in particular, interests me because in this chamber he represents the primary industry portfolio. The implications that would have arisen for the whole rural sector of Australia and the special privilege that would have been granted to businessmen prepared to pay a $3,000 fee for these special privileges need to be answered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are well aware of many of Senator Collins's actions in relation to his portfolio interests in this chamber for the last year. We are well aware of the interest that he has taken in the waterfront and the shipping portfolio about the reforms that are proposed and what is in the budget. We remember that, not only with regard to the waterfront but also with regard to the Civil Aviation Authority, Senator Collins has had special and commercial interests that have been apparent in the air traffic control system and, much more recently, with the whole pay TV debacle there are implications that would have arisen through this particular budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has to be a special answering by the government of what prior knowledge officers of the Labor Party had of access to these ministers' offices. We need to know the diary commitments that were made by each and every one of the ministers in advance with the Labor Party hierarchy, independent of their roles and their responsibilities to this particular parliament. The full facts and the knowledge and the involvement of the ministers need to be on the table and this Senate chamber ought to have a special report. I call on the Leader of the Government in the Senate to explain comprehensively, in full detail, this particularly ridiculous proposal by the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope, Mr President, that both you and Mr Speaker have called the leaders of the parliamentary wing of the Labor Party to account in this place. I hope that you have challenged the ministers who have been named by the Labor Party for a full report.

But when we come to the discussion, within five days' time, some of the other documents we have relating to the Liberal Party and its various fundraising and involvement schemes will also be put on the record, as a matter of balance. These are ones that actually went ahead, without the Liberal Party intervening and cancelling. We are talking not only at a federal level but also at a state government level.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason Senator Tambling has brought this matter to the attention of the Senate and asked for the information is not because anyone objects to seeing business people or ordinary Australians meeting with their representatives. Indeed, part of the reason is the failure of the Prime Minister to do that. He goes home in the afternoons and bunkers down in the Lodge and does not do his work properly. He does not turn up to the meetings he should properly attend, and he is not available to see Australians and the hurt that they are suffering. </PARA>

I want the ministers of state and other members and senators to be talking to the Australian people so that we make better laws for them. If we are out of touch, we make bad laws. But to say that access to a minister of state, in his capacity of minister of state, after bringing down the prospectus for Australia&mdash;that is, the budget, the most important single financial document that goes on the record&mdash;shall be given exclusively to those who contribute to the coffers of the Australian Labor Party is simply not acceptable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why I rail at the term Senator Ray used in saying that the matter Senator Tambling is raising was a ridiculous one. The ridiculous proposition is that access to the ministers and members of this place should be given only to those who pay. That is what is outrageous. There should be access for the Australian people, for anyone who wants to have access. People will say that that is fine, and we all attend functions for which people charge. It might be $35, it might be $75. But $3,000? Should they charge $3,000 to give exclusive access to somebody who is supposed to be governing for all Australia and is appearing in their official capacity?

It happens all the time. I wonder how many of my colleagues in the House of Representatives sought seats for their families to watch the budget, particularly the new members.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here we have a situation where specially arranged seating in the House of Representatives chamber was to be made available at a fee arranged by the Victorian division of the ALP, a matter of which the ministers appear to have been aware. What I want answered in this matter is: who provided the seats? Who demanded the seats? Whose seats really were they? To whom would these seats normally have been made available? Would they be available to members of parliament and their families, to the public, or were they specially reserved for sale to friends of the Labor Party? If this sort of procedure is allowed to exist then we not only have seats in parliament for sale, we have a Prime Minister for rent and we have various other ministers for rent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am intrigued to note in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> when Mr Gary Gray, the new federal secretary of the Labor Party, said he had cancelled the matter a week before it took place&mdash;none of the participants knew it had been cancelled, but that is by the way; it must have been a very effective cancelling&mdash;he said, and I quote from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>, `I became aware last week that this function was very sloppily organised'. There was no moral objection to selling seats in the House of Representatives, to selling the time of the Prime Minister and other ministers. His objection was that it was sloppily organised. That is a great, moral, firm stand. That is why I want these matters included in the answer. I hope that Senator Evans will ensure that the undertaking Senator Ray gave extends to this matter of whose seats they were. Why were our families and our friends denied access to the House of Representatives because these seats were specifically set aside for people who had bought them?</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this Bill is to give effect to a revised Murray-Darling Basin Agreement between the Commonwealth, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia for the improved management of the land, water and environmental resources of the Murray-Darling Basin. The Agreement is set out in the Schedule to this Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Murray-Darling Basin Agreement provides the framework for intergovernmental cooperation to address natural resource management issues in the Basin of joint concern. As Australia's most important agricultural region, the Murray-Darling Basin is a major focus of the Government's approach to achieving sustainable resource use.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Murray-Darling Basin comprises about one-seventh of Australia. It also produces about one-half of Australia's total output from natural resource-based industries. It supports 25 per cent of the nation's cattle and dairy farms, about 50 per cent of its sheep, lambs and cropland, and almost 75 per cent of its irrigated land. Production derived is valued at some $10 billion annually. It is Australia's agricultural heartland.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Until well after the Second World War, the River Murray Commission, established under the first River Murray Waters Agreement of 1914, stood the test of time in successfully regulating the shared water resources of the River Murray to ensure reliable supplies for irrigation, urban and industrial use. This provided the foundation for the irrigation industry in the Murray Valley and ensured that South Australia received a supply of water essential to its survival and growth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the early 1980's, however, there was growing community and government concern about the economic and environmental costs of resource degradation in the Basin. The four governments party to the River Murray Waters Agreement recognised that a joint approach was necessary to address broader resource and environmental problems in the Basin.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The breakthrough in achieving a genuinely holistic approach to Basin natural resource management came in November 1985 when Ministers with responsibility for natural resources in the Labor Governments of the Commonwealth, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia, agreed to adopt a cooperative approach to the better management of all the resources of the Basin.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This new approach was given effect through an amended River Murray Waters Agreement which was signed by the Prime Minister and the Premiers of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia in October 1987. Parallel legislation was passed in all Parliaments a short time later.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The paramount feature of the new Murray-Darling Basin Agreement was the establishment of a Ministerial Council to promote effective planning and management for the equitable, efficient and sustainable use of the water, land and environmental resources of the Basin. The Agreement also created the Murray-Darling Basin Commission to assume the River Murray Commission's regulatory responsibilities and take a broader advisory responsibility to the Ministerial Council.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another important element in the Agreement was the provision for a direct line of communication between the Council and the Basin community through the establishment of the Community Advisory Committee. All participating Governments recognised the need for cooperation not only on an intergovernmental level but also with the community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With this strong institutional framework, the Murray-Darling Basin Initiative represents a genuinely comprehensive approach to natural resource management.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Innovative public administration arrangements are linked with a strategic and comprehensive suite of policies and programs. These are firmly aimed in addressing real problems and realising genuine opportunities open to governments and communities to progress their mutual interests.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addressing natural resource management issues, the Initiative depends fundamentally on mobilisation of the community. It is an outstanding demonstration of how policies and practices can be integrated to resolve the conflicts between competing demands for natural resources on the one hand and their sustainable use on the other.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Initiative has an impressive list of achievements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Salinity and Drainage Strategy, a major component of the overall Natural Resources Management Strategy, has provided an effective means of dealing with land salinisation and waterlogging in the irrigation areas of the Basin. It is a dramatic reminder of the benefits of taking a coordinated approach across State borders to address natural resources management problems.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Strategy aims to achieve a 20 per cent reduction in average salinity levels in the River Murray while providing the opportunity to protect, through drainage and disposal of wastewater, up to 500,000 hectares of land affected by water logging and salinisation. The Strategy complements other market-based measures such as more appropriate water pricing and transferable water entitlements. Since adoption of the Strategy in 1988, over $74 million has been jointly expended on government funded salt interception schemes and joint government and community based drainage and salinity management plans. Major salt interception works have been completed at Woolpunda and commenced at Mallee Cliffs and Waikerie. Drainage programs are being undertaken at Shepparton, Deniliquin and in the Murrumbidgee region.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Natural Resources Management Strategy (NRMS), now in its fourth year, has become an effective framework for individuals and governments to jointly attack environmental degradation in the Basin. The Natural Resources Management Strategy promotes and sustains activities as widespread and diverse as river management, water quality management, land and vegetation management, and conservation of native flora and fauna and the Basin's cultural heritage.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a working example of an integrated regional approach to the sustainable use of natural resources. It has elicited a joint government funding commitment to date of $55 million. The increase in Commonwealth support in this period has been equally impressive, rising from $1.9 million in 1989-90 to $7.6 million for 1992-93, a total of $22 million over the period.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">NRMS on-ground works undertaken through the community have been effective in fostering and harnessing community commitment and involvement in the Initiative. More than 200 community groups have received assistance. An ethos for sustainable resource management is taking root across the Basin. It will provide the enduring basis for sound stewardship of the Basin's irreplaceable resources.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The experience gained over the first five years of the Initiative confirms the view that an integrated and co-operative approach to Basin-wide resource and environment management can achieve significantly more than would be possible through independent action by the Commonwealth and States.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current development of new strategies for irrigation management and water quality management indicates that the Initiative's momentum is continuing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sound and responsive water resources management policies are essential to support a viable irrigation industry in the Murray-Darling Basin. Similarly a comprehensive Basin-wide nutrient management strategy is needed to address pollution of the river system. Work on this strategy has been given new impetus following the widespread algal blooms of last summer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The maturing of the Initiative has led to further refinements of its institutional framework. In 1989, the Ministerial Council commenced a review of the Murray-Darling Basin Agreement to provide for the evolving role of the Council in water, land and environmental management and to allow more efficient implementation of Council decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill before the Parliament contains a number of significant amendments which will further strengthen the Initiative. The inclusion of the Salinity and Drainage Strategy as part of the amended Agreement is foremost among these amendments. This major achievement, a cornerstone of inter-governmental cooperation, has developed to the stage where it can now appropriately be given the backing of legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">More efficient allocation of water, essential to the viability and sustainability of irrigated agriculture in the Basin, is also addressed. The amended Agreement provides for water allocation through a system of continuous water accounting. This will allow New South Wales and Victoria to draw on their annual water allocation according to need. Unused allocations will be carried forward as credits; above allocation drawings will be carried forward as a debit against future entitlements. This will facilitate the optimal use of a shared resource without disruption of fundamental access guarantees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In line with effective program administration and efficiency goals, financial provisions will be revised to allow improved budget management by the Commission. Particular changes include the ability for the Commission, with the approval of Council, to carry-over limited funds from one year to the next. This will allow the Commission to apply its financial resources more flexibly in responding to changing circumstances and needs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The development of new strategies to meet changing priorities and emphases, against a background of complex economic, environmental and social issues, requires a flexible legislative framework. Accordingly, the amended Agreement empowers the Ministerial Council to modify the Agreement through approving additional Schedules. This will enable, for example, the timely incorporation of new strategies into the Agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With successful passage of this Bill through Parliament, the first Schedule to be brought forward for approval under this process will be one authorising the accession of Queensland to the Initiative. Approximately a quarter of the Basin lies in Queensland, including the headwaters of the Darling River, the major tributary to the River Murray. Queensland's accession will permit a truly Basin-wide perspective to be brought to resource management issues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commission's day-to-day workload is increasing and issues being considered are becoming more complex. The provision for the appointment of an independent President in the Agreement will facilitate strong, ongoing Commission leadership in the development of sound advice to Council and in the implementation of Council decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is confident that the changes to the Murray-Darling Basin Agreement proposed by the Bill before the Senate will strengthen the legislative underpinning of the Initiative and facilitate its forward progress. In this way we can build on the significant achievements to date.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The manner in which the community of the Basin has embraced and adopted the objectives of the Initiative, together with the unprecedented cooperation of all levels of government, is clear evidence of a government and community partnership that can secure the future of the Basin's resources, to the benefit of both the local community and all Australians.</PARA>

<PARA>Since 1987 the government has tried on a number of occasions to bring the Senate up to date by introducing a system for the declaration of interests. The matter has had a very long history and it is now time to resolve it in this chamber, once and for all. Unhappily, in the past, the opposition has resisted the exercise at every opportunity. It has filibustered on the issue until the government has been forced, each time, to return to the business of legislation. We all got sick of the obfuscation and the delay. It will be remembered that in the last sittings we went ahead and tabled our declarations anyway. The Australian Democrats did the same and Senator Chamarette did the same. I think the clear disposition of the majority of honourable senators in this place is to do just that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is now up to the opposition to show its colours on this fundamental issue of political integrity and we hope that that will occur today. The Leader of the Opposition, Dr Hewson, declared his colours, when in a statement on 30 April last year, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have a strong personal disposition in favour of disclosure in government and I support the existing arrangements for the declaration of members interests that operate in the lower House. In short, I have strongly supported a disclosure and have established my bona fides.</PARA>
<PARA>One hopes that he will also be able to establish a little more credibly his leadership bona fides by having his will prevail on this issue and get honourable senators opposite to join in the debate on what is an issue of real integrity. It is about time the opposition showed its colours on this issue. Senator Hill has said in the past&mdash;this is about all he has said on the issue&mdash;that he wants more time to debate the matter. Well, time is available now. I hope he and others will debate it in a constructive and non-filibustering fashion so that we can see this matter resolved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, it is an issue that has a very long history. In 1974 the Whitlam government suggested that there should be public disclosure of the income and assets of parliamentarians. He set up a joint committee which included Mr Killen and Mr Nixon and which recommended unanimously to set up such a register. Mr Whitlam moved a motion to that effect on 6 November 1975 but unhappily that lapsed with the events that followed five days later. Even more unhappily, the Fraser government decided not to proceed with the exercise, notwithstanding its unanimous endorsement on a bipartisan basis before then. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Hawke government came into office in 1983, it immediately directed that all ministers, including Senate ministers, declare their interests and those of their immediate families. That practice has been in place ever since. In October 1984, the House of Representatives considered a motion requiring all honourable members to submit statements of pecuniary interests, once in a lifetime of each parliament, within 28 days of making an oath or affirmation as a member of the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A committee on members' interests was established to consider the processes involved and its report, among other things, urged the Senate to look also at the issue of the registration of interests. The House adopted its motion in September 1986 and honourable members in the other place have been tabling their returns ever since. On 17 March 1987, I proposed, by motion, a similar system of registration of interests for the Senate. That proposal, I am sad to say, met with objections from the other side and it lapsed with the calling of the July 1987 election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just to make the story complete, in November 1988 the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Members' Interests rescinded the requirement to declare a relevant interest before speaking in a debate, as it was found to be impractical and unnecessary in the context of the register existing, with those needs being met by the register. I just mention that to honourable senators as perhaps an additional attraction of the register process. The current motion before the Senate does not include the declaration requirement, as it would require alterations to be tabled every six months, as opposed to from time to time as required, which is the form of words applied in the house. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In May last year the government&mdash;Senator Button initiating the debate&mdash;put the proposal to the Senate again. I am again sad to say that the opposition used the occasion for no more than an opportunity to attack Senator Richardson, and once again the government had to allow the matter to lapse because of pressing legislative business. In May this year, just before the break, through Senator Faulkner we gave notice of this motion that we are now debating today, in order to indicate what was proposed by the government. We adjourned that debate in a substantive way until today, again because of pressure of business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In May last, we also circulated to all honourable senators a pro forma of a form for registration on a voluntary basis pending the establishment of the formal register. Again I am sad to say that no opposition member complied with that request. All government senators did, and the Australian Democrats and Senator Chamarette did as well. So it really is a matter now of considering whether pecuniary interest declarations are simply a right and proper thing for parliamentarians to do. Members of the house think so, Dr Hewson thinks so, and we on this side of the chamber certainly think so as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will speak quickly about the substantive content of the current motion. The details are before the Senate. Honourable senators have seen what it looks like when translated into the form of a document, which is the one that has been circulated to them. The current motion has been developed bearing in mind some of the concerns that have been raised in previous debates and in all the endless discussion that has gone on in this place in the past. As a result, some modifications have been made to the practice that has been adopted elsewhere. The proposal before the Senate provides, for example, for details relating to spouses and dependent children to remain confidential. It also raises the threshold for declarable gifts to $500, that being the same as the limit which is applied to gifts received by ministers. It also defines, one hopes with some useful precision, the concept of official sources and membership of organisations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe it is necessary for me to speak, at this stage of the debate anyway, in any more detail than that. As I have said from the outset, the issue has a long history. It is now time to resolve it. With the amendments to earlier proposals that are now embodied in this motion, I do not believe there is any reasoned basis for the opposition to continue either to oppose the issue or to obfuscate and delay it, which is essentially what it has been doing in the past. We hope that this debate will result finally, at last, after all these years, in a formal endorsement of a system which is fair, which is decent, which I think is regarded in the community as a whole as no less than what people expect of their elected representatives, and which is perfectly workable in practice. I believe, for all those reasons, it should command the support of this chamber. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam Deputy President, this matter has been around for a long time. There is no doubt about that, and the opposition agrees with Senator Evans to that extent. The fact is, however, that it has been around for a long time because the government has never shown any determination to bring it to a conclusion. From time to time it has been politically opportune for the government to raise this issue. It has received the appropriate publicity for doing so, and has then failed to pursue the matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To say that it has not been resolved in the last 10 years because of a filibuster of the opposition could be recorded as an incredible credit to the power of an opposition which does not have the numbers in this place. At any time in the last 10 years the government could have brought this matter to resolution if that was its purpose and it had any real determination to do so; but it did not do so on any occasion because it was not really interested in the issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year it started the run again, when the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) sought to place some pressure on the Leader of the Opposition. That got Senator Button to come in here and move his motion again&mdash;a motion which, as I said, has been moved every few years for the last decade&mdash;but the government showed no interest in pursuing it. It had achieved its political objective of the day and it had no interest in then bringing this matter to a conclusion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government does not see that this exercise as genuinely beneficial. Why does it not see it as beneficial? Because the Prime Minister himself&mdash;no less than the Prime Minister, the highest elected officer holder in this land&mdash;has demonstrated by his own pecuniary interest statement that the process this government has adopted is ineffective. The Prime Minister's interest statement does not demonstrate to the Australian people that he is a half-owner of a massive piggery business or that, as I gather is the case, it is considerably indebted to the Commonwealth Bank. It gives no indication at all of the extent of his investment. It gives no indication as to the fact that apparently he has, through a nominee, the interest of a director in that body. It gives no indication as to the liabilities of that company and a series of subsidiary companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It therefore gives no indication to the Australian people whether he may gain as a result of legislation he is dealing with, whether it be banking legislation, legislation concerning AQIS&mdash;and the importation of semen was an issue last year for piggeries&mdash;or legislation on other rural matters. It is not possible for someone to go to his pecuniary interest statement and determine with any real certainty whether the Prime Minister has a conflict of interests. If it will not work in relation to the Prime Minister, why should this government seek to impose an unworkable system on the whole of the parliament? That has been our concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We thought that over the last few months this government would have gone away and redrawn this proposal and put it into a workable form, so that there could be some assurance that pecuniary interest statements are in fact transparent and do demonstrate real interest. But the government did not do it. Why did it not do it? Because it has no interest in the outcome in terms of ensuring that detail of pecuniary interests is on the record. It is simply pursuing a political objective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Madam Deputy President, Senator Evans has got a nerve to come in here again today, after months in which this Senate has not been sitting, and with a history of lack of interest in the issue, and claim that it is as a result of our opposition that in 10 years this government has not put a pecuniary interests objective into effect in this place. Over the last few months coalition senators have again looked at this matter carefully and seriously, and they still find this proposal objectionable on a number of grounds. The main one is, as I have just said, that it demonstrably does not work. We do not dispute the worthiness of the motive behind establishing a register of interests, which presumably is to increase the confidence of the public in the integrity of its elected representatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The parliament cannot prescribe propriety and that is what Senator Evans does not seem to understand. This form of register, even if it were considerably strengthened, would not have the effect of avoiding dishonesty. However, an interesting aspect is that this parliament, generally speaking, can hold its head high in relation to propriety. In the main, the evidence is before us that parliamentarians in this and the other chamber have maintained high standards through the history of this parliament. It is interesting that the government has not come into this place alleging the contrary and therefore saying there is a need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, it does not say that there is a need as a result of misbehaviour by parliamentarians and, secondly, it does not put to us a form that could in any way overcome dishonesty if that were to occur. Even if that was its objective, which it does not seem to be and it certainly has not been advanced in those terms by Senator Evans, it does not bring us a form that would be effective in any event. If we go back to the report known as the Riordan report of 1975 of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Pecuniary Interests of Members of Parliament, we find that it advocated the establishment of a register but it also noted that a register would not be effective in exposing fraud by members of parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1978, the Fraser government formed a committee of inquiry concerning public duty and private interests which was chaired by Sir Nigel Bowen. That committee reported the following year and the report expressed grave doubts about whether it would be possible to devise a register so as to eliminate lawful avoidance. The committee considered in detail the arguments for and against compulsory registration of interests and concluded that a register ought not to be introduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This decision was influenced by two major considerations. Firstly, however tightly the specifications for a register might be drawn, it would be impossible to list all private interests which would give rise to conflict situations. Secondly, the committee considered that the longer term consequences for office holders' privacy were undesirable. Public registration of interest denies each senator his or her right to privacy. To a great extent, parliamentarians' lives are already open to public scrutiny and, as was noted in the Bowen report, to require the registration of interests is to take the first step down a slippery slope that is likely to lead to a much wider system of disclosure and unjustified invasion of privacy than its first proponents contemplated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite that report, despite the advice of that committee, in 1983 Mr Hawke saw it as politically opportune to urge that a system of public registration of members and senators be introduced. The House of Representatives passed a resolution requiring the registration of members' and ministers' interests. The coalition accepted that ministers' interests ought to be registered. They ought to be because ministers are making executive decisions day by day that concern taxpayers' funds, but the coalition opposed the application of the requirement to ordinary members of parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me briefly look at the features of the present proposal that the government puts before us. Firstly, within 14 days of the passage of the resolution each senator must provide to the registrar of senators' interests a statement of their registrable interests and those of their spouses and dependent children. So we are not simply talking about the privacy of members of parliament, we are talking about the privacy of their families. Secondly, any senator who fails to comply or knowingly provides false or misleading information `shall be guilty of a serious contempt of the Senate'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The statements of spouses and children are to be held in separate parts of the register and are to remain confidential to the committee of senators' interests. The committee may table a declaration where it considers a conflict of interest arises. Of course, the committee will just be a microcosm of the Senate. Registrable interests will include shareholdings in public and private companies; family and business trusts; real estate; directorships; partnerships; liabilities, bonds and debentures; savings and investment accounts; and any other assets valued at over $5,000. The nature of other substantial sources of income, whatever that might mean, is to be listed, as are gifts from official sources valued at more than $500 and gifts valued at more than $100 from other sources. Also included within the statement will be sponsored travel or hospitality received&mdash;that presumably means lunch&mdash;and any other interests where a conflict of interest could foreseeably arise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The President of the Senate is to appoint an officer of the Senate as a registrar of senators' interests. That person will also be the secretary of the committee of senators' interests. The chairman of the committee is to table in the Senate a copy of the completed register after the commencement of each parliament. Pursuant to a separate notice of motion, which will be a later debate this day, a committee of senators' interests is to be established at the commencement of each parliament. It will consist of three government senators, two opposition senators and an Australian Democrat or an Independent senator. The minority party in this place&mdash;the Australian Labor Party&mdash;still believes that it is entitled to have the largest membership of a committee such as this. It is to be set up as a parliamentary committee; it is not something within the province of government. The committee's duties will be to inquire into and report upon the arrangements for the register; to consider proposals about the form and the content of the register; and to consider submissions made in relation to the registering or declaring of interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me expand upon our reservations, some of which I mentioned a little while ago. First, although this issue has been around a long time, there has been a lack of debate within this place. It really is incredible that this is one of the few occasions, over 10 years, when the government has programmed this matter for serious and full debate in this chamber. Was there consultation with the major parties and the minority parties in this place in relation to the form of the motion? What we saw from Senator Evans in the last parliamentary sittings was really a gimmick. Even though the motions contained obligations upon the Senate to set up this structure, Senator Evans tabled a form that he, or the government, presumably, thought was desirable. He sought to make political capital out of calling upon all senators to comply with his requirements, not a requirement of the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He could have, if he had chosen to do so, had the matter debated during the last sittings of the parliament. Almost the whole of the first two weeks of that sitting was taken up with matters of procedure initiated by the government. This was not high on the governments order of priority. Yet Senator Evans comes in here today and says that it is a matter of high priority. That has not been demonstrated by the way the government has pursued this matter in the past. The government has not demonstrated good faith. It has been an exercise in political gimmickry, as Senator Evans demonstrated in the last sitting of this parliament. He is once again seeking to treat it as an opportunity for political point scoring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After hearing Senator Evans talking yesterday about this Senate not giving sufficient time for consideration of the government's legislative program, I find it astonishing that today the government has decided that point scoring on this issue should take priority over that program. No doubt, at the end of this sitting, the government will come in to us and say the guillotine should be applied because there is insufficient time for this chamber to consider its program. This is another demonstration of the distorted priorities of Senator Evans and his government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many other concerns that we have in relation to the form. We are amazed that, for some reason that is not explained by the minister&mdash;but subsequent speakers on the other side might fill the gap&mdash;the government has removed from this draft the provision for ad hoc declarations which it had included in previous proposals. Notwithstanding the lodgment by a senator of a statement of registrable interests, in previous drafts a senator was to be obliged to declare any relevant interest at the beginning of a speech in the Senate chamber and after a division is called, if they propose to vote in that division. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That has been a principle that we have adhered to on this side of the chamber. We have always accepted that if a senator, who has a conflict of interest, is going to participate in speaking or in voting, then the interest that could be in conflict should be made clear so that the public and the parliament can understand the position of that senator. Why has the government taken out that obligation, that it was going to put in previous proposals, in the draft that is before us today?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are of a view that if this is to proceed, and the numbers in this chamber seem to indicate that it is, such an obligation should be reinserted, and we have an amendment to that effect. The British Select Committee on Members Interests 1992 report went so far as to observe that `there is a danger that the existence of a register may tempt members into being casual in their observance of the declaration rule'. Then let us put us back in. Let us try to find out from the government what it is seeking to hide. Why did it want that traditional obligation to be removed from its documentation?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this is to be applied to members of this parliament, we wonder why it is not also to be applied to those who report upon the business of this parliament. One might say they actually have greater influence in many ways than those who participate within the process. The question of the application of disclosure provisions to classes of persons other than parliamentarians has, of course, been raised in the past. I remind honourable senators that the Riordan report in 1975 recommended that the parliament should require those accredited media organisations that enjoy the facilities of Parliament House to comply with the same registration requirements that are required of members of parliament. There are precedents for this and we will be moving amendments later in this debate to extend the application of these disclosure provisions to accredited members of the Canberra press gallery. They will no doubt applaud those amendments because of the high standards that they would like to see of us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have concern in relation to the definition of spouse. This is the first proposal in which the government has retreated from the position of requiring full public registration of the interests of spouses and wholly or mainly dependent children. The privacy of members' families is one of the areas of our greatest concern. There is a little more protection in relation to what is put before us, but it is, nevertheless, an invasion of the privacy of spouses and of children. However, if one is to talk of families why is it limited to spouses?  Why does it not include de factos? Presumably, it was just a slip. Therefore, we propose to move an amendment to specifically include de facto spouses. I take it that the government will support that amendment when we get to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are concerned about many aspects of the penalties for non-compliance. Paragraph 1, subparagraph (2) of the motion provides that a senator who knowingly fails to provide a statement of registrable interests, or who fails to notify an alteration, or who knowingly provides false or misleading information shall be guilty of a serious contempt of the Senate and shall be dealt with by the Senate accordingly. Does that bring in the provisions of the Parliamentary Privileges Act or not?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, the parliament has the power to identify and punish contempts of the Senate, but it is section 4 of the Parliamentary Privileges Act which identifies what is punishable by the courts. The essential element is conduct amounting to improper interference with the functioning of the Senate. It is arguable whether providing false information or failing to provide information would amount to contempt for the purposes of section 4. We believe that it needs to be clarified. We would have thought that even the Australian Democrats would be interested in the issue of penalties because they had previous amendments that specifically raised those issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are concerned as to the confusion between the supervisory role of the new committee that is to be set up and the investigatory role. In fact, it is not clear who should conduct the investigations into alleged breaches&mdash;in other words, where senators knowingly misled. We think it is wrong if the ambiguity is to be interpreted in a way such that this new committee should have the responsibility. We think there should be separate bodies because there are separate responsibilities of supervising the structure and carrying out the investigations. If we are to go down this path, and we think there are strong arguments against it, we think it would be better if the Privileges Committee were to conduct the investigations. It is a committee held in high regard and it has longstanding experience. We therefore propose to move an amendment to clarify the situation so that such investigations as are needed to be carried out would be carried out by that committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said some time ago that we have a serious concern that it will not work. It does not provide to the parliament the sort of information that is necessary and which the government would have required it to provide if it were serious. I will mention just a few examples again. A senator has to give information of his or her shareholdings but that does not tell people whether the senator is a major shareholder. It does not tell people whether those shareholdings are of great value or whether they are insignificant. It does not tell whether they are scrip left over from the 1969-70 mining boom which someone might have in the bottom drawer. They will have to haul out that scrip and see whether those companies are still in existence. The scrip may be worthless, but under this obligation they have to disclose that worthless shareholding, whereas a colleague, perhaps on the Labor side, who has literally millions of dollars of shares could simply list a company or companies and give the parliament no idea as to the influence through his shareholding that he can bring to bear in a particular company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With liabilities also, there is nothing that tells the reader of this statement&mdash;the public&mdash;whether someone is seriously in debt or in debt to a minimal extent. It is ineffective in that regard. There is nothing that gets behind discretionary trusts. There is nothing that gets behind holding companies. In other words, if the government were serious about this proposal, why did it not bring to the parliament a form that would ensure full disclosure of all relevant financial information that could potentially put a senator or member in a position of conflict? The answer to that, of course, is: because the government is not genuinely serious to that extent. What it is seeking to do is to gain political points out of putting a form proposal before the parliament and demanding that it carried. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope the Greens and the Australian Democrats are seriously considering these major deficiencies that are in this document today. I hope they will not in their later speeches say `We all support these proposals with major deficiencies', because then presumably they would be failing in their responsibility. It would demonstrate that they have simply been got at by the government and have been drawn into this rather sloppy public relations exercise&mdash;political gimmickry, as I described it earlier&mdash;that is being engaged in by the government and by Senator Evans in particular. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I could go on if I had time and take the Senate through each of the separate registrable instruments in the document before us and demonstrate how they do not give us any real information at all. Others will do that. Let me just round it out by bringing honourable senators back to the examples that we have before us, not just those that are hypothetical when we look at the document and start to imagine its shortcomings, but the specific examples that have demonstrated that what we have had before the House of Representatives and what we have had before the ministry in the past has not worked. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Evans mentioned the example of Senator Richardson and his failure in 1992 to disclose his directorship of radio station 2HD while Minister for Transport and Communications. What was the response to that? Senator Richardson said that he was not aware that he had to disclose it. He apologised to the Prime Minister, and that was the end of the matter. What is being expected of honourable senators in the same circumstance? They are going to commit by the same act a serious contempt of the Senate. It did not work in relation to Senator Richardson. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Howe, when Minister for Defence Support, failed to disclose that his wife was a member of the Victorian Town Planning Appeals Tribunal and had an income&mdash;and he is now Deputy Prime Minister of the country. Senator Button indicated that he was a director of a company. From memory, I do not think he had a beneficial interest&mdash;I think it was a trust&mdash;but he was director. He did not indicate that that company had substantial interests in BHP, and that was at a time when the major public issue of the day was the possible takeover of BHP. So it did not provide information to the public to gauge whether Senator Button had a real conflict of interest and how he was responding in those circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most notorious, of course, is the one that we will hear much more of today, that of the Prime Minister that I mentioned earlier, whose own declaration of interests really gave the public no helpful information at all as to the extent of his assets and liabilities in relation to his major piggery. If it does not work in relation to the Prime Minister, why should he be seeking to impose it on the rest of the parliament?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, for the reasons I have discussed, coalition senators do not support the motion moved today for a register of senators' interests in the form that it is before us. But, because it is likely to pass in any event, we will be moving a series of amendments. I have mentioned some of them during my speech: for instance, the amendment to make it clear that the committee of senators' interests is not going to be responsible for the investigation, and many other amendments that I will try to find an opportunity to expand upon a little later. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 4 May and, I think, 19 May last year, when this was first discussed, the Democrats and the opposition had a lot of problems with it. In response to that the Democrats went away and looked at all those problems. We think we came up with reasonable answers to most of them. I put those in letters to Senator McMullan and to Senator Hill and sent them off, requesting that they get back to me with what they thought about them. The government did get back to me and has changed the register of senators' interests to accommodate almost all of those. I will just go through the changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first and probably the most important change the government put in to accommodate the Democrats' main problems was that the spouses' and independent children's interests would be confidential to the committee of senators' interests, except where a conflict of interest arises. It did seem, and it still seems to us, that it is unfair to spouses to have their interests published to the general public. They did not get into politics. Heaven knows, they support those of us who are in politics, but it should not be that they have to have published to the world in general what their interests are. Now their interests will not be published unless a conflict of interest arises and unless the committee of senators' interests sees that and sees that it is in the best interests of the parliament and of good government to publish them. That is excellent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We asked that the value of declarable gifts be increased from $250 to $500 for official gifts, because that is the standard amount which is used by the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet for official gifts which have to be declared. That is why the first $250 was in there. Seeing that it has gone up to $500 for ministers and for official gifts from overseas, we thought it should go up to $500 within the Commonwealth as well. We asked the government to spell out official sources and it has done that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another one which we thought was quite interesting was the declaration of membership of organisations. We have asked for the declaration of membership of organisations to be limited to those organisations in which a senator is an office holder or to which he or she contributes over $100 in any single calendar year. The reason we did that was that one of the Democrat senators discovered, in reading the small print of her <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">National Geographic</EMPHASIS> magazine, that she was a member of National Geographic because she subscribed to the magazine.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Boswell is correct that it does prove the stupidity of the first proposal. A person would not have been aware of being a member, not being told that membership was involved in subscribing to some organisations. Obviously, a person who has a distinct interest in an organisation is either going to be an office holder or is going to donate a substantial amount of money every year. We believe that over $100 is a substantial amount of money to donate to any cause.

At the moment, the penalty which is paid by people who breach the privilege of the Senate is $5000 or imprisonment for six months, and as a maximum penalty I think that is fair enough. That is what we have got in the Privileges Act, and I do not see why it should not be a penalty for this as well. Members of the government baulked at that when we said it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, the motion before the chamber is one proposed by the government to provide for members of this chamber declaring their pecuniary interests and having them available on the public record so that citizens in this country can check to see the vested interests of members of this chamber. They can then consider those vested interests when members speak and vote on matters of policy and on bills and legislation in this place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a fundamental rightness about this proposal. The fundamental rightness is recognised by the Labor Party, and has been so recognised consistently over a long period of time. It is, for us, a fundamental principle. It is a principle that is espoused not only by us; it is widely held by all commentators on democracy. Democracy does consist of the right of individuals to vote; and democracy consists of the right of individuals, when casting their vote, to know the policies and the personalities for whom they are voting. We would argue that democracy consists, as well, of those electors voting knowing not only the policies and the personalities, but also the private vested interests of those personalities, which may or may not have an influence over how they conduct their affairs in the parliament. Democracy consists of many things, and there will be a lot of debate about what it consists of in its entirety. But certainly it consists of those things; and of those things there can be no debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is because of that recognition, quietly held in the back of the mind of the opposition even, that the opposition has never had the courage to come out and directly oppose this motion. The opposition has never said, `We are absolutely opposed to pecuniary interests being revealed'. What the opposition has done has been more sneaky than that. The opposition has said, `We support pecuniary interests. But not at this time. But not in this form. But in some other appropriate way. And, because of the `buts', we shall not proceed with doing it now'. In that way, the opposition got around the principle by pretending to uphold it but, in reality, defeating it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have now arrived at a point in time at which the opposition can run, but the opposition cannot hide anymore. The opposition has to face the fact that this chamber at last appears to have acquired a majority in favour of giving some material force to the third principle of democracy that I have espoused, the right of the electorate to know the pecuniary interests of members of parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Acting Deputy President, a principle that the Labor Party has long held and espoused and presented to this chamber may now at last be enacted by this chamber. Doing so will, of course, bring us into line with the House of Representatives, whose members are required, because of a government majority, to declare their pecuniary interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will bring the practice in this chamber also into line with the practice of the Labor ministry. As a minister in this government, I declare for the public record my pecuniary interests, and my pecuniary interests and those of all other ministers in this government are available for any person to see. We do it as a matter of principle; we do it because we uphold our own principles. Despite the reticence of the opposition to oblige and to bring this matter out of the shadows into the light, we will stand by and enact our own principles. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that there is passion in members of the opposition in that they do not want to be pinned down on the fact that they have avoided implementing a practice of revealing their pecuniary interests. There is a field of argument open to me now to explore under the heading, `Why would they do that? What is the motivation for it and do they have something to hide?'. I do not propose to develop that argument, but I want to note for the record that that is a field of argument. When someone so passionately objects, one is led logically to ask: why do they so passionately feel about it and is there something to hide here?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In any case, from the Labor side, we do not want to hide anything; and that is why we have followed this practice in the House of Representatives and in the government and why we seek to obtain an observance of the practice in this chamber. </PARA>

I have to say that mine is a pretty damn boring form because I do not happen to be a shareholder in any company and my form is that of an ordinary wage or salary earner of this country. The most enlivening thing about it would be that it would declare the extent of my mortgage. I may not be the only one in that category. Certainly a number of my colleagues are.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, were this resolution to be adopted, a number of my other colleagues and, I expect, a number of the opposition would have to declare what shareholdings they have and with whom they have them. That should be publicly known so that, if matters occur in debate in this chamber in which the interests of those particular companies are advantaged, then we will know what are the pecuniary interests of the people participating in that debate. It is the electorate's fundamental right to know that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that I am not a shareholder is probably a reflection on me. The fact that my pecuniary interests declaration is boring because it just reveals my mortgage and my bank account is probably a reflection on me. But I am not a typical case in all of those circumstances. I draw the opposition's attention to one of the things that my form does declare, which they have been happy to use politically against me in debate and in trying to besmirch my name in the community. On the form I also declare the associations and organisations of which I am a member. One of those organisations is the Building Workers Industrial Union of Australia. In the last term of government I was industrial relations minister, and several members of the opposition accused me of conducting my affairs of office as a minister of the Crown in a partisan way because I was a member of a trade union. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable senators will remember the debate in this chamber. I have never shrunk from that allegation. I declared it on the public record. I am proud of that membership. The point is that, because I was honest enough to tell honourable senators, they could draw the attention of the rest of the community to that fact and they could judge me and my performance accordingly&mdash;and they should have been able to do so. All I am saying in this debate is that, where honourable senators on the other side have an interest by shareholding in or by association with any organisations, the test they applied to me should equally be able to be applied to them. That is a fundamental principle, I believe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point I want to make is, because the Prime Minister also declares his interests, members on the other side are aware that the Prime Minister has an interest in a piggery. There are very few electors in this country who do not know that and they know it because of the declared interests that we put down on the forms. They know it for that reason. They were then able to pursue a line of inquiry to see whether the Prime Minister had conducted himself correctly or misconducted himself. It was a line of inquiry that exonerated the Prime Minister absolutely, but while the inquiry was being conducted by the opposition it enabled innuendo and besmirchment of his reputation to take place. That is the political cut and thrust. All we say is the standards we observe in the declaration of those interests ought to be standards the opposition observes so that where similar circumstances apply appropriate probing of motive and reason can be conducted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I heard here a moment ago a contribution to this debate made by the leader of the opposition, Senator Robert Hill. He made several points. I do not propose to canvass all of them but this is one of the points he made that is worthy of mention. He argued it is not appropriate for this Senate to adopt this resolution on pecuniary interests and have the pecuniary interests of all members of this Senate put on a public register for inspection by the public because the media, who may have a more influential role in shaping public perceptions and opinions, do not declare their pecuniary interests. So the argument went. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As my colleague Senator Barney Cooney would know, being a learned lawyer and familiar with the classics, what Senator Hill has uttered is a classic fallacy. The fallacy is we cannot do it because someone else is not doing it. The logic is that we are the elected representatives of the people of this country; we make the laws in this chamber and the people of this country are entitled to know what our pecuniary interests are when we make those laws. The fact that there may also arguably be an equal case for the gallery and for journalists does not absolve us from our principal responsibility of declaring our interests. To say, `We won't declare ours because they are not declaring theirs', is not an argument; it is a fallacy to put it that way and it is a recognised classical fallacy to do it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may well be there is a case for journalists to declare their interests and it may well be that that is a matter for consideration for this chamber, but it is not a reason for objecting to and obstructing the passage of this motion at all.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will come back to this first point by Senator Hill. It may well be that there is a case for the media that report parliament to declare their vested interests too, but we are the ones that stand for election, we are the ones who make the laws and we are the ones who are under public scrutiny. It is not reasonable to say, `Because the press do not declare theirs, we shall not declare ours'. We should declare ours and insist on a proper standard of public conduct by making an example of ourselves and standing by the principle ourselves, extending a proper example of public conduct to others as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point I heard Senator Hill raise was that in the manner in which this resolution is cast it is an invasion of privacy of spouses and children, and why not include de factos. I am not an expert on family law but my understanding as a rough layman is that in the way in which family law is often practised these days de factos or partners, as they are sometimes called, are regarded in terms of marriage breakup and property settlement as about equal to legal spouses. It may well be that an interpretation of wives or spouses or husbands includes those in a de facto relationship, but it is a minor point. It is a point that we should deal with. I do not shrink from it, but it is not a substantial point to prevent the passage of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me now go to the principal point that it is an invasion of privacy to ask the spouses and children of members in this place to lodge, privately, with a group of senators who have the responsibility for maintaining this record, their pecuniary interests. The way in which this motion is being passed protects that privacy. I think there should be a record&mdash;it is absolutely fundamental to a declaration of pecuniary interests that there be a record&mdash;of the pecuniary interests of spouses and children of members in this place. It is well known that people can escape taxation or scrutiny, and that they can evade obligations and rights by putting it in the wife's name, or in the husband's name, as the case may be, or in the kid's name and pretending that they therefore do not have any obligation. That is a well-known practice. I do not have to elaborate on that; we all recognise that it occurs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be false to pretend that pecuniary interests have been properly declared, if the real interests were not available in some way. Therefore, putting it in the wife's name, or in the husband's name, or listing the interests transferred by the principal to the children, should occur in some form, but their privacy should be protected; and this motion does protect that. There is a record so that in case there is a conflict we are aware of it. I think that is an appropriate way to do it. I do not accept the argument that privacy is a defence against a declaration of what the real and proper interests are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third argument that I heard Senator Hill put was that it requires the details of shareholdings and, yes, it does. He then went on to say that some of these shares may be worthless and that some of them may have been devalued over time or have no meaning. I could equally say that some of these shares may be very worthwhile, have real meaning, not be devalued and be very important in assessing whether or not members have been motivated by financial gain rather than proper conduct as members of this place. Whether they are worthless will be obvious once they are declared and once they are seen or known to be worthless. The extra clerical work required by an individual to get out those records, and put them down on the register, is a small price to pay for having some record of the full shareholding, which is the principal point. To once again raise a minor obstruction to try to delay, prevent or obfuscate the principal issue is not an argument. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fourthly, Senator Hill went on to name four people, all of whom were ministers&mdash;in one case, a Prime Minister&mdash;saying that we had learnt of their shareholdings or pecuniary interests. He named Senator Richardson, Mr Howe, former Senator John Button and the Prime Minister, Mr Keating. In the case of Senator Richardson, he said that he omitted to declare a shareholding. He did, and he admitted that he had omitted to do so. I cannot see that, if someone neglects or omits to properly report on the register, that is a reason not to have a register. It is a reason to deal with what happens in the case of improperly reporting, or neglecting to report, for the register: it is not a substantial argument about the register itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of Mr Howe, he said that, when Mr Howe was Minister for Defence Support, he declined or neglected or omitted to declare that his wife was sitting on a town planning board. Obviously, the connection here is that the defence industry acquires property compulsorily, and the implication sought to be drawn here is that there may in some way be a connection between that ministerial activity and the responsibilities of the spouse in this particular case. No suggestion of any impropriety has ever been raised on this, I might say, and, looking at this case, I am absolutely certain that no impropriety in any way occurred. The offence is that the interest of the wife, in terms of this town planning position, was not declared. Under our system, one presumes that interest would in some way be declared, but protected in the privacy way which I referred to earlier. Again, a neglect or overlooking or evasion of the obligation is not a reason to not have a register. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then, in the case of former Senator Button, it was said that it was believed that he was a non-beneficiary to a trust and that that trust had an interest in BHP at a time when BHP was being taken over. I thought the salient point in that sentence was that former Senator Button was a non-beneficiary. But, of course, one could go further and say, `While he may not gain, the trust could gain by his activities'. </PARA>

Whatever else is being said about it by members of the opposition, they have never directly opposed it; they have always found a reason to delay it or not apply it now, or a defect in it which would prevent it going forward. But if one goes back to first principles, there is a first principle in a democracy that the electors and the citizens of a country are entitled to know what the pecuniary or vested interests of their members of parliament are. What the approach of the opposition over the years has served to do is prevent them knowing that as far as this Senate is concerned because of obstruction or objections raised on matters of detail and not relating to the point.

None of those arguments are sufficient to defeat the point. The point should carry, and it should carry in this chamber unanimously. I would be disappointed if it did not, because it would then provide the people outside who harbour cynicism about the motivation of politicians, about whether this should properly be called the coward's castle or about whether or not we hide behind privilege, fuel and ammunition for those cynics to again make those allegations.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to stress that the coalition is in favour of proper revelation of interests at proper times; and those proper times are when matters are before this Senate. There is an obligation on us all to reveal what conflicts of interest we have when the potential for those conflicts emerges. What concerns me about this matter is that ministers and members of the House of Representatives have wrongly considered their misleading and deceptive statements to be proper declarations of interest, so removing the need to make proper declarations in the parliament at the time matters are being discussed in which they may have a potential for conflict of interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to stress that, because it is being falsely held out that we have something to hide and that we wish not to reveal relevant matters relating to our interests.

In the Prime Minister's language, `interests in' appears to mean the same thing as total ownership. In a so-called declaration of interests, can there be a more deceptive statement than to say this company has `interests in', as if it is just one of the many organisations that have interests in it&mdash;that there are other people with interests in the piggery&mdash;when, in fact, that company held all the controlling shares in that piggery group. That is `ownership' and not `interests in'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They tried to skirt around this by saying, `Oh, but there were some redeemable preference shares still held by Mr Brown&mdash;some redeemable preference shares carrying no voting powers&mdash;which were redeemed'. The fact is, in terms of beneficial ownership, the Prime Minister owed half a company which had beneficial ownership of the piggery group, not just interests in it. That gives a clear indication how, under the present rules, one can be deceptive. Under the present rules one can be deceptive and get away with it and, in fact, be defended in this place by ministers, and by some sycophantic members of the media who said the Prime Minister met all the reporting requirements. That is simply untrue. The Prime Minister's letter is deceptive and misleading but, according to the government, is acceptable under the rules. Now that says something about the Prime Minister, but it also says something about the Labor Party's view of the rules. That is the essence of the matter before us now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know that Euphron's `interests in a piggery' was really total ownership, so leaving the Keating family ownership of half of the group&mdash;because he owned half of Euphron&mdash;with control of the piggery and refrigeration group being shared between Mr Keating, along with his family company, and Mr A. Constantinidis and his family company and with Mr Keating having his nominee, Mr C. Coudounaris, on the board of Euphron Pty Ltd, the group's holding company. It is simply dishonest to describe Euphron's 100 per cent ownership as having interests in a piggery and refrigeration business, and is clearly aimed at understating the significance of the Keating investment. Yet the Labor Party considers that meets the requirements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So this was not just an arms-length investment by an ordinary citizen in a corporation which carries no influence, as Mr Keating's declaration seems to set out to indicate. It is his half-ownership carrying a hidden but, nevertheless, considerable potential for conflict of interest. I am not saying there is a conflict; I am saying there is a potential for conflict. It is that potential that should be revealed to this parliament if these declarations of interests are to mean anything whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But far more is hidden in this grossly inadequate and misleading declaration of interest by the Prime Minister despite his claims, along with claims by former Senator Button and other apologists for the Prime Minister, that he has fully met all the reporting requirements. As I said earlier, such claims effectively damn the requirements as ludicrous, for they have been met despite the fact that the Prime Minister's declarations failed to reveal that, firstly, the piggery companies Mr Keating acquired while Treasurer&mdash;note that the Treasurer is the minister responsible for the Commonwealth Bank&mdash;were heavily indebted to the Commonwealth Bank. That indebtedness had originally arisen during his period as Treasurer while his former colleague Mr J.J. Brown was a director and half-owner and resulted, ultimately, in the Commonwealth Bank making a provision&mdash;according to documents I revealed to the Senate some time ago&mdash;for a loss of $4.5 million against borrowings that totalled $17.9 million by the group on 6 August 1992, when Mr Keating was Prime Minister. Those borrowings from the bank of $17.9 million were, of course, on top of a $2 million loan by, I think, the Commonwealth Development Bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This appears to provide a clear potential for conflict of interest. Surely, if the job of these declarations is to reveal potential for conflict of interest, to be meaningful, this potential should have been revealed to the parliament. But according to these rules, as interpreted by the Labor Party, one did not have to do it. That just demonstrates how nonsensical the rules are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another matter that he did not reveal was that Mr Keating's half-owned piggery group owes $4.5 million to Mr John Brown, who is, among other things, a lobbyist seeking benefits from the government on behalf of various interest groups, particularly in tourism. I might say, in parenthesis, that he seems to have been quite successful in the latest budget in getting a tax benefit for some of the tourism associations with which he is closely associated. I am not criticising the benefit one way or another. I am just saying, as a fact, that he is an effective lobbyist of government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Keating's half-owned piggery group owes Mr John Brown $4.5 million, according to the group's belatedly filed annual returns, providing a clear potential for conflict of interest. The fact that the Prime Minister is a half-owner of a company that owes a lobbyist $4.5 million was hidden from us. That information became available only because of my continued pressure, the searching of documents at the Australian Securities Commission and the requirement by the Australian Securities Commission to get this group of companies to file proper, full and adequate returns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The matter of the indebtedness to the Commonwealth Bank is quite fascinating. I notice that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> recently reported that, less than a year after the Commonwealth Bank provided for a $4.5 million loss against the $17.86 million loan to the porky venture, the company is proposing a $44 million expansion. The Brown and Hatton Parkville piggery has lodged plans for an extensive revamp, including a high-tech pork processing plant costing $44 million. I suppose this question emerges: will this widen the Prime Minister's company's indebtedness? Will the Prime Minister&mdash;in other words, the one removed, behind the corporate veil&mdash;be involved in half-ownership of an even greater debt?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Maybe it is the Danpork side of it that is doing the development. One does not know because, under these guidelines, one knows nothing of the real indebtedness or the real beneficial assets of this Prime Minister in areas where there is a clear potential for conflict of interest. In dealing with a multinational group, there is dealing with foreign officials and foreign companies, in a deal affecting the Prime Minister's beneficial interests, his wealth and his indebtedness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another thing he did not reveal was the extent, if any, to which the Commonwealth Bank of Australia had required guarantees of Mr Keating or his family company against the bank's loans to the piggery group. It did this with the former owners. We can see that from the documents I have searched. It was done with Mr Keating's equal-ownership partner, Mr Constantinidis. The interesting thing is that, if Mr Keating is excluded from such guarantees, the Commonwealth Bank appears to be giving him a preferential position as against former owners and directors, particularly in a situation where the debt appears to be at some risk. Surely this merits close examination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may be that the bank has treated Mr Keating with an even hand and that, as a half owner of Euphron, he has been required to make personal guarantees as all the others were required to do. If this is so, it does not appear in his declaration of interests. Is this because the declaration of interests does not require him to state that kind of guarantee? If so, the declarations of interests are an even greater farce and hide even greater potential for conflicts of interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These failures to report such relevant information by hiding behind the corporate veil&mdash;which, by the way, was lifted a little only as a result of my diligence, not as a result of any information provided here&mdash;are despite the fact that Mr Keating is required by the rules to reveal `where a conflict of interest with a member's public duty could foreseeably arise or be seen to arise'. I quote from the requirements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Declaration requirements appear to mean very little to some members of the Labor Party. This seems to apply particularly to the Prime Minister, because his other failures to meet declaration requirements include his failure, while still Treasurer, to abide by the rules clearly set out in the cabinet handbook that ministers are required to notify the Prime Minister of any substantial alteration to their private interests `as soon as they occur . . . including monetary values of interest'. This is immediate, by the way, rather than within the 28 days requirement for the register of members' interests in the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Hawke has confirmed that Mr Keating never notified him as required by the cabinet rules, even though the acquisition was made on 15 May 1991 and Mr Keating remained Treasurer&mdash;and the minister responsible for the Commonwealth Bank, the FIRB and other relevant government bodies&mdash;until 3 June 1991, almost three weeks later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This potential for conflict of interest remained totally hidden from Prime Minister Hawke while Mr Keating continued as his Deputy Prime Minister and Treasurer, despite the additional requirement in the cabinet rules that any matter `which may give rise to a conflict between duty and interest must also be declared'. Yet Mr Keating was aware at that time of his piggery group's negotiations which were preceding with Danpork, which ultimately might&mdash;and did&mdash;require governmental approvals and which would have been to his ultimate benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another failure to meet declaration requirements was Mr Keating's continuing failure to abide by the cabinet rules against directorships in public companies or in private companies, except where `the retention of a directorship is not likely to conflict with the public duty of the minister'. But the Keating family investment company, Pleuron Pty Ltd, is, in reality, an ultimate half owner of a partner in a multimillion dollar, multinational joint venture, with Pleuron's company secretary&mdash;that is, his family company secretary, who has no beneficial interest in that company whatsoever&mdash;clearly acting as Mr Keating's nominee on the board of the group holding company Euphron Pty Ltd along with a joint venture company, Danpork Australia Pty Ltd.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister's declarations of interests have told the parliament a lot less about his piggery group interests than should be provided by simply pressing keys on a computer terminal linked to the Australian Securities Commission. I say `should' because it depends on the relevant companies filing accurate and timely returns for the Australian Securities Commission for that proposition to be sustainable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This group's notorious failure to do so, with false returns having to be substantially corrected under instructions from the Australian Securities Commission&mdash;at my prompting&mdash;after being filed unlawfully late, had added to the improper level of secrecy and deception surrounding the Prime Minister's half ownership of this piggery group. The false return understating his investment of $430,000 at only $43,000, which was corrected only on my prompting&mdash;they did not initiate any corrections at that time&mdash;compounded the deceptive attempt to minimise the significance of the Prime Minister's piggery involvement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The failure to report properly meant that we and the rest of the people of Australia were not aware that five of the seven group operating companies had a deficit on shareholders' funds. An auditor's qualification emerged only because I pressed the ASC to impose the requirements of the law on this group and have an auditor's examination, which the group had not provided when it filed unlawful returns and false returns. This auditor's qualification notes that these five of the seven group companies could continue in business only with the support of the Commonwealth Bank, because their shareholders' funds were negative. Their liabilities exceeded their assets. They could only continue with the support of the Commonwealth Bank. Which bank? The bank owned by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Anyone wanting to know what directorships any honourable senator owns in public or private companies in Australia has access to this publicly available information through the Australian Securities Commission. One does not have to get a declaration of interests. One would not see it in the government declaration, anyway. All one has to do if the person sought is a director is to press a button, asking what directorships, private and public, this person has. It is quite good fun to press up names like `J.J. Brown'. One gets information under the name `Paul Keating' by pressing a button. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Anyone wanting to know what directorships any honourable senator has in public or private companies simply has to press a button, provided the companies are more honest and diligent in their reporting than the Keating piggery group has been. The same goes for registered mortgages through state authorities. So there is key vital information that is readily available, more readily available by pressing a button on a computer than it is from reading the phoney declarations of interests from the people opposite. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What other meaningful information should be revealed? There is a case for registering gifts in cash or kind to parliamentarians, particularly ministers, over a certain level. I agree totally with that. But the present requirements, which the Senate is now being asked to embrace, apparently do not cover expensive renovation work done on homes of at least two of the government's most senior figures at apparently no or little cost to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that the present requirements have been shown by the actions of the Prime Minister himself to be a farce. By hiding behind such declarations, members of this government have, effectively, reduced the level of relevant disclosure that would otherwise be required under the system presently applying in the Senate, where honourable senators have an obligation fully to declare their relevant interests in matters coming before the Senate for determination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The irony is that the wife of Mr John Brown, former Labor minister and former half owner of the piggery group, refused&mdash;I believed quite properly&mdash;to reveal her financial interests in Mr Brown's declaration of interests. Mr Brown was entitled to say that he did not know what her interests were, although many of them were held jointly with him. They were joint directors of the piggery group. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is just another little irony in this nonsensical farce being carried on by the government, which is happy for its leader to mislead the parliament and the people by the use of requirements which are clearly nonsensical, misleading the people by not revealing that the words `interests in' mean total ownership of, by not revealing the beneficial interest and&mdash;if one can link the word `beneficial' with liabilities&mdash;the ultimate liabilities which the Prime Minister's half owned piggery holding company has. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one is going to require potential conflicts of interest to be reported properly, one is going to need better rules than these because these have been demonstrated by the Prime Minister to be inadequate for those people who set out to mislead this parliament. As a result, I strongly suggest that it is wrong for the Australian Democrats, for example, to say, `It is not perfect, but at least it is a step in the right direction'. It is not. By pretending, by giving an impression that there is revelation, one is diminishing the requirement and raising the expectation of the public that people have fully declared their positions, their potential for conflicts of interest, when they have, in effect, set out to hide them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This sense of false security that such declarations set up is shown by the Prime Minister's own activities to be a dangerous proposition. There you have clear potential for a conflict of interest on a major scale involving multimillion dollar multinational companies and involving huge debts to the Commonwealth Bank of which it has had to write off part. The only way someone like me could find out about that was not by looking at any declarations of interest&mdash;one would find nothing in there&mdash;but by pursuing the sources of information that are available to all Australians through the Australian Securities Commission, provided the companies tell the truth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most disconcerting element of this whole matter, quite apart from the false declaration of interest, is that this Prime Minister who half owns this group did not feel it incumbent upon himself to ensure that the group he half owns put in reports to the Australian Securities Commission which were accurate, which met the law, which were timely and which simply told the truth about his investment and its liabilities and its so-called assets. One element of the group phoneyed up the value of its assets by revaluing its piggery buildings by changing, in quite improper ways according to normal accounting standards, the nature of the loan to John Brown&mdash;turning a liability into an asset. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It appeared in one set of unaudited accounts as an asset that was shareholders' funds&mdash;a debt was magically transferred into shareholders' funds. Here we have a failure by the half-owner to care about whether or not there were accurate reports which we could examine. So I say that the most important thing in revelation is for anyone in this chamber, any minister who has such interests, to make certain that any reporting to the appropriate authorities is accurate and honest.

If we do not, what is it in here for? Then item (m) states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">being an officeholder or a financial contributor donating over $100.</PARA>
<PARA>Does this include the contributions that people make to the boy scouts or to some church? Does it include union dues? Does it include social clubs, racing clubs or rotary clubs&mdash;all those things? If it does, the forms are grossly inaccurate, because I cannot find instances of many members including those things on their lists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I venture to suggest that many of them are committed to more than $100 a year. I feel that anybody from this organisation who attends any recognised church would find that $100 a year would not go very far, but I have not found anybody listed. I notice that one senator listed his church as being one of his influencing factors, but it might just as easily have been the boy scouts or other bodies of that nature. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Item (n) talks of `any other interests'. Everything I have done in the past influences what I do&mdash;everything to do with my upbringing, with my business life, with my belonging to a political party. Whether I am aware of it or whether I am not, I am prepared to concede that all these things are an influence on my life&mdash;on the way I act, on the reason I am with this party and not with another party, and the reason I vote in the way I do. How can I list those? I believe those things are of considerably greater influence than whether I have got a few shares in some mining company, whether I have got a house in Wynyard and a unit in Canberra, or whatever. I believe it is the same with everybody. It is a pure charade to produce a requirement of this nature because it is thought it will look good&mdash;and that is the only reason it is done. It is not done with a view to trying to establish higher principles. It is not done with a view to making sure that there is no corruption. It is not done with a view to seeing that people change their vote because they might have a conflict of interest or abstain from voting. In a house such as this, with the sort of voting we are having now, that would have certain interesting effects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what is it we are after? We are just looking for some way to say, `There we are; we have got a register of interests; we are all clean; we are all clever', when in fact we are not. It makes no difference. It will make no difference whatsoever to how we behave and how we react. I believe it is time we faced this issue, and I would ask the minister at the table, the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley), to bear that in mind and say, `Well, it is a charade; it does not do what it purports to do. It was never intended to do that anyway, and we believe it is time we left the thing alone'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable senators will be aware that over the past 12 months or so I have been raising concerns in this place about the use and misuse of chemicals in our society. This concern was sparked by an incident of aerial spraying over a school at Forest in north-west Tasmania. If I recall correctly, the operators at that time were eventually prosecuted and fined. That incident was the catalyst for what has become an involvement for me in a very big, broad and important issue. There is now a network of interested people spread throughout Australia, many of whom are sending me stories of their experiences; and, importantly, they are sending requests for legislative outcomes from this place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of those requests asks for the aerial spraying of pesticides to be banned completely and immediately. I would suggest that, apart from the promotion of tobacco, aerial spraying has to be one of the most devastatingly unhealthy assaults on an unsuspecting people that governments in this country have allowed to happen. The cost to human health must be enormous, but we do not have the data to tell us. We are only now beginning to accept the enormous cost to the environment in terms of the effect on our rivers and water supplies of pesticide run-off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice in the chamber the previous chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts, Senator Crowley, who is well aware of the cost to the environment of pesticide run-off. As part of the inquiry into toxic algae, Senator Crowley quite rightly expressed her concern and showed her knowledge of the effects that these problems have on our environment. I am looking forward to the report that that inquiry, which was initially chaired by Senator Crowley, will bring forward soon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concerns are no longer confined to the tragic results of aerial spraying. That is just one of the headlines of what is going on in our country with regard to the misuse of chemicals. I have got letters and stories about tip sites, about reactions to industrial cleaners, about problems with school buildings&mdash;I am sure you are interested in that, Madam Acting Deputy President&mdash;and about exposure to what has been in shipping containers but has not been documented when those shipping containers have been re-used for other purposes, and the effects of what happens there. I have got stories about the toxic consequences of spraying building sites, about conditions of painters, and about the after-effects of domestic pest control treatments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In June this year my office convened a workshop in Newcastle on the whole issue. People came to that workshop from Newcastle itself and from Tasmania, Victoria, New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory. They came together to share their concerns and experiences and eventually to ask me to help them raise the problem of chemical poisoning, and to work to bring about wide ranging legislative changes to expose, to control and to limit the nature and existence of these poisons that pollute our life space and threaten the health of us all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To the meeting we attracted farmers, authors, medical practitioners, a refugee from graphic art work in television, a teacher, an academic, biological farmers interested in promoting pesticide-free food, victims of aerial spraying, and a variety of other people. It was not just a collection of people from a limited area of life; these people had been affected in a number of different occupations and in a number of different situations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since that workshop I have received a flood of material from those people and others, including a 120-page document, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Report on the New Face of an Epidemic: 1950s-1992</EMPHASIS>, by Yvonne Dolman and two other women in Victoria. It is a report about pesticide poisoning. The view being put is that pesticide poisoning is a new epidemic involving many different kinds of sicknesses deriving from a myriad of chemicals. The situation began with the advent of synthetic chemicals around the 1940s and 1950s and is still continuing, but we are yet to understand it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By about 1960, thousands of acres of agricultural and crown land had been aerially dusted or sprayed. From these sources excessive residues of DDT, dieldrin, aldrin, chlordane, benzene hexachloride and hexachlorobenzene have been found in food animals, tobacco and crops in virtually all districts in all Australian States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After about 10 years of almost uncontrolled pesticide use, government control began. Various committees evaluated each new use for every chemical in the interests of safety of users, bystanders, consumers, agricultural crops, domestic pets, domestic animals, wildlife, the environment and trade. All those things were considered worthy of being protected in some way from uncontrolled pesticide and chemical use. We had at that time the establishment of maximum residue levels, withholding periods, market basket surveys&mdash;all implemented to reduce pesticide use and risk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have not, however, controlled soil toxicity, the poisoning of vegetation or the poisoning of our waterways, our wildlife and our farm animals; nor, as the reference I have already made to the aerial spraying over Forest school in Tasmania and a number of other stories I have documented in the Senate indicates, have we exercised much control over the way we have thrown and still throw these lethal chemical cocktails into the air with, I suggest, nothing less than gay abandon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In suburban areas, pesticide control was disregarded from the start of the early 1950s. Few people then knew what it was that they were doing. Those who thought they knew sprayed along quite happily and those who did not know went right along doing it anyway. Public places, buildings, homes, rental flats, land and horse agistment areas were all treated. Councils were faced with either one or a series of problems for which mandatory spraying and long-term or partial treatments were required. It was becoming too expensive to employ people to remove manually what were considered pests, and anything that came with a long chemical name seemed to be attractive. Homes were treated, and neither the operator nor the occupants were aware of the chemical toxicity or the chemical abuse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nowhere, it seems, has anything been done to examine the possible after-effects on people of this cavalier period, despite growing documentation of chemical poisoning from all over the world. In this parliamentary session I intend to highlight the need to recognise that many people are now suffering from chemical illnesses as a result of the way we rely on and are indeed encouraged to rely on the use of chemicals for so much of our lifestyle. In many instances it is not the use of chemicals; it is the misuse of chemicals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One letter I have had for a little while is from the Victorian coordinator of the Australian Chemical Trauma Alliance. This is one of a number of organisations representing the interests of people whose health has been damaged by chemical exposure. Many of these people are so critically sensitive to every aspect of modern life that they live in complete isolation in specially built houses constructed without glues, paints, or synthetic materials of any kind. For many it means virtually no contact with the outside world, including no medical help. Indeed, these are people who are allergic to all medications, and many of them cannot even visit a doctor's surgery, let alone be hospitalised. But they have to take part in the world, where they are subject to spray drift and chemically treated buildings and materials. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The person I referred to a moment ago writes to me that her sensitising exposure traces back 17 years to the period of unsolicited pesticide exposure. For the next 11 years, she tells me, her rapidly worsening health problems were invariably attributed to stress, nerves, hypochondria and those sorts of things when the routine pathology tests proved negative. Once she has been sensitised by this exposure to chemicals, further exposure to even minuscule doses of the substance may evoke reactions commensurate with a normal toxic dose. She writes of her son, who after being exposed to two-day old Roundup and Estercide, was left ill for three weeks. He was too weak to walk; he was unable to eat; he was in such pain that he vomited and was unable even to move in bed; his face was so swollen that blood ran from his lips; he was jaundiced; he was shivering, though it was midsummer; he was rambling and disoriented, and shaky as if in shock. This is a boy who is not well, but it is very hard to decipher and to attribute a so-called normal analysis of the situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She also says in her letter to me:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . drift from ground spraying 2 kms away, and aerial spraying within a 10 km radius, leaves me semi-paralysed, in agonising pain, with double vision, memory and cognitive impairment, bleeding from the bladder and bowel, spontaneous bruising and haemorrhaging into my skin, terrifying heart arrhythmias, muscle spasms, and a host of lesser reactions.</PARA>
<PARA>She writes that she cannot even tolerate rainwater and must spend $40 a week on treated drinking water. This person is not unique. As a counsellor she constantly receives calls from many others in similar situations, some of whom are desperate and even too ill to go to hospital. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pat Snowden, a participant at the workshop I attended in Newcastle, is a victim of poisoning from exposure to chemical products that she used in the Victorian cleaning industry. She is one of an unknown number of chemically poisoned people now suffering from our growing reliance on chemicals used in agriculture, in industry, in our homes and in our schools. As I bring their stories to the Senate, I will be calling for changes to the legislation. I will also be tabling petitions, signatures to which are now being collected. I received a petition today asking for government action. It also asked for the application of a levy on the supply of chemicals. The levy would be used to encourage the implementation of education and training in the development of low toxic, chemical-free agricultural production. That just came, by coincidence, from another source. I will be tabling such petitions and asking for legislative action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a big issue. It is an issue that affects an incredible number of Australian people. The government will ignore it to its cost. Last year in this place we set up a new national registration authority. The draft of the legislation defining its operations was to be exposed to public scrutiny last November. We have been told to expect this legislation each month since then. The latest proposed timetable is that it will reach us at the end of August. The authority is to consist of a board of eight people, one of whom is to be a community representative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the questions asked of me during the Newcastle workshop in June related to the function of the community representative. This is to be performed by Mr Don Burke of television fame. The government announced the appointment of Mr Burke with a great deal of fanfare, and probably rightly so. I can assure the government that the `community' of people interested in, and affected by, chemicals is not quite as excited as the minister with that appointment. To that end, I have placed a question on notice seeking information about Mr Burke's program of consultations and how he will go about ensuring that he is capable of acting as a community representative. The government will be well advised to handle that consultative process seriously. If the people who came to our workshop in Newcastle are at all representative of the community, and I believe they are, there is an expectation that meaningful consultation will be high on Mr Burke's agenda. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I close with a simple statement of intention: the use of chemicals is an issue that has a capacity to become a real Pandora's box. For too long it has been swept under the carpet and for too long too many people have been horrendously affected by them. We will continue to be vigilant in our efforts to expose the truth of this whole matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are two matters I wish to refer to this afternoon, and I shall deal with them both briefly. That is not, though, to be interpreted as indicating that I have only a brief interest in each matter. I just want to place them on the record.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first matter relates to the outbreak of the disease in Western Samoa called taro blight, which has affected the taro crop in that country. It is a new disease that has not been found in Western Samoa before and it is absolutely devastating for the taro crop. It will have a major impact on the supply of domestic food. As honourable senators would know, the leaf and the corm are a significant part of the diet in Western Samoa. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not long ago, when I was<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">in Western Samoa, a young woman I was speaking to about food and diet said to me, amongst other things, `A meal without taro is not a meal'. So the significance of this disease to that country is very great indeed. I understand that, as yet, it is not in the island of Savai'i. I hope that our government will assist in doing whatever it can to make sure that that does not occur. It will have an effect on their exports as well as on domestic consumption. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have in Australia a man who is an expert on taro blight. Dr Grahame Jackson, who presently resides in the Australian Capital Territory, has worked for some 21 years with the Solomon Islands government as a plant pathologist and is a world-recognised expert in the area of taro blight. I understand that the Australian high commission in Apia has been very involved in talks with the Western Samoan government as to what Australia might do, and the Western Samoan government has sought assistance from us in dealing with the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, eradication of the disease is something that must be sought, or at least bringing it under control in the short term. I have no doubt that AIDAB and ACIAR are actively involved. I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Sherry), who is present in the chamber, to raise the matter with Senator Evans and ask those organisations to take every possible step as urgently as possible to assist Western Samoa to deal with this very significant problem that it has. If necessary, perhaps they could arrange for Dr Jackson to visit the country, but at least they could call upon him for all the expertise that he can bring to bear to fight the problem, because it is very grave indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other matter that I raise, and I am sure honourable senators have heard me mention it previously, is the treatment of Buddhists in Vietnam. The communist government there banned the church in 1981. I have on other occasions mentioned the treatment of some of the monks of the church in that country. I have raised the question of the property and pagodas of the Buddhist congregation having been confiscated by the Vietnamese government and not returned. There have been incidents again recently that I want to refer to briefly, such as the worsening restrictions on the patriarch Thich Huyen Quang. I think that the last or the second last occasion on which I spoke about this was when there were problems about the funeral of the previous patriarch. In June and July of this year 36 monks were arrested. There is also the matter of the continuing claim against the Unified Vietnamese Buddhist congregation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was 30 years ago in June of this year&mdash;and many of us will remember the photographs&mdash;that a 66-year-old monk drove to Saigon and set himself on fire in a crowded street to protest against the repression of Buddhism in that country. In a sense, it has been a bit like that ever since. I know that Senator Evans has previously taken up the matter of the execution and detention of monks. I know that the Australian embassy in Vietnam has been involved. With the latest escalation in this sort of activity against the Buddhist church I would ask Senator Evans again to ask the Australian embassy in Vietnam to prepare a report on what is happening and let us know whether there are any signs that freedom of religion will be allowed to operate in that country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to refer briefly to part of an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Far Eastern Economic Review</EMPHASIS> of 5 August of this year written by Murray Hiebert in Hanoi. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Just when Hanoi's communist rulers thought they had quelled a Buddhist rebellion in central Vietnam, a new row has erupted in the southern part of the country. The later clash culminated in the 9 July arrest of superior monk Thich Hanh Duc, head of the Son Linh pagoda near the southern port city of Vung Tau. He and a number of supporters were detained for `creating social disorder.'</PARA>
<PARA>It went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many observers believe this incident marks an escalation of the conflict between the government and supporters of the fiercely independent Unified Buddhist Church, which Hanoi banned in 1981 . . . The dissidents are demanding the right to re-establish their old church, the release of detained monks and the return of pagodas confiscated by the government.</PARA>
<PARA>I ask Senator Evans again to ask the embassy in Hanoi to prepare a report on what is happening and to make representations to the government on the matter of freedom of religion, particularly in relation to those under detention at present. </PARA>

An impasse is potentially developing which will be to the great disadvantage of my state and the great disadvantage of vocational students, those current and those for many years to come, if certain proposals are now adopted. It is to safeguard against this disaster that I speak, partly on behalf of the chairman of the college council of the pre-eminent TAFE college in my state, now called an institute of vocational education. It is the Adelaide, or the college at Light Square.</PARA></TALK.START>

I also alert the Department of Employment, Education and Training that I will seek to pursue this matter in the estimates process in the coming few weeks and will want very careful answers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What had happened, until a few weeks ago, was a very responsible planning process for the institute of vocational education in Adelaide for the fifth stage of its capital development. The plan was an extension to its current modern and very practical campus by the demolition of some old buildings that had been bought for the purpose and the erection of a distinctly purpose-built structure with appropriate rooms and facilities that were to be totally integrated with the existing building in the centre of Adelaide. It was to include a child care centre which has been much wanted for many years by the thousands of students that come to this vocational education institute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was to include a hospitality training program instead of that program being in an old hotel which, for more than a century, had been on this site. It would be demolished and there would be an appropriate dual facility&mdash;teaching and serving facility&mdash;for hospitality students of this college. There would be an appropriate number of rooms for a wide range of courses immediately accessible to the existing campus. This proposal was well developed, with proper consultation, with the plans exhibited for all the public to see. It has been in process and has been approved by the Commonwealth government and $19.7 million has been set aside for it this financial year. Tenders have been called and tenders received. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the 11th hour the state government of South Australia has put a spoke in the wheel. It has proposed that the whole process might be shut down and, instead, a redundant office building on the other side of Adelaide might be adapted for use for the purposes of this extension to the vocational institute. It is an existing 11-storey building that is distant from the campus. It was custom built as a commercial or city office building and is essentially a series of 11 floors with a few toilets per floor, a foyer and a lift, instead of the precisely designed building set out in the plans and approved by the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I seek leave to incorporate a letter from the president of the institute, addressed to the State minister. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Minister</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">Stage 5 Development, Adelaide Institute of Vocational Education</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am most concerned to learn that the proposed Stage 5 development for the Adelaide Institute has been dropped in place of a proposal to purchase an office building in Chesser Street, Adelaide. At my request, I accompanied the Leasing Agents on a tour of the proposed site this morning and as a result, seriously doubt that the building could be adapted to an educational facility.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I regret that again the Minister has not consulted with the Institute Council on a very major decision concerning the Institute.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, I am more concerned about the impact this proposal will have on the Adelaide Institute. I am sure that you appreciate that the Adelaide Institute is one of the most outstanding technical and vocational educational institutions in Australia. It has a reputation for innovative, leading edge technology and for enthusiastic, cooperative and very hardworking staff. The Institute has developed an excellent reputation which goes well beyond the State border. The number of international visitors who request a visit to the Adelaide Institute (and visit no other organisation in Australia) is extraordinarily high and is growing dramatically.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I was pleased to meet with you at the luncheon you hosted at Adelaide for the Malaysian Minister of Education. The Minister is a prime example of the foregoing. His visit was an outstanding success because he was able to hear about, and see on video, various aspects of the Institute. He then asked to visit a department and was able to quickly walk to that department to see in practice, the methodology discussed earlier.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As technology develops internationally, we envisage a growth in the international market for the export of courses and technology from the Adelaide Institute. The physical difficulties of coordinating staff split between two campuses in order to achieve this development will quickly mitigate against any future developments. I suggest that splitting the campus will cause many operational problems.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am sure that your Government is only too aware of the export potential that the Adelaide Institute has realised through SAGRIC and the future that this represents. A hasty decision now could cost the State significant export revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposal to relocate a large section of the Institute in a tower building which was designed for a completely different purpose has the potential to rip the heart out of the Adelaide Institute. It will destroy the opportunity for rapid and effective interaction between staff and will remove the opportunity for innovative, creative and productive interaction which has resulted in the sort of organisation of which your Government should be proud. I believe that the proposal, if it proceeds, will destroy the critical mass of the institution.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I also question whether the building could be adapted to conform to requirements of the Occupational Health and Safety Act because of the lack of facilities available to service the number of people occupying each floor.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From an economic viewpoint&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.we will have to provide an additional level of student services at the Chesser Street site</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.relocation costs</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.cost in conveying materials between the two campuses</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and other difficulties too numerous to list at this point.</PARA>

This will not now be possible if the proposed development goes ahead without significant increase in recurrent and capital expenditure costs.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Arnold Government has told the Adelaide College of TAFE  to spend $19m to buy a Grenfell Street property currently owned by the Bad Bank.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the same time, it wants to leave the next Liberal Government with the additional bill to re-furbish the Grenfell Street property.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Stage 5 of Adelaide TAFE could have been completed for $19m.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the Government's decision that Adelaide TAFE should buy the Grenfell Street property will add up to $10m to the cost to taxpayers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Grenfell Street property is totally incompatible with plans that Adelaide TAFE had for its extensions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a largely glass building when much of the work being undertaken at the College involves the use of computer screens and videos.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This press release also speaks for itself. I have not been in direct consultation with my good friend Dean Brown in this matter but I am aware of his and his party's concern that this is broader than what I know to be the case in what I have said up to this point. Dean Brown adds an extra dimension. He is looking to a successful win in this coming state election in my state.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That election might be held in November. I hope it is held as soon as possible, because we want to see a change of government in South Australia. One of the reasons why the present government deserves to be completely rejected and thrown out of office is the State Bank fiasco. The State Bank has left a debt of more than $3 billion on the heads of the citizens of the state. Among the assets that were left over from credit that was extended and that went bad in the hands of the State Bank, and that were therefore passed on to the state government, was this building called Chesser House, on the corner of Chesser Street and Grenfell Street. The building was an unwise investment by some Western Australian interests, but involved State Bank of South Australia money. It has never been used, and is a white elephant and which the state government has on its hands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The state government wants to use the Commonwealth's $19.7 million to reduce the book debt it will have when it faces the public in the coming election, and then leave an incoming alternative government to pick up the pieces and try to serve the interests of technical and further education&mdash;and, indeed, the present and future interests of those who come to this institute of vocational education. Therefore I draw particular attention to the fourth, fifth and sixth paragraphs of Dean Brown's apt press release. Mr Brown says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the same time, it wants to leave the next Liberal Government with the additional bill to re-furbish the Grenfell Street property.</PARA>
<PARA>He also talks about the practical problems: about the splitting of the campus and the inability to adapt the building. This is the accusation that is made by a responsible leader of the opposition in the state parliament. I believe that even if this were shown in some debate to be not fully founded, on the grounds of my earlier remarks about the completely inadequate aspects of the proposed building it is sufficient that no shift be made and that the campus not be split in the way that is proposed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I finally wish to refer to the statement issued on the same day as the press release from my colleague Dean Brown by the minister responsible in the state government, the Labor minister Susan Lenehan. She made this press statement, still without any consultation with that institute of education. I note three things. First, she confirms that no decision has been made on this matter. She says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There has been no decision made yet on exactly how the $19.7m allocated by the Commonwealth Government for construction of Stage 5 of the Adelaide Institute of Vocational Education will be spent.</PARA>
<PARA>She confirms that there is a proposal under consideration. I want her and the state government to announce that this proposal was ill-founded, that it is dismissed, and that stage 5 can go ahead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, she confirms that there was no consultation with the college council, but she does make the promise that at some stage in the future it will be consulted. That is some consolation. Thirdly, she notes that were there to be this change, the Commonwealth would have to approve it. The state government cannot just intervene and get away with either the shonky rewriting of some State Bank debt or the inappropriateness of this facility. The Commonwealth would have to approve it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why I appeal directly to ministers Beazley and Free and to their department to ensure that this decision is soundly made and that there is a rejection of any state government request from South Australia that would compromise the facility to the people of my state. It is clear that the minister has in fact caused a delay, because she has withdrawn the demolition order on the College Arms Hotel which was to clear the way for stage 5. So it is on hold, to the great tragedy of this college and of my state. I ask the ministers of the Commonwealth government to ensure that this whole fiasco is ended now and that the college can get on with the tenders that it has received to build stage 5 as planned. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In recent days, and in the more distant past, we have heard in this chamber the words `mandate', `representation' and `accountability'. There has been a great deal of discussion and comparison between the Senate and the House of Representatives with respect to the way in which legislation is dealt with. As recently as yesterday we heard a great deal of discussion around the motion dealing with the timing of the introduction of bills into the Senate. Many people built arguments around this notion of mandate&mdash;what party had a mandate to what&mdash;and the idea of accountability back to the public.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bears very much on the issue of the form of election which we have for the two Houses. I think most senators, looking dispassionately at the way the Senate operates, would agree that the Senate indeed operates as a house of review and that, since no party has held the numbers in this place to simply slam legislation through on numbers alone, this place has operated as a proper, representative and accountable chamber. With that in mind, I was particularly interested to see the report, in March 1993, by the Proportional Representation Society of Australia in relation to the 1993 elections. The society states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The elections for Australia's House of Representatives resulted in the ALP and the Coalition each receiving less than 45% of the first preference vote.</PARA>
<PARA>Based on that, one can argue that neither the ALP nor the coalition alone have a mandate to do anything. They require an additional vote from somewhere to represent more than 50 per cent of Australians. Its report continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ALP percentage exceeded that of the Coalition by only 0.66 percentage points, yet the ALP's share of the seats exceeded that of the Coalition by 10.20 percentage points.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the method of election in the House of Representatives resulted in an unfair, excessive proportion of seats in the House of Representatives compared with the number of votes which were actually first preference votes which were cast for the ALP. It is something on which the opposition should give some consideration. The society's report continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the PRSA's recommended Hare-Clark system of multi-member divisions with PR had applied, the ALP would have had 74 seats and the Coalition 72&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>a much closer result, which would have been far more reflective of the actual percentage of votes cast for the two groups. The society said that of those 72 seats for the coalition, the Liberals would have 61 seats and the Nationals, 11. They said that the remaining seat would have been taken by an Australian Democrat in South Australia. It further stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This would have allowed the ALP Government to continue in office with an absolute majority of seats, but would have ensured that its activities and proposals, and those of Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>a term which we heard frequently yesterday&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">could receive at least the minimum possible scrutiny and questioning by interests other than just the two standard alternators in power.</PARA>
<PARA>The society pointed out that, significantly, the one member of the House of Representatives that a proportional representation system would have elected would have been an Australian Democrat from South Australia, and that person would have been elected by virtue of a substantial quota of 66,842 votes of which 41,367 votes were first preference votes for the Australian Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By contrast, the present system of election for the House of Representatives elected Mr Ted Mack by virtue of an absolute majority of only 37,542 votes, of which only 27,834 votes were first preference for him. Likewise, Mr Phil Cleary's absolute majority was only 35,218 votes, of which only 20,721 were first preferences for him. I make these few remarks at lunchtime today to point out that the method of election for the House of Representatives is unrepresentative, as shown by those figures and quite contrary to what the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has disparagingly said of the Senate&mdash;that we are unrepresentative swill. I point out again that the Senate is a far more representative chamber, precisely because of the method of election, and that consequently we are the proper parliamentary and democratic house in this parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I stress those figures to the opposition. If we had had a PR system for election to the House of Representatives, at the last election the opposition would have had 72 seats, compared with 74 seats for Labor. The result would have been a great deal closer and the pressure on this government, which I think everybody in here would agree would be highly desirable, would certainly have been increased. I think the opposition should give serious consideration to the proposal which the Democrats have before this parliament. We have had on our books for a long time the notion that we should go to a system of multi-member electorates with proportional representation. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true to say that on the Labor back bench there is very great concern about the tax increases which have come through in this budget. Senator Chris Evans from Western Australia, I am happy to see, is in the chamber today. He will be able to relate to the Senate, when he makes his maiden speech, the importance of the wine industry in that great state of Western Australia. I wonder whether Senator Christopher Evans can tell us whether, when he went around and campaigned during the election and undoubtedly met some of the wine producers, he gave any assurances to the wine producers that there would be no tax increases on their product. But Senator Chris Evans will have to speak for the industry in Western Australia and I hope that he will join his colleagues on the back bench who are in revolt over this budget. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My purpose in rising today is to discuss the wine industry in Victoria. I have had the opportunity of speaking to the Victorian Wine Industry Association and have listened to its very great concerns about the impact that this massive rise in taxes will have on its industry. In my home state there are some 230 winemakers and many of those are planning major investments as the wine industry is one of those sectors of the Victorian economy which has really been targeted as a growth sector, certainly in terms of the export markets that we see opening up to wine production. Of course, as people know, the wine industry also has important effects on the tourism industry and particularly on employment in the rural sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it is an important industry. It is an important industry in my home state and it is an industry which we see as one of the growth sectors. As a result of this promise broken by the Keating government, we are now seeing some of these prospects of the industry cast into doubt. I bring to the attention of the Senate, and particularly Labor Party backbenchers, the concerns of the Victorian wine industry. There are two Labor Party seats in Victoria which have a large wine sector and those are the seat of McEwen and the seat of Burke. The member for McEwen is Mr Cleeland and the member for Burke is Mr O'Keefe. I would like those two particular individuals but also people like Senator Chris Evans and others who come from wine growing states to be very aware of the impact that these tax changes on the wine industry will have on the growth of that important sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Victorian Wine Industry Association will be making a press release later today in which it strongly condemns the federal government's budget, particularly the sales tax hike from 20 per cent to 31 per cent. This is what the Victorian Wine Industry Association says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A 55 % increase in sales tax from 20 % to 31 % at this absolutely critical moment in the development of the Australian wine industry is more than simply ill-considered and regressive.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And yet the federal government (despite exhorting Australian companies to do all these things) has chosen to penalize the wine industry for being successful.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a statement by its president, Mr Shelmerdine. Mr Shelmerdine says:</PARA>

Our international competitors&mdash;Chile, South Africa and Eastern Europe&mdash;are celebrating tonight . . . </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The mantle of government leadership and encouragement for Australian winemakers has now passed to the state governments of Victoria, South Australia and New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Victorian winemakers are fortunate to have a state government committed to the full tourist, technical and economic development of the wine industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The federal government have cynically abdicated their responsibility to the thousands of independent grape growers and small and medium sized family wine companies in rural Victoria.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This tax grab must be rescinded at once.</PARA>
<PARA>He concludes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Regrettably, it is yet another example of Canberra bureaucrats' complete insularity from an insensitivity to the real, hard world of winegrape growing, winemaking and international marketing.</PARA>
<PARA>I have brought to the attention of the Senate just one example of the adverse consequences that this budget will have on a particular sector of the economy.

They are the result of the Prime Minister breaking his election promises. </PARA>

It is certainly my intention to make sure that their particular concerns are properly and fully addressed by the government. This matter raises the wider issue that has been before this chamber now for a number of days since the budget: what value does one put on the price of a Labor promise these days? Is there anything so worthless in the community as the word of our Prime Minister? Let us face it, Mr Keating will say anything and do anything in order to win a short-term political advantage.

They had the chance to stand up and make it clear to the Prime Minister that, no matter how lowly and cynically he might hold the value of his own word to be, they held their promises dear. If those two senators do not do that, the community will take note that, in future, a Labor promise will not be worth the paper it is written on or the policy statement it appears in.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to make a few comments about the latest development in the never-ending saga of satellite pay television licences. If we were to take our cue from the two ministers who have nominal responsibility in this area, we would not be any the wiser; indeed, we would probably be thinking that this matter was simply being negotiated administratively in some way. The reality is that we have now reached the point of absurdity where the fourth deadline has passed&mdash;with a deafening silence from both communications ministers! The process is still in free-fall and we have no early prospect of identifying any successful bidders.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we go back to 1 May last, just after the first deadline had expired and applications had closed, we find that it took about five minutes flat for Mr Beddall to get up and say that not only had UCOM and Hi Vision won the bids but that $389 million was on the table. He said that this ushers in a new era in Australian television. If, by that, he meant that there would be a new era of unprecedented ministerial incompetence, he was absolutely right. He also said that he was not surprised at the size of the bids; that he had always thought the price could be much higher than other people thought. I do not know whom he has been talking to, but these days there is not anyone who would put up his or her hand to say that these prices were anywhere near reasonable. Indeed, most people would say that the market price is less than half the bid of either UCOM or Hi Vision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He said that he was perfectly relaxed about that outcome and asked why he would not be if he could say to Ralph Willis, `Here is $389 million to help you with the budget deficit'. The fact is that, if honourable senators look at the budget papers, they will find no mention at all of proceeds from licence sales in respect of these licences. Are we meant to conclude from that that a few months ago the government was so confident and these ministers were so deluded that they were able to boast about having got $389 million for Treasury coffers and now they are so lacking in confidence and so totally out of touch that they are not even prepared to put $1 into the budget by way of revenue provision?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This matter has reached an extraordinary level of incompetence. One can only say that Senator Collins has been acting like a water buffalo frozen in the spotlight. If the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), who fancies himself as being a man of great political courage, were prepared to summon up enough courage to sack Senator Collins, it would be the biggest dope bust of the decade. It is worth remembering the sort of bravado that Senator Collins constantly goes on with and how each and every time he falls flat on his face.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to refer to one of his more recent efforts, when he told the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Northern Territory News</EMPHASIS> on 2 August last&mdash;only a matter of a couple of weeks ago&mdash;that he was confident that the imposition of the five per cent deposit requirement would sort out the winning bids. The fact is that that was only a couple of weeks ago. Nothing has happened since that time, except that we have seen further bids fall over. There is absolutely no prospect of any end in sight to this circus. Quite clearly, both Senator Collins and Mr Beddall have chosen to say nothing on each occasion because they have absolutely nothing to say. They are acutely embarrassed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They were under no obligation to nominate the successful bids and bidders several months ago but they chose to do so. They did so because they thought there was political mileage in it. They thought they were very clever in being able to identify new players paying top dollar. In fact, all we have discovered is that those bids were totally unrealistic. With hindsight we know that neither of those bidders had any serious intention, let alone prospect, of being able to become long-term players at that level. They are simply cascading down because the government has allowed that process to occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given all the sound and fury that we had from Senator Collins, it seems extraordinary that he has not taken the very simple measure that has been advocated by many in the industry, and that is to require all remaining bidders to put five per cent on the table immediately. That would sort out the sheep from the goats, or the water buffalos from the rest. In one fell swoop, he would be able to bring this process to a halt. But instead he lets it drag agonisingly on so that we keep going through these never-ending cascades of bids, making Australia an international laughing-stock and ensuring that Senator Collins goes down in history as the most incompetent communications minister the country has ever had. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am provoked into speaking today by the continuing litany of deceit that is unveiling before us as we see the breaking of promise after promise of the newly elected `sweetest victory of all' Australian Labor Party government here in the federal capital. The budget has been a disgrace. It has also been a budget that has hurt many individuals. Most of us are reminded of that every day when we drive to this building in Commonwealth cars, whose drivers are yet a small example of people who have been deceived by the federal government, by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and by ministers in relation to the security of their employment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth car drivers, along with many other public servants in Canberra and around Australia, were told, `Watch out. Don't vote for the Liberal Party at this election because there will be massive sackings. You will all lose your jobs and you will lose all your benefits and entitlements. So don't vote for those nasty, horrible Liberals. Stay with us. We'll look after you. She'll be right. You'll be comfortable'. But what happens only a few short months after the sweetest victory of all, the true believers' victory, is that we see the employment security of thousands upon thousands of federal public servants threatened. I think the saddest thing about that&mdash;the very, very sad thing&mdash;is that these people were lied to, they were deceived by this federal government and, worse still, they were just unable to plan their futures because of this deceit. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, it has not got tanks but I recommend it to Senator Sherry. I might even seek leave to table it but I probably would not get leave. This publication is entitled `Labor's Election Lulus'. I guess that is parliamentary language, Mr Acting Deputy President&mdash;it does not say `lies' or `dishonesty'; it says `election lulus'. Senator Vanstone has put this together after a process of broad consultation with coalition members and honourable senators throughout Australia. Senator Vanstone said, shortly after the federal election in those most depressing days for those of us on this side of the house, that she would like us to send to her examples of outrageous claims made by Labor Party people during the campaign. One was made by one of Senator Evans's former state secretary colleagues, Mr Wayne Swan, now MP. This excellent document should really become a document of the Senate but I might send it across to Senator Sherry so he can have a look at it. Page 26 of the document shows Mr Wayne Swan as having said during the campaign, in a direct mail letter to residents of the seat of Lilley&mdash;those poor people who again have been deceived by this man&mdash;`Under Dr Hewson women will have to wait five more years to qualify for the pension'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course it was not true. There was an incremental increase, as Senator Panizza has said. But the fact of the matter is that Wayne Swan went around scaring the women in the electorate of Lilley by saying that to qualify for the pension they would have to wait another five years. Many of these women in the seat of Lilley, in Queensland, very good citizens of Australia I am sure, probably believed Mr Swan when he said that Dr Hewson was going to do that. They probably thought also that Mr Swan was implying that the Prime Minister and the Labor Party would not put up the qualifying age for pensions by five years if the women were to vote for Mr Swan.</PARA></TALK.START>

As Senator Vanstone says, it would be probably a good thing that we could not put together a list of that size, because we would need a hydraulic trolley to move the document from one place to another.

In Australia in the last couple of months we have seen it perfected by this government, which was prepared to cheat and lie to the people of Australia in order to get re-elected. Again, on this serious note, I repeat to Senator Panizza, this very sad thing. We see every day when we come into work in our Commonwealth cars that good citizens of Australia&mdash;public servants in particular; and Senator Reid, who represents many of them here as a senator for the Australian Capital Territory, is entering the chamber&mdash;have been deceived. They have been cheated. They have had their lives and their security disrupted and disturbed by a government that, only a few months ago, was prepared to look them in the eye and say, `If you are a public servant, do not vote for nasty Dr Hewson because you will lose your job'.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Coulter, in reflecting on debate that occurred earlier in this place about cut-off dates for legislation, made me think about some comments by one of his fellow colleagues in the Australian Democrats. I think it was Senator Spindler who suggested that one of the major problems for lengthy debate in this place is repetition. I certainly believe that if we could overcome some of the repetition problems and people truly debated, rather than coming into the Senate simply to give a speech and then leaving again, we might save some time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Kemp referred to the wine industry. I am sure we are going to be debating the effect of the budget on the wine industry on a number of occasions in this place. He did have the temerity to suggest that Senator Chris Evans, who was in the Senate at the time, should address this matter in his first speech. I would suggest to Senator Kemp, who is still in the Senate, that the first speech content is a matter for the senator to decide, not for him to suggest. I hope, but I am sure, given Senator Kemp's past record, that he will be here to listen to a very good speech from Senator Chris Evans when he gives his first speech. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Alston referred to the ongoing concerns he has with the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins) and some concerns over licence bidding.

I think the accusation, that we would need a hydraulic lift to list documents containing alleged breaches of promise by this government, is a slight exaggeration, particularly given the honourable senator was waving this document around by hand.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. Given that since February 1992 the government promised that it could match the coalition's tax cut pledge without any increase in tax, given that it perpetrated this lie throughout the 1993 election campaign, and given that the Prime Minister has admitted that he and the Treasurer agreed less than a week after the election that they could not honour their tax cut promise in full, how can anyone believe them when they now promise no new taxes for four years?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Hill is obviously not the sort of person from whom one could buy a used prime ministerial statement. I say that because he has completely misquoted the line used by the Prime Minister in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS> interview of 19 November, when he did say, `What I am promising is not to put up tax'. What the Prime Minister said in the immediately preceding sentence was as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>So the context in which that statement was made is exactly the context I described yesterday. It has always been the position of the government that we would not increase the proportion of revenue to GDP. It was also of course the position of the government that we would not introduce a broadly based consumption tax. Of course it was the position that we would not introduce a wholesale sales tax. It is in that particular context and with that particular trio of quite explicit promises that the government went to the last election.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it has been perfectly straightforwardly explained by the Prime Minister and Treasurer in the context of the budget strategy as a whole, which is a four-year medium term strategy designed to produce, as those opposite should know by now, a fiscal deficit of around one per cent of GDP&mdash;no more than that&mdash;by 1996-97. The budget has adopted projections based on a series of plausible assumptions, which are spelt out in the budget documents. They bring forward a projection roughly halfway between the high and low growth scenarios which were presented in the national fiscal outlook report. As again Senator Hill is probably not aware, this was an unprecedented cooperative effort by Commonwealth and state governments to map out the medium term fiscal challenges in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me answer this question in my capacity as minister representing the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. I was sure that one of the government backbenchers would ask this question because this matter is of great importance to rural Australia. We have tried to provide a special emphasis on it in the budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am advised by the minister, Mr Crean, that the significance of what the government has done is quite important. We have responded to the problems of the rural sector with a range of targeted programs&mdash;targeted at farmers, rural communities and rural families. The budget has provided $406.8 million over four years for the rural adjustment scheme, known as RAS. It has provided $105.2 million for the national Landcare program. I think most senators in this chamber agree that land care is the foremost environmental issue in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Four million dollars a year has been provided for rural families through the abolition of the assets test on the supplementary boarding allowance under the assistance for isolated children scheme. There has been further funding to almost treble the number of telecentres, that is, centres owned by local communities which teach techniques in computing and the use of other modern day electronic aids to business. Funding to telecentres in rural areas will allow them to treble; an additional 1.2 million has been provided. Funding for rural counselling has increased by $650,000 to reach the figure of $3.95 million for the budget year 1993-94. Funding of $22.6 million has been provided for the agribusiness development program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has introduced a refocussed rural adjustment scheme targeted at providing a leg-up to farmers who are making an effort to improve the productivity and sustainable profitability of their businesses. The scheme offers interest subsidies on commercial finance for productivity improving measures and grants for training and professional advice. Australia-wide in 1992-93, over 11,800 applicants for RAS were approved, providing support totalling more than $112 million all up. Of this, 6,638 applications were approved for exceptional circumstances support, totalling, for that category, $75.9 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will say a few words on the farm household support scheme. In March this year the government introduced the farm household support scheme which provided a further support mechanism for farmers in addition to the standard welfare programs already available to the general population, such as the Jobsearch allowance. This scheme provides a loan for up to two years at the level of the Jobsearch allowance to meet daily living expenses for those farmers who are unable to access further commercial finance. The scheme is aimed at two distinct groups within the farming community. The first group is those are who are unable to convince their financial institution of their prospects but who wish to work their way out of difficulties. The scheme provides a source of finance to meet their day-to-day expenses while the farmer works to return the business to a sound footing. The second group is that which has taken the difficult decision to leave farming. For this group the FHS provides for daily living expenses while the farm is on the market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a range of things I could say in answer to Senator Jones's question. Let me say that these schemes and extra finance build on a plethora of existing mechanisms to help the rural community and should be seen as answering many of the needs expressed by farmers and rural organisations.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to receive a question on the GATT because the Uruguay Round, which has now been running for seven years, is coming up to the endgame of the negotiations. The negotiations resume in Geneva on 1 September and they are to be completed by 15 December. Seven years of negotiating work is coming to fruition in those last three months. Since the value to Australia in extra income from a strong outcome to the round when fully implemented is about an extra $2.5 billion, we can expect that, in the last few months as we complete the negotiations for the round, there will be endless forays to deflect our attention and try to put obstacles in our course for successfully bringing this round to conclusion. I am not accusing Senator Spindler of putting an obstacle in our course, but I am saying that his question betrays a fundamentally flawed understanding of what the GATT itself is about.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, please listen to this because it is now important more than ever for us to have a clear understanding of what the GATT does and does not do. For example, the GATT does not impose environmental standards; the GATT does not impose labour standards; and the GATT does not impose labelling standards or things of that nature such as Senator Spindler referred to in his question. What the GATT does is proclaim a set of rules to ensure that trade in the world among the contracting parties to the agreement is fair, free and transparent. So, if a country is using environmental standards as a non-tariff barrier, then the rules under the GATT would expose that and then deal with it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This does not in any way prevent countries like Australia or the United States&mdash;or any country&mdash;imposing their own environmental standards for environmental reasons. But we would be naive in the extreme to think that, on labour standards, environmental standards, labelling standards and a whole range of other standards, some countries in the world do not exploit the idealism of some groups in the community and use false implementation of those things as non-tariff barriers to prevent free trade. That, I think, answers the first question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me turn to questions two and three. The questions of detailed assessment and delaying of the signature to the Uruguay Round agreement do not arise. On what Senator Spindler has put, we certainly would not, should there be a successfully concluded outcome, delay our signature. This is because the GATT and the Uruguay Round text on technical barriers to trade, the revised standards codes and the sanitary and phytosanitary measures will not impose specific standards on Australia and the GATT will therefore not undermine Australia's ability to maintain its own high level of environmental and other standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I suggest&mdash;because I know that Senator Coulter has a notice of motion which is similarly flawed in its understanding of the role of GATT&mdash;is that if the Democrats, the Greens or the independent members here would like a full briefing on the GATT, I would be delighted to give it. For Australia this is the most significant multilateral trade negotiation that we have undertaken. What is at risk here, if we miscue on this, is a loss of income of $2.5 billion a year and a commensurate reduction in Australian living standards. Before anyone does anything rash about this, he or she should understand the full implications of what is involved.</PARA>

I think our concern is that if the government proceeds as it has in the past, the costs from this will be much greater than the benefits. May I draw the minister's attention to the fact that Australia has lodged an appeal against the energy tax that the United States wanted to impose to advance its performance under the Montreal protocol to reduce the greenhouse effect in the United States, and of course globally. That is an example of what the Uruguay Round can be used for. The burden of my question is that those opposite do not do that for Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>

Australia has not done what Senator Spindler has accused us of doing. Australia has not opposed any measure on energy taxes by the Clinton administration. We have expressed our view about a form of tax being suggested by some in Congress which would impose an energy tax on countries that export goods and services into the United States and tax those exports from, for example, Australia on the basis of their energy component.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The short answer to Senator Chamarette is no. I think the reason why the answer is no is pretty well known not only to people in this place but also to people who have been out parading in the streets trying to put pressure on the government in respect of this issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The background is that when the act was changed&mdash;and I think that change took place in May 1992; in fact, it was in the House of Representatives on 5 May 1992&mdash;it was understood and acknowledged at the time that there may have been problems with the detention regime. That was spelt out in the House of Representatives on 5 May by, amongst others, the opposition spokesperson Mr Ruddock. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are of the view that the current powers of arrest and the basis on which people are detained are sufficiently cumbersome, outdated and silent as to leave doubt in the minds of some as to whether or not people held in custody can continue to be so held.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In essence, it was understood at the time that although there might have been some question of illegality or doubt over legality, the legislation that the government introduced would rectify that particular situation. The people have been held quite legally, without any doubt at all, in detention since the passing of that legislation. As I say, although there was some doubt beforehand, that doubt had not been acknowledged technically until court proceedings on a matter of compensation were continued last week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of those proceedings, the Government Solicitor filed particulars and an amended defence in the High Court during the week ending 13 August and in that defence was an acknowledgment that Mr Ly was detained unlawfully. That was very much done in order to proceed to the major question of that litigation, that being the question of compensation. The basic issue here is that we are talking with people who have been determined not to be refugees and, as a consequence, we are not going to proceed down the road that Senator Chamarette suggests.</PARA>

The government has conceded that a person has been detained unlawfully for two years, regardless of the fact that the previous 18 months have been lawful detention.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think I have gone to the substance of the question. What Senator Chamarette and others in the community who might get worked up about this particular issue should understand is that people who come here illegally by boat have, for a long time, had a very clear message from the Australian parliament, not just the government, and that is: if they are bona fide refugees they will be processed and out in the community. One quarter of them who have arrived in Australia by boat have been so processed and are in the community. If they are not bona fide refugees, then for so long as it takes them to pursue the courses of action available to them through our system they have to stay in detention. The people in question in a number of cases have been determined some four times not to be refugees. It is not within the will of this government to allow the process of delaying legal proceedings as embarked upon by some practitioners in this field to force us into a situation which subverts the policy of this parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>

We have also added to it a visual arts touring program which will enable more Australians to enjoy the visual arts, crafts and collections of heritage and scientific materials of our national collecting institutions and of state and regional institutions. One of the important things about both the performing arts and the visuals arts touring program has been and will be that not only are collections in the major capital cities and the arts groups performing in the major capital cities being taken to regional cities where it was not otherwise possible, but also performers and artists in those areas are getting access to the wider audience of people in the major capital cities.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I note the fervent attempt by people to create a climate in which they can justify voting against these measures, but the attempt to portray that question as concern for lower income workers is an absolute phoney. Most people except Senator Alston would understand that for this simple reason: no worker, no citizen in Australia, on less than $20,700 a year will lose 1c as a result of this policy&mdash;everybody should know that&mdash;because the tax rate on which this applies at the moment is 30c. So no-one whose marginal rate is less than 30c will lose a cent.

The College of Ophthalmologists said that it was about to give me a submission which would lay the ground for heinous things to be done to optometrists who were in some way cheating upon the system. I told the optometrists about the ophthalmologists wanting to give me that document. I told them that I would take no action on that document without talking to them. I have not read that document because subsequent to the meeting that I had with the optometrists there were budget discussions. Savings papers came up in those budget discussions and, as a minister with no problem with the truth and with an absolute commitment to the responsibility ministers have, I did not discuss that matter with the optometrists or anyone else. To have done so would have been a clear breach of responsibility on my part and not something which I would do.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Pursuant to the order of the Senate agreed to on 18 August on the motion of Senator Short, I now table a statement of the government's forward estimates projections of revenue for each of the fiscal years 1994-95 to 1996-97. This will be of particular interest to Senator Kemp, because it starkly outlines the particular point I was making before. Whereas revenue has gone last year to this year from 23.6 to 23.5 per cent, tax revenue&mdash;and there is a distinction&mdash;goes from 22.2 down to 21.9 per cent, as I just said. It will make very interesting reading, and I think Senator Kemp should be grateful to his friend Jim Short for giving me the opportunity to put this firmly on the public record.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans), in response to a question without notice asked by Senator Kemp this day in relation to the ratio of taxation to gross domestic product.</PARA>
<PARA>I wish to respond to the astonishing comments that Senator Gareth Evans made after a bit of quick advice from Senator McMullan, who popped over on the run. The trouble with taking advice on the run is that one is liable to get it wrong, and that is precisely what Senator Gareth Evans did. I was using the formulation used by Senator Gareth Evans and by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in previous question times and that is, what happens when these tax changes that the government has announced wash through the system. The government's budget papers show that, at the end of the day, the ratio of tax to GDP will rise to 23.5 per cent. Of course, some of these tax changes do not apply until part of the way through the year. Everyone now concedes that the Prime Minister has given a somewhat inflated estimate overriding Treasury of what the GDP will be in year one. That was the figure which Senator Gareth Evans mentioned but which was not relevant to the question I put. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is interesting to the taxpayer&mdash;and what the government has tried to justify since the budget&mdash;is that taxes will not rise above what Senator Gareth Evans has described as current levels, which he then goes on to define&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WW4">Senator KEMP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Gareth Evans has had his go; I am going to have my go. He has defined them over the past eight years. The government's own budget papers show that after all these tax changes which are imposed this year wash through the system, on the government's own forecasts, the ratio will rise to 23.5 per cent. That is precisely what I said in my question to Senator Gareth Evans.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem today was that Senator Gareth Evans was caught out seriously. He defined the promise in terms of the tax to GDP ratio and we accepted the terms in which he defined that promise. Then we looked at the government's budget papers and found that the tax to GDP ratio rises over the term of this government as a result of these tax changes. Because of the poor advice that Senator Gareth Evans has taken or because of the lack of work that he applies to his job, he has put the Prime Minister straight in the soup. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, I think that after all this is over, Senator Evans should go and make it clear to Mr Keating that he and his colleagues and the community are not going to accept these broken promises. These innumerable taxes, which Senator O'Chee so well explained to the Senate today, are quite contrary to the promises that the government made during the election campaign. After these have washed through the system, as Senator McMullan will now tell us, the tax to GDP ratio will rise from the level that Mr Keating was talking about to 23.5 per cent on the government's figures. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation is that we have people here who are seeking to be profound when unfortunately they are not really on top of the facts that they are dealing with. We have those things which determine the tax to GDP ratio as well as the revenue to GDP ratio, which is clearly the more important factor. If it is not self-evident, I will come to the reason why it is more important in a moment; it would be self-evident to most people but apparently not to everybody here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ratios are determined by more than merely the changes in the tax laws. With absolutely no change in the tax laws, it is possible for the tax to GDP ratio to change depending on the rate of inflation, the rate of growth, what is happening on to wages, what is happening to company profits and on the composition of the GDP between wages and profits, because taxes on profits are different from taxes on wages. In a projection four years out, there is a complex array of factors that determine tax to GDP ratio. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the table that Senator Evans has just tabled, which is an extract from the budget papers and shows figures going back to 1953, we find a number of occasions in which there have been major changes in tax to GDP ratio without changes of any significance&mdash;and sometimes none at all&mdash;to the tax laws of a revenue raising nature. It is possible to have a year in which there are tax cuts, and yet the tax to GDP ratio changes because of other underlying economic factors. Senator Kemp knows that, just as he knows that the tax cuts cost more than the tax measures will raise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not saying that Senator Kemp sought to mislead, but it is misleadingly simplistic to go four years out and assume that the tax to GDP ratio is solely driven by changes in the tax laws. The data over the years quite clearly proves that that is not the case. Senator Short and other people with any knowledge of, for example, the impact of the change in composition of the GDP, the impact of growth, the impact of inflation on tax to GDP ratio would know that inflation is the most obvious but not the only one. Even at the very low inflation rate that we have there is inevitably some impact on tax to GP ratio. But revenue as a percentage of GDP is a much more important issue than tax as a percentage of GDP. </PARA>

But then it will increase every year until 1996-97, till it reaches the figure of 23.5 per cent, and that figure means that the tax hike involved is more than $6 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If that is not a tax hike, I would like Senator Gareth Evans to tell me and the Australian people what is, because there is no way that the government can get that figure without there being a massive increase in taxes.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before the election, the budget was self-repairing. It was going to `whirr back into balance'.

Now that has been redefined to mean the overall tax take will not be increased beyond the level it reached in the boomtime `80s. Pre-election, nary a word was said about the decline of national savings. Now it is one of the major problems facing the nation.</PARA>
<PARA>This is what we have seen today from Senator Evans and his chief adviser, Senator McMullan. Referring to Dr Edwards, Mr Oakes continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He goes further, referring to the process as `manipulation', often on many different levels, `with one rationale for action giving way to another more sophisticated one as each was successively undermined by fact and experience'.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On the subject of the heady days, I remind Senator Campbell that in the last two years of the Fraser administration the figure was 24 per cent&mdash;a higher proportion of tax to GDP than will be the case in 1996-97, even on these projections; that is, 23.5 per cent. He might just contemplate that figure before he gets too cavalier with some of these other figures he has been throwing around. It was 24 per cent&mdash;a higher tax take than there is now and a higher tax take than there will be, even after the full effect of all these measures works itself through in the way that Senator Kemp, Senator Short and everybody else have been getting excited about. Those opposite should contemplate that before they start throwing these figures around again, because they are going to come back and bite them.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Kemp has not brought up any other examples. This is the quote used all the time. If he has some better ones, he should let us see them. The particular quote the opposition has been using was the one made on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS> program. On the face of it, taken out of context, it does seem to be the most stark and the most interesting for the opposition's particular purposes, but the point about that particular statement, which is the only one the opposition felt able or comfortable to quote and to repeat, is that it was made in a very specific context. For a start, it was made in response to a question about infrastructure spending and what kind of capacity there would be on the part of the government to do that. The context was not a question about what kind of revenue measures we have in mind, what we are going to do with direct taxes, or what we are going to do with indirect taxes.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am just making the point, little bit by little bit, in little dollops that those opposite will be able to understand, that the response was to a question about that. It was not in response to being asked, `What is your tax policy?', and it was not in response to a question about what we are going to do with particular individual taxes or tax rates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point to make about it is that the words used by the Prime Minister were not words of precision, as has been acknowledged by Senator Short. He was saying, `What we want to do is maintain the tax to GDP ratio we roughly have at the moment'. He is talking in generalised language in a particular context where it is self-evidently the case that we are talking about the same orders of magnitude. de. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moreover, we are talking in a context where the average tax take for the whole previous 10 years of this government had been over 24 per cent&mdash;24.2 per cent. If you look at those figures and add them up, I think that is the way the arithmetic falls out&mdash;24.2 per cent over the previous 10 years, starting with the 24 per cents, two in a row, from the Fraser administration, which we inherited. Let me read the figures into the record so that those opposite know: 24 per cent and 24 per cent for the last two years of the Fraser government; for the first year of our government, 1983-84, it dropped to 23.1 per cent; going down the list, it was then 24.6, 24.7, 25.3, 25.3, 24.7, 24.7, 24.5, 22.6 and 22.2 last year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the particular context the Prime Minister was talking in&mdash;that average tax to GDP ratio coming out at around that 24 per cent. He was talking about roughly the environment he was confronting. So before we fiddle and fuss any longer and paw apart even further this poor benighted throwaway line of the Prime Minister's, any proper reading of it should acknowledge that particular context. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The further point, the obvious point, to make, moreover, is that not only is the tax take not going up this year, it is going down. How often do I have to repeat the point that it may have been 22.2 per cent last year; it may be, on the out-year projections, getting up to something less than it has been for the last 10 years and less than it was in the last couple of years of the Fraser government; but this year, when the immediate impact of all these petrol taxes and the wholesale tax and all the things the opposition is troubled about makes itself first apparent, the tax ratio to GDP actually goes down from 22.2 per cent to 21.9 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a pretty exotic little debating point that those opposite have been able to put together, with all the research resources available to them.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I present the government's response to the report of the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration on the management and operation of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. I seek leave to have that document incorporated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard </EMPHASIS>and to move a motion in relation to it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The response read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For the information of honourable members, I present a statement containing the Government's response to the report from the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration entitled Management and Operations of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When this report was released last December, I welcomed it as a comprehensive vindication of the Department's management and, in particular, of its continuing management improvement program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report's examination of the issues and its recommendations constitute strong support for the direction and implementation of management changes in DFAT since the merger of the former Department of Foreign Affairs, the former Department of Trade and Promotion Australia (PA) in 1987. It provides strong support for the Department's program of  modernisation and reform. I support the report's conclusion that the Department "must be given credit for the progress it has made" in managing changes which the Committee describes as "large and rapid".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A basic feature of the Department's reform program has been an openness to constructive ideas and to practical suggestions about how performance can be further improved. This is the spirit in which the Government has considered the report's recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By its own account the Committee's recommendations cover mainly "housekeeping" issues. For the most part the Government endorses these recommendations, and indeed has already implemented several of them. In the very few cases where the Government is not in a position to accept certain recommendations&mdash;for reasons of practicality or cost&mdash;we have sought to examine alternative ways in which the Committee's objectives could be met. The details are set out in the formal response which I have tabled.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Management Reform</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The management of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is, by any measure, a complex endeavour. Its global reach is unique in the Australian public sector, as is its mix of policy advising, service delivery and public advocacy functions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Such an operation is not managed by static systems. It requires flexibility and a practical, evolutionary approach. The management improvement program introduced in  1988&mdash;which has been endorsed by the Committee&mdash;was one part of this evolutionary process. It addressed the needs of a then newly amalgamated Department confronted additionally with declining resources and expanding demands.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since then, many other changes have been introduced in areas such as staff development, program evaluation, information technology, and financial and accounting systems.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department is now a more open one with greater diversity in staff background and experience. Its personnel management systems have improved in terms of client service and collegiate decision making consistent with Industrial Democracy and EEO principles.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most recently, the new Secretary has, with the full support of the all three Portfolio Ministers, moved quickly, in consultation with all staff, to initiate a comprehensive review of the Department's Corporate Plan, its capacity to pursue the Government's core economic and strategic interests, the match between resources and priorities, the role of its Senior Executive officers, and a range of other management issues including competency training, career satisfaction and work and family, or personal, responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In all of this the Department's continuing objective is to ensure it has effective management systems operated by staff who are motivated, expert and flexible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Staff Morale</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Much of the Committee's report is devoted to the complex range of issues that affect staff morale at a time of rapid change and with multiple pressures upon Departmental management and staff. The major changes involved in merging two Departments and Promotion Australia, each with its own strong sense of history and organisational culture, inevitably brought with them challenges for all concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Changes of this magnitude require a sustained sensitivity on the part of Departmental management to any consequences in terms of staff morale due to uncertainty about the new directions for the new organisation and each individual's place within it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The creation of the new Department added a further layer to the range of complex issues surrounding management/staff relations in recent times, arising not only from implementation of the extensive public service reforms of the 1980's, but also from the simultaneous actions to enhance flexibility by abolishing the narrow career streams which had been a feature of the old Department of Foreign Affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And now we have under way further major changes flowing from the Government's adoption of workplace bargaining and from the Department's pursuit of modernisation through the introduction of Information Technology.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Throughout this process I have encouraged the Department in its renewed focus on corporate identity, greater flexibility and stronger definition of standards of ethics, individual accountability and courtesy, consistent with the tenets of "New Professionalism" embraced by the APS as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Allegations of Corruption</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the Committee Chairman noted in his tabling statement, the Committee in its Inquiry devoted some considerable time in investigating many of the claims made by the so-called "DFAT Reform Group".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Allegations, by a former officer of the Department, of corruption within the Department played a major role in the establishment of the Senate Inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Previous investigations into these allegations by the Auditor General and by the Australian Federal Police had concluded that they had no basis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee arrived at the same conclusion, describing the allegations as "improper, reckless and likely to have damaged the reputations of individuals and to have been contrary to the public interest".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I welcome this exoneration of Departmental officers, and its associated acknowledgment of the integrity of Departmental systems.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I strongly agree with the Committee's recommendation that any further allegations about the Department by the so-called "DFAT Reform Group" should not be subject to further inquiry until "they provide substantive evidence to support the allegations".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our public service disciplinary provisions, are underpinned by principles and values such as natural justice, fairness and equity. The Public Service Commission has stated that in keeping with these principles and values, "vexatious or unsupported allegations against the management and operations of a department should not be inquired into".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I welcome the Committee's balanced comments on the phenomenon of "whistle blowing". My Department's recent experience underlines the need to ensure that in protecting the rights of individuals to speak out, we also afford protection to the victims of false or malicious allegations, as well as to those involved in investigating the allegations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The issue of safeguards for investigators is a particularly serious one. Investigators have been vilified while performing their tasks by leaks to the press and public figures, anonymous pamphlets, abusive phone calls, including to their families, and abuse in the work place.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Minority Report</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, let me say that the minority report attached to the Committee's report, while not unexpected, is nevertheless disappointing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It reflects, at best, only grudging acceptance of the very significant improvements that have been introduced into the Department over the last few years, and documented in the main report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It would appear that some critics are simply not prepared to allow the facts to speak for themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report's thirty-three recommendations are grouped under six headings: Departmental Reorganisation; Allegations by the DFAT Reform Group; Personnel Management Issues; General Management Issues; Conditions of Service Issues; Disciplinary Systems and Standards of Conduct. I have followed this format in responding to the recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RECOMMENDATIONS</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Departmental Reorganisation</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 1</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the Government decides to retain a specialist public relations capacity within DFAT, it should do so in such a way as to maintain a viable core of specialisation within a single branch;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 2</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That branch be given clear and unambiguous objectives related to the undertaking of specific public relations campaigns and activities (Paragraph 3.66).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government concurs with the merits of concentrating core public affairs specific functions within a single branch in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade . The Overseas Information Branch is in the process of developing a set of objectives which relate directly to the aims, goals and priority tasks of the Department as a  whole. Its performance against those objectives will be monitored closely.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Allegations by the DFAT Reform Group</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 3</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No Commonwealth investigative or administrative review agency inquire into any further allegations about DFAT made by Mr Carroll or the DFAT Reform Group unless and until they provide substantive evidence to support the allegations (Paragraph 5.35).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government supports this recommendation. It should be noted, however, that there may be some investigative or review bodies which have no discretion to refuse to investigate a complaint.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Personnel Management Issues</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 4</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DFAT bring together its various staff welfare initiatives into a specific sub-program directly answerable to the appropriate Deputy Secretary position (Paragraph 7.18).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government supports the substance of the Committee's recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A small Welfare and Occupational  Health and Safety (OH&amp;S) unit has already been created, and a new position of Staff Counsellor will shortly be filled. The occupant will be a suitably qualified professional who will provide a confidential counselling service on personal and workplace problems for all Departmental staff and their families both in Canberra and at overseas posts. These positions, together with those of the Family Liaison Officer (FLO), Medical Adviser and Careers Adviser form a network of staff welfare positions which consult closely and meet periodically with the First Assistant Secretary, Corporate Services Division (FAS/CSD) and PA/CSD to review staff welfare policy and issues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 5</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DFAT adapt its Statement of Service publication into a skills register by seeking basic information on postings, educational qualifications and other skills in standard format from all members of its staff and by maintaining that information in a sortable format (Paragraph 7.29).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Statement of Service publication has a different function from that of a skills register. It is a quick reference for obtaining personal and career information on officers. Much of the information currently contained in the publication is not relevant to a skills register and in its current format it would not be possible to interrogate it as one would a data base.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The resources which would have to be devoted to developing and maintaining a new and dedicated skills register which would meet staff and management expectations would be significant.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Much of the information likely to be included on a skills register is readily available in various forms in the Department. In particular, the PERSPECT personnel information system that is used in the Department captures much of this information (e.g. relevant personnel information, placements in the Department, language skills, educational qualifications, training undertaken).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department has decided to conduct a skills audit of all staff in order to identify current and medium term training needs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 6</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In its response to this report, the Government report on the effectiveness of the development diary system with particular regard to whether there is scope for making the essential components of the system mandatory and whether there is scope for extending the system to SES officers (Paragraph 7.34);</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department accepts the case for making the essential components of the system mandatory. The appraisal section of the diary is being re-designed for universal and mandatory use, consistent with the performance appraisal mechanisms established under the agreement between the Government and the PSU of December 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department always intended that the development diary appraisal process should apply to SES officers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the case of heads of mission, appraisal input will be drawn from a wide range of sources, including post clients inside and outside DFAT. The comprehensive annual Post Evaluation Report process will be used as an initial basis for judgements to be made on a HOM's performance against agreed post objectives. Final judgements will be made by the Department's Executive in a moderation process to ensure fair and consistent standards are applied to all HOM's. The post objectives will constitute a performance agreement between each HOM and the Department.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 7</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Completion of the appraiser's self-assessment in DFAT's development diary to be made mandatory with a requirement that it be countersigned by the person being appraised, with provision for that person to comment if he or she wishes, and a requirement for review by the appraiser's supervisor (Paragraph 7.35).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department supports the concept of mandatory upward assessment, but would wish to consult formally with staff before introducing such a system. Existing Public Service wide arrangements do not make formal provision for self appraisal, nor for any form of upward appraisal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 8</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DFAT, OPG and the Department of Finance jointly review the feasibility of allowing at least some officers to receive an allowance and rent their own accommodation instead of residing in government-supplied residential accommodation at posts where it could reasonably be expected that officers do so (paragraph 8.17).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A number of DFAT officers already receive an allowance and rent their own accommodation overseas instead of residing in Government-supplied residential accommodation. This occurs mainly in London and in North American posts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">OPG has expressed the view that, for most countries, Government owned or leased accommodation will remain the most cost-effective means of providing staff accommodation. A copy of a paper prepared by OPG on this issue is attached.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department of Finance has pointed out that a potential difficulty it has with the extension of private leasing arrangements is that it may be cheaper for the Commonwealth, over the long term, to own houses rather than lease them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade nevertheless has explored the feasibility of extending private leasing arrangements. In looking at this issue the Department concluded that it should be confined to countries where:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the local leasing arrangements are similar to those in Australia and officers could be reasonably expected to negotiate leases without any special background knowledge of local conditions;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the leases are written in English and the negotiations carried out in English;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the conclusion of personal leases for foreigners is  normal practice among the diplomatic community in the relevant city;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the laws governing the personal liability of officers in leasing accommodation are comparable to those in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other overseas operating agencies concur with DFAT's approach.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">General Management Issues</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 9</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DFAT account for passport fee revenue in a way that separates the components of the fee which apply to passport production costs, consular services, and the remainder of the fee (Paragraph 8.26).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The costing details provided in the attached Passports Australia Business Plan annually details the cost components of passport production and issue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The problems of precisely stating the costs of consular services are considerable. Consular workload is unpredictable, the majority of our posts have no officers dedicated to consular functions, consular functions are also undertaken by officers of DFAT, DIEA and AUSTRADE overseas and costs can also be incurred by other Commonwealth Agencies (eg Defence in the provision of evacuation aircraft.)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee's recommendation that full transparency of costs be provided is partially met now by the detail contained in the annual Passport's Australia Business Plan. As revised program structures for the Department are introduced and as accrual accounting systems are developed the Committee's interest in a substantial, but not total, identification of Consular costs should be satisfied.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 10</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia have a standard passport with a system of endorsements to certify the position held by or status of the person to whom the passport is issued (Paragraph 8.31).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 11</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There should also be the option of some distinctive endorsement to be embossed on the covers of passports issued to Australian officers posted overseas, especially where such an endorsement might offer operational advantage or increased safety (Paragraph 8.31).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Special passports are recognised by all international states and are used by the majority of international states and this convention affords universal recognition for Australian officials travelling overseas on behalf of the Government. The circumstances whereby security and operational efficiency of officers would be enhanced by the abolition of special passports and introduction of another special "one off" restricted passport category for staff posted overseas, have not been established. The current categories of special passports provide operational flexibility for all overseas travel and posting needs, including areas of specific security concerns, cost effectively. The status of documents proved to be particularly important during the Iraq conflict.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 12</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DFAT comment in detail in its 1992-93 Annual Report on the measures it has taken to improve its records and information-retrieval systems and provide evidence of the success of those measures (Paragraph 8.38).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department accepts this recommendation and details of measures taken to improve records keeping will be included in the 1992-93 Annual Report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 13</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government response to this report outlines the measures taken by DFAT to ensure that its methods of payment of locally engaged staff do not breach or facilitate breaches of taxation law in Australia or overseas (paragraph 8.44).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government understands the Committee's concerns about the Department's responsibilities under Australian Taxation Law in relation to payments to locally employed staff employed at Missions overseas. The Committee is aware that efforts to rectify the problem were "clearly hampered" by contemporaneous change to Australian taxation legislation. Since the report was tabled in late 1992 efforts to improve the situation have continued.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 22 March 1993 the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT), in consultation with the Australian Taxation Office (ATO), issued an Administrative Circular (No. 24/93) on the Australian taxation of Australian resident Locally Engaged Staff (LES). A copy of Administrative  Circular 24/93 is attached.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Administrative Circular 24/93 set out the procedures which DFAT-managed posts must implement to ensure that DFAT meets ATO requirements in relation to the Australian taxation of Australian resident LES notably :</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">LES employed at DFAT managed posts will be required to complete a `Questionnaire' to establish Australian residency and Australian income tax liability; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australian resident LES who are assessed to be liable to pay Australian income tax will be required to complete a `Declaration of Income' form which DFAT will pass to the ATO on an annual basis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These new arrangements are to be applied on a retrospective basis to take in all salaries and wages paid to LES in the 1992-93 financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Procedures established by Administrative Circular 24/93 cover all LES engaged at DFAT managed posts including LES who may be performing all, or some of their duties, on behalf of other Government departments or agencies. The ATO intends to establish similar reporting mechanisms with other overseas operating agencies of Government which manage offices overseas independent of DFAT and employ LES.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In terms of LES who are not considered to be Australian residents (and who are normally citizens of the host country) DFAT will continue to observe local laws which vary widely from country to country. From time to time posts may be requested by host governments to provide details of salaries and conditions payed to LES.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 14</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DFAT, in reporting on the activities of its Evaluation and Audit Section in its 1992-93 Annual Report, comment on the extent to which its internal audit program has been aligned with the audit priorities of the Australian National Audit Office (paragraph 8.58).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government accepts this recommendation and will include relevant material in its 1992-93 Annual Report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 15</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All cases of apparently unauthorised release of information within DFAT's area of responsibility be recorded in the Department's list of leak investigations, including the release of information on individual current or former members of the Department's staff and the release of information other than by DFAT officers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All cases of apparently unauthorised release of information are recorded and investigated, and that record is kept up to date. In some cases the matter is forwarded to the Minister responsible for approval to enlist the services of the AFP to conduct further investigations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government will ensure that all cases under investigation involving apparently unauthorised releases of information within DFAT's area of responsibility are recorded in the schedule, including releases of information other than by DFAT officers which become known to the Department. Cases where information is disclosed without authority relating to individual current or former members of the Department may be reported separately in relation to the work of the Fraud Prevention and Discipline Section consistent with the provisions of the Privacy Act 1988.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Overseas Conditions of Service Issues</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 19</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Responsibility for the setting and administration of overseas conditions of service be transferred from DIR to an independent body within the Industrial Relations Portfolio comprising members drawn from overseas operating agencies, the Department of Finance and the Department of Industrial Relations (Paragraph 10.46).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government does not see it as necessary at this point to pursue the development of an independent bureau as recommended. However, the Government recognises that communication between central agencies and overseas operating agencies can still be improved. Further steps will be taken to meet this objective.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The authority to take decisions on a number of overseas conditions has already been devolved to Overseas Operating Agencies (OOAs), and further items are proposed for  devolution over coming months. All parties recognise that this process will make a substantial contribution to improving the overseas conditions system, with the financial impact of devolution handled as an integral part of the process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">OOAs have been co-ordinating effectively on arrangements for the implementation of devolved conditions to ensure that divergences of approach are minimised.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Consultative Forum on Overseas Conditions, chaired by DIR, has continued to meet at regular intervals. Agencies agree that it would be desirable to strengthen its activities so that it has  more of a decision-making character. The Consultative Forum has a number of working parties set up to address specific issues. Agencies agree that working parties could be more effectively utilised to examine issues and provide recommendations to the Forum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 20</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All overseas operating agencies which do not already have a management-staff consultative body with specific responsibility for overseas conditions should establish one; this might conveniently take the form of a sub-Committee of an established management-staff consultative Committee (Paragraph 10.48);</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government supports effective management-staff consultation. DFAT has for some years been operating a staff-management consultative body under the auspices of the Departmental Consultative Council&mdash;the Overseas Conditions Industrial Democracy Committee, which meets at least four times a year. All staff associations and the Foreign Service Families Association are represented on the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In DIEA, unions have not sought the establishment of a separate consultative arrangement. There is no barrier to overseas conditions matters being raised at the peak consultative body&mdash;the National Consultative Council. Agencies have no difficulty with the proposal that a sub-Committee be formed with specific responsibility for overseas conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other agencies have insufficient staff to necessitate a formal consultative body on overseas conditions alone.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 21</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The anachronistic general entitlement to boarding school fees at any school in the UK or Australia be replaced by an entitlement to assistance with boarding expenses  associated with education at any school provided the officer can justify the need to board a child or children and subject to an upper limit on the Australian Government contribution equivalent to the limit that currently applies in relation to boarding school fees in Australia (Paragraph 10.51).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government agrees with the Committee that the automatic right for children to attend boarding school in the UK is anachronistic and that the reference to the UK in the definition of a "Relevant School" should be removed. The Government remains of the view, however, that officers posted overseas should have the option of either (a) maintaining the family unit by having their children attend school at the post, or (b) maintaining the continuity of the children's Australian education by having them attend school in Australia. This involves an automatic entitlement to send their  children to boarding school in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Determination 149 of 1992&mdash;which empowers Secretaries to approve reimbursement of the cost of children attending boarding school elsewhere than in Australia or the locality of the officer only if circumstances at the post, such as the inadequacy of education facilities, warrant it&mdash;provides the flexibility which agencies require to give effect to the above options and to provide for officers to send their children to boarding schools in other countries where neither of these options is viable. The new provision would enable us to deal positively with situations such as the one Mr Townsend brought to the Committee's attention.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Elimination of the entitlement to education in the UK may require some transitional arrangements for any officers whose children have commenced education in the UK under the existing provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 22</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The right to leave without pay so that a spouse can accompany an officer on posting.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government notes the recommendation and supports the principle that spouses of officers posted overseas should be granted leave without pay in order to accompany the officer on a posting. The Department of Industrial Relations is consulting with other agencies to ensure that amendments to current arrangements can be applied in a manner that promotes the Government's employment policies, and work place objectives, particularly in relation to balancing work and family responsibilities. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has written to the Public Service Commission, ACT Government authorities, the CSIRO and the ANU encouraging a positive approach to granting leave without pay to spouses of officers serving overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The right for a spouse on LWOP to continue to contribute to an Australian Government superannuation scheme</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade wrote to the Minister for Finance on 7 September 1992 about the possibility of spouses who are members of the APS being permitted to continue contributing to the APS superannuation schemes. The Government has this issue under consideration. Several important issues remain to be resolved before the Government can fully respond to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Remission of rent and utilities contributions where an officer overseas is required to maintain a household in Australia as a direct result of a posting</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government supports this recommendation. DIR issued a determination giving effect to this proposal on 25 November 1992. DFAT has subsequently received fifty-nine applications, reinforcing the view that the provision meets a widely-experienced need. Other agencies have also received applications, of which several have been approved.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 23</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DFAT regard as a matter of urgency the negotiation of as many reciprocal employment agreements as possible and give those negotiations a high priority (Paragraph 11.27).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia has entered into bilateral agreements (of treaty status) or arrangements (of less than treaty status) with Britain, Canada, Israel, Sweden, and the United States to facilitate the employment of dependants of diplomatic and  consular personnel of one country assigned to duty in another.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is actively working towards concluding agreements or arrangements with France, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Brazil, Chile, Zimbabwe and Spain.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department's Protocol Branch has provided all posts with guidance on handling proposals for new agreements and encouraged posts to seek to put in place arrangements with their host governments. Inquiries which may result in the conclusion of new arrangements have been made in respect of the Philippines, Denmark, South Africa, Fiji, Venezuela, Greece, Cyprus and Argentina. A number of other countries have indicated an interest in seeking to put in place some form of arrangement. A review of the agreement with the United States is to be undertaken.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 24</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The family component of Overseas Living Allowance be paid directly to spouses (Paragraph 11.27).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The "family component" of OLA could be regarded as comprising part of the loading in part B (i.e. the differential if the officer is accompanied), of some post specific costs in part C being costed at the family rate where applicable, and of child supplement and/or reunion supplement being payable where there are children. In addition to OLA, there are accompanied rates of Difficult Post Allowance (DPA), which could also be regarded as a family component of the overall package. The submission by the Foreign Service Families Association (FSFA) to the Committee referred to "those allowances designated as child or spouse allowances".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government appreciates the concerns of FSFA in putting this proposal forward. However, there are problems associated with the proposal which would dissuade the Government from proceeding with it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The conceptual basis of OLA is of a cost-based allowance system. While OLA is divided into different parts to cover costs which are arrived at differently, the system does not intend to go beyond the translation to the overseas situation of a regimen of normal family expenditures. Indexed disposable salary is augmented to assist with additional expenses associated with living overseas but staff overseas are essentially in the same position as they would be if supporting a family from their salary in Australia. Conceptually, therefore, there would be no more reason for staff overseas to be paid part of the salary and allowance package separately than there would be in Australia to pay part of salary itself to  spouses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, the Government would be reluctant to involve itself in an assessment of whether or not agreement existed between officer and spouse as to how relevant allowances should be paid. In considering how the wishes of staff might best be met in regard to the payment of allowances, the Overseas Finance Directions already give staff the option to have all or part of their salary and allowances paid to a bank account other than their own. For reasons of flexibility, privacy and responsiveness to individual staff wishes, leaving the option with officers and spouses through this mechanism would appear to be preferable to introducing a centralised system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 25</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DFAT ensure that the planning for the proposed York Park office building provide for the Family Liaison Officer and related advisory facilities for officers and spouses to be located in an area of the building that is readily accessible (Paragraph 11.27).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee noted that as the proposed new central office for DFAT was before the Joint Committee on Public Works at the time, it was inappropriate to comment upon it. The building has now been approved and construction on the York Park site is proceeding. The building will incorporate suitable access to the information services for spouses provided by the Family Liaison Officer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 26</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DFAT and the Department of Finance jointly review the possibility of improving cash management in the representation funding system by replacing as large a proportion as possible of the present representation advances with direct payments by DFAT or with reimbursement of expenses as they are incurred (Paragraph 11.44).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government supports this recommendation. In carrying out such a review, DFAT and the Department of Finance would have to take into account a range of considerations relating to overseas circumstances and the administration of posts overseas. The issue of representation funds advances is common to many Overseas Operating Agencies (OOAs). Any proposals for changes which might result from the review would have to be the subject of consultation among all agencies concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 27</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All payments to domestic staff of Australian Government officers posted overseas be made directly by the administrative units at their posts (Paragraph 11.46).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department of Industrial Relations (DIR) devolved responsibility for Household Maintenance and Assistance (HMA) to agencies on 31 December 1992. The Government is prepared to review the methodology for payments under this provision. Following devolution, DFAT intends to conduct a general review of HMA, which would be undertaken in consultation with posts and in coordination with other OOAs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee's recommendation will be an input into consideration of how the system could be streamlined. It is relevant that posts may already pay head of mission (HOM)/head of post (HOP) domestic staff their contracted wages and ancillary payments directly on the clear understanding that such payments are on behalf of the HOM/HOP, not of the Australian Government. The Geneva Convention on Diplomatic Relations makes a clear distinction between private servants employed by diplomatic staff and employees of the sending State. This distinction would need to be retained should the review of officer HMA conclude that direct payments to domestic staff of all Australian Government officers posted overseas would be feasible and desirable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 28</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Departments of Administrative Service and Industrial Relations review the arrangements for the issue of private-plated cars to SES officers with a view to extending the entitlement to government-supplied petrol during periods of leave subject to an increase in the officers' contribution (Paragraph 11.51).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government considers that little would be gained in terms of operating efficiency and equity by changing current arrangements at this time. The current arrangements seek to achieve a balance by recovering (via the officer contribution) costs from individual SES officers reflecting the private benefit aspects in the provision of private plated vehicles. If implemented the proposal could raise significant equity issues given the likely disparities in usage by SES officers of vehicles during recreation leave.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current arrangements, requiring an SES officer authorised to take the vehicle on leave to bear all fuel and any servicing costs, reflect the general practice in  the APS that officers' expenses while on leave are a matter for officers. To endeavour to encompass recovery of notional costs for recreation leave usage within an increased private contribution would be inconsistent with this general approach.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DFAT's guidelines on the use of SES vehicles contain clear instructions on the use of vehicles while on leave, including advice that fuel cards are not to be used while an officer is on recreation leave. Application of these guidelines is subject to the usual audit processes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 29</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australian Government officers and their dependants overseas be prevented from purchasing cars free of duty but be permitted to lease from the Australian Government cars of a reasonable but limited range of makes and styles or to participate in arrangements for the use of government cars for private purposes, subject to a contribution towards the cost of that use (Paragraph 11.64).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A previous DFAT study found that the start-up costs to that Department for a scheme to lease Government-owned cars to officers overseas would be very high. Such a scheme would probably not be feasible at all posts because of the high initial capital costs and the large administrative burden, as well as possible local restrictions, but it may be an option which could usefully be considered at some posts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Relevant agencies will consult further on this recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 30</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Pending a decision on recommendation 29, DFAT should immediately reduce the entitlement of SES or equivalent officers, including heads of mission, to purchase cars free of duty when posted overseas from two to one per posting (Paragraph 11.65).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government agrees with this recommendation. The Department's instructions on SES officers' entitlements to purchase cars free of duty overseas were amended in Administrative Circular no 12/93 of 4 February 1993, a copy of which is attached. SES or equivalent officers, including heads of mission, who exercise their entitlement to an official car for private purposes are only permitted to purchase one personal vehicle under diplomatic privilege per posting, including extended postings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Disciplinary System and Standards of Conduct</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 31</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">High priority be given to amending the Public Service Act to provide for the extension of the standard disciplinary procedures under the Act to heads of diplomatic missions and posts (Paragraph 12.24).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government had recognised the need to extend the disciplinary provisions under the Act to heads of missions and posts (unattached officers) prior to the Committee's recommendation and had already taken action through the Public Service Commission to draft legislative changes. The Public Service Commission is now seeking an opportunity to present these changes to Parliament for approval. These amendments to the Public Service Act will, however, apply only to those unattached officers who were public service officers at the time of their head or mission appointment. DFAT is actively examining the possibility of mirroring the disciplinary provisions under the Act in the terms and conditions of those appointed to unattached positions from outside the public service.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition to the above changes to the Public Service Act, DFAT is examining a further anomaly in the disciplinary provisions of the Public Service Act which raises doubt whether charges can successfully be laid against an attached officer for misconduct while they were unattached and whether charges laid against an unattached officer can be proceeded with if that officer subsequently becomes reattached. Further necessary legislative changes to the Act will be sought through the Public Service Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 32</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Public Service disciplinary system be changed to provide for disciplinary proceedings to be public at least to the extent of the fact that charges have been laid, their nature and the outcome (Paragraph 12.29).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government would be opposed to the publication of such information in a form which would enable the individual officer to be identified. The Department is in consultation with unions represented in DFAT to draw up a revised fraud control charter taking into account the Privacy Act of 1988 which sets parameters for third party disclosure of personal information. Once these consultations are concluded and a revised charter approved  by the Senior Executive, an Administrative Circular will be issued to staff advising of the new charter and drawing the attention of staff to the Public Service Commission's "Guidelines on Official Conduct for Public Servants".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The publication by departments of summary, non-attributable information on disciplinary matters, e.g. the type of infringement, and the sanctions applied, may, however, help to raise the standard of conduct of its officers. Departmental annual reports departments could provide a vehicle for providing such information. Such information would also enable comparisons to be made about the way in which departments respond to similar infringements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 33</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DFAT institute a continuing system designed to ensure that its officers at all levels are familiar with the Guidelines on Official Conduct for Public Servants and supplement those guidelines with material designed to relate the guidelines to its own operating environment, to impress their importance on all its staff, and to make clear to all DFAT officers the importance of consistent application of departmental and public service instructions (Paragraph 12.34).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government endorses this recommendation. The Guidelines on Official Conduct for Public Servants are regularly drawn to the attention of all DFAT staff. A copy of the Guidelines is issued to all heads of mission proceeding on overseas assignment with the instruction that the Guidelines be drawn to the attention of all staff at their post. The Department additionally issues instructions to supplement the Guidelines and to relate them to its operating environment in Australia and overseas. Instructions are issued in the form of Administrative Circulars and manuals. Officers are also regularly reminded of their obligations through periodic newsletters issued by relevant areas of the Department, eg. the Audit Fraud Newsletter issued jointly by the Evaluation and Audit and the Fraud Prevention and Discipline Sections, and through training courses conducted for all officers when joining the Department and proceeding overseas.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to make a few remarks on the government's response to the report by the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration on the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. The response is generally constructive and positive and should be welcomed, but there are a few points in it that I would like to quibble about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The response to recommendations 1 and 2 on the overseas information branch avoids any mention of the committee's concern about the place of specialist public affairs officers in the department. This is part of a broader concern about the place of specialists generally in the Australian Public Service which has arisen in other inquiries of the committee. We did not feel qualified to get into the detail of how DFAT should be structured, but we were concerned that, if DFAT decided to keep a specialist function, it should be managed as such and the advantages of specialisation not lost in a generalist culture. I would again commend that concern to the minister. The responses on staff appraisal are very positive, and in fact are relevant to the committee's current inquiry into performance pay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's response to recommendations 10 and 11 on standard passports I think is disappointing. The committee recommended that there be a standard passport, with a system of endorsements to certify the position or status held by the person to whom the passport is issued and to allow for some distinctive endorsement to be embossed on the covers of passports issued to Australian officers posted overseas, especially where such an endorsement might offer operational advantage or increased safety. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has come back and said that it cannot see the need for this and that the circumstances have not been established for such a change. I have some difficulty understanding what is being stated in the government's response. The general tenor seems to be negative. I would like to reiterate the committee's view. I ask for a re-reading of the recommendation that there be a standard system, but allowing for the special circumstances of officers posted overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recommendation 19 relates to overseas conditions of service issues. We recommended that an independent body within the industrial relations portfolio but separate from the Department of Industrial Relations deal with overseas conditions of service. The response says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government does not see it as necessary at this point to pursue the development of an independent bureau as recommended.</PARA>
<PARA>I still believe strongly that it would be preferable to move to an independent body as we suggested. Once again, I would ask that that matter be reconsidered rather than just state that it is not necessary at this point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to refer briefly to recommendation 22. We suggested that the government expedite the consideration of the proposals for a right to leave without pay so that a spouse can accompany an officer on a posting. Our recommendation also related to a couple of consequential matters about spouses' rights. The government in its response noted the recommendation and supported the principle that spouses of officers posted overseas should be granted leave without pay in order to accompany the officer on a posting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recall that the government had already acknowledged the principle of the matter. We were able to point to the fact that some agencies were not cooperating with that principle and were denying the right of a spouse to leave without pay for that purpose. I am rather disappointed to find that we still have a situation where the Department of Industrial Relations is merely consulting with other agencies about this matter. I think it is something that should be treated more urgently in order to ensure that the balancing of work and family responsibilities of officers from both foreign affairs and other areas of the Australian government can be provided for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recommendations 26 and 27 relate to improving cash management in the representation funding system at posts by replacing as large a proportion as possible of the present representation advances with direct payments by DFAT or with reimbursement of expenses as they are incurred. The response says that the government supports this recommendation. But the payments to domestic staff are of more concern to me. Our recommendations were based on evidence that the existing management systems were open to abuse and that they could be tightened relatively easily without much expense. Although the amounts involved might not be large in this case, it is still most undesirable to leave obvious gaps in financial management systems. I hope that the consultation and consideration proposed in these responses proceed quickly to a positive conclusion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recommendation 28 related to the arrangements concerning private plated cars driven by SES officers and government supplied petrol during periods of leave. Once again, I am disappointed at the negative response on this matter because I think that again was a problem that should have been dealt with in the way the committee suggested. The government's response on that matter is not convincing to me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is pleasing to see that the entitlement of SES or equivalent officers, including heads of mission, to purchase cars free of duty when posted overseas is being reduced from two cars per posting to one, as the committee recommended. Recommendation 31 noted that there needs to be more standard disciplinary procedures and that they be extended to heads of diplomatic missions and posts. It appears from the government response that the matter is being dealt with rather slowly. Given that we reported on this matter last December, it should be dealt with more expeditiously than is apparent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are some of the comments that I have been able to put together from a brief reading of the report.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am quite happy to talk about the minority report. The inquiry was instituted after wide ranging public expressions of concern as to matters within the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Those concerns included leaks of highly security classified documents over a continuing time in such circumstances where it seemed that they were coming from different sources and in such ways that were highly embarrassing to this country. As a result of that continuing situation, the matter was brought to the attention of the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) who, consistent with the somewhat complacent response that we find in the department's reply to the committee, also dismissed it as a matter of little concern.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will remind the Senate of the sort of leaks involved. On 27 May 1991, a leak revealed DFAT speculation about the role of Singapore in giving military backing to the present military dominated regime in Burma. That is clearly embarrassing to Australia and has the potential to undermine trust in Australia by the government of Singapore and other governments in the region. A leak on 5 February 1992 revealed that DFAT considered with other ASEAN foreign ministers that they did not take seriously the views of the Philippines foreign minister, Raul Manglapus, which we believe is something seriously embarrassing to Australia. There are numerous examples. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I've, of course, asked for a full report and I guess the usual suspects will be rounded up&mdash;with the usual results.</PARA>
<PARA>This parliament took those issues more seriously than the minister. At least this inquiry was able to look in some detail at the issue of those continuing leaks. Sadly, however, the source of the many dozens of leaks has never been discovered. Although we have been assured that departmental security has been improved, on the evidence that was put before the committee&mdash;I was an observer in most of that committee's deliberations&mdash;I did not see how they had been significantly improved. That is just one aspect of the inquiry. </PARA>

It was alleging corruption within the department. The opposition is of the view that the parliament should take that matter up. It was again being dismissed by the minister. I am pleased to say that the committee could not find evidence to support those allegations and said so quite clearly and unambiguously in its report; therefore, I believe the committee performed a worthwhile public service in doing so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question of the inconsistency in the way the department pursued certain diplomatic officers in relation to breaches of regulations concerning the purchase of cars overseas was also put before the committee. Former ambassador Burke, the former Labor Premier of Western Australia, was protected in his diplomatic office by Senator Evans even though he breached the regulations. Ultimately the parliament found that out, but only after exhaustive inquiries and pressures upon the minister. In relation to Mr Burke's breaches, we found that the course of action taken by the department was, in effect, to send officers to Dublin to find ways in which the breach could be overcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is in contrast to another former ambassador, Malcolm Dan, about whom there were similar allegations made. In that instance, the department sent three officers to Chile to find ways that evidence could be gathered and he could be charged and convicted. The contrast was dramatic and worrying. This was clearly brought out before the committee's hearings. Senator Evans has never given a satisfactory explanation to this parliament as to why one ambassador might be treated one way and another so differently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It very reasonably raises concerns in the public mind as to the way in which this department was being administered under Senator Evans. Of course, this matter was dismissed by him because it is one of those difficult and uncomfortable personnel aspects that could in some way divert him from what he sees as his more important tasks in the ministry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it was not just at that level. We were concerned about statements of low morale in the department. It was interesting that the trade organisations within the department came to the committee and spoke about low morale. In the few minutes that I have had the report, I have noticed that that matter has been dismissed as resulting from the significant changes that are occurring in the department. But the opposition is of the belief that the minister should accept responsibility for trying to improve morale in the department, rather than dismissing it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At least the committee was able to explore some of the areas of concern expressed by officials&mdash;concerns in relation to the overseas living allowance and other industrial relations matters. Honourable senators might remember that it was under this Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Evans, that the first industrial action was taken by officers of the department. Of course, he blamed the Department of Industrial Relations because he does not accept responsibility for anything. That matter was put to the committee and explored by it. The committee was able to make constructive recommendations in relation to OLA and other serious issues, such as the lack of reward for specialisation and concerns in relation to families in postings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are matters that really the department should have an expectation would be pursued by the minister&mdash;but they were not because the minister is disinterested in those matters. At least this parliament was prepared to take them up and make some positive recommendations and I think that ought to be recognised. I see that although the secretary has undertaken a review of the department's corporate plan, most of the other issues that were raised by the committee in a very serious way have been more or less dismissed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I guess the minister would say that he is entitled to dismiss those issues because, in the light of the recent budget that strikes at the poor in this country to the degree that it does, DFAT officers should not complain when the minister is responsible for the expenditure of $200 million of taxpayers' money on a new building for them. That might be his attitude to their very serious and reasonable concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Be that as it may, the opposition will continue to take an interest in the department. We will continue to listen to the concerns that are expressed by departmental officers. We will continue to address such serious issues as the proper allocation of resources between the trade and political aspects of Foreign Affairs, which has not been the case in the past. We will act in a way that recognises and publicly rewards those public servants within DFAT that serve this government and this country so well, often in very difficult circumstances. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was a member of the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration that produced this report. I think for all committee members, under Senator Coates's excellent chairmanship&mdash;and also with the addition of my leader, Senator Hill, and the foreign affairs spokesmen for the Democrats, Senator Bourne, who sat in on most of the hearings&mdash;it was certainly a wide ranging inquiry. It was a complex inquiry for those of us who had our first look inside the halls of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, both from an organisational point of view and indeed, on one occasion, on a physical visit to the building which, of course, will become redundant to the requirements of DFAT in a few years time when Gareth's gazebo is completed at York Park. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On a very quick reading of the government's response to this committee report, I have the same sort of feeling that has been expressed by my leader Senator Hill, and in probably slightly less critical terms by Senator Coates. Our criticisms seem to be in line with many of the responses we got from the senior management of DFAT while we were taking evidence. They were: we do not really think we should be looked into; everything is okay; there are a few problems but we are trying to fix them up; any morale problem&mdash;as Senator Hill said&mdash;was caused by the changes and by public sector reform.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I got the overwhelming feeling throughout the entire quite lengthy inquiry that everything was okay and whenever there was what seemed be a very serious problem to solve, DFAT had a self-healing mechanism that quickly covered up the crack and put plaster in it. It is very hard to pin that fact down, but I suggest it is best summed up by the words `the more things change, the more they stay the same'. I suspect that is the case with DFAT. I am not particularly happy with the government's response even though it has agreed to some of the recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the issues that I think is very important in a agency like DFAT, which has a policy and political role in large measure, except for the trade aspects of the department, is that it is probably very hard to keep people focused on the target. It is an unusual organisational challenge to keep morale high, to keep people focused and to reward excellence, so promotions and industrial relations problems do come to the surface quite regularly. As Senator Hill said, under the current minister, Senator Gareth Evans, we have had an enormous number of leaks; we have had industrial trouble and problems that have not occurred there before. We can all speculate as the reasons for that. We can only hope, however, that the Senate committee's inquiry and the report will, in some small way, assist in overcoming those problems. I am dubious as to whether that will take place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also dubious about whether or not shifting out of the old DFAT building&mdash;I think staff affectionately call it the Kremlin&mdash;across to the $200 million Gareth's gazebo building at York Park will do much to improve morale. One of the sad things about that proposal&mdash;we will probably hear a lot about this in the next couple of years, and I am sure it will not make the Minister for Foreign Affairs very happy&mdash;is that there is an overcrowding problem at the Kremlin, but the building at York Park is being built on a site which allows for absolutely no future expansion and which will house almost the identical number of people as are housed in the old building. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the Department of Foreign Affairs has made a fundamentally stupid property decision. In the long run&mdash;even though people will have a good, happy feeling when they move into the new building and get their new desks and chairs, if the department can actually afford to carpet the place&mdash;the morale problems will not be assisted by what should have otherwise been a positive move. The decision making processes within the department are controlled by a group of people with an unusual set of incentives. I say no more than that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very hard to solve those industrial relations problems and those morale problems when the promotion and industrial relations systems within the department are so tightly controlled and so bureaucratic. Again, they are tightly controlled by a small clique of people within that department. That is a fundamental problem which was very hard for our committee to address, even though I think all members of our committee regarded it as real. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was very surprised to see that the Public Sector Union had a full time officer on the full time payroll of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. To me that was an unusual arrangement. I still have grave reservations about the taxpayer funding a full time trade union shop steward on the floor of a government department. I am sure many taxpayers in Australia would respect the right of a trade union to organise public service officers and to represent their interests, but I also think many taxpayers would be very suspect about the taxpayer paying the salary of that shop steward within the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. I doubt whether workplace relations within the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade can be progressed and improved by having the public sector representative on the payroll of the management of DFAT. That is the problem I think we have to face. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude my remarks by saying that I am disappointed by  the government's response. I was disappointed generally with the whole way in which our inquiry was approached within DFAT. In many ways it was a let down to the very many highly professional, dedicated people&mdash;many of whom are friends of mine&mdash;who work within the Department of Foreign Affairs in the very best interests of Australia's international and national interests. As Senator Robert Hill said earlier, the DFAT staff dedicate themselves, under trying industrial workplace conditions, to the job of furthering Australia's interests&mdash;a job that goes unrecognised by many Australians. </PARA>

The Kimberley area and Shark Bay World Heritage area in Western Australia have been mentioned to the committee specifically in this context.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is tough; it has been a depressing first half of the year. It is interesting to draw a comparison with the report on DFAT which was tabled here in December 1992. That is a very complex report which goes into all of the complex issues in relation to the operations and management of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. We have a detailed response, even though not a good response, here in August 1993 from the department. I am sure the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is at least as busy as the departments and the ministers responsible for this very important report on the Australian environment and tourism. This report was tabled many months before the report on DFAT, yet here we are with a letter from the minister, Michael Lee, saying that he hopes the government might get some sort of response together before we go home for Christmas.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I present the government's response to the report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade entitled `Stockholding and Sustainability in the Australian Defence Force'. I seek leave to have the document and a tabling statement incorporated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The response read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Defence stockholdings are a vital component of our capacity to sustain ADF operations for the defence of Australia. Defence policy is to maintain sufficient stock levels for all appropriate force elements to meet credible contingencies&mdash;low and escalated low level conflict, which remain our focus in accordance with approved strategic guidance. Collectively, our stocks of missiles, munitions, spare parts and other consumable combat equipment represent an investment in the order of several billion dollars. Hence a review of the matter by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs Defence and Trade was appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At present there is no identifiable military threat to Australia. However, there are many uncertainties in our strategic outlook. Defence preparedness to meet any possible threat in the shorter term needs to be balanced against the need for continuing development of the force structure, specialist skills and infrastructure to meet the uncertainties of the medium to longer term.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The determination of ADF sustainability and hence stockholding requirements is a complex matter. The nature, scope and duration of a possible contingency for the defence of Australia are unclear and there is no simple means of determining the stocks of ammunition, missiles, spare parts and other consumable stores which the ADF might require in these circumstances. Because of this, we must depend on assumptions and judgements by our Defence planners based on Government approved strategic and financial guidance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Defence continues to review its sustainability and stockholding requirements. Major studies were undertaken during 1992 to consider the sustainability and stockholding judgements which have been made in the past and it was assessed that the present arrangements are appropriate to our current strategic circumstances and outlook.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Joint Committee has placed considerable emphasis on the use of stockholding to assure sustainability. The holding of large reserve stocks of fuel, missiles, ammunition, spare parts and other consumable stores is expensive and this fact must be considered along with all other factors in determining appropriate levels of stockholdings. Government policy is to balance the maintenance of reserve stocks with force development consistent with strategic and financial guidance. Also, government-to-government agreements and arrangements with industry, have been developed to ensure stockholdings should our strategic circumstances deteriorate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given the unlikely requirement for the ADF to have to mount operations for the defence of Australia in the shorter term, larger Government outlays on reserve stocks are inappropriate. The situation is kept under review, so as to assure national security.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the introduction to its Report, the Joint Committee criticised Defence for withholding some classified information on stockholdings. Detailed information on the preparedness of individual components of the ADF, including stocks of missiles, ammunition and spares, is highly-classified. Officers of the ADF and my Department are bound to protect classified matter and hence they were acting entirely properly in withholding these details during the public hearings. The Committee was informed about some classified information during an in camera hearing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee's conclusions appear to reflect some misunderstanding of Government policy on Defence preparedness objectives, which limits the value of some of the recommendations made in the Report. Current approved strategic guidance specifically provides that "The planning and conduct of ADF operations, and the development of its force structure, must comprehend all the levels of conflict of which the adversary is capable." (Australia's Strategic Planning in the 1990s, paragraph 4.7.)  ADF preparedness takes into account all levels of credible conflict, which in the present circumstances includes low and escalated low level contingencies for the defence of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 4, concerning Foreign Military Sales contracts, and Recommendations 10 and 11, concerning the Defence National Storage and Distribution Centre, appear based on considerations which are difficult to relate to Defence and other submissions presented to the Committee. Recommendation 12, concerning Warehousing Strategy, is based on information (provided at Appendix 4 to the Report) which had not previously been placed on the public record. Hence, Defence was unable to comment comprehensively on these issues before the Committee's Report was tabled. This was unfortunate as the Committee's deliberations might have been enhanced had they been able to consider the countervailing Defence viewpoints.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 1</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that Defence take immediate action to procure the reserve stock and unit equipment components necessary to meet capability criteria.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Agreed in principle.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Defence policy is to maintain sufficient stock levels for all appropriate force elements to meet credible contingencies. The level of stock actually required is a matter for judgement given the lack of an identifiable threat. Judgements on readiness levels for each force element are reviewed annually as are the consequent judgements on reserve stocks. Defence is conducting detailed Sustainability and Stockholding studies to enable the adequacy of judgements on reserve stocks to be reviewed. The degree of immediacy recommended by the Committee does not appear warranted in the present benign strategic climate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 2</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that judgements be applied in determining activity levels and usage rates appropriate to the highest level of credible threat, and that the policies be developed without further delay.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Agreed</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As indicated in the covering statement, Defence planning does take into account all levels of credible contingencies which in the present strategic circumstances includes low and escalated low level conflict. Action is continuing to determine activity levels and usage rates, but the difficulty of quantifying them must be recognised, in view of the need for many broad judgements and assumptions, in the absence of an identifiable threat.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 3</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that separate provision be made for a range of United Nations commitments which would be acceptable to and agreed by the Government and that funding be provided as an extension of the Defence budget.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not Agreed</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The wide range of ADF options available for Government to contribute to United Nations commitments invites consideration of a large and diverse range of stocks to achieve the Committee's objective. In the present financial climate, it would be difficult to allocate sufficient priority to provide the necessary additional funding. It is also not necessary. The present arrangement of using ADF reserve stocks to outfit forces committed to UN operations is effective and has a minimal impact on Defence preparedness because replacement stocks are acquired where necessary during the course of the UN commitment. Estimates for replacement stocks are included in costings for supplementation by Government of the Defence Budget.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 4</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that commercial and Foreign Military Sales contracts within capital equipment projects include specific clauses which permit the return for credit of support spares identified as surplus to requirements within five years of delivery into service of the new capital equipment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not Agreed</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no evidence to support an argument that frequent or systemic surpluses are generated, as a consequence of excessive initial support provisioning funded by major capital projects, which would warrant inclusion of contractual clauses to deal with such infrequent arisings. Evidence to the Committee did not imply that initial support procurements result in any significant surplus, rather, the Department noted that "judgements are made . . . as priorities are assessed and resources allocated to sustaining and improving the support base initially set up by the project." (Defence Submission Page 34).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Negotiation of clauses recommended by the Committee will certainly prove difficult to achieve with contractors, and may incur a cost premium to the Commonwealth, demanded by the contractor to cover his contingent liability arising from having to accept any unwanted spares. Contractors could incur costs as a result of being obliged to accept unwanted spares because:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the progress of technology over time may cause the spares to be of no interest to other customers;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">many major acquisitions for the ADF involve, at least in part, unique equipment or equipment modifications for local conditions. Surplus spares may thus also not have a ready market elsewhere; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the contractors would bear administrative costs for the return of unwanted spares, as well as freight costs, costs of disposal and provision of storage facilities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 5</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that Defence arrange for the development within supply systems redevelopment projects of a system to actively monitor production and supply leadtimes for combat oriented and other important stock items.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Agreed in Principle.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The importance of leadtimes in determining stockholding levels is recognised and indeed is fundamental to the entire process. Leadtimes are presently able to be reviewed as part of the automated provisioning review process for operating stocks, but it is accepted that current systems do not react automatically to variations in leadtimes. SSRP does possess the capability to flag specific items such as `combat oriented and other stock items', and a system to monitor their associated leadtimes could be developed. For active inventory items sufficient data may be available from current systems to support such a facility. However, for low usage items not generating regular procurements the regular monitoring of production schedules would require dedicated additional effort. The costs and benefits of implementing such a system will require further examination and will drive the funding priority to be attached to it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 6</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that Defence examine objectively alternative logistics support arrangements including new supply sources, indigenous production and the maintenance of strategic reserves in order to reduce the level of dependence on government to government agreements as a single supply source.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Agreed in part</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Defence already regularly examines its logistics support arrangements to ensure they remain effective. Consistent with the policy of self-reliance, Defence continually seeks Australian Industry sources of supply, but acknowledges that some reliance on foreign sources is unavoidable. In respect of foreign sourced equipment, a government to government agreement is seen as the best assurance that support will continue in foreseeable circumstances. In those cases where Defence equipment can be obtained only from overseas, there is usually little or no practical scope for any diversity of suppliers of specific items, e.g. missiles or spare parts, after an initial capital equipment procurement decision has been made. Strategic reserves of such items are maintained in Australia at levels which reflect judgements based on the prevailing strategic circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 7</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that in regard to long lead items, Defence examine alternative supply arrangements, including new sources of supply, indigenous production and the maintenance of strategic reserves.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Agreed in principle</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As indicated in the response to Recommendation 6, many of the foreign sourced long lead items, including missiles, in service with the ADF are produced only by a single supplier or within a single nation, usually for economies of scale in production. Having selected a parent equipment, the ADF is generally committed to relying on the sole supplier. The maintenance of reserve stocks and government-to-government agreements provides insurance for assured supply. The size of reserve stocks is reviewed regularly to ensure that it remains appropriate to our strategic circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 8</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that within the development of Australian Defence Force preparedness and stockholding policies, Defence address the mix of resources, the strategic location of stocks, the distribution needs of the Australian Defence Force and the likely effects of threat levels on the continued responsiveness of supply sources and civil infrastructure arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Agreed in Principle.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current approach to preparedness development and mobilisation planning, which encompasses stockholding policy development, does comprehend the mix of resources, the location of stocks and distribution requirements. As stated in Defence's Supplementary Submission No 4, transportation effects are already taken into account for operating stocks. As further progress is made in defining the requirement for credible contingencies, the issues raised in this recommendation will be extended to reserve stockholding and indeed to all resources required for mobilisation at that level of conflict.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As also noted in the Supplementary Submission, most of the deficiencies in transportation arrangements identified in the evidence from which this recommendation was drawn relate to more substantial conflict. While some action is being taken to progress this matter (see response to Recommendation 9), work on the requirements for more substantial conflict must take a low priority until requirements for credible conflict have been met.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 9</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that Defence take immediate action to initiate Defence Power legislation and to develop civil transport infrastructure and industry support arrangements which are responsive to all levels of national emergency.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not Agreed</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is important that timely and appropriate access to industry and infrastructure support be assured for all levels of national emergency. While arrangements, including legislation if required, need to be in place in advance for those contingencies which might arise in the shorter term, it is not believed that additional legislation for more substantial conflict is needed at this time. Rather, Defence needs to be aware of the legislative steps that would be required.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In consultation with the Department of Transport and Communications as well as with industry, Defence has begun to examine the requirement for regulations which might be needed for access to appropriate transportation support at any level of conflict. This action represents a progression from the current range of Memorandums of Understanding (MOU) which have proved effective in meeting Defence's requirement for responsive access to civil transportation for likely operational tasks, eg the Somalia commitment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to industry support more generally, the development of appropriate relationships and mechanisms will be considered in the follow-up to the November 1992 Report on Defence Policy and Industry, which was prepared under direction of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Defence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 10</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the Defence National Storage and Distribution Centre proposal be cancelled.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not Agreed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">See response to Recommendation 11.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 11</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the existing smaller and more reactive wholesale warehouse facilities be retained.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not Agreed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Defence National Storage and Distribution Centre (DNSDC) is a significant warehousing activity which is central to the effectiveness of Defence's endorsed approach to the supply function. While offering substantial savings, its main focus is on more effective support of the ADF. This will be achieved through the elimination of an entire level of stockholding for Air Force, as well as through the replacement of relatively inadequate and inefficient facilities across the ADF.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report overstates the new Defence warehousing strategy's effect on stock vulnerability. Dispersion arrangements for Army and Navy essentially will not alter at all. Air Force's significant levels of dispersion will be retained, albeit on a different basis&mdash;ie by weapon system rather than by commodity. The more modern facilities at the DNSDC and at the user level will be less vulnerable to natural disasters such as fire. There will also be little change to risk levels from military action.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It should be noted that optimum efficiency in warehousing facilities has less to do with their physical size than their rate of transactions. While the DNSDC's storage requirement is large due to the nature of military stores, the transaction rate will be relatively small. For example, it will be less than half that of K Mart's new facility at Hopper's Crossing Vic.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 12</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that Supply Systems Redevelopment Project and Defence Logistic Redevelopment Project staff jointly investigate and report on the cost effectiveness of installing proved automated warehouse systems and equipment within base and regional warehouses. The potential to achieve improved responsiveness and manpower savings in warehouse operations should be given equal emphasis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not Agreed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The cost effectiveness and appropriateness of the SSRP and DLRP approaches has been the subject of extensive Departmental consideration. The level of warehousing technology selected for the DNSDC and the regional warehousing upgrade programs has resulted from those considerations. The selected level of warehousing technology is considered to be the most cost effective for the type of inventory stored at these locations. Modern automated warehousing technology will in fact be introduced, but only where the volume of transactions justifies it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The appropriateness of the chosen approach will of course be validated in the project's implementation, but a further investigation into the selected level of warehousing technology is not considered warranted at this time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 13</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that no Australian Government should agree to the Australian Defence Force participating in United Nations operations without uninhibited access to agreed Australian Defence Force weapons and equipment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Agreed</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 14</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that, in the event of weapons and equipment being withheld from Australian Defence Force personnel participating in United Nations commitments, without agreement, the units should be withdrawn.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Agreed in part</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Units deployed on UN operations are manned and equipped according to the role that they are given. Although the withholding of some stores by Moroccan authorities threatened the ability of the Australian contingent to MINURSO to perform its role, adequate alternative arrangements were made to allow it to complete its assigned mission without seriously affecting the capability and safety of the troops involved. In such instances, it is not considered to be sufficient reason to withdraw ADF personnel merely to make a point to intransigent authorities. Withdrawal of ADF personnel on apparently minor issues could be perceived by the UN as a lack of resolve, and would threaten Australia's credibility within the international community. However, where a unit's ability to achieve its mission is jeopardised or the safety of troops is compromised, then withdrawal from a mission may be warranted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 15</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that Defence take immediate action to increase training stocks, without waiting to complete the preparedness and stockholding policies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not agreed</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In Australia's current strategic circumstances only those force elements, which are at very short notice to respond to defence contingencies, need to maintain high levels of readiness (which includes combat proficiency with missiles). The present assessment is that all ADF units are able to achieve appropriate levels of training with the existing allocation of training stocks of missiles. Defence planning provides for additional training stocks of missiles to be allocated to units if they are required to work up to higher levels of readiness in preparation for combat operations.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report into stockholding and sustainability in the Australian Defence Force was tabled by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade in December last year. It relates to the preparedness of the Australian Defence Force: stockholding relates to the equipment, the munitions and ammunition held by the Defence Force; and sustainability relates to the ability to supply the defence forces when they get into combat and are using expendable stores.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It involves the ability both to train human replacements for casualties who are killed or wounded and to provide the munitions and the ammunition to keep the defence forces in operation. In the very first sentence of his response, the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Defence stockholdings are a vital component of our capacity to sustain ADF operations for the defence of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>That is very true. The great tragedy, and the reason why the defence committee moved to look at this matter, is that the Australian defence forces essentially have no sustainability at all. I will develop that argument later on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make a general comment before I start to discuss the minister's response to this. I draw the attention of the Senate to the comments of the chairman of the defence committee, Mr E. J. Lindsay, in the foreword to the report. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Notwithstanding the fact that the Minister for Defence had referred the matter of stockholding policies to the Committee, the inquiry was constantly frustrated by the unwillingness of Defence to provide answers to the questions posed by the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Several issues were canvassed at the first public hearing on 25 May 1992. As the inquiry progressed the Committee pursued some specific issues in greater detail. The transcripts of evidence taken at the public hearings demonstrate that Defence merely reiterated at subsequent hearings the information provided at the first public hearing. The transcripts also illustrate the difficulty experienced by the Committee in eliciting answers from the witnesses. Without access to information, the Committee cannot form judgments on the adequacy of policies.</PARA>
<PARA>I have served on committees ever since I have been in this Senate. I was the longest serving member of the defence committee; I served on it for 10 years. I was the longest serving deputy chairman; I held that position for eight or nine years. I have never experienced the obstruction from the Department of Defence that we experienced at that committee inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can think of two other occasions when I have got inquiries up before the committee: one was on the resignation rates, when people were leaving the Defence Force at a very high rate; the other was on the management of the ADF. On both occasions, the Minister for Defence and the Department of Defence were resolutely opposed to the defence committee inquiring into those matters. But once the parliament accepted that they were the topics for inquiry, the Department of Defence cooperated with all its witnesses to the fullest extent possible. I have no criticism at all of the conduct of the department on those occasions. But for reasons that I simply do not believe, in this inquiry Defence never cooperated with us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On page 2 of the minister's response, he notes the committee experienced difficulties in this regard. He blamed the committee for wishing to pry into matters which were of great secrecy, such as the holding of missile stocks and all the rest of it. With the greatest of respect to the minister, he is dissembling there. The committee has a sense of responsibility. We had no intention of laying out in public what the stockholdings were on sensitive issues. But it happens to be a fact of life that there is very little secrecy in this area. Any of our potential enemies know what our stockholdings are, for the simple reason that in the countries from which we buy them&mdash;and the principal country here is the United States&mdash;the sale orders are fully listed on congressional records or other public documents. The matter of secrecy cannot be sustained at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We offered Defence the opportunity to tell us in in camera briefings. Again, we got no further than we got in public hearings. It is simply nonsense to say that security was what prevented us from being informed. If that was so, the minister should never have given us the remit to inquire into stockholding in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suspect that some of the members of the committee had more accurate information on the level of missile stocks and other sensitive information than the senior uniformed officers from the Department of Defence, who were the two principal witnesses. We cannot very well inquire of a witness and use the committee as a platform to put information on the public record. It is properly a matter for the witnesses to put information on the public record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the governments's response to the recommendations made by the committee. The central theme is the old theme that we always have from this government; that Australia has no discernible military threat facing it today and therefore there is no point in getting worried about the state of defence in this country. It is a theme that is mentioned in the second paragraph of the minister's response. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At present there is no identifiable military threat to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>Everything flows on from there. The next point the minister makes is that the determination of the stockholding required by the Australian Defence Force is a very complex matter. I agree with that completely. But the government is prepared to let the matter end at that point and say, `It is all too difficult. There's nothing we can do about it'. I would say that it is very difficult; it is very complex. But there is a lot we can do about it. What we do about it certainly involves some degree of risk; it certainly involves quite a degree of expenditure. But the matter has to be dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We cannot go on with a Defence Force which simply does not have the munitions, particularly the precision guided munitions, that are needed to be involved in a combat situation. We simply cannot defend a country as vast as Australia with the very low numbers of personnel we have in the Defence Force without using high technology weapon systems, quite apart from the fact that our opponents will be equipped with them, particularly in the post-Cold War era when there is a plethora of high technology equipment available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once upon a time, at the height of the Cold War, the Soviets and the United States were very careful in selling high technology equipment to Third World countries. It is a well known fact that while NATO and Australia enjoyed a special status with the United States, there was equipment the United States would not supply to them; they kept it for their own use. The level of equipment that was available to Third World countries was considerably removed from what was available to that second tier that went to the NATO group countries and to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Cold War has ended and we now have the situation where the Soviets are prepared to sell their very latest technology at very low prices simply to get money. This means that unsophisticated Third World countries now have access to the highest level of technology. Some of the Russian technology is as good as or better than technology available to the Western world. In the air-to-air missile field of the infra-red missiles, the short range missile the Western world uses is the AIM9L or M, which is an infra-red guided weapon with a range of five to seven nautical miles. The equivalent Russian missile has a seeker with a 180 degree head on it. The American Sidewinder has a much smaller aperture for visions, so its target acquisition capability is very much less. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The matter of complexity has got to be dealt with. We are dealing with missiles that commonly cost of the order of $1 million each. Many years ago, the Harpoon&mdash;which is a missile we use from submarine platforms, surface ships and air launch platforms like the FA18 or the F111&mdash;was costing over $1 million. I do not know what the contemporary price of a Harpoon is; it may well be $2 million to us, with the erosion that has taken place in the value of the Australian dollar. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not the case, as the minister argues, that we have logistic agreements, government to government agreements, memorandums of understanding which provide that in an emergency we can draw on another country for these supplies. The politics of the world have changed considerably with the ending of the Cold War. It is quite conceivable that our principal country of supply, the United States, could find itself in a political, as opposed to a military, conflict of interests vis-a-vis a country that might be threatening Australia. In that circumstance, there is no guarantee that we could draw on American logistic supplies, because at the end of the day there is no way legally of enforcing these agreements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing is that, increasingly, with high technology weapons systems, instead of having a continuous production line, as existed with simpler munitions in the past, production is now in a block system. It runs for 12 months, 18 months, maybe 36 months, but it is a finite period where the maximum number of munitions they have orders for are produced as rapidly as possible to minimise overheads and keep the unit costs down. Once that is finished, the line is closed and we cannot get any more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That leads to the conclusion that the present policy is not tenable in a serious way. The solutions for Australia were put forward in the committee's report: first of all, buying more initially and holding stocks within the country; secondly, looking at alternative countries of supply&mdash;whether we can get missiles and things like that from European or, in the post-Cold War era, even from Soviet sources. That is easily said but it is not so easily done. Missiles are integrated into a fire control system and the whole of the electronic weapons system of the platform, whether it is a ship, a submarine or an aircraft. With an infra-red weapon such as an air-to-air missile, one cannot simply put a French or Soviet missile on without changing the electronic fit of the aircraft and then proving it up through a qualification period. So the use of alternative supplies is very restricted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third avenue that has to be explored is production of our own munitions to as extensive a degree as possible. That is certainly an expensive program, but there are some advantages in it. One advantage not generally appreciated is that, even though we buy from the Americans or the French or the British a missile system or a particular piece of kit which is supposed to do such and such, we never know what we get. We never know whether we get exactly the same missile as the Americans are using in the USAF or the USN. It may look the same; it may be stencilled the same; but particularly with respect to electronic countermeasures and the guidance system within it, we simply do not know, and we are forbidden under reverse engineering agreements from pulling it to bits and finding out whether it is the same. In fact, even if we did do that, we probably would not know because we do not have access to the missiles that are going to the American air force, the French air force, or whatever it might be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The consequence of all this is that we have to put more money into defence. It is as simple as that. This government has been progressively removing support for defence in this country. We have seen numbers cut year after year. We have seen the defence vote cut year after year. In the budget this week, we saw another $273 million cut out of the defence vote. Because of these cuts that have progressively taken place, the defence forces have kept on year after year trying to maintain their capabilities, trying not to get rid of any more personnel than they have to. As a consequence, they have not had the money to put into building up the stocks that will enable them to sustain the Australian defence forces if they are ever required to be used. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The position is so bad that the Australian defence forces simply could not operate in a situation where there was armed conflict for this country and where we had an active opponent against us for more than a matter of days. It is as bad as that. We could not resupply them. It is a situation we simply cannot sustain. It goes on year after year and no-one brings it up. That was the importance of this report. It is the parliament inquiring into the expenditure of what is a relatively large sum annually for the defence forces. But all we are getting is half a system. Even if we got the full system, it would be only a very modest defence capability. It is hamstrung because it does not have the ability to sustain itself for the purpose for which it exists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Defence forces are expensive. There is no cheap or easy solution to having one, and that is particularly relevant to Australia, where we have a great land mass and a low density population. We cannot fund a defence force on the basis that if we have a good wool clip or a good wheat crop we will put money into it, but when we have a drought or the economy collapses because the Labor Party has blown it apart we will cut our defence force. We have to have continuity of funding, and funding at a high level. If we diminish that funding and lose a capability in an area&mdash;as we did when we had the high resignation rates with the air force pilots in 1988 and 1989&mdash;it takes us 15 or more years to recover. We need experience and expertise in the defence forces. We have to keep them funded year in, year out, at what we believe is a reasonable level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the years the government has set up a series of strategic basis papers in which it allegedly analyses and thereby predicts what threats face Australia. That is worth doing. But where the government goes wrong is that it uses these predictions&mdash;which do not have much more validity than horoscopes in the daily newspaper&mdash;to order the stocks against that contingency. The government says that the only threat to Australia is a low level contingency threat, where we will have small groups of lightly armed insurgents running around the north blowing up power houses; therefore, we do not need a stockholding policy; therefore, we do not need to hold expensive munitions&mdash;because the strategic guidance tells us that we do not need them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that the government supports the strategic guidance to save money is lost on most people. That means that we have the situation the committee exposed. I quote from the committee's report at page 65, Conclusions, at 6.1. The opening statement reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no ADF stockholding policy.</PARA>
<PARA>There is no ADF stock-holding policy in place because we have this no-threat doctrine. The consequence of that, in the case of the army, is that the government believes that the stockholdings required for the army are literally no higher than the stockholdings required for peacetime training activities. Nothing could be more absurd than that assertion. If we are to have a defence force, we have to fit it out so that it can carry out the job it has to do if it is called on to serve this country. We can never afford a big or lavish defence force. To have a defence force that consists of men and women only and cannot be used in combat, that can be used only for United Nations peacekeeping, is in my judgment a waste of money and a betrayal of the interests of this country. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA>This annual report of the Reserve Bank is a very important document and always comes in budget week. It is interesting to note the difference between the emphasis the Reserve Bank puts on the problems facing the economy and the measures taken by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Senate will be aware, the opposition has at times expressed some concern about the need to ensure that the Reserve Bank is kept totally free from being influenced by the government in respect of its policy decisions and its right to comment on what is happening. Certainly a few years ago there was a very significant statement in the Reserve Bank annual report when Mr John Phillips was Deputy Governor, and that report clearly demonstrated how the government strategies were failing and were wrong, and, of course, he was proved totally right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What interests me in the present situation is that page 15 of the Reserve Bank report clearly raises some serious concerns about the policy of the present government as evidenced in this budget. One can see this very clearly, despite the very cautious language that the Reserve Bank uses, because it deals with the need for getting a sustainable, sound, proper recovery and a higher rate of growth than has taken place in recent times when, as we all know, we have had a rate of growth that has been inadequate to provide job opportunities for all Australians. We now have this appalling unemployment rate of around 11 per cent which will continue pretty much as it is under this budget. But the Reserve Bank report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">How to achieve and sustain higher rates of growth is the challenge for today's policy-makers.</PARA>
<PARA>I might interpolate there on the criteria the Reserve Bank establishes; this government fails that challenge. The report goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For the moment, winding back the consequences of excessive borrowing in the late 1980s is proving to be more protracted than expected.</PARA>
<PARA>The report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia has many inherent advantages, not least natural and human resources, political stability&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I suppose one could call `political stability' a little questionable at the moment&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">quality infrastructure, and proximity to the fast-growing Asian economies.</PARA>
<PARA>The report goes on very significantly to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Turning those advantages into a successful and sustained growth performance, however, requires a number of additional elements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From the Bank's point of view, one which looms large is a stable price framework. This is essential&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>Not just important, nice or something to aim for, but essential&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">if we are to hold the gains on competitiveness and generate the quality investment necessary to increase future output. Monetary policy carries much of the responsibility here, although other policies (such as wages and taxation policies) can make monetary policy's job more or less difficult.</PARA>
<PARA>So what has this government done? It has made its job more difficult. It has done its damnedest to destroy the low level of inflation which has been achieved through blood, sweat and an 11 per cent unemployment rate. Under this government's budget the inflation rate, as measured by the consumer price index, will rise from one per cent to 3 1/2 per cent, and other indicators of inflation will also rise substantially as a direct result of this budget. This will also be assisted by the decline in the Australian dollar which has emerged basically through economic mismanagement which has yet to flow through fully to the inflation rate because, as the Australian dollar goes down, so the cost of imports goes up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Reserve Bank is saying that it is essential that the government maintain inflation at the lowest possible rate and the government, in order to `keep' its phoney election promise about reducing income tax, has put on all these other taxes which put up inflation. In other words, the government is putting up taxes which are exactly the opposite to the ones the Reserve Bank says are needed in order to pay for its phoney election promises. It can only cut taxes by increasing taxes. That is what the government has done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What it has done provides a far greater increase in inflation without any of the offsetting benefits that were involved in the GST, which the government so strenuously attacked and on which it based its dishonest and disreputable return to office. The scare campaign is now shown to be phoney because the government itself is introducing a series of tax rises which, despite what Senator Gareth Evans says, will be a major factor in the increase in the cost of living from one per cent to 3 1/2 per cent and is in breach of the Reserve Bank's essential requirement to have a stable price framework. The Reserve Bank report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On its own, however, price stability will not guarantee faster growth.</PARA>
<PARA>There are a few other factors. The report goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The main requirement for higher sustained growth is higher investment.</PARA>
<PARA>But, of course, we are not getting higher investment. We have the lowest investment levels here in Australia since how long? According to page 7 of the Reserve Bank report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Equipment investment too has suffered a large fall and, as a share of GDP, has been lower than at any other time in the past 40 years.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the great, able, and competent `Australia's best Treasurer' bringing about this disaster. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the private business sector's capital stock appears to have declined . . .</PARA>
<PARA>The report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given these conditions, strong growth in business investment could occur as the negative influences are lifted.</PARA>
<PARA>What we need, of course, is confidence? Are we going to get that confidence? The Reserve Bank report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Equipment investment appears to have bottomed, although there is little evidence yet of the rebound necessary to restore the economy's productive potential. Continuing uncertainty about the state of the world economy is a dampening factor, as is the large overhang of unused capacity in many areas.</PARA>
<PARA>So, according to the Reserve Bank, there are certainly problems facing us on that score. On page 15 the report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The missing factor is the confidence to expand in anticipation of future sales and profits. This in turn depends on various factors and cannot be drummed up easily; it will, however, be responsive to policies which are generally supportive of growth, and which minimise impediments to investment and hiring decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So what has the government done in the budget? It has belted some of those industries, such as the wine industry, that are seeking to invest, expand and export more. In fact, the wine industry is probably the fastest growing export industry in Australia and, as a wine spokesman said in this morning's media, `There is no other wine industry in the world taxed as heavily as the Australian wine industry'. Yet, under this extraordinary budget, the wine industry is expected to compete in world markets, having just been belted in its domestic sales, which are the base on which its exports can be developed. Do we see anything in this budget which is generally supportive of growth and which minimises impediments to investment and hiring decisions? The answer is no, we do not. The budget fails on that ground. The Reserve Bank report continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Financing that necessary investment raises some critical issues. Rapid and sustainable growth tends to be associated with countries with high saving rates. While a temporary fall in savings by both households and governments in the recession is normal, Australians&mdash;both as individuals and through their governments&mdash;need to lift their savings performances over the medium term.</PARA>
<PARA>What is this government doing? We are going to have the highest approach to the market by the governments. Under this government we are going to have the highest level of government borrowing requirement for 10 years. So there is dissaving by the government, more borrowing by the government. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even more significant, the household saving rate, which was 7.2 per cent in 1991-92, and which declined to 6.1 per cent in 1992-93, will go down under this budget to 4 3/4 per cent. So we have exactly the opposite occurring in an area that the bank says is critical&mdash;`rapid and sustainable growth tends to be associated with countries with high saving rates' and `there is a need to lift the savings performance'. Instead of that, under this budget the savings performance is worsening. We clearly have a situation where the Reserve Bank is in disagreement with the fiscal policies of this government. The Reserve Bank report goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Compulsory superannuation can help&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, in terms of lifting savings rates&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But these arrangements work best where employees accept lower current consumption standards in return for higher future incomes; attempts to realise higher living standards at both points in time by-passing the cost onto employers will risk dissipating the potential gains from savings through higher prices.</PARA>
<PARA>Under the budget, average weekly earnings in the four quarters to June next year are expected to rise by four per cent. So on almost every score of what are the essential elements of real, sustained recovery from the recession, this government's policies, as evidenced in the budget documents, are a failure. They fail to meet the Reserve Bank's requirements. I must say, I am particularly grateful to the Reserve Bank for being so frank in this case about what it sees as the requirements for getting Australia out of its present mess. In this Reserve Bank report there is a clear warning to this government about the impact on inflation of the declining Australian dollar. The report says, for example:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Over May and June 1993, the TWI [trade weighted index] fell by a further 5 per cent, which implies some further rise in import prices and import valuation effects. The continuing slack in product and labour markets should assist in coping with the short term inflationary consequences; whether there is any lasting impact on the rate of inflation will hinge largely on wage outcomes.</PARA>
<PARA>So here is the government, having just enraged the ACTU with its taxation attack on lower income workers, expecting to get cooperation from the ACTU in the essential area of holding down wage rises. What the Reserve Bank has revealed yet again is this government's monumental economic incompetence. It is unfortunate for the Australian people that, unless there are changes of a significant nature, this nation is going to have to put up with this economic bungling for another three years. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA>On 24 May 1993, the committee received a reference from the Senate to inquire into the efficacy of the Education Services for Overseas Students Act 1991 in light of the collapse of the Australian Business College in January 1993, and to report by 30 August 1993. The committee had previously reviewed the operation of the ESOS Act and had reported to the Senate on proposed amendments in December 1992. This further inquiry into the efficacy of the legislation was triggered by the collapse of the Australian Business College in Perth in January 1993. The collapse of the college involved 350 overseas students and a further 350 Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee held two public hearings. The first hearing involved officers of the Department of Employment, Education and Training, who provided the committee with information on the aspects of the act which they were proposing to amend in light of this collapse. At the second hearing, representatives of industry groups and students participated, along with departmental officers, in a detailed consideration of the proposed amendments. This latter hearing, which included a round table discussion of all the witnesses with the committee, clearly helped speed up the process of reaching agreement on those issues which were still a matter of dispute between industry groups and the department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has made a number of specific recommendations with regard to amendments to the act, including an extension of the sunset clause to 1 January 1997. Details of some proposed amendments had not been finalised in time to be considered by the committee prior to preparing its report. The committee has therefore recommended that proposals to amend the ESOS Act be referred to the committee immediately upon tabling of the proposed legislation in the House of Representatives. I commend the report and its recommendations to the Senate. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA>In speaking to this report, I wish to refer to the report of the same committee entitled, `Aspects of the operation and interpretation of the Family Law Act', which was presented earlier this year to the parliament and which contained many recommendations. But perhaps the most important thing that we drew to the government's attention appeared in the conclusion to chapter 16, where in part we said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee considers that the government, as a matter of urgency, must address the anomalies currently inherent in the child support scheme so that both parents share an equitable burden of the cost of supporting their children after marriage breakdown.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reason we suggested this is that throughout that inquiry the number of times that we heard people making comments about the child support scheme made us realise that it was well overdue for review. I think all of us already knew that from the number of representations that we had had in our electorates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Constantly people are coming in&mdash;both men and women, custodial parents and non-custodial parents&mdash;with complaints about the agency, the way it operates and the way the scheme itself is structured. When the committee inquired into the Family Law Act, we were left in no doubt that many of the problems that people talked about relating to access to and support of children flowed from this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Thanks for listening</EMPHASIS> is a report on a hotline that the committee ran in Canberra to enable people to have access to it. From our own electorate offices, we all knew that some of the constituents who had complaints about the agency would write submissions and send them in, but we also knew that there were a lot of people who were hurting very deeply because of aspects of this scheme who perhaps did not have the skills or the confidence to write what seemed to them to be a fairly demanding thing&mdash;a submission to a parliamentary committee. The committee attends hearings in other places, but again there would be some people who would have some reluctance about coming to meet us. This way we knew that we would be making ourselves available to large numbers of people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When it was first suggested that we should have a hotline, I expressed some reservations&mdash;not because I did not want people to have access to the committee but because I knew that the number of people who would attempt to contact us would be so vast that our capacity to cope with it was, by comparison, very limited indeed. Unfortunately, that proved to be the case. Telecom has told us that in the two days that this operated, 21 and 22 July this year, over 150,000 calls were attempted, 80,000 of them on the first day and the balance on the second day, getting up to just on nine and a half thousand attempted calls in one hour during that period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of us manned the phones that we had available. In all, we talked to just under 700 people. That is not very many out of 150,000 calls. We know that that figure included people who rang several times trying to get through. We know that we spoke to people who had been hanging on for a very long time after they got through before they actually got to one of the people taking the calls. The level of frustration was quite high&mdash;and understandably so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also know that during the same two days many of our electorate offices had calls from people who were trying to get through but could not. That has continued, and many have now written in. People now understand that a submission to the committee does not have to be a PhD thesis; it can be a letter giving their version of what it is about the way the scheme operates that is causing them concern and distress. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of things came out of the inquiry. Clearly the formula needs adjusting. I do not think any of us who answered the phones that day did not realise that the formula needs to be examined very closely. When the legislation was before us, there was bipartisan support for the concept of seeing that parents support their children. There was no argument about that at all, but we did say at the time that we would need to review it and see how it worked. The issues come in two parts: firstly, the formula as to how maintenance is assessed and what things are taken into account in assessing it and, secondly, the way the tax office operates the scheme. There were many complaints in both areas and they are set out in this report which we have placed before the Senate today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are some of the complaints: the fact that it is based on a gross wage, not a net wage; the way overtime is calculated; the way changes in financial circumstances are not taken into account for perhaps two years after a wage may have dropped considerably&mdash;the new circumstances just do not seem to operate in time; the application of an indexing factor of 3.4 per cent when inflation is not that high; the fact that a non-custodial parent can be left with $8,000 per annum whereas a custodial parent's current income is not taken into account unless it is above $30,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We heard from men who explained that they had absolutely no capacity whatever to embark upon a new life after they had been dealt with by the agency. We heard from people who were paying maintenance and were happy to pay maintenance but were unhappy about the way they were treated and the way that it operated. I will not go through every one of the concerns that have been listed here. They are the issues that we will be pursuing more closely as the committee goes on with its work and the major inquiry that we are undertaking.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We refer also to the administration of the Child Support Agency. The agency has a case load of nearly 206,000. The stress and strain on the tax office and those involved in it has been very great. There are criticisms. We had people tell us&mdash;and I heard it on the phone a number of times&mdash;`You are treated like a criminal by those on the other end of the phone if you ring up or if you make any inquiries'. We heard complaints about the agency's lack of enforcement of orders. We heard complaints about the delays in paying money once it had been received by the agency. There certainly are areas that need to be looked at. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the agency does not have sufficient resources to enable it to do well the things that are required. I know from my own dealings with it that it has made considerable changes in the last 12 months or so in an effort to address the complaints that are being made, but there is still an enormous sense of frustration in the community with those who are dealing with it&mdash;and many people are dealing with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The title of the report, which we present with some humility, is <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Thanks for listening</EMPHASIS>. While sitting and listening to and taking notes of the things that these people wanted to say, it was very moving to see the number of people who felt that they had never before been able to say these things and who had never had anybody who would listen to them. A number of the calls ended with people saying, `Thanks for listening'. I think all of us need to take note of that and remember that it is important to listen to the people who are affected by the sort of legislation that we enact here. They are entitled to be heard and it is important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amongst the calls that I took&mdash;and I can only talk about the work that I did on those two days&mdash;so frequently this came up: `I don't mind paying maintenance for my children, but surely there must be some mechanism to ensure that I am able to see them&mdash;that I am able to have a meaningful relationship with my children'. It is not easy to answer that one, but somehow somebody has to try to find the answer, because it happens all too often. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Acting Deputy President, you will understand what I am about to say. In one morning, quite by chance&mdash;there were about eight phone lines operating&mdash;I took a number of calls from Queensland. My electorate, here in Canberra, is pretty compact and people can get to see their member pretty easily.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For three of the callers that I spoke to&mdash;all from places I had not heard of&mdash;the nearest Child Support Agency office was Townsville. The first man that I chatted to was complaining about ringing and never being able to talk to the same person. He was not actually complaining about the people in the Townsville office; it was the way it operated. In fact, most of the people involved with the Townsville agency thought they were doing a good job. Not knowing where he lived, I said to him, `How far are you from the Townsville office?'. He said, `Oh, it'd be a good 12 hours drive, luv'. That makes an impact on somebody who lives in an electorate where 25 minutes would be the longest anyone would need to get just about anywhere. I come from the country, but I have never lived 12 hours from somebody I wanted to talk to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another person told me that he was about 1,000 kilometres from Townsville. The other one said, `I'm out in the coalfields', and indicated the distance. The frustration of that being the nearest place to go to get an answer is something that perhaps we need to take into account. As I said, I am talking about your electorate, Mr Acting Deputy President, and you would know better than me. It was a worthwhile exercise, even though we did not get to many of the people who wanted to talk to us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that this is the first time any parliamentary committee has run a hotline of this kind. Perhaps this is a unique inquiry where it is important that people have the chance to speak to us. But it was not just an exercise to let people have a say. It was a very genuine endeavour to enable people to say to us the things they wanted to say. None of us who took part in the hotline will forget the things that were said to us that day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, I should like to refer to the staff of the committee, members of my own staff and others in the parliament who volunteered to take part. Their names are listed at the beginning of this report. Some of them had not done this sort of work before and found it quite stressful to be involved in the sorts of conversations they had. To somebody like myself, who worked in family law for many years before I came to the Senate, it was in a sense going back to hearing things that I had been familiar with and am familiar with in my electorate office. But to many of these who participated that day I say a very sincere thank you for what they did to make it possible for us to talk to 700 people. It was only with the assistance of so many members of staff of the parliament that we were able to speak to even that number of people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I emphasise that this is an interim report, which I hope people will read. We will not be presenting the report of the inquiry until some time next year because there is a great deal of work still to be done. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I enjoyed participating in the work of the committee. The members of the committee approach their task with a deep commitment to trying to resolve some of the very deep problems of this country. Not everyone on the committee is in agreement, and not everyone approaches the problems from the same ideological framework. There are quite different approaches in terms of values, but there is a common commitment and concern to resolving quite complex problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has served another function in allowing people to access the state in ways in which they probably otherwise would not have been able to do. In terms of the substance of the report, committee members had the opportunity to speak directly to people about a very sensitive and detailed matter. This occurred in an environment in which they previously had experienced great difficulties in approaching the formal agencies of government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that many citizens of this country chose to participate in this hotline is indicative of the deep concern that exists in the community at large in relation to these matters. The evidence we have accumulated already in this inquiry is in itself indicative of the mandate for change that exists in terms of the operation of this scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw the Senate's attention to paragraphs 25, 26 and 27 of the report which basically assert the common view within this parliament of the objectives of the scheme. Paragraph 26 of the report reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee . . . applauds the objectives of the Child Support Scheme, that is to increase the number of sole parent families receiving child support to provide an effective enforcement mechanism, to ensure the regular payment of child support and to relieve taxpayers of the financial burden of subsidising single parent families.</PARA>
<PARA>The other objective is to ensure that parents share equitably in the support of their children. It is apparent to me that the objectives of the scheme are not being met and that the scheme's operations are questionable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This inquiry provides an opportunity to concentrate public debate in a rational and reasonable way in an area of public policy which is often characterised by its irrationality and unreasonableness. It provides an opportunity for the citizens of this country to express their views about the future of the children of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To date, the committee has received 2,700 submissions. This reinforces the public response that we saw to the hotline itself&mdash;the fact that 80,000 calls were logged on one day, 21 July, and that about 150,000 callers attempted to contact the committee. The fact that we are able to speak to only 700 is, to my mind, significant. However, I think that is evidence of the strong feelings and concerns that exist in the community. That is not to say that every particular matter that has been raised in this report has yet to be verified. Obviously there are matters that need to be inquired into in great detail to ensure the accuracy of the claims that are being made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been impressed by the way in which the agency has been performing. With 206,000 clients, it is a significant government agency and deals with matters that involve very sensitive issues in terms of the way in which we relate to one another in this country. It picks up some really basic policies of the way in which our society is changing and the need for legislation that recognises that changes can occur within very basic structures of our society, such as the family. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is significant that so many working class people are drawn into this scheme. Approximately 90 per cent of the participants in the agency's work earn less than average weekly earnings. I find that an extraordinary statistic. Why is it that so many people with such low incomes manage to be drawn into the scheme while so many people with higher incomes seem to be outside it? We will pursue that matter further in the inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am concerned by the responses of some in our community that suggest that inevitably any figures produced are statistically insignificant in terms of the number of people concerned about the operation of this scheme. That is often stated by organisations that have a very keen professional interest in this area of public policy. I believe that wherever injustice exists, it is a matter of concern to this Senate. Where there is injustice to the levels that we are uncovering, I think it is clearly a matter that cannot go without some response by the government of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not satisfied that the academic responses we have received in the operation of this scheme are adequate. I am concerned that too often in this area there is no real-world experience of how people actually live in this country. As a consequence, we are finding that many anomalies are arising. I cannot believe they were intended when the scheme was created, and I believe they were on the basis of cross-party decisions of this parliament. It cannot be said to be the responsibility of one particular party within this parliament; it was a matter that all different political views in this country as expressed in this parliament were able to support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, in some respects I do not believe any of us could possibly have believed that laws passed in this country would have had such a devastating effect on people. I trust that this report will provide a stimulus to further public debate. I also hope it will stimulate people concerned in this area of public policy to come forward to the committee and put views to the government about ways and means in which this scheme can be amended to alleviate some of the suffering that is occurring in this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a member of the inquiry conducted by the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues, I, too, was concerned that the income support scheme required a thorough investigation and overhaul. I am pleased that the efforts to bring that about have now come to fruition and that the inquiry is under way. I am also pleased to be a member of this inquiry for a further term. I do believe that the guiding principle of this inquiry should be the welfare of the children, as indeed the Family Law Act prescribes in general terms whenever one talks about a family break-up.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My experience during the family law inquiry and my experience with this inquiry so far has overwhelmingly made me realise once again how difficult it is to find legislative and administrative solutions to what is essentially an extremely traumatic personal experience for the people who are involved. I believe it is our task to minimise the trauma and, in particular, minimise the suffering of the children involved and ensure that they live full and satisfying lives which are supported not only by basic necessities but also by opportunities for future development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even at this stage it is very clear that the many letters and phone calls that I, other members of the family law committee and, no doubt, other members of parliament, particularly senators, have received from people who feel that this scheme is not functioning as it should have brought out major difficulties in the operation of the scheme. It is very clear that the structure is far too rigid and does not allow the departmental officers to take account of particular circumstances as they affect individual families. The structure is too inflexible and cannot accommodate individual circumstances where hardship exists and where the provisions of the scheme operate to make it impossible for people to find an equitable solution to the problems that they experience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The details of the responses that we received from this phone-in&mdash;the report about which I am addressing&mdash;have been mentioned by Senator Reid. I shall not delay the Senate by going through these again. Suffice to say, the very volume of responses that we received&mdash;150,000 calls, with 700 calls individually listened to and dealt with&mdash;indicates the massive difficulties that the community is experiencing in this area. I, too, have experienced a degree of humility in assessing this response. I, too, would like to say `thanks for listening'. I make a commitment that the work of the committee will be pursued conscientiously to address the difficulties that people have brought to our attention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is obviously too early at this stage to foreshadow solutions to the problems that have been brought to us. All we can do is work with dedication and in great detail to assess the record number of submissions&mdash;the several thousand submissions&mdash;which have reached the committee, in addition to the calls that we received on this hotline.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, too, am a member of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues. The committee's interim report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Thanks for listening</EMPHASIS>, has just been presented. Clearly, we have before us an example of how the parliament does listen to people. Senator Reid in her contribution made reference to the report of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Aspects of the Operation and Interpretation of the Family Law Act. She drew attention to the fact that that committee's report made some remarks about the operation of the Child Support Act and the Child Support Agency. The report was pretty damning in its comments on the operation of the agency, how the formula worked and a number of other matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst that committee did not make any direct recommendations for reform or change at the time, it was not because we did not want to. The simple fact is that this matter did not come under the committee's terms of reference and, as such, we felt as a committee that we could not address it. Nonetheless, we did not overlook it; we put it in our report. That matter has now been taken up, as is evident to all by this interim report which has been presented this afternoon. The matter has been taken up with the newly established committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new committee, under the chairmanship of my House of Representatives colleague Mr Roger Price, has wasted no time in getting to work on the reference delivered to it by the parliament to examine the operations of the Child Support Agency. I think we have to be careful at this time not to jump to conclusions too early as a result of our experiences with the hotline phone-in on the subject matter of this report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the earlier report was presented in November last year, the number of complaints coming to my electorate office in Western Australia on the operation of the Child Support Agency in my state has dwindled. That is not to say that there are not people who need assistance. But the complaints are not coming in in the volume that they used to. I will look carefully at the ombudsman's report when it is presented this year to see whether the experience of the ombudsman mirrors what I am experiencing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am cautious about the report that we are presenting now because we have not yet had the opportunity to analyse the individual submissions. The sheer volume of submissions has made that work prohibitive. We have already held some public meetings and some witnesses have appeared before the committee. We have done some testing but we are nowhere near in a position to reach overall conclusions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I caution people to treat the contents in a cautionary manner. We received one-way information from the telephone hotline. As I understand it from the other committee members who were able to participate in the hotline, there was not much opportunity for them to direct questions back to the people who were calling in because of the volume of the calls and the backup that was needed. They had to try to clear the lines as soon as possible. They did not do that on all occasions and they certainly did listen to people. I endeavoured to be part of the hotline myself but, unfortunately, other committee work in this place prohibited my attendance. On one occasion my colleague Senator Spindler and I were tied up with the migration committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my opinion, we should also treat with some caution the volume of calls that came into the office. It was an experiment. This was the first occasion on which something like this has been used by a parliamentary committee. It would be wrong to say that each and every one of the callers who tried to get through was negative to the Child Support Act, the contents of that act or, indeed, the operation of the agency. I understand from my colleagues who took part in the phone-in that that was their experience on some occasions. Some people were complimentary when they talked about the act but were critical and wanted rearrangement of some of the formulas and arrangements that govern the agency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee did not have the resources to go out and advertise that such a hotline was taking place, but it did receive quite a deal of publicity, particularly through radio stations and some of the print media. That helped to get the word around, as did individual committee members and other members of parliament from both houses, who informed their constituents that the phone-in was happening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The volume was also probably assisted by a press statement from the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) which came out on the afternoon of the first day of the hotline. That in turn aided the process of getting people to come in and make their contribution about the operation of the Child Support Agency. So the people in the committee can be grateful to Mr Gear for the fact that his timely intervention aided the whole democratic process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I again caution that this is only an interim report. The committee has not had time to fully digest the calls&mdash;because they were so numerous&mdash;or the submissions. As I understand the secretariat, the committee has now received in excess of 3,600 items of correspondence, which is by far and away a record&mdash;it must be a record&mdash;for any parliamentary committee, not that this committee is about creating records. We want to aid and improve the present system. </PARA>

On this occasion, I commend the secretariat, the support people and all those other voluntary people, including staff from some committee members' offices, who came in and assisted in the process. The secretary of the committee, Robina Mills, really was a tower of strength in all this process. She was assisted by Lesley and the other people who were associated with the report. They really need tremendous commendation for the amount of work they have done over the past few weeks. A voluminous amount of material has passed in front of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must say some words about our chairman. The proposal to institute a hotline emanated from the chairman, Mr Roger Price. He has to be commended for bringing that innovation before the committee. Even though the committee is at a very early stage in its life, I commend him on his abilities and contributions in terms of how the committee is working and operating. I am sure that my colleagues on all sides of the parliament will join me in that respect. If he continues to control the meetings and hearings and the committee in the way that he has done so far, it certainly will be a committee that will match any other committee that this parliament has ever had in its history. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I first mooted the idea of having an inquiry into the Family Law Act, I said that I wanted an inquiry into the Child Support Agency to run in conjunction with it. But I was told very cleverly and succinctly, if you like, that the Family Court and the Child Support Agency operate under two different administrative areas; one is administered under the Attorney-General's Department and the other comes under the Australian Taxation Office, the Treasurer, the Minister for Finance, et cetera, and all those who deal with the financial side of things. So we never looked at the Child Support Agency in the Family Law Act inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just about every person who attended hearings for the inquiry into the Family Law Act mentioned in some way the concerns, worries and problems that he or she was having with the Child Support Agency. The 150,000 calls that were made on the hotline&mdash;I do not know whether 10,000, 5,000 or 100,000 people made calls or whether, for example, there were 10 successive calls from 15,000 people&mdash;represents an horrific number of people who attempted to get through. I am sorry and a little concerned that only 700 calls were listened to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend those members of the committee who took the calls&mdash;Kevin Andrews MP; Senator Carr; Marjorie Henzell MP; the Hon. Roger Price MP, the chairman; and Senator Margaret Reid, the deputy chairman&mdash;and for the job that they did in ensuring that people had access to members of parliament to say what they think about the Child Support Agency. What people said in that hotline has already been very well canvassed. It is also in the report, which I commend to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Child Support Agency has caused a lot of concern to people in the community. That is obviously why we are having the inquiry. It is a problem of mammoth proportions; it will not go away and it must be addressed. I am confident that this committee will be able to arrive at recommendations that in some way alleviate some of the present inequities. I commend this interim report to the Senate. It is just the start of what I believe will be quite a long and arduous inquiry.

There can be no argument that the rural sector has become the new forgotten poor in Australian society&mdash;forgotten and poor as a direct result of the Labor government's policies, promises not delivered and unbalanced budgets. The Labor Party campaigned on a platform of tax cuts, jobs and a return to prosperity. That was only a few months ago. A lot of words have been said in this chamber already about whether they were untruths that were told or whether they were deceitful or whatever. I will not go into using words that would be unparliamentary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the government delivered on Tuesday night has absolutely no resemblance to what government members told us in March, and even their mates are screaming for blood.

They have been slugged at every turn and in every way. Ninety per cent of wool producers last year had negative incomes and many of them have been evicted from their properties, barely salvaging their personal possessions. They were remembered in this budget. Woolgrowers were hit with an increase in the wool tax&mdash;to 12 per cent. The wool industry that has done so much and struggled so hard has been slugged again by the Keating Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Garnaut report, which will hopefully be acted upon, shows the problems and concerns of the people who know a little bit about the wool industry. The rural crisis has not just happened. As ill-informed as this Government is, it must be aware of the problems; it has been exacerbating them for years. The average return last year for broadacre farms was $20,500, the lowest for 30 years. But they are well off compared to the woolgrowers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Wool producers and those affected by drought had farm income drops of 90 per cent, receiving on average about $1,800 for their entire year's work. That is more than the Labor government would pay in a weekend just to keep itself in booze! That is going to be a bit dearer for government members as well; they are slugging themselves a bit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite this rural disaster of massive proportions, what did the government do for rural Australians this week? It hit them with the wool tax, as I have already said; it hit them with the fuel tax; it hit them with the wholesale sales tax; and it hit them with the old Pea-Beu, I would say, because it has actually slugged them in every way it could. Fuel is the lifeblood of rural Australia. Those of us in the bush are the biggest users of fuel because everything we do requires it. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know rural Australians did not vote for Paul Keating, and that is probably why they are being hit even harder than the rest of Australia. The government trumpets its great assistance to export industries, but what did it do for the Australian wine industry which has only recently increased its share of the UK market to 5 per cent? Senator Tierney is going to make some comments about in a minute or two. The government has slugged it with a massive 11 per cent tax&mdash;on an industry that is just getting going. That will be enough to put some wine growers out of business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wine industry is another rural industry that is in trouble because of the federal government's policies, and this measure will hit domestic wine sales just when the industry is starting to show growth. This Labor Party&mdash;the champion of the cause of the poor!&mdash;has even been desperate enough to make no exemptions for its sales tax hike, so fruit juice and flavoured milk will go up along with videos, jewellery and furs. The hypocrisy of those who sit on the Labor government benches is mind numbing, and I say: shame on them for putting down a budget like that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having forced farmers to bankruptcy, the federal government is now going to abandon them and has decided to put funding responsibility for the rural adjustment scheme back with the states.

There can be no argument that the rural sector has become the new forgotten poor in Australian society as a direct result of a Labor government which does not care for Australian people, a government which leaves us with undelivered promises and unbalanced budgets.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate for its cooperation in allowing me to make this, my first speech. Having sought and received much advice about the appropriate form of a first speech, I have received quite varied and different suggestions. I hope what follows does not offend any established practices, but I have found it impossible to think of anything worth while to say that is, if not controversial, at least highly political.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">May I first pay thanks to those whose support has allowed me to take up the great honour and opportunity of representing Western Australia and the Australian Labor Party in this parliament. While I thank the people of Western Australia for my election, I do not delude myself that, given the Senate electoral system, they have expressed any great confidence in me personally. I come here by virtue of the endorsement of my political party. To its members, supporters and trade unionists I offer my thanks and commit myself to honour the trust they have placed in me. In particular, I wish to acknowledge the support of the Miscellaneous Workers' Union, the United Firefighters' Union and the many party members who have assisted me in my political development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was the sole Labor senator elected at the last election to replace Senator Pat Giles and Senator Peter Walsh who both retired. Both senators made enormous contributions to Australian political life. While no-one would argue that they are not very different characters with diverse interests, I nevertheless hope to emulate some of the qualities each brought to the Senate. On my retirement, if I were to be fairly described as a feminist champion of social justice with a reputation for financial responsibility and an abhorrence of humbug and privilege, I think I could retire well pleased. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On a personal level, I would like to acknowledge my family for their support and my father and my sister who are in the gallery this evening. My father, a Welshman, brought us to Australia with the intention of moving on to Canada. We never did get to Canada and I am sure he never imagined his son would one day sit in the Australian parliament. It is of course long overdue that a Western Australian Labor senator with Welsh heritage was elected. The Irish and occasional Scot have dominated the ALP ticket for far too long. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the pressure of political life and the tyranny of distance I am determined to honour my commitment to be a good husband to Miriam and a good father to Dylan. I hasten to mention before the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Gareth Evans, is unduly maligned that I am no relation to the honourable senator. Nevertheless, I am opening his misdirected mail in the hope of intercepting invitations to foreign parts. There must be some positive side to being the other Senator Evans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In preparing this speech the temptation was to roam far and wide outlining my views on the world. I am afraid to say I have only in part resisted that temptation. I have chosen to make some comments on three of the public debates dominating Australian political life. While not claiming a unique perspective on these issues, I do wish to contribute something to the debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In structuring this speech I have identified common elements to my approach when addressing these and other issues that will come before the parliament: firstly, that there exist fundamental inalienable human rights that must be paramount in our considerations and that those rights must be protected and enhanced by any legislative action we take; secondly, that we must defend those fundamental rights against attempts to subjugate them to propositions designed to protect privilege, property, discrimination or inappropriate power; thirdly, that notions of states' rights should not be given pre-eminence over human or people's rights; fourthly, that the federal government should not shirk exercising its full constitutional power to legislate whenever that is required to protect those basic human rights; fifthly, that our legislative approach must be guided and give effect to international law and Australian treaty obligations. These are the principles on which I base my remarks today on the issues of constitutional reform, the High Court Mabo decision and industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am disappointed that in 1993 so much that I had thought of as accepted principle in Australian politics is having to be reargued in the context of these debates. In June 1993, the High Court, in ruling in the case Eddie Mabo v. the state of Queensland recognised native title rights for Aboriginal Australians and rejected the notion of terra nullius. This ruling confirms what any fair minded Australian must accept&mdash;that the process of European settlement has dispossessed Australia's Aboriginal people of their land and denied them justice. The High Court's decision establishes this historical fact in Australian law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister has quite rightly recognised the importance of the High Court decision and sought to build on that decision in order to provide a more substantial and binding basis for reconciliation. I commend the government's determination to legislate to bring certainty to the question of titles while protecting and enhancing the rights of Aboriginal people as recognised by the High Court. This debate has unfortunately generated some of the most ill-informed public comment in living memory. Those who seek again to remove the legal rights of Aboriginal people in order to placate the vested interests which they represent are beyond contempt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my own state of Western Australia, we have seen a particularly virulent attack on the High Court's decision and senators could be forgiven for gaining the impression that all Western Australians are hell-bent on denying Aboriginal people justice. However, the vast majority of fair thinking Western Australians support the recognition of Aboriginal rights and a lasting reconciliation between indigenous people and other Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, sections of the Western Australian branch of the Liberal Party have championed the most hysterical arguments against the High Court's decision. They have claimed that 80 per cent of Western Australian land is subject to claim and that even Perth suburban backyards are under threat. These claims have been calculated to spread fear and division. Thankfully, rational voices within the Liberal Party have spoken in opposition. The member for Tangney, Darryl Williams QC, and former senator and member for Pearce, Fred Chaney have, to their credit, opposed their state colleagues and defended the High Court's role. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The High Court's Mabo decision does raise issues that will require considered legislative response from this parliament. The government will introduce legislation that will bring to the matter the certainty that is required. Some, of course, would argue that the uncertainties raised by the High Court decision require us to trample on the rights of the Aboriginal people in order to give certainty to national and international investors. The need for certainty must be balanced, however, against the need to protect the rights of Aboriginal people and the need to maintain our international human rights reputation with our neighbours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1988 during Australia's centenary celebrations I was fortunate to study at the London School of Economics. During my stay there I witnessed a large anti-Australian rally protesting over the treatment of Aboriginal people. I was at first affronted and shocked that people could view our treatment of Aboriginal people in the same way we view the treatment of, say, black people in South Africa. Upon calmer reflection, I could see that our record on Aboriginal imprisonment, child mortality and poverty could reasonably be compared with those countries which we ourselves hold in contempt for their human rights records. An Australia Day function I helped to organise was boycotted by many of my African and Asian student friends for those same reasons. For the first time I was exposed to the increasing belief and concern within the international community that Australia had failed to live up to its responsibilities and obligations to its own indigenous people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth noting that Sydney is favoured to host the 2000 Olympic Games partly due to the international concern over the poor human rights record of the People's Republic of China. Make no mistake that the attitude of many African and Asian nations to Sydney's bid is influenced by their concerns regarding our record on the treatment of Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's international political reputation and trading future will be damaged by any lack of resolve in facing up to the challenges of our responsibilities to the Aboriginal people. The High Court's Mabo decision recognises the fundamental human rights that have been denied Australia's indigenous population. The government must remain firm in its resolve to implement its commitment to justice for Aboriginal Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to industrial relations reform. This government has, through the accord process, presided over a transformation in industrial relations practice in this country. By a cooperative and constructive approach, the government has achieved real reform at the same time as ensuring record low levels of industrial disputation. The industrial relations system now encourages greater flexibility and productivity without diluting the commitment to the fundamental rights of workers that are the cornerstone of the Labor Party approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party is committed to further reform and believes that, with the development of real enterprise bargaining, further improvement can be achieved. But we totally reject arguments that there exists any justification to go down the low wage, low skills path driven by attacks on workers' rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is tragedy that, despite the recent real reforms in Australian industrial relations, some groups in society have reverted to the propagation of discredited 19th century ideas with their basis in the old master and servant acts. These ideas have been adopted in different forms by some branches of conservative parties in Australia. We in the Liberal Party&mdash;I am sorry; we in the Labor Party&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AX5">Senator CHRIS EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At least I am on the right side of the House. We in the Labor Party are being forced to defend principles we thought agreed in the early years of this century and broadly accepted as part of the Australian social fabric. The Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) is currently preparing to bring legislation into the parliament to expand the government's industrial relations reform agenda. The government will encourage the extension of enterprise bargaining, at the same time as protecting and enhancing our commitment to fair minimum conditions and standards for all Australian workers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, the government's capacity to achieve further constructive change has been severely hindered by the actions of conservative state governments. Industrial legislation in New South Wales, Tasmania, Victoria and now Western Australia has attacked basic principles and working conditions developed over 90 years of Australian industrial relations practice. The cooperative tripartite approach encouraged by Labor has been turned on its head by regressive attacks on the most fundamental of workers' rights and working conditions. The continued development of enterprise bargaining and the future of cooperative federal-state relations are called into question by these developments in state legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The trade union movement and working people generally have cooperated with the federal Labor government to implement its reform agenda. That change has been painful and difficult for many. The fact that they have largely accepted the change is a credit to them. As a community, we cannot expect the trade union movement to cooperate in change and the development of enterprise bargaining if, at the same time, its very existence is being threatened by conservative governments. The union movement will be forced to adopt a defensive position and devote its resources and energies to protecting its members' rights and conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The progress of enterprise bargaining under federal awards will clearly be adversely affected. The impact of regressive state government legislation has already been felt in this parliament. The Kennett government's industrial relations legislation has provoked much debate here already and has seen the federal government respond in order to protect Victorian workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recent industrial relations workers compensation legislation introduced by the Western Australian Court government may also require a response from the federal government. While a cooperative federal-state approach is Labor's preferred option, we will not tolerate the erosion of fundamental workers' rights implicit in the Western Australian legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Western Australian legislation is less honest than the Victorian equivalent but arguably more radical. The legislation purports to be about workplace agreements, but in effect its whole intent is to promote individual contracts&mdash;contracts based on the unequal power relationship between an employer and a single worker. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Western Australian legislation is an attempt to reduce working conditions by excluding unions from the industrial relations process and destroying the protection offered by the award system. The legislation reduces the protection offered to workers to little more than that provided by individual contracts under common law. It brings with it secrecy provisions which ban the disclosure of the details of an individual contract. It aims to deter unions from challenging the making, or indeed the contents, of workplace agreements. It even introduces punitive action directed against unions seeking to protect their members by moving to federal awards. This legislation will deny Western Australian workers the fundamental right to organise and bargain collectively. It is totally unfair and un-Australian. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today thousands of Western Australian workers rallied and marched through the streets of Perth as part of their continuing campaign against the legislation. They were protesting in defence of their basic rights&mdash;rights that we accept as part of the very basis of Australian society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Western Australian legislations attack on workers' rights to organise may well, in my view, be in contravention of Australia's obligations under International Labour Organisation conventions. In particular, they would seem to contravene the principles underpinning conventions 87 and 98, which deal with the right to organise and bargain collectively. I endorse the government's commitment to improve the process of ratifying more of the ILO conventions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an increasing need for the fundamental code of international labour standards enshrined in the conventions to be accepted by Australia and adhered to by all Australian governments. In particular, ILO convention 154, the convention concerning the promotion of collective bargaining, should have been ratified by Australia long ago. That convention was passed in 1981 and has the effect, among other things, of recognising the role of unions in collective bargaining. This is a principle thought self-evident in Australia until recently, but one which is directly challenged by the Western Australian government's legislation. I understand that the convention would have been ratified but for the states dragging their feet. The federal government may well need to review its processes for ratifying conventions if the states are unwilling to ratify appropriate ILO conventions within reasonable time lines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Conservative state governments should not doubt the commitment of the Labor Party to protect worker and trade union rights. The states' right to pass laws relating to industrial relations will not prevent Labor from guaranteeing the central role of trade unions in the protection of workers' rights and the protection and improvement of their working conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to the current debate over constitutional reforms in Australia. The Labor Party is committed to reforming Australia's constitution in an endeavour to make it more relevant and more in tune with political reality. It is important that our constitution and institutions reflect that development in Australian society. Some opponents to change cling to the sanctity of the original constitution as if it were holy writ. However, the constitution has progressively been amended and interpreted over the past 90 years. Many of the notions upon which the constitution was founded are now regarded as the antithesis of democracy. The electoral rights of women and Aborigines were not provided for in the original constitution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party believes that now is the appropriate time in Australia's development to sever our links with the monarchy and establish an Australian republic. That republic must, however, be built on proper democratic foundations. In order for that to occur, the principle of one vote one value must be one such foundation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rural vote weighting that still exists in a number of Australian parliaments is an undemocratic hangover from the time when ownership of property was a qualification for an entitlement to vote. In my own state of Western Australia outrageous malapportionment in both the Legislative Council and Legislative Assembly continues to act as a blight on the democratic process in that state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 1993 state election vote weighting in favour of country areas was almost two to one in the Legislative Assembly and up to 3.4 to one in the Legislative Council. In practical terms, this means that the votes of 44,000 people in the city are regarded as being equivalent to the votes of 13,000 people in the country in the conduct of elections for the Legislative Council in Western Australia. In the lower house the figures are similar, with roughly half the number of voters required to elect a country member to the Legislative Assembly as are required to elect a metropolitan member. This is not equal suffrage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both the Queensland Electoral and Administrative Review Commission and the Western Australian royal commission have advocated reform. The Western Australian royal commission recommended that a commission on government review the electoral system for representation in both houses of parliament. When commenting on reform of the Legislative Assembly, the commission said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The democratic principle by which the majority of votes in the Assembly determines the formation of the Government is generally and properly understood to require as close to equal value in the votes of electors as is possible.</PARA>
<PARA>The commission went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whether the present electoral system is one which properly reflects the democratic basis on which a House of Government should be elected is a matter which warrants examination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Conservative parties in Western Australia have enjoyed a majority in the Legislative Council ever since the chamber was established. Despite the gradual extension of the franchise and political reform around Australia, the Conservatives in Western Australia refuse to yield to pressure for proper democratic elections. The Court government's cynical backing away from the implementation of the royal commission's recommendations confirms that those reforms will not be implemented for the state parliament. The Western Australian electoral system is corrupt. The Western Australian parliament has not reformed itself in almost 100 years; it will not do so now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recent interpretations by the High Court concerning implied rights confirm me in my view that the federal parliament has the power to legislate to establish the principle of one vote one value for elections for all Australian parliaments. I urge the government to give very serious consideration to such legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia must honour its obligations that flow from our being a signatory to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. In that covenant, article 25 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Every citizen shall have the right and the opportunity, without any of the distinctions mentioned in Article 2, and without unreasonable restrictions&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)to vote and to be elected at genuine periodic elections which shall be by universal and equal suffrage and shall be held by secret ballot guaranteeing the free expression of the will of the electors.</PARA>
<PARA>Article 50 of that covenant goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the provisions of the present Covenant shall extend to all parts of Federal States without any limitations or exceptions.</PARA>
<PARA>Australia's obligations are clear. While no-one would argue that some tolerance should not be allowed in the electoral system, it cannot be argued that the sort of malapportionment which I have identified provides in any way for equal suffrage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The parliament is confronted by these simple facts: the current Australian electoral system allows for election to its parliaments by means of unequal franchise; judicial inquiries into corruption of the political process in two states have called for reform to bring about equal franchise; the Constitutional Commission in 1988 recommended reform in this area; Australia's international treaty obligations require us to establish equal suffrage; and the federal parliament has the constitutional power to legislate to ensure equal franchise for all elections for all Australian parliaments. It would be wrong for us not to take action to rectify this last remaining undemocratic practice in the election of Australian parliaments. Federal legislation is urgently required to establish the fundamental democratic principle of one vote one value. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In drawing to a conclusion, I thought it worth while in this my first speech to set out the approach to issues that I intend to adopt in matters that come before the Senate. I also wanted to contribute to placing the government's general approach to these issues within a philosophical framework. I think the Labor Party has paid too little attention in recent years to redefining and expressing its philosophical approach to issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The world has changed rapidly and our experience of it and of long-term government has undoubtedly changed us. There is a need for Labor to re-examine and restate its philosophical approach as we respond to modern challenges.

That is an issue about which almost every farmer I have met in the country in the last six months&mdash;and I have met a lot of them&mdash;has complained; and we get no recognition by those opposite of the reform of that organisation. The list also includes: the Australian Geological Survey Organisation; efficiency gains in the department; cost recovery for the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics; savings in the Bureau of Resource Science; cost recovery for management of Commonwealth fisheries; Australian Fisheries Management Authority staffing; national residue survey; commitment to energy and greenhouse issues; the national Landcare program; the Murray-Darling Basin natural resources management strategy; a commitment to New South Wales flood mitigation; and a range of other initiatives including, for my own home state, the Tasmanian wheat freight subsidy scheme. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. There are six issues I will turn my attention to, firstly in my own home state. We had a lot of nonsense being driven by those opposite from Tasmania about the proposed abolition of the Tasmanian wheat freight subsidy scheme. They claimed that this would be abolished in the budget. If we read through the budget, we will see it there: a $2.7 million commitment to the Tasmanian wheat freight subsidy scheme&mdash;a good example of this government's continuing commitment to the state of Tasmania.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the edification of all honourable senators in the chamber, but particularly those not from Tasmania, the Tasmanian wheat freight subsidy scheme provides essential support to maintain a reasonable level of price for wheat in Tasmania. That is essential in Tasmania for the price of bread and the price of eggs. It is also essential for some of the exports from Tasmania, because wheat is an essential commodity in the processing of glucose and paper production&mdash;a commodity on which Tasmania relies to a significant degree. It is also used in value adding for the feeding of beef and other animal stocks. So, contrary to the claims by those opposite from Tasmania, the Tasmanian wheat freight subsidy scheme has been retained. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are five other programs I will address briefly. The first is the rural adjustment scheme. Because of the continuing poor level of prices that farmers are receiving for most of our rural commodities, with the exception perhaps of dairy, fat lamb and some other commodities, the vast majority of the rural sector is indeed facing very difficult circumstances. That is overwhelmingly because of the very poor price in the international commodity market for what we produce and a variety of other reasons, including access to countries such as the United States and to trade blocs such as the European Economic Community. So they are the basic problems affecting the pricing of our rural commodities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of the continuing concern the rural sector is facing, we have increased the funding to the rural adjustment scheme in this budget. Some $406 million will be provided over the next four years to the rural adjustment scheme. Indeed, this coming financial year, we were to provide $117 million; that will be increased to $157 million. The following year, only $25 million was to have been provided; that will rise to $92 million. At the end of the four-year period, we were to have spent $180 million, but that is now being increased to $406 million&mdash;and yet those opposite claim that there is absolutely nothing in this budget that assists the rural sector. Well, here is one very substantial and concrete measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, we have the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service. I will certainly concede this: there is a great concern in the rural and exporting and importing communities about the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service, particularly its charges. In my duties as a parliamentary secretary, I receive more correspondence on this issue&mdash;and I know those opposite do as well&mdash;and more complaints about the AQIS charges than probably any other issue at the present time that goes across rural policy. What is this government doing in this area? It is taking what I think is very major reform of the quarantine service. It will involve substantial staff reductions over the next three years&mdash;some 500 staff out of approximately 2,000 staff. That is a very substantial reform in anyone's definition. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZW4">Senator SHERRY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If Senator Brownhill does not believe that is reform, I suggest he go and talk to the Farmers Federation about this one. I had a meeting with some of its representatives two or three weeks ago; they certainly believed that the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service should have a much more efficient structure. As a result of these changes, the government has decided that AQIS should be reducing these cost burdens on industry. Existing charges will be kept at current rates and reduced over the next four years, and industry will be receiving a benefit of approximately $10 million.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a very substantial reform of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service. At the same time, because of the adoption of quality assurance, so-called QA&mdash;which is a process whereby industry takes a greater level of responsibility for the quality throughout the continuing production or the processing cycle&mdash;we believe that we can carry out these fundamental reforms to the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service without in any way reducing the standards of inspection that are so necessary to ensure that the quality of food that we export from this country is of the highest possible international standard and that the food that we import into this country is not contaminated in any way. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, this must rate as Labor's worst budget in its decade in office. With nearly one million Australians out of work and something like 30 per cent of young Australians looking for work, no hope can be found for them within this document at all. What a depressing effort. But of course it is the product of Labor's election lie. It was a successful lie in terms that it brought home the bacon, the only bacon that Labor was really interested in.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor conned the Australian people. It said it could offer them tax cuts without expenditure cuts and bring down the deficit as well. It knew it could not do so. Labor did not really believe the lie would work, but unfortunately it did. Now it has to fashion a budget so as to cover as much of that lie as possible. So part of the tax cuts have been brought forward and the balance has in fact been abandoned, and to hold the deficit in the absence of any real expenditure cuts, there has to be a massive hike in existing taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I do not think anyone realised that Labor would strike at the lower income earners in the way that it did. No-one realised that the reward to the true believers would be the sort of slap in the face that they have received in this budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor gave us the recession. Let us never forget that it was the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) who said that this was the recession we had to have. It was a recession brought about through unnecessary high interest rates. For month after month we said to Labor that the effect of these ridiculously high interest rates was to crush Australian business, including efficient business. But Labor would not learn; an arrogant Prime Minister would not listen. The result was massive unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia led the world into recession. It might be that world conditions have made it more difficult for it to come out of recession, but it was not a world recession that drew Australia in; it was Australia that unnecessarily went into recession. An arrogant and out of touch Mr Keating saw the punishment of the recession as necessary in the national interest. Of course he had said earlier that it would not happen, but what is a little more deceit on what we have learnt since? And now in the wash-out of the recession we had to have, we have this pathetic contribution to the charge of encouraging economic growth and jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What it demonstrates, apart from the lies, is a government waiting for the world to change before instigating real and creative change of its own. It, in truth, represents a government bereft of ideas, imagination and sadly hell-bent on being the punisher and straightener. Its rhetoric speaks of internationalisation of the Australian economy with the Asian area, but it does not provide the structural change at the pace of the competitive change that is occurring within our region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor tells us we must be internationally more competitive while at the same time imposing the home-grown obstacles on our exporting industries&mdash;obstacles that we saw in this budget. I refer to an increase in indirect tax, fuel taxes and other business taxes&mdash;increases that can only have the effect of making Australian business on international markets less competitive, not more competitive. Labor boasts about taxation levels lower than Europe without acknowledging the levels of our regional competitors; those where the greatest market opportunities lie are in fact much lower. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an astonishingly confused document. It makes no sense. It offers some tax cuts to families, the working men and women of Australia, but takes them back in higher charges for food and clothing. It offers mothers assistance with child care, but takes this back in higher charges for driving their children to creches or to baby sitters. It offers the long term unemployed $3 a week more, more training schemes, another committee but no jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It offers non-card holding pensioners dental care but takes away their free optometrist visits. It offers farmers an increase in the rural adjustment scheme, but increases the wool tax from 8.5 to 12 per cent. It offers men 55 and over concessional rates of taxation on their long service leave and retirement pay should they be retrenched, but says women should work until they are 65. In short, it offers no vision, no cohesive approach to overcoming our problems, and no hope for a better Australia for our children or our children's children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we emerge from the depression, we are told we that are in recovery. We have an unemployment rate of 10.75 per cent; a CPI forecast of 3.5 per cent; a deficit of $16 billion&mdash;$1.4 billion more than in this past year. This is what Labor calls recovery. But because it is recovery, according to Labor, the poor can be taxed more, devastated industry such as the wool industry can be taxed more, and emerging industry&mdash;the new hopes such as the wine industry on the world market&mdash;can be particularly slugged. It makes no sense at all. If one is going bad one gets taxed more; if one is going well one gets taxed more; if one offers hope and jobs apparently one gets taxed more. In fact, overall tax revenue is to rise in terms of the vision of this budget by some $32.2 billion compared with a rise of only $5.4 billion in the last four years. It makes no sense, Mr President. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These additional taxes equal over $5,000 for each household and $4,200 for each working Australian. It is almost as if Mr Keating wants to punish the recovery. And this from a government that poses as the representatives of the true believers; this from a government that claims it is the legitimate party of social justice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The irony of this budget is that even the true believers have turned against Mr Keating and his comrades. Martin Ferguson, for example, could not defend the indefensible. He would not even take a punt on John Dawkins being returned in a double dissolution. Merle Mitchell expressed extreme disappointment in the `lack of action to bring down unemployment and a failure to implement recommendations on national savings'&mdash;a fair comment, one might think. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Employment was to be the cornerstone of this budget. Mr Dawkins began his speech with a promise that the budget's main theme is about the creation and maintenance of jobs. Yet all he delivers is another committee to report some time in the future. The answers are known; it is the action which is needed. How does increased tax help reduce unemployment? This budget makes a mockery of Mr Keating's campaign plea&mdash;do you remember it, Mr President?&mdash;to be given another chance to reduce the unemployment rate. It reveals how arrogant he still is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where is the promise to create 500,000 jobs over the next three years? Mr President, do you remember that promise? How is this budget going to help create 500,000 jobs over the next three years? Where is the proof that the worst is over? This Prime Minister has the hide to refer to the unemployed as being `neutralised'. Do you remember that, Mr President? In his famous pre-election night speech, in a Sydney Chinese restaurant, he said the government had succeeded in neutralising the unemployed? This callous disregard for the most disadvantaged and unfortunate in our community reeks of the `Let them eat cake' syndrome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this was to be a budget to reduce unemployment we would see encouragement for savings and investment. The Treasurer said, `The way to reduce unemployment is through the expansion and development of Australian industry on a truly world competitive basis'. That is correct. But how does this budget help to achieve that goal? Where is the encouragement to invest? How will increasing taxes and inflation encourage investment? Encouragement is not there. Add to that the uncertainty of Mabo where, instead of building a consensus with state leaders, Mr Keating sought to dictate to the level of government responsible for land tenure.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is the 11th budget that this government has brought down since it gained office in 1983. Each budget over the past five years has heralded deteriorating economic and social conditions. We have seen over one million unemployed, 29 per cent of our young people are out of work and have never had a job, our trade deficit has risen to $15.5 billion and our foreign debt has risen to over $160 billion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These woeful economic indicators and unemployment figures are the manifestation of this government's total inability to handle an economy. Sadly, there is very little reason to expect any improvement over the next three years. The official budget deficit is $16 billion. However, when government assets sales are taken into account&mdash;and these include the sale of the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, the sale of 19 per cent of the Commonwealth Bank, the Moomba-Sydney pipeline, the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation and others, to the value of $2.4 billion, with the inclusion of an extraordinary $3.2 billion profit from the Reserve Bank and $800 million from higher dividends from government business enterprises&mdash;the real government deficit would be in the vicinity of $23 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has engaged in some creative accounting, flogged the country's assets and raided the state governments' hollow logs. This is evident in the case of the rural adjustment scheme, where the states have been forced to return $123 million to Canberra to make their deficit look better, only to have it paid back to the states at a later date, something like the thimble and pea trick. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has spent $23 billion more than it took in revenue, despite cutting spending by $285 billion and increasing taxes by $32 billion over the next four years. That is after the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) told us time and time again that he would not raise taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are pages of quotes of the Prime Minister promising no tax increases, but no amount of quoting broken promises will remove the government from the other side of the House until the next election. I have always worked on the principle `winners are grinners and you've got to cop it', but the Prime Minister's deceit has made me determined that I will do everything possible to play a role in removing him from office at the next election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tax on fuel will rise by 5c a litre on diesel and unleaded fuel and by 10c a litre on leaded petrol, raising $1.4 billion in increased excise&mdash;increased excise which falls on two sectors of the economy that can afford it least. Our export sector, our great primary industries and mining industries, will be forced to pay the increased excise as they freight their commodities to the wharves, the abattoirs and the mills. How much more internationally competitive would those industries have been, how many more jobs would they have provided or created, and how much better off would our farmers have been if $2 billion had been removed from Australia's fuel excise bill instead of increasing it by $1.4 billion? The price of diesel fuel alone would have been 31c a litre cheaper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other hard-pressed sector of the community to bear the brunt of this fuel excise increase is the owners of cars over seven years old which require leaded petrol: the family man, the worker, the student, the unionist, the young married couple saving for a house, some in the ranks of the one million unemployed, and the men and women earning $23,000 a year or less&mdash;people whom the Prime Minister had picked up with his magnanimous gesture of $2 a week in a tax cut. All these people will suffer due to this unprecedented tax hike. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us be sure about this and be under no delusions. The increase in leaded petrol excise is a sop to the environmentalist and a severe blow to the family man and the worker whose total assets would be a mortgaged house and an older model car. Not only will they pay more for their fuel; the resale on their trade-in of a leaded petrol car will be much less. I know everyone has seen&mdash;and everyone would agree with me&mdash;that if there is ever a conflict of interest between the environmental lobby and the worker in this parliament, we can confidently put our money on the environmentalists. They have never lost a round yet. Senator Harradine would agree with that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the devastating problem of unemployment. Once again, I do not believe the government has shown any answers. Last year it spent $1.2 billion in employment programs in a desperate attempt to keep unemployment down. This year the government weighed in again with an extra $120 million to expand to 500,000 the number of places in the already existing training schemes of jobstart, jobtrain, jobskill, jobclub, skillshare, and the landcare and environmental programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite Mr Dawkins's repeated assertion that this budget is about jobs, one million people will find very little hope in it. They want to work, not to take part in the endless training schemes that are short term in duration and lead nowhere. While the misery of unemployment cuts across all age groups, the plight of the young unemployed, particularly those who have never had a job, is absolutely tragic. The one hundred thousand 15-year-olds to 19-year-olds who are unable to gain employment will not find anything in this budget which promises genuine job creation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are forty-seven thousand 15- to 19-year-old school leavers who have been unemployed for between three and nine months. There are 16,000 who have been trying to find their first job for more than a year and a further 6,000 who have spent over two years looking for their first job. In the 20- to 24-year-old group there are 31,000 people who have never worked at all and a core of 8,000 who have been looking for their first job for over two years. These young people are our future, yet how are they ever to have a future if they cannot find work and all the government can do is offer them extra places in meaningless training schemes?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now have a generation of young Australians who are unable to look at the future with any optimism whatsoever. Without the opportunity to work, saving, home ownership, marriage and family all become impossible goals; yet for our generation, endowed with full employment, these events were the standard milestones in all our lives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tightening-up of the Austudy criteria will impact particularly heavily on rural students and their families. The raising of the age threshold from 16 to 17 will impose severe financial hardship on these families. As of 1 January 1994, payment for students under the age of 17 will be transferred to the family payments scheme, which is rigorously means tested and assets tested. Many rural families will be hard-hit by the loss of these payments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rural students have been further disadvantaged by the government's axing of country area programs. This commendable program had provided rural students with access to music, drama and cultural activities, as well as career projects with local industry. The abolition of the program means that rural students are once again denied the opportunities available to students in the city. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the assistance for isolated children scheme, the government has made some recognition of the financial difficulties faced by rural families in educating their children. The National and Liberal parties have long campaigned for the abolition of the assets test for the isolated children scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's decision to remove the concessional tax treatment of unused annual leave and long service leave will also hit Australian families. We are being told that we must prepare for our retirement. When people have done that, they have been hit with these regressive taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In general terms, the 1993-94 budget is a horror budget for rural Australia. Primary industry has had government expenditure cut by $80 million this year after a fall of $98 million last year. The average level of farm business profits is minus $10,500 and the average farm debt is $114,800. This is not the time to remove support for primary industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has announced that the wool tax will increase from 8.5 per cent this year to 12 per cent for 1994-95. This will cost the average woolgrower another $2,000 a year at a time when producers are losing an average of $33,700. Last year 91 per cent of woolgrowers made a loss. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government&mdash;in fact, the whole parliament&mdash;should remember that in 1987 and 1988 the wool industry brought in export earnings of nearly $6 billion and in 1988-89 that figure rose to $6 billion, or 14.3 percent of Australia's total export earnings. The wool industry would be in a position to make that type of contribution again if it were able to keep the structure in place and the farmers on their land. The next two or three years will be critical for this great industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has budgeted $20 million to the Australian Wool Corporation this financial year for wool promotion. However, this grant is the final payment of the $75 million package that commenced in 1990. On all accounts, the level of wool production is already inadequate and woolgrowers will have to find another $50 million or $60 million to keep up their wool promotion in Australia, which now has roughly the same advertising budget as that for Mars bars or Kit Kats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Synthetic fibre manufacturers outspend the wool industry on promotion and research by at least three to one. I believe that the government must continue to support the promotion of this industry next year. It may be down on its knees now, but in good years it is one of the foundations of our export successes. The estimates for the rural adjustment scheme show that the government is attempting to hold down its expenditure in primary industry areas by increasing the states' contribution to the scheme. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know, but one does not give it in one hand and then say, `Look, the budget deficit is a bit high. We want it back and then we will give it back to you'. According to the budget, the total level of federal and state expenditure on the scheme will increase slightly in 1993 and 1994. The federal government's own outlays on the scheme, however, will fall sharply this financial year and its total outlays over the period will increase only slightly. The government has forced the states to promise to make up the shortfall by raiding the hollow log of the RAS reserves, although the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) has told them that they may have to increase their own spending on the scheme as well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Crean's threat shows that the states may have to make a choice between increasing their own rural adjustment budgets and reducing the number eligible for RAS assistance. Mr Crean must guarantee that no primary producer will be disadvantaged by the new funding arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet another attack on primary industry and the mining industry was opened up in the budget when the government signalled an alteration to the diesel fuel rebate scheme&mdash;a scheme that is sacrosanct to farmers, who are price takers on international markets. They must be super efficient to meet competition from heavily subsidised commodities under American EEP schemes and European common agricultural programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our farmers have two strikes against them before they even get on the tractor. The increase of 5c a litre on diesel fuel will increase their costs and erode further their profits. But to change the diesel fuel rebate by charging an administration fee of one per cent on the diesel rebate shows just how far this government is prepared to go to hurt primary industry. This reduction in the diesel rebate scheme can only be seen as a complete vote of no confidence by the government in the Australian farmer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The alteration to the scheme will increase revenue by $19.6 million this financial year, rising to $29.1 million next year. Who knows what will happen after that, once this legislation is in place. It puts the government in a strong position to raid the scheme when faced with a budget deficit. With this government's record of financial incompetence, I reckon we can expect more of those deficits in the future. The emasculating of the diesel rebate scheme legislation deserves special consideration by this Senate if it believes that our farmers must be cost efficient to stay internationally competitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government also seems set on a course to wreck Australia's biggest export earner&mdash;the Australian mining industry, which brought in $28 billion in export earnings last year and gave work to 160,000 employees. The Prime Minister is determined to carve out a name for himself in Australian history as the solver, with one piece of legislation, of all problems that have occurred over the last 200 years between blacks and whites. If a solution was so easy, it would have been done long ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1993 budget is a horror budget for Australia. It is a budget of misery and despair for the one million unemployed, especially the youth. It has received universal condemnation. Even the ACTU President was scathing in his criticism when he proclaimed that you could not defend the indefensible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to conclude by touching on the debate about the ability to block the government's tax legislation. The Prime Minister told caucus on Tuesday that he hoped the Senate would not vandalise the political process. Yesterday, the Treasurer cited the government's mandate as the reason the Senate should pass the bills. But the facts are clear: section 53 of the constitution clearly grants the Senate the power to reject tax bills. The Senate would hardly be vandalising the political process if it used its legitimate powers under the constitution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasurer says that the government has a mandate to implement its budget proposals. I do not remember seeing Mr Dawkins or the Prime Minister telling the farmers that their diesel fuel rebates would be slashed. I do not remember anyone going out and telling Queensland truck drivers and owners that they would have to pay an extra $6,000 a year for their fuel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can promise the Treasurer that we will not let them go through without a fight. The opposition has already decided to oppose the increase in the petrol excise, the across-the-board wholesale tax increases, the increases in the sales tax on wine and the tax on unused recreation and long service leave. This is not denying the government its budget by blocking supply but merely keeping it to its mandate of not increasing taxes.

It is in fact a highly regressive budget which is short on courage, short on vision and, most disgracefully of all, short on giving any real assistance to the 900,000 Australians who are unemployed.

But this government has not even seriously explored them. Those measures do include the selective provision of tariffs on a sector by sector basis. Government purchasing policy should give preference to Australian products. Anti-dumping measures, labelling laws and import quality controls should be stiffened. These are measures used all over the world.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Macdonald supports the government on education; this is where we feel differently. This government persists in seeing education as a mere money making commodity. Who voted for the higher education contribution scheme? Senator Macdonald and the Labor Party. HECS will hit students with crippling debt levels and education penalties and exacerbate the situation where students in higher education are being rushed through the system at breakneck speed in much the same way as products come off a conveyer belt.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After this budget students will be expected to repay their HECS debt faster and sooner and they will face further financial penalties if they fail to complete courses within a minimum time. There are increases in the rate of the HECS repayment and a lowering of the threshold at which students begin to repay their HECS debt, all at a time when graduate starting salaries are at a 16-year low. Students who want to undertake second degrees will have to think long and hard about whether or not it is worth being slugged with a double HECS debt. Students who fail to complete their courses within a minimum time face a 50 per cent increase in their HECS payment for each additional unit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These measures will have a significant effect on the ability of women to enter and complete tertiary education. Women are already five times less likely than men to repay their HECS debt by the age of 30. Yet here we have the government introducing measures which discriminate against women, particularly those of mature age, who are likely to have interrupted periods of study because of domestic and employment commitments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A key to ensuring equity of access in post-compulsory education is student financial assistance. The extension of the loans scheme in this budget signals the phasing out of Austudy grants. In addition, the abolition of secondary Austudy for 16-year-olds will affect over 130,000 students. Students who are eligible for assistance under the family payments scheme will lose at least $4 a week as a result of this measure and students from rural areas risk losing their benefits altogether with the application of a different assets test limit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats do not support the continued erosion of student financial assistance. Education is an investment in the future of this country.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Funding cuts to adult literacy programs are astonishingly short-sighted when 10 to 20 per cent of our population is functionally illiterate. Increases in charges for English as a second language courses make absolutely no sense if we want to ensure that people migrating to this country can contribute as active citizens. These moves are not sensible. Ultimately, they will not even be cost effective. They represent cost cutting desperation from members of a cash strapped government, most of whom, I might add, like most of us here in this chamber, got their education for free. I take great pride in saying that this budget confirms the Democrats as the only political party that is committed to a fair and accessible education system for all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the health portfolio, we have the charming thought of the Minister for Health (Senator Richardson) playing footsy every month with the AMA. I really worry about whose interests will be served in this respect; it certainly does not seem to be the patients' or the taxpayers' interests, if the two major health measures in the budget are anything to go by. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, the government has announced that it is ending the $42 Medicare rebate for basic eye tests other than for pensioners and health care card holders. The estimated saving is meant to be $48 million this financial year and $90 million next financial year. Quite clearly, this is a cynical, desperate cost-cutting exercise. Senator Richardson does not seem too concerned; he knows this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The plan is also, if you will excuse the pun, extraordinarily short-sighted because it will result in a decline in the eye health of Australians. Eye diseases will go undetected as people defer their eye care because of the cost. It will place a substantial additional financial burden on families where eye conditions are hereditary or where children suffer from ongoing eye problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One optometrist has written to me that he knows of many children whose vision problems have actually caused learning delays of several years. What does that ultimately cost the community? This leads me to seriously question whether savings can genuinely be made here. Aside from those extra costs brought about when children and adults neglect their eye care, it could easily be the case that, instead of going to an optometrist, people will end up seeing an ophthalmologist via a referral from their GP at three or four times the cost of Medicare.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before dinner I was outlining to the Senate a range of positive initiatives in the budget, which apparently members of the opposition have not read, directed at assisting the rural sector. These initiatives clearly demonstrate the government's consideration and understanding of the rural sector in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst I do not want to comment on the broad expanse of the budget in this debate, I would say, in regard to the three contributions that have been made earlier tonight, that whilst I do not agree with a considerable amount of Senator Kernot's contribution or indeed Senator Boswell's contribution, at least they do play to the main game. All I can say about the contribution of Senator Hill&mdash;and I am sure it was reflected in Dr Hewson's speech&mdash;is that we could best summarise their attitude as one of venting their spleen. If that is the way the opposition is going to approach the government of this country over the next three years, well I rather pity it. If it continues to adopt that attitude, then it will lose the next election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Boswell's major contribution did make reference to a couple of points that are pertinent to this issue of assistance to the rural sector. I want to make reference to a couple of those matters before I conclude my remarks. Firstly, he made reference to opposition to the so-called retrospective application of the tax on untaken long service leave and annual leave. That is a bit rich coming from the opposition, given that we consistently get complaints from the opposition that it does not believe in long service leave. Whilst the opposition does accept a certain amount of annual leave, it is fairly nebulous in its approach to annual leave. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Boswell made a big song and dance about a one per cent administration fee on the diesel fuel rebate. But the fact is that the diesel fuel rebate will cost over $100 million more as a result of this budget. There is a relatively minor affect of the administrative charge; it is less than one per cent of the total payout of the diesel fuel rebate to the farming community. Despite that administrative charge, it will still cost another $100 million. That is a recognition of the unique position that the rural community has in the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of programs that I referred to before dinner that I want to comment upon now. I referred to the Tasmanian wheat freight subsidy scheme. I referred to the rural adjustment scheme. I do not know how Senator Boswell reads the budget, but he actually claims that in the budget there is actually a cut in funding; there is actually an increase in funding. Much of the additional moneys will go to state governments and, as Senator Boswell acknowledged, it is being kept in hollow logs. We have paying money over to the states since 1982 and they have not been reimbursing that money to the farming sector in the proper way. The government is now insisting that they do that. In addition to that, we are putting aside an extra allocation for the rural adjustment scheme; yet the opposition is complains. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Boswell made absolutely no reference to the reforms of the Australian Quarantine Service, AQIS. As I mentioned earlier, there will be a massive change to the approach of the Quarantine Service which will lead to a freeze on charges over the next four years and a reduction in charges in many areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was at the rural press club breakfast this morning and many in the audience were quite praiseworthy of our approach to the AQIS reforms; yet there is no word of acknowledgment of those reforms from Senator Boswell or Senator Brownhill. As those on the other side know, AQIS charges is the issue about which we get the most representations and most correspondence; yet there was not one mention about it by the opposition tonight. They like to conveniently forget these sorts of important structural reforms that are taking place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a couple of other programs that I would like to mention. These were actually contained in our election manifesto. Again we are accused of not implementing our election promises. These matters were included in our election policy platform and they are three of 10 election promises that I referred to and read out earlier tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to the three new programs to enhance our export industries in the agribusiness sector. Firstly, there is the world best practice incentive scheme. This is a central component of this government's agribusiness development initiatives. It will accelerate the introduction in Australia of a culture based on world best practice by encouraging groups at all levels of the production chain to benchmark their current practices against equivalent practices overseas. Secondly, we have the rural development incentive scheme which is focused on encouraging community and regional business groups to identify local development opportunities. Thirdly, we have the rural enterprise network program. Those are three new programs being funded to the sum of $22.6 million over the next four years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have taken quite a considerable personal interest in the clean food export program. One of the central thrusts for this country over the next decade is to improve our export program in the food industries, and central to that is the clean food export program. As part of that program this government has announced funding of $5 million for a special pilot promotion to be launched in Taiwan. Taiwan has been targeted as a market for this program. I am not going to speak in detail on this matter tonight, but it is a very interesting program and it will certainly be useful to see the sorts of results that come from this approach. There is an ongoing commitment in this budget to a range of horticultural programs, including the Australian Horticultural Corporation, the Horticultural Policy Council and the task force of which I am chair which is currently examining a range of horticultural industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I go back to the 31 initiatives, I make a comment on the alleged increase in the wool tax. When we put the wool package through earlier this year, 15 or 16 opposition senators commented on the wool tax package and certainly demonstrated a fairly significant knowledge of that package. I can recall a number of opposition members referring to the fact that the package contained a reduction of the prescribed wool tax&mdash;which is 12 per cent&mdash;to a rate of 8.5 per cent for one year only. Yet we had media releases from the opposition touting the proposition that this budget contained an increase in the wool tax. That is not correct. There has been no increase in the wool tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current prescribed tax level in the legislation is 12 per cent. It will revert from 8.5 per cent to 12 per cent at the end of this financial year. There is nothing new in that. I have here the minister's press statement which was released in April. When we debated that issue earlier in the year, those opposite demonstrated an understanding of that. But they conveniently forget that in the budget context and for the purposes of this debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Indeed, those opposite conveniently forget the range of positive programs that is contained in this budget. As I warned them earlier tonight&mdash;and I do it quite sincerely&mdash;they continue to generalise, they continue to assume that all is wrong. The motion reflects `a total lack of consideration and understanding'. One cannot come to that conclusion from reading this budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have read out the programs for which this budget has provided funding and I will do so again because it is apparent that those opposite have not read the initiatives contained in the budget for the rural sector. The enhanced rural adjustment scheme&mdash;RAS as it is commonly known&mdash;has received an increase in funding from approximately $200 million to $400 million. Other measures include programs to enhance agribusiness&mdash;an election commitment; boosting the clean food export program&mdash;another election commitment; assistance to isolated children; the rural counselling program&mdash;another election commitment; upgrading rural telecommunications&mdash;another election commitment; telecentres&mdash;another election commitment. In the area of rural development there will be an evaluation of community based approaches&mdash;another election commitment. There will be an overhaul of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service and an overhaul of the Australian Geological Survey Organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Efficiency gains in the department is a matter which those opposite have not mentioned tonight. The administrative costs of the department are being reduced by 20 per cent. For an opposition that is continually crying out for efficiencies in government administration, that is a very significant reduction in the administrative costs of the department. The budget further includes: savings in the Bureau of Resource Sciences; cost recovery for managing Commonwealth fisheries; reductions in the Australian Fisheries Management Authority staffing&mdash;again, the opposition failed to even acknowledge that; fisheries research and development improvements; a national residue survey&mdash;very critical in terms of our export performance; energy and greenhouse initiatives&mdash;another election commitment; and the national Landcare program. Senator Boswell seemed to scoff at that program earlier this evening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things that impressed me in my position as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy when visiting rural and regional Australia over the past four months is the clear cultural shift in the rural community towards landcare over the past decade. It has been very widely embraced and almost universally praised. We continue to expand that program in this budget. A further budget measure relates to the Murray-Darling Basin natural resources management strategy&mdash;another critical initiative to overcome many of the problems faced in the Murray-Darling Basin area because of the overlapping political jurisdictions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is the New South Wales flood mitigation; there has been no mention of that from the opposition. That is another election commitment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support Senator Brownhill's motion, but I do have some concerns about the absolute language which he uses in the motion. I understand Senator Sherry's frustration with such words as `a total lack of consideration and understanding'. The Australian Democrats support some measures in this budget, such as counselling services and the abolition of the assets test for isolated students.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have learned over the years to be very suspicious of over the top and absolute statements. However, given this qualification, I am still prepared to support the direction of the motion because it is correct in stating:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that the increases in taxes and charges will have devastating effects on the people in rural and regional Australia . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Regardless of whether the government tinkers at the edges of the problem, as this budget does, the situation in the bush remains that the people, the industry, the families and the communities are desperate. There are families who, going back generations, have never asked for help in their lives, but who are asking for that kind of help now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When in St George a week ago I talked to a number of cotton growers who are some of the best farm managers in Australia. One of them, a friend of mine for many years and someone who would never ask for help, said to me, `We will cope with this drought as long as you can prevent any increase in taxes and charges. We just cannot cop any further increase in our overhead costs'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the past few weeks, government ministers, such as Simon Crean and Graham Richardson, have visited centres in western Queensland. To their credit they have listened to the people and expressed concern. They promised to make sure that bureaucratic blocks to assistance and social security would be removed. But I need to remind this house that rural families have special needs and so often that assistance and those social security allowances do not reach them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I give another example of a family in Bollon. At the moment the three sons are living in Toowoomba, which is 500 kilometres away. They receive Jobsearch allowance and they cannot find a job. The family is desperate for them to go home because they certainly need help. Yet, if they go home, they will lose the Jobsearch allowance. If they go home, the family will not even have enough income to feed them. I know the father, and he is so close to the edge. If this were an isolated example, then one could dismiss it. But the same story is repeated over and over again across Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although we recognise some minor assistance in this budget, in terms of the situation which we face in Australia, in terms of the desperation of thousands of families and hundreds of rural communities, the budget simply does not even come close. I know that it is difficult to design a social safety net to cover every circumstance, but I believe that for the sake of rural families it is worth trying. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This morning I asked a question of the minister representing the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. Although I give him credit for trying, he did not seem to fully understand the point I was making. So I want to put it on the record. Under this budget 16-year-old students at secondary schools will no longer receive Austudy; rather they will be paid through the family payments system. There are two problems with this. Firstly, the level of benefit payable to those students under Austudy used to be $64.90 per week. This will be cut to $60.80 per week, made up of about $10 in basic family payment and $50 in additional family payment, and it is available only if parental income is below $21,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly&mdash;and this is the serious issue&mdash;the assets limit on Austudy is around $700,000, whereas the new assets limit to apply for the basic family payment has just been slashed to $550,000 in this budget. Worse still, the assets limit on the additional family payment is just $363,500. The majority of farms are nominally worth far more than those asset levels but are still producing very low levels of income. I am concerned that much of the saving, which the government estimates at $5 million for this year and $20 million, $24 million and $27 million respectively for the next three years, will come from the pockets of rural students at a time when they can least afford it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the minister did say was that the government has removed the assets test from the supplementary boarding allowance paid under the assistance for isolated children scheme. We applaud this, but the government is simply not consistent. The minister's press release announcing this initiative stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is to ensure that people living in isolated areas were not excluded from receiving additional financial assistance for schooling because of assets that yielded little or no income.</PARA>
<PARA>We agree with the minister. That is a very good principle, and the Australian Democrats have been saying that for a long time. Now I want him to apply the same principle to our 16-year-old rural students. Indeed, the principle should be extended to a whole range of allowances and social security payments. I trust that this time, if we bring that initiative into this chamber, the coalition will support us. Finally, I am glad that Senator Brownhill has proposed this motion in the Senate, but I want to be assured that his words and those of other members of the opposition will be backed by action. The Democrats will look for the opposition's support to this end in the coming weeks. </PARA>

It will provide a major focus to develop industry in rural Australia. It needs to be said that, in spite of the opposition's rhetoric, the government has retained the diesel fuel rebate to primary producers, reducing fuel costs to that sector by $900 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberal and National parties are shackled in any debate on rural communities by the narrowness of their vision as to who the rural communities are. The interests of the rural sector are much broader than the farm gate. We have heard nothing tonight from Senator Brownhill about workers in rural Australia. We have heard nothing about the sorts of conditions which many people in this country are facing. Their view of the rural sector consists mainly of farmers and excludes the citizens of rural cities and towns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us just look at a few of the 100 election promises and commitments delivered in the current budget which will give direct benefits to rural Australians. In terms of employment, education and training the Commonwealth Employment Service will be upgraded, including enhanced offsite facilities, to service clients in remote areas and telephone based client services. Some 300 open access learning centres will be established throughout the country to help open learning students gain access to a variety of technological aids and support services at a cost of $52 million provided through the 1992-93 budget and into the 1993-95 period. A figure of $3.7 million over the next three years will be available for hostel accommodation for rural school students. The assets test for supplementary boarding allowance under assistance for isolated children will be abolished. This will help students living in remote areas and cost the government $14 million over the next four years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of transport and communications, a national transport planning task force will be established to assess Australia's national transport infrastructure, to meet future demands and to develop priorities for infrastructure in the long-term at a cost of $1.5 million. One such project, for instance, is the Alice Springs to Darwin rail link proposal which is receiving $3 million to complete the survey work. A figure of $1 million has been provided to establish an expert advisory group to develop a blueprint for extending optic fibre networks to the majority of houses, schools and businesses in Australia. This has enormous implications for assessing optic fibre technology for rural Australians. Also, $19.2 million over the four years will be available to extend the ABC radio station JJJ to 44 areas with populations greater than 20,000. This will enable 3.7 million additional people, mainly in rural areas, to access this excellent service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In tourism, the government is committed to promoting regional areas and has given significant stimulus to regional tourism, which in turn means more jobs in these regions. In the current budget, $42 million over four years has been allocated to develop tourism in rural and regional Australia. In addition $23 million is available to implement a regional tourism development program, to improve the capacity of regional areas in order to attract both international and domestic tourists. Assistance for the development of farm based tourism will be part of the new special interest tourists program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In health, over $16,000 million&mdash;that is, a nine per cent increase&mdash;will be spent on health for Australians this financial year. Many people in rural Australia will benefit directly from this. Of particular note is the senior health card, the benefits of which Senator Richardson outlined to the Senate today. This will benefit over 200,000 non-pensioner retirees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of women, of great benefit to rural women will be the new home child care allowance of up to $60 a fortnight which recognises the workload and enormous contribution of women as home makers who care full-time for children. There will be a new pilot program and referral service for women seeking to escape domestic violence in rural and remote areas. This service will provide support as well as advice on housing, finance and legal issues. In employment and industry, there will be the creation of jobs and help to unemployed people as a major thrust of the 1993-94 budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unlike the opposition, which seems obsessed with the price of petrol as the one and only concern of those who live outside our major urban cities, the Labor government recognises that unemployment severely affects the lives of all Australians, city and country people alike. The federal Labor government will not accept a situation where people are condemned to long-term unemployment. The key to more jobs is to get industry moving and to facilitate economic growth. The injection of almost $30 million to assist companies become more export oriented and innovative will greatly assist many regional and rural industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those on the other side of this chamber deliberately forget that much of the $600 million this government spends annually on industry programs and bounties goes to helping rural communities.

There will be closure of schools in rural Victoria, but we have heard nothing on that score from those opposite?  In fact, what we see in Victoria from the National Party is that the price of coalition is silence.

We heard first of all tonight from Senator Sherry as the main apologist for this budget, and we have just heard from Senator Carr in similar vein. These people are very game to defend any aspects of this budget. The microphone was on the other night when Martin Ferguson did not realise it was on and he said, `How do you defend the indefensible?'. That really sums up this budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We heard 31 initiatives from Senator Sherry. Let me give the Senate a few other initiatives that are in this budget: a tobacco tax rise, a HECS tax rise, a petrol tax rise, a fringe benefits tax rise, a wholesale sales tax rise, a credit union tax&mdash;that will not be a great problem in the rural sector because they have not got any money to save after what this government has done for them&mdash;and a wine and cider sales tax. That is the tax I want to concentrate on tonight because of its devastating impact on the wine industry, particularly on my own region, the Hunter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Eric Fitzgibbon, who is the honourable member for the Hunter, actually increased his vote at the last election. I do not think he would be game to show his face in his electorate after what this government has done to the major industry of the Hunter. Where was he when the government was framing the budget and increasing sales tax on wine by 55 per cent which next year goes up to 60 per cent?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, it is not just the Hunter that is affected. The wine industry is one of our most successful domestic and export industries and it has a base in most states. These measures brought down by this government attack rural communities across a very wide range of Australian country areas. The Australian wine industry is made up of 5,000 wine grape growers, approximately 600 winemakers, and it has an annual turnover of $1 1/2 billion per annum. Wine is a very high value added product and its sales are booming in world markets. It also now has the potential to establish markets in the areas to our north. As Mr Perry Gunner, Chief Executive of the Orlando Wyndham Group, said last February in Canberra at the National Agricultural and Resource Outlook Conference:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . apart from unforeseen natural disasters or major economic upsets and trade wars, the single factor which stands between the Australian wine industry and the achievement of its $1 billion export target by the year 2000 is the availability of financial resources.</PARA>
<PARA>That was, of course, until the Keating government brought down its budget on Tuesday and slugged the wine industry with an increase in sales tax from 20 per cent to 31 per cent in one hit&mdash;and rising the following year. The increase in the sales tax on wine from 20 per cent to 31 per cent is a devastating attack on this industry. To quote Mr Brian Croser, President of the Winemakers Federation of Australia:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A 55% increase in sales tax at this absolutely critical moment of the development of the modern Australian wine industry is stupid in the extreme.</PARA>
<PARA>Unfortunately, the Winemakers Federation of Australia is expected to announce that it is revising its expected overseas sales target for the year 2000 from $1 billion down to $500 million&mdash;a halving of the expectation&mdash;due to this government's measures announced this week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A large number of Australian wine companies have recently undertaken to raise a record $1.2 billion in investment for this industry. This was needed to meet the original $1 billion export sales target. According to Mr Croser, the investment and the export targets are at risk because of this unexpected and savagely discriminatory sales tax increase. An example is the statement delivered today by the manager of Penfolds wines that its planned vine planting program worth $100 million will now have to be reviewed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is tragic because this industry is a model for all other value added industries in this country. It is internationally competitive and based on sustainable natural and technological advantages. But most important, according to the Winemakers Federation, is that the very competitive and price sensitive domestic market is the springboard for any export success. According to Mr Croser:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The domestic market&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>which makes up three-quarters of Australian wine sales&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">provides the scale and opportunity for product development and is the anchor of investor confidence.</PARA>
<PARA>The actions of this Labor government are criticised by Mr Gunner of Orlando Wyndham. He said that, with this tax increase, `the industry had been chopped off at the knees'. When I questioned Senator Gareth Evans in this place yesterday, he completely missed the point in his answer. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the increase in the wholesale sales tax will not, in our judgment, make a major dent, in any significant way, in an industry that is booming, that is doing brilliantly well in terms of export markets, and that we fully expect not only to survive but also to flourish locally.</PARA>
<PARA>It is clear that the government cannot see how important the domestic market is as a launching pad for international sales and how the domestic market will be savaged by this tax increase. Senator Gareth Evans certainly is not listening to the winemakers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The actions of this Labor government are nothing short of a betrayal of the wine industry. Having survived Labor's tax imposts in the 1980s, the Australian wine industry has been tripped up on this hurdle during this budget. The ill-conceived actions by this government will destroy confidence in the wine industry and its production and in the marketing plans of those investors who were beginning to be supportive of the wine industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of Labor's budget, the Australian economy will suffer because the $300 million in export sales that we now have will not grow to $1 billion by the end of the century, as previously projected. The already reeling regional economies of Australia will take another body blow from the Keating government's careless disregard for the struggles of the small business and rural enterprise battlers, including the 600 small winemakers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the Winemakers Federation, there are over 5,000 independent grape growers. These are dispersed among the regional economies and they will be affected greatly by this government's actions. This is at a time when many of them, having suffered from the rural recession and the inappropriate policies of these Labor governments, are on a knife edge. This will result in many of them being sent under and going bankrupt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very important to remember that many of the winegrowers in Australia are not export oriented. The export side of the wine industry is dominated by six very large producers. The other 600 or so small, mainly family run wineries are currently having a very tough time in the domestic market, just like any other small businesses in Keating's engineered recession. According to Australia's biggest wine producer, Penfolds, as a result of these measures, Australia's domestic wine consumption will drop by five or six per cent. This is a far cry from Senator Evans's misleading and falsely optimistic comments of yesterday. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no case whatever for taxpayer support of poorly managed rural businesses, including where wrong investment or production decisions lead to commercial failure. Government should not be in the business of subsidising primary producers every time they meet adverse conditions. History suggests that government intervention in the rural economy does more harm than good. Indeed, in this area, the 19th century philosopher Thoreau was correct in his view when he said that government never furthered any enterprise but by the alacrity and speed with which it got out of its way.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2F4">Senator BURNS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, but Senator Calvert has not attacked me yet, and I know Senator Crane well, of course. The report states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The present Scheme came into effect on 1 January 1989 following a review in 1988 as a result of which major changes were incorporated into new legislation&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>They were changes for the good brought about by a Labor government&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">with the objectives of operating the Scheme in a more flexible and innovative way and to more closely match the requirements for assistance of individual farmers.</PARA>
<PARA>Those opposite should note that&mdash;to match the requirements of individual farmers. Senators Brownhill, Crane and Calvert know that we listened very carefully to all those farmers. That is what we have done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We looked at the question of improving the farm. Part A of the scheme provides assistance for structural adjustment purposes. It goes to these questions: capital restructuring, increasing farm size, increasing capital intensity, changing farm programs and adopting technological developments. Assistance takes the form of a 50 per cent interest subsidy on commercial loans. Honourable senators opposite asked me what we were doing; this is what we are doing. Grants and loans are also available to eligible farmers to improve their farm management skills or to obtain professional advice to improve their farm performance. Surely  the opposition is not objecting to that. It seems to me to be a fairly rational and reasonable approach. We do care, otherwise we would not be pursuing such a program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part C of the rural adjustment scheme provides assistance to those people who leave the farm. Honourable senators opposite would say, `That is their problem. They made a commercial decision. Let them go down the drain'. We do not say that. We say that they are human beings and that they should be looked after. The community should assist them. Part C provides assistance to the farmers who have been assessed as being without prospects of a return to profitable operation. This provision enables them to leave the industry and it takes the form of household support payments and re-establishment assistance. Household support payments are equivalent to jobsearch or newstart allowances. We have done that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Brownhill asked whether that should be so. Senator Crane asked whether that should be. Senator Calvert asked whether that should be so. We did that. Now we get attacked for trying to help rural people. The rural adjustment scheme's annual report says that once the farmer has left the land or made firm contractual arrangements to do so, a means tested re-establishment grant of up to $34,000 as of 30 June 1992 may be payable. The grant is indexed according to the quarterly consumer price index. One cannot do much more, when people are really down and out and finished, than assist them to leave in a way which enables them to start a life somewhere else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we get to the Commonwealth rural counselling program. It was interesting to hear the comment Senator Troeth made about standing on her own two feet&mdash;you make the wrong decision and out the door you go. As a very young person I first began to understand people on the land. I found that in those days, which was quite a while ago, people on the land were not highly educated. They really did not understand accountancy. If you talked about cash flow, they did not know what it was. So some farming families do have a problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the family farmers are a very important unit in our community; I agree with Senator Troeth about that. So we decided that we should assist in that area. In 1986 we established the Commonwealth rural counselling program, with Commonwealth assistance provided under the authority of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. It provides grants that help rural communities to operate local counselling services which support and advise farm families in times of financial difficulty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our committee heard from people in that community who had been really happy to get that sort of assistance. In some cases it had saved them. That was not done at the initiative of people. It would not have happened if the government had not assisted. What it did was help farm families identify their options and successfully adapt to change. Opposition senators may say that if people make the wrong commercial decision or they are not smart enough to run their farm then they will go down the drain. We reject that sort of proposition. We say that these people need assistance. Let us give it to them. The community will assist in that regard. We made sure that the rural counsellors were required to have experience in a wide range of issues affecting the rural community and were well able to handle the task they were given. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In October 1991, Commonwealth RAS funding was increased by $30.64 million under parts A and B of the scheme and a new modified provision for farmers was introduced in December because of continuing difficult financial conditions, largely the result of a prolonged dry spell. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rural telecommunications services will be upgraded through funding of $4 million over the next four years for the standard telephone service network. Telecommunications is very important for rural economic development. Difficulties such as congestion, call drop-out and delays in servicing will be targeted so that areas most in need gain the benefit of this funding. It is fairly clear that government intervention and government ownership of Telecom over the years has served the rural community fairly well. I would challenge anyone on the other side to argue with that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The national landcare program funding of $105 million will be allocated in 1993-94. The national landcare program includes $14.2 million for community land care activities, $12.1 million for land management, $10.2 million for catchment management, $1.6 million to improve sewage treatment at identified hot spots, and $11.1 million for flood plain management projects. All are meant to assist the rural community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An additional $1.2 million, on top of $2.8 million in the 1992 budget, has been provided for the establishment of telecentres in rural communities. The telecentres are community owned and operated centres where people can access modern computer and information technology for the purpose of increasing local employment, improving business, telemarketing of rural communities, and the delivery of community services, including education and training. Total funding of $4 million for the telecentre program will provide increased public access to this technology and the potential benefits it can bring to rural and remote areas of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is not any doubt, given the information that I have just placed before the Senate, that this government does care about the rural community and has for a long time&mdash;far more so than people on the other side. They may have a particular bias towards the rural community; that is their right. I myself have a particular bias towards trade unionists and the workers and lower paid people in the community. But we have done more for those people in the rural community than those who pretend to represent them. Those opposite had better lift their game. We have. </PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)condemns the Keating Labor Government for their continuing and callous disregard for this vital sector of the Australian economy.</PARA>
<PARA>In 30 minutes of debate Senator Burns did not address the issues of that motion. Instead, he implied and he insinuated that the people of rural and regional Australia were not highly educated&mdash;that they were uneducated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw Senator Burns's attention to a statement made by one of his Labor mates in the House of Representatives earlier today. He referred to another person in that chamber being unduly affected by unintended consequences. That is not much different from the attitude and the style shown by Senator Burns. He came in here tonight and spoke for 30 minutes, and for about 27 of those 30 minutes he read from various reports that he has been a party to. All he could do was read the scripted words of some researcher. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why did Senator Burns not address the response to the report of the Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs? It is because the government has not yet made a response. There has been no response to that report. The honourable senator has not addressed the issues of any government response; they were issues and initiatives put forward. Why did he not get to the responses? Why did he not detail those issues in the budget that had resulted from those reports? He could not because they are not there. They are totally missing from that particular area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Burns admits to his biases towards the waterfront. They are with the trade unions, but they are not with the people of rural and regional Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They do produce the wealth. They do employ and provide jobs for the trade unionists on Senator Burns's wharf and in other areas. This government has had to expand RAS because of the deteriorating economic circumstances and provide additional counselling services. Why do they have to be provided? It is only because of the economic vandalism of this Labor government and the results this has produced throughout rural and regional Australia. Care and compassion is not evident anywhere in what the Labor Party is doing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me refer to the three very important industries that underpin rural and remote Australia. The first is the essential farming of Australia. Whether it be the wool, wheat, beef, fishing or pearling industries of Australia, every one of those is going to be faced with unintended&mdash;Senator Burns would argue&mdash;consequences from this budget. They will send their costs skyrocketing; they will affect all of those industries, all of those businesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about the mining industry which underpins rural and remote Australia and the people who are employed in mines throughout Australia? Nothing the Labor Party is doing will assist those people. What about tourism, one of the exciting and very vital industries in Australia today? Tourism underpins remote and rural Australia, and yet this 1993 federal Labor Party budget will send costs skyrocketing. This budget will affect the industry of tourism so drastically that we will need more counselling services. We are going to need more underpinning of rural adjustment-type schemes; we are going to need more of this social nipple, special engineering that we have to have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Brownhill's motion refers very properly to the effects on people in rural and remote parts of Australia. Senator Burns does not refer to the people; he refers to the `human beings' throughout rural and remote Australia. What about the elderly who live in rural and remote Australia? What about the costs of services to the elderly such as Meals on Wheels and other essential services, for example the cost of their electricity, rates and transportation? The costs to the elderly are going to skyrocket. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about women in rural and remote Australia? What about the women who underpin so much of what happens throughout Australia? We hear about a new child-care allowance; but it is to replace the dependent spouse rebate which is linked to the zone rebate and provides additional services. The families who are now going to lose the dependent spouse rebate are going to lose the consequential deductions that they get from their zone rebates. Women are going to be worse off because this Labor government is just fiddling the books and sticking in different, new schemes that it thinks are good. They are just words to tout in an attempt to get to different interest groups. What about the children of rural and remote Australia? What about their education, child care, and the cost of transport in getting them to and from school throughout rural and remote Australia?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also have to look very carefully at what this budget is doing to the disadvantaged throughout the rural and remote parts of Australia: the disabled people, the people with mental illness&mdash;more of them, unfortunately, because of the economic vandalism of the Labor government. What about the Aborigines of Australia? The consequences of this budget will force up the costs in every Aboriginal community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These consequences will force up the costs in the nursing homes, in all of the mental hospitals, for all the services. The government has been saying that its dream is to have more disabled people working in open employment. Where is the opportunity for any of those people to participate in open employment when the government itself admits that it is doing nothing for unemployment; that it is doing nothing to create jobs? There will be no additional opportunities for disabled people to participate and the government's response therefore will be that the consequential flows to those parts of the budget are going to be very hard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This budget is a disgrace. Senator Burns's contribution tonight was to sit back and read scripts that other researchers have written for other reports suggesting government action which his own party did not even pick up. Why did he not come in here and list all of those recommendations and then list alongside them which ones had been picked up?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has not even been a government response to the report in question. Just because he had his name on the front of the report as the chairman, Senator Burns thinks it should go down in history as the Burns report. We ought to burn the damn thing because it did not have any effect on this year's budget.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this Bill is to introduce amendments to the Pig Industry Act 1986, the Primary Industry Councils Act 1991, the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation Act 1977, the Meat Research Corporation Act 1985 and the Australian Meat and Live-stock Industry Selection Committee Act 1984.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Pig Industry amendments are designed to improve the effectiveness of the pig industry's statutory policy body in providing advice to Government and industry on issues affecting all sectors of the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments to the Meat and Live-stock Corporation and Meat Research Corporation Acts enable levy motions put to annual general meetings of industry stakeholders to be passed on a simple majority on each of the appropriate registers, and no confidence motions passed by two-thirds of total votes cast with a minimum of 50 per cent of the votes cast on the two producer registers and 50 per cent of the votes cast on the processors register. The amendments will also allow the lodgment of proxy forms by facsimile.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other amendments to the Meat Research Corporation Act will bring the Meat Research Corporation's functions and operational powers into line with those presently available to the majority of other Primary Industry research and development corporations which have been established under the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989. The opportunity will also be taken to remove the 65 year age limit on Board membership from the Meat Research Corporation Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments to the Australian Meat and Live-stock Industry Selection Committee Act will replace one of the three members of the Committee appointed on the nomination of the Australian Meat Exporters' Federal Council with one appointed on the nomination of the Meat and Allied Trades Federation of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill will establish the Australian Pig Industry Council under the Primary Industry Councils Act 1991 to replace the Australian Pig Industry Policy Council, which was established in 1987 under the Pig Industry Act 1986. This change gives the new Council enhanced powers and operational functions so that it can more effectively perform its role of coordinating and formulating industry policy. Also it will allow for funding of the Council by the Commonwealth Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the Primary Industry Councils Act 1991 industry councils are required to review and report on the strategic direction of the industry; to inquire into and report to the Minister on matters affecting the pig industry that the Council or the Minister consider warrant investigation or action; to convene industry review conferences; and to convene regular meetings of chairpersons of the other relevant statutory bodies in the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The passage of the Primary Industry Councils Act 1991 provided the catalyst for the Department of Primary Industries and Energy to review the Australian Pig Industry Policy Council with the object of improving its effectiveness.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The review found that there was a need to clarify the Council's role and functions. It found a need to improve communication of the Council's work. It suggested that the Council needed to be financially independent, and that it should be staffed full time and located in Canberra. It recommended that there should be a minor adjustment to membership to better represent those with a direct investment in the industry, with associated interest groups being accommodated through working groups.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The review also concluded that the industry needed to take a more strategic approach to securing its future. At the moment only about one per cent of domestic production is exported. Clearly, the future for the pig industry lies in developing an export orientation. The level of investment in technology in the industry needs to be increased, and greater efficiency and rationalisation in the processing sector achieved.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The review concluded that the Council would be in a better position to address these matters if it was brought under the Primary Industry Councils Act 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under this Act, provision is made for the establishment of a Council and the specification of its membership by amending the Schedule to the Act. This Bill adds the Australian Pig Industry Council to the Schedule and it is proposed that the new Council will begin its operations on Royal Assent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Besides the Chairperson, membership will include three persons nominated by the Pork Council of Australia, one person nominated from each of the Meat and Allied Trades Federation of Australia and the National Processors Association, and the Chairpersons of each of the Australian Pork Corporation and the Pig Research and Development Corporation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The anticipated operating costs of the Australian Pig Industry Council, which will be met by the Government, will be about $205,000 in a full year. The present Council is funded by industry levies paid to the Australian Pork Corporation. This arrangement is inconsistent with the principle of separating industry policy development from statutory marketing authority arrangements. Government funding will remove this dependency and will bring it into line with other industry council funding arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also provides for the termination of the Australian Pig Industry Policy Council and establishes transition arrangements for the orderly transfer to the Australian Pig Industry Council. These arrangements ensure that all outstanding liabilities at the date of commencement will be met by the Australian Pork Corporation. There is also a provision for the old Council to continue beyond the date of commencement for the sole purpose of preparing and submitting a final annual report to Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also amends the Pig Industry Act 1986 to recognise the Pork Council of Australia as the eligible representative producer body for the purposes of Australian Pork Corporation accountability and membership of the Australian Pork Corporation Selection Committee. The industry formed the Pork Council of Australia in March 1992 to supersede the Australian Pork Producers' Federation as the sole nationally representative body of pig producers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments to the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation Act 1977 and the Meat Research Corporation Act 1985 will change the requirements for passing motions at annual general meetings. Levy motions will now be passed on a simple majority on each of the appropriate registers. Currently it requires 75 per cent vote against a levy motion put by a Corporation for it to be overturned. No confidence motions will be passed by two-thirds of total votes cast. Additionally, at least 50 per cent of the votes cast on the two producer registers and 50 per cent of the votes cast on the processors register must be in favour of the motion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments will give effect to the Government's decision that levy motions at Annual general meetings should be passed on a simple majority. This also has the support of the meat and livestock industry organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new arrangements will ensure that any successful no confidence motion, which represents a very serious step for the industry to take, is based on strong industry support.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments will also enable the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation and Meat Research Corporation to accept by facsimile forms appointing other people as proxies for people entitled to vote at Annual general meetings. This issue was raised on the floor of the Annual general meetings held in November last year. Both Corporations have subsequently requested the Government to make these amendments, and the Government has been pleased to do so, believing it will allow greater producer participation in Annual general meetings, particularly for those producers in isolated areas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill further amends the Meat Research Corporation Act 1985 to give the Corporation a clear commercialisation function and to allow the Corporation to carry out routine operations and activities with the same level of confidence and efficiency as is available to research and development corporations which come under the umbrella of the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The additional function of facilitation of the dissemination, adoption and commercialisation of meat and livestock industry research and development results will now be included in the Meat Research Corporation Act. This function has been provided for by the Meat Research Corporation Regulations as an interim measure. The clear statement of this function in the Act will enable the Corporation to confidently develop and pursue initiatives in the increasingly important area of technology transfer, particularly commercialisation activities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The provision in the Act requiring the Minister to approve agreements and contracts made by the Corporation where these exceed a set limiting amount will be removed. The amounts involved, particularly in the case of contracts with research organisations, require Ministerial and legislative processes which are not imposed upon other Primary Industry research and development corporations. The Meat Research Corporation will be able to operate more efficiently by removing the demand on corporate and Ministerial time created by those processes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Board will be able to conduct meetings and pass resolutions without it being necessary for members to meet physically, allowing meetings to be conducted by telephone or other means of communication. It will also provide a more cost effective method of meeting, as members of the Board are frequently widely dispersed geographically at times when Board meetings are scheduled.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At present the authority of the Executive Director is dependent on delegations by the Corporation. These are detailed and require reasonably frequent amendment. The Bill will give the Executive Director the direct authority to conduct the affairs of the Corporation and the power to delegate that authority to his or her staff. This will have the effect of greatly simplifying the conduct of the Corporation's operations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition to these amendments, the Bill will give effect to the Government's decision of 17 September 1991 to abolish statutory age limits for part-time officeholders by taking the opportunity to remove the 65 year age limit on the appointment of Board members from the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment to the Australian Meat and Live-stock Industry Selection Committee Act 1984 will include a person nominated by the Meat and Allied Trades Federation of Australia on the Australian Meat and Live-stock Industry Selection Committee. Honourable Senators will be aware that the Selection Committee is a statutory body which nominates persons to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy for appointment to the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation and Meat Research Corporation. The Committee is required to nominate persons against selection criteria set out in the Australian Meat and Live-stock Industry Selection Committee Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Selection Committee currently consists of an independent Chairperson appointed by the Minister, and six other members appointed on the nomination of the Cattle Council of Australia, Sheepmeat Council of Australia and the Australian Meat Exporters' Federal Council. The person nominated by the Meat and Allied Trades Federation of Australia will be in place of one of the three nominated by the Australian Meat Exporters' Federal Council. The inclusion of a Meat and Allied Trades Federation of Australia nominee on the Selection Committee will ensure that meat processors, retailers and smallgoods manufacturers are represented in the selection process for Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation and Meat Research Corporation Board members.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In conclusion, this Bill will create an Australian Pig Industry Council that is responsive to the policy needs of the pig industry and is effective in coordinating policy input from all industry sectors to deliver an overall strategic policy direction for the benefit of the whole industry. In the case of the meat and livestock industry, annual general meeting requirements give effect to both the Government and industry's desire to make voting requirements more democratic. The Bill will give the Meat Research Corporation the necessary basis on which to develop its evolving commercialisation role and for improved efficiency in carrying out its day to day operations and activities. The Bill will also include a nominee of the Meat and Allied Trades Federation of Australia on the Australian Meat and Live-stock Industry Selection Committee.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to the review being undertaken in Senator Faulkner's department of the Veterans' Entitlements Act. I want to ask him why he is not allowing the Vietnam veterans family support link to be consulted in relation to the review that is being undertaken. I remind Senator Faulkner that when speaking to the New South Wales RSL congress not long ago he said, `I am committed to consultation with ex-service organisations'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people that I am talking about are those women who are the carers of veterans suffering as a consequence of their involvement in the Vietnam war. Those women are the mothers and wives of returned veterans and have the responsibility of caring for those on Department of Veterans' Affairs pensions who need, in many instances, 24-hour a day, seven-day a week care. These people really need their families to look after them. They are not permanently in hospital but are at home sick and are being cared for by their families. It is very much a full-time job for the carers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that Senator Faulkner is consulting quite widely and his intentions are probably quite honourable when he says that he wants to consult quite widely. But I fail to understand why he does not appreciate that the carers ought to be consulted and their needs and experiences recognised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The group that I have referred to has 1,500 members Australia-wide, but this really represents only a small proportion of the total number of people involved. Many of them do not have the time, in addition to the role that they play of looking after their family member, to take part in an organisation such as this. Luckily, there are some who have the time and energy to be spokespersons for the Vietnam veterans family support link line. Without them, many would have nobody to talk to and nobody that they can share their experiences with. For some reason they are not included in the review of the Veterans' Entitlements Act. I cannot understand why that should be the case because the Department of Veterans' Affairs should be very conscious of the unpaid role that is played by the carers of veterans who need pretty intensive care from their family members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">War widows are involved&mdash;and so they should be&mdash;and are being consulted by the department in the review of the act. It is my view that this group of women ought to be consulted. I fail to understand why, presumably, somebody is advising the minister that they not be included. I ask the Minister why he will not consult with the Vietnam veterans family support link line. Why is the minister not prepared to listen to the stories that they have to tell about the role that they play in caring for Vietnam veterans?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Along with the previous speaker, Senator Reid, I want to use this opportunity to seek some information from Senator Schacht, the Minister for Science and Small Business. On 4 August the Trade Practices Commission put out a press release stating the new regulatory arrangements for newsagents in Victoria, and abandoning the territorial zoning system. To some degree, this was supported by the Victorian newsagents, who wanted to change the system. I cannot quite understand why; nevertheless, it was an agreement between the Victorian newsagents and the Trade Practices Commission.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If those findings and new regulatory arrangements for the newsagents of Victoria are transferred to Queensland, to the ACT and to New South Wales, a great deal of loss will be incurred by newsagents who have paid huge amounts of money for their businesses. In many cases, they have invested their life savings to acquire newsagencies, spending $400,000 or $500,000&mdash;which would be the average price of a newsagency in Queensland. They have spent that money to acquire a business which has a territorial zoning system, and if that system is deregulated it immediately reduces the value of that business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People have been prepared to buy into newsagencies because they are the type of business which will guarantee a certain income, provided the newsagent is prepared to work seven days a week for 80, 90 or maybe even 100 hours a week, 363 days a year. The only days newsagents get off are Christmas Day and, of course, Good Friday. On every other day papers are produced and, therefore, have to be delivered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I point out to the minister that in Queensland it is very important that this territorial zoning be maintained. Many newsagencies in the smaller towns in the rural areas of Queensland rely on what they call a cross-subsidising arrangement. They would not be able to afford to throw out a couple of hundred&mdash;or even 100&mdash;papers a day. They cross-subsidise the profits they make on the news runs&mdash;it may be only $5 or $6 a day&mdash;with the profits they make on the shops. If they cross-subsidise between the retail shops and the news runs, the businesses are quite successful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An exemption was signed early in 1980 when the Trade Practices Commission found that the newsagents' territorial zoning system was anti-competitive but did provide a service for the community. I believe that service is still important and is still required today. If those newsagents did not have this particular zoning system, many businesses in some of the smaller communities would not be able to stay viable. This would result in papers being sold maybe in the Coles or Woolworths stores and the town's newsagency being removed, which would have an effect on the rest of the town. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tonight I am seeking an assurance from Senator Schacht&mdash;having lobbied him on a number of occasions&mdash;that the Victorian decision will not be transferred to Queensland, New South Wales, the ACT or even Tasmania, which I think would have the same problems. It would result in a loss of business and a loss to the community, which would not be able to get specialised newspapers through grocery stores or even Coles and Woolworths. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Specialised newsagencies being removed would result in specialised magazines not being delivered. These newsagencies provide a service to the community. They have been in the community for 80 or 90 years. There is no doubt that most people are happy with the service they get. If Senator Schacht could give an assurance to the Senate and the newsagents of those particular states, I am sure he would put their minds at ease, as they are particularly worried about the investment they have made in their businesses. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I speak in the adjournment debate in response to Senator Boswell's remarks. He spoke to me today after he missed asking me a question on this matter. As the parliament is about to rise for a week or more, he wanted to get this issue raised in the Senate. I agreed that I would respond on this issue in the adjournment debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Boswell has raised this issue with me and made representations on a number of occasions. In my short time as minister for the small business area, Senator Boswell has been more than active in dialogue with me about issues concerning small business. This goes back to discussions we had when I was a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs and we dealt with changing the Trade Practices Act. Senator Boswell was a very assiduous lobbyist, not only of his own colleague on the committee, Senator O'Chee, but also of me and other senators, irrespective of parliamentary affiliation, to get certain amendments to the Trade Practices Act that would, in his view, assist small business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agreed with him on all those issues. I also agreed with Senator Spindler, and he agreed with me. As a majority, we convinced the committee to adopt a couple of recommendations. Even when we were in the minority, we still put forward some views that we believed would assist small business in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Boswell, like some others of us on that committee, made it very clear that, if he had to choose between supporting the top end of town interests, or big business, and those of small business, his heart and mind were with the interests of small business. I respect his genuine interest in this area. When he raised this issue about the situation of newsagents in Australia, I was more than happy to take up his representations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to give to Senator Boswell some information from the Trade Practices Commission. I do not know whether it will be absolutely 100 per cent what he wants to hear, but I think there is enough of it to give some encouragement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Boswell and other honourable senators may be aware that recently the Trade Practices Commission made a determination with respect to a system for newspaper and magazine distribution in Victoria. To date, the Trade Practices Commission has not formally considered the positions in Queensland and New South Wales. I am advised by the Trade Practices Commission that once the revisions to the Victorian system are finalised, the Trade Practices Commission will wish to discuss with the industry participants the implications and possible application of the changes in Victoria to other states&mdash;namely, New South Wales and Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Trade Practices Commission advised me that the period during which appeals may be lodged in Victoria expires tomorrow. If no appeals are lodged, it is expected that the new arrangement will be in place in Victoria within about three months. The TPC said it is significant to note that the changes in Victoria were supported by the Victorian Authorised Newsagents Association. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, the changes reduce the anti-competitiveness of the system, allow for greater innovation and freedom in retailing and improve the efficiency of the home delivery system to the benefit of competent newsagents and their customers&mdash;so I was advised by the TPC. The changes proposed in Victoria preserve the delivery zone monopoly for home deliveries and deliveries to retail outlets which cannot obtain direct supplies from publishers. It should be noted that in South Australia and Western Australia agency distribution arrangements provide for delivery territories only as retailing is not a regulated market. The Victorian changes also provide for compensation to be paid by certain subagents to newsagents where those subagents change from obtaining supplies from a newsagent to obtaining supplies direct from the publishers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The compensation payments to newsagents for loss of income formerly received under commission sharing arrangements applies for a transitional period. I must emphasise that in relation to Queensland and New South Wales the TPC has agreed to consult the industry before taking any steps which would or might involve issuing a notice to revoke the existing authorisations. I emphasise to Senator Boswell that the TPC has made the commitment to have consultation with the industry in New South Wales and Queensland if it is going to revoke the present authorisations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The TPC's view is that if those authorisations are now operating in a way which is excessively anticompetitive, or if they contain restrictions now unnecessary to deliver the public benefits claim, they should be reviewed. The marketing of leading title magazines in supermarket chains has become a shopping reality and appears to be supported by customers without obvious extensive damage to newsagencies. I am advised of this by the Trade Practices Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The commission is very mindful of the quality of service to readers, small businesses and retail businesses generally. It is also very mindful of the comments by and interest of Senator Boswell in this issue. It is noticeable that complaints about the newsagency system come from small businesses which object to the disadvantages they face because of these arrangements&mdash;so I am advised by the TPC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As in the Victorian situation, if changes were considered which affect the value of existing newsagencies, the issue of compensation would be addressed. I suspect that that information is not totally what Senator Boswell wanted to hear because it indicates that after the Victorian review is completed it is quite possible that the arrangements will be reviewed in New South Wales and Victoria. The review will be done in consultation with the industry. I hope that the industry is able, with the support of such people as Senator Boswell, to explain the particular and peculiar&mdash;I do not say that in a pejorative sense&mdash;features, particularly in Queensland with its decentralised nature, that have to be considered as far as arrangements for newsagencies are concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I assure Senator Boswell that I will provide him with more information if the TPC starts a process of review, so he has plenty of time to make his views known and so the people he supports have plenty of time to put their views to the TPC. At the appropriate time I will ask people within the small business area of my portfolio to consider the implications for small business&mdash;and newsagencies are small business&mdash;of any such changes if there is disagreement between the industry and the TPC because I note that in Victoria, according to the TPC, these changes were supported by the Victorian Authorised Newsagents Association. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now that I have given that information to Senator Boswell, I want to conclude by making a few brief remarks about the opposition's contribution to the debate earlier this evening on the budget. I did not enter into the debate at that time because of the agreements about the time available for the discharge of Senate business. I was the duty minister in the chamber and on a number of occasions I felt that I had to interject about a number of points that Senator Hill was making. </PARA>

From my cursory examination of the history of the Senate, it is interesting to note that this Senate is the first since federation in which no member of the major non-Labor parties represented has had ministerial experience.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think that by now most members of the Senate would be well aware of my continuing campaign to bring to this place the examples of the misuse of chemicals within our society. I continue that tonight. I bring to this chamber tonight the case study story of Pat Snowden.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After helping her husband in the cleaning industry in the early years of her marriage, Pat Snowden was bewildered by the various debilitating symptoms that suddenly affected her. Like most people who take pride in their work, she fought to stay on, but in the end she had to resign because of continuing ill-health. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She had never previously considered chemicals as an explanation of that ill-health until directly after x-rays her doctor asked her, `Have you ever been exposed to chemicals other than in cleaning?' At first, through her naivety at the time, she began to inquire about the ammonia content of the heavy-duty cleaning products that she used. But then later, through further diligent searching, she found what she believes to be the responsible chemical, known as 2-butoxyethanol or ethylene glycol mono butyl ether. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pat says that she attempted to bring the subject to the attention of people whom she thought would immediately understand the problem, but her efforts fell on deaf medical and bureaucratic ears and many of these people were openly scornful of her. She felt that she had been denigrated, ridiculed and left without the medical attention that should have been given to lung damage and industrial asthma, a diagnosis which had never been passed on to her. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She believed that governments never permitted people to use chemicals without labelling and providing suitable warnings of danger. She says, `All those years I struggled against an unknown poisonous substance and there are others who are suffering as well'. In her opinion, the people who were at that time considered experts were in fact not sufficiently qualified to understand the pattern of poisoning caused by this particular chemical. Consequently, she learnt the same lesson that many other pesticide victims have learnt, and that is that very few people, if any&mdash;including medical specialists, local GPs and government health authorities&mdash;can recognise the symptoms of chemical poisoning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In November 1989, Pat Snowden said that she left a written report at the Victorian Department of Labour in Nauru House. It was directed to the attention of Mr Pope, showing him the scientific adverse effects of this chemical and her fears about its use. She received no reply. In April 1991, a full report was placed with a senior ACC member asking for an investigation into her allegations, and still no reply&mdash;still no action taken on her behalf.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the ongoing debilitating effects from the excessive chemical exposure, Pat Snowden continued to search and supply the so-called experts with the scientific evidence of the toxic effects of this chemical and its related compounds. She feels entitled to know from each and every person who ignored her symptoms or belittled her in their professional capacity why she was treated so badly in view of the fact that the information she fought so hard to find was so readily available to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pat Snowden had the normal childhood illnesses. Nevertheless, she did not need any other medical attention between the ages of eight to 21 years, at which time she had an appendectomy. During her working life she held managerial positions from 16 years of age, including one as a cash controller, until 1985. She married at 20 years of age and had four children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Her husband's main occupation was a carpenter and he supplemented his income by working part-time as a cleaner. Sometimes Pat helped him and the children went with them. Gradually, both began to suffer illnesses they had not experienced before, while the children and Pat showed symptoms that her local doctor could not identify. He was perplexed and was unable to diagnose the white lumps with black tops which presented in Pat and her baby son. These broke out on almost every part of the body, including legs and genitalia. Her doctor even suggested that the case should be presented to the Australian Medical Journal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, Pat and her husband were so upset by continuing illnesses, which they blamed on their home for want of any other reason, that they moved away and purchased a milk bar. During the 11 months in the business, she was still ill and suffered constant bleeding thought to be period related, loss of hair, weight loss down to five stone and spasmodic shaking. The business was sold and the health problems gradually diminished. Her next working experience was at the Sandringham police station as a part-time cleaner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During this period she suffered from migraines, pumped up feelings in her head, dreadful pain in the legs, loss of circulation, anaemia, narcolepsy, memory loss, deafness, very loud speech, red eyes, tears for no reason, dreadful cold and the inability to write. She could not follow recipes, lacked concentration and had shocking nightmares. There was a cobwebby feeling over her eyes, urine and faeces incontinence, appalling body and faeces odour and sudden drowsiness and slurred speech. She recognised a sudden irrational dislike of people, salivation then dry mouth, excruciating pain in the right chest; a cold icy feeling in the right side&mdash;very complicated symptoms, as anyone would recognise. She could not even hold light weights and at times she could not walk straight. Among other problems, she learnt in the early part of her illness that medication made her worse and she refused it from then onwards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The symptoms changed and she began to feel afraid. Reluctantly, she took a month off work and was tested for cancer because of the debilitating illnesses. The results were negative. The doctor suggested it was depression, which she knew could not be correct. She said that she was so ill, she felt she was dying. She spent three weeks out of a month's leave in bed and the symptoms lessened a little. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She went back to work but the promised help did not eventuate. All of the symptoms returned plus others. There were pains in the right side of her chest and right arm; she was unable to breathe easily and bruising began. Then, Pat had to take two days a week off from work because she could not stand the dreadful head pains. In the end she began to hear voiced thoughts. She struggled to continue but she was having six-hour narcolepsy attacks which began about three-quarters of an hour after leaving work. It was then she decided she could no longer drive safely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She revisited her doctor and again he wanted her to take anti-depressants. Once again she refused because it was not her habit to take medication. She struggled back to work but, through her failing health, she was forced to leave on 2 December, 1988. Today, Pat says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I still suffer burning and soreness in my lungs and I find it hard to breathe. There is numbness in my left leg, a lump in my right side under my ribs, my chest feels like lead. Sometimes, I suffer short-term memory loss and the inability to walk up a few steps without feeling leg pain. However, there is no narcolepsy nor anaemia. Without medical help, I found ways to ease some of the symptoms and I believe by doing so, I have managed to stay alive.</PARA>
<PARA>That terrible story that I bring to the Senate tonight is one for which there has been no explanation other than this person's exposure to chemicals through her work. She is just one of the thousands of Australians who have not been properly diagnosed or catered for with regard to the health problems that they have suffered as a result of exposure to chemicals during their work or their normal daily occupation. It is because of the inability of any other standard system to cater for the needs of these people that I will continue to bring their case studies to this place. I will continue to argue that there needs to be action taken&mdash;which may need to be legislative action&mdash;to properly regulate the way we use chemicals in Australia. </PARA>

On this particular occasion I do sympathise with you.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Burns's mind numbing 30-minute speech, I should add, was in contravention of an unspoken agreement between the two sides of the house that we would only take some 10 minutes each in addressing Senator Brownhill's notice of motion, but it took him 30 minutes to say nothing. We did not have to have that. If we are going to get through these sorts of motions, we have to stick to these agreements. Senator Burns chose to break that agreement, to take people like me out of the debate. He may think that is a clever tactic in the Senate, but we also have some clever tactics on the agenda. One is that, as the coalition announced this evening, it will not be supporting the government's tax measures which, of course, affect the rural sector and have been so well outlined this evening by other speakers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I confine my comments to one particular point. The honourable member for Canberra, Mrs Ros Kelly, made boastful comments on the radio today about how this budget has benefited the city of Canberra, saying in fact that there will be a net increase of 400 jobs in the Public Service in Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rural community, which has been shocked by this budget&mdash;it cannot understand why its needs have been so blindly ignored&mdash;has a right to be bitter or more bitter than it already is against this government. This budget is directed towards the pampering of its own bureaucratic corps, as boasted by the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, the honourable member for Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's running costs are up almost six per cent, but the rural community has to absorb cut after cut when it is suffering one of longest crises ever endured. I know there has been a bit of a fanfare of late in Canberra that there has been a reduction in the Public Service numbers, but this means nothing. One has only to listen to the honourable member for Canberra, Ros Kelly. She has confirmed that the staff have not been affected; they have been redeployed. She has confirmed that they are taking up other so-called special projects. So there has not been a cut at all. As confirmed by the honourable member for Canberra, there is actually a net increase of 400 jobs in the Public Service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here we have a minister of state celebrating the size of the Canberra based Public Service while the rural sector sinks. She is celebrating the government's making sure that some other city or some other town suffers, not its precious and protected public sector. It is no wonder the rural agenda has been lost; it has been lost in the Canberra bureaucracy. What can the second largest growing city in Australia know about the bush and the real depth of its suffering? How can a city which is annually propped up by millions and millions of dollars of public works ever understand about the infrastructure collapse in rural and regional towns in Australia? There is absolutely no doubt that every time the budget rolls around Labor always looks after its city of Canberra, its mandarins, those that work for them&mdash;those who deliver the lines and deliver the lies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Public Service in Canberra is the most politically appointed and biased Public Service since Federation. This year's budget has fuelled the Canberra building market still further. Despite all the austerity, we still have a $150 million construction project going ahead for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. We have about the same amount of money being spent on the new complex for the Australian Geological Survey Organisation. Is it any wonder that the Canberra property market has jumped by almost 100 per cent? While Canberra continues to be recession proof, the rural community sinks. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the adjournment debate. I am extremely concerned about the vindictive attack by Senator Burns on country people in general and me in particular. The implication was that country people are uneducated. On the contrary, Australian farmers are among the most efficient farmers in the world. How can a senator who belongs to a party which instituted the statistical fact of one million unemployed Australians claim to possess compassion and to care for country people? The rural adjustment scheme certainly helps people. It helps people off farms and into unemployment queues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also refer to the earlier remarks of Senators Sherry and Carr. Senator Sherry kindly outlined 31 initiatives which have been set out in the budget which certainly do not care for country people. Apart from the rural adjustment scheme, he detailed things such as clean food, rural counselling, community based approaches, when soon there will not be any communities to make these approaches, energy and greenhouse commitments and landcare commitments. At the moment very few farmers in Australia can afford to plant trees. I ask the government to revert its attention to the true people in the country who are really hurting: pensioners, low income earners and the unemployed, who will all be affected by what Senator Carr terms as the `fixation' of this side of the house on the petrol initiatives instituted in the budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may not be apparent to the government but the reason why country people need petrol at a reasonable price is that they travel longer distances. There is no public transport, or very little which is accessible on a daily basis in the country. The area in which I live is bounded by three provincial towns, Hamilton, Portland and Warrnambool. Those towns are 100 kilometres from each other. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the demise of small rural communities&mdash;a fact which has been hastened by the policies of the federal government&mdash;people now need to travel to one of those provincial centres on a weekly if not twice-weekly or thrice-weekly basis, simply to buy the basics of daily living, let alone visits to medical practitioners and optometrists. This means that they will need to spend more on their petrol to go and buy groceries. Trips to take their children to sporting activities on the weekend will become a luxury rather than a necessity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pensioners, low income earners and the unemployed contribute a great deal to their local community, mainly because they cannot afford to travel further for their entertainment or leisure activities. The fact is that they will simply not be able to indulge in any leisure or spare time activities because they will not be able to afford to drive their cars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the government would like to think that its initiatives will discourage the use of leaded petrol, the fact is that, because these people will need to hang on to their cars for much longer periods, it will encourage the use of leaded petrol. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At a business level the hike in petrol prices will add to the cost of groceries, farm costs and small businesses in towns. The town in which I live, Heywood, at one stage in January 1991 had a fuel price of 88c per litre. The standard price is 72c per litre. At present, this is 12c or 15c a litre higher than it is in Melbourne. I suggest that, under the initiatives mentioned in the budget, this price discrepancy will become even greater. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of the remarks made by Senator Sherry and Senator Carr, it is all very well to set up these bureaucracies and task forces, but how will they help the individual? They will not. Senator Carr mentioned the sterling endeavours of Premier Jeff Kennett who is slowly getting Victoria back on track instead of pandering to groups like teacher unions. He has had to adopt those initiatives because the party to which Senator Carr belongs progressively sent Victoria broke. If the economic upheaval, chaos and devastation had not been so severe, the strong measures undertaken by Premier Kennett would not be necessary. Most Victorians now agree that that sort of strong action is necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In short, I simply wish to register my extreme concern over the lack of care, consideration and understanding of the rural sector demonstrated in the budget. I rest my case. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I apologise to the Senate for delaying our departure from this place tonight. I think in six years I have made three adjournment speeches. I was not going to do so tonight until I, like Senator McGauran, became incensed by the delaying tactics of Senator Burns. Senator Burns is the chairman of the committee that Senator Brownhill, myself and you, Madam Acting Deputy President, are members of. I have always respected his chairmanship, but I thought that his display in here tonight was rather disgraceful. I was quite astounded by the way that he carried on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must admit that I am one of those people he was talking about. I left school when I was 15, so I suppose that I am one of those uneducated rural people that he was having a shot at tonight. I feel just as slighted as anybody else in the rural community about the unwarranted attack that he made upon the rural people of Australia. If I had had the opportunity, like my colleagues were hoping to have the opportunity today, to support Senator Brownhill, I was intending to pass comment on the fact that this being the budget week, we were very lucky yesterday to able to hear four maiden speeches, or should I now say, now that we have this new non-sexist language, four first speeches? We used in the old days to call them maiden speeches. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was interesting to note that three of those four first speeches made comments about the effect that this government's policies have had on people in rural areas. I looked with interest at Senator Troeth's speech, and she has confirmed again tonight her ties and concerns with the people in rural areas. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a great deal of concern in rural Australia about the future of the family farm.</PARA>
<PARA>That is absolutely correct, and that is why earlier today my colleague Senator Brownhill put forward his motion. Madam Acting Deputy President, I have the feeling that you were just as embarrassed as I was about certain comments that were made by our committee's chairman tonight about rural people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was also very interested to hear my colleague from Tasmania, Senator Gibson, in his first speech mention something that I had forgotten about but which was absolutely true. When talking about the prosperity that Australia has had over the years, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The exceptions to this trend have been our miners and farmers who are world leaders and have remained world leaders in efficiency and productivity for the past 100 years or so.</PARA>
<PARA>It was rather comical to hear Senator Burns here tonight talking about making our farmers more efficient. We have been the most efficient farmers in the world for a long time. All we got from this government and this budget that came out this week was to screw the farmers harder and harder. All the winners in this country have been taxed out of existence over the years and this budget is no exception. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then I was very interested to hear our new Democrat colleague Senator Woodley. He had a bit of a jibe at our side of politics, but he did say that he had spent a lot of time in the bush travelling through Queensland. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Those 30 years have enabled me to observe the steady decline in population, the impoverishment of many rural families and the awful neglect of the bush by successive governments of every complexion.</PARA>
<PARA>We have not been in government for 10 years. I have been farming since I was 15 years of age; I have been through the credit squeeze in the 1960s and a few other bad times; but my colleagues and myself in the bush have never experienced anything like the things this government has subjected the people in the bush to. It does not matter where one goes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was quite surprised to hear Senator Burns because our committee went to Barcaldine where the Labor Party supposedly had its roots. We went out and stayed there. Senator Burns took the hospitality of a magnificent woman who on the night we were there said, `Look, you've nowhere to stay because the pub is full up'. So we travelled the 50 miles to her place at 2 o'clock in the morning. She made her home available to us and extended her hospitality. She was there on her own and had been battling along. I just wonder how she feels now when she will have to pay another 10c a litre on her fuel as well as all the other nasties, such as the wholesale sales tax and the compounding effects of freight charges as they affect those who live and work in the bush. The effect of the fuel increases on goods and services in remote areas will be catastrophic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Burns has been with us on the drought inquiry to the back of Bourke where farmers were letting their sheep die and were forced to shoot kangaroos to make a living. We experienced the absolute desperation of country people. Now we see what is going to happen with this budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was surprised to see that some of my Labor colleagues from Tasmania have been quite outspoken. I noted on Tuesday of this week that the new Labor member for Franklin, Harry Quick, got a headline on the front page of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mercury</EMPHASIS>. It was absolutely good stuff; the sort of stuff that Bruce Goodluck, whom Harry Quick replaced, used to get. It said, `Quick opposes petrol tax hike'.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Two of Tasmania's new Federal Labor backbenchers have vowed a party room rebellion to try to overturn some of yesterday's Budget decisions. Franklin Labor Member Harry Quick said he would oppose the petrol price increase.</PARA>
<PARA>What a load of rubbish. Michael Lester, who wrote this stuff, must be a member of the Labor party. He knows how things work. It is a bit of a joke for him to say all that. How can Harry Quick turn around and look at his constituents in Franklin and say, `Look, I am opposing this'. When the budget bills come up I will be interested to see what Harry Quick does. Will he do what Michael Tate quite often did&mdash;absent himself from the chamber when the vote is taken so that he can say, `Well, I did not vote in favour of it. I was going to oppose it, but unfortunately it was a budget decision and I had to go along with the party'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We on this side of politics from Tasmania have been there. It would not have made any difference if we had crossed the floor. But if Harry Quick has got the courage of his convictions, after having all this media coverage, he should lobby Senator Devereux. Then Senator Devereux should join us over here and vote against some of these taxes that are going to affect the rural people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had dozens of phone calls from sawmillers and battlers in Franklin who were quite surprised and disappointed about what has happened. With all the promises that were made at the last election, they did not believe that these sorts of things were going to happen. Dick Adams, the new member for Lyons, had the audacity to come out and say that the budget provided funds to help rural industries to set up for production of high quality clean food exports.

What thanks has he got? The government is going to decimate the fledgling wine industry in  Tasmania&mdash;one of the few industries that is starting to show a bit of promise. The government has increased the excise. As my colleague Senator Tierney said here earlier tonight, the government is cutting the wine industry off at the knees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not go over all the other particular matters that have been canvassed by my colleagues. It goes without saying that, as a farmer from Tasmania representing all Tasmanians who have been savagely affected&mdash;and we have been particularly affected in Tasmania because we rely on freight&mdash;it will really hurt us. I make the point once again: I just hope the people of Franklin, Lyons and Bass realise that the cavalier attitude of Harry Quick, Silvia Smith and Dick Adams is nothing but a sham&mdash;just like this budget&mdash;on the people of Australia but, in particular, on those of Tasmania. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak briefly&mdash;because the hour is late and I do not wish to detain my colleagues for long&mdash;on a major paper which was presented at a recent conference which I attended. The paper was by the distinguished Victorian silk, S.E.K. Hulme, and dealt with the High Court's Mabo decision.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is very difficult for members of the public to come to grips with the High Court decision and its ramifications. Since this has been a news item almost every day for the last three or four months, naturally, like all members and senators, I have had a wide range of discussions with constituents who, perhaps like us, are trying to come to grips with this particular decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose a few themes have come through. The first theme, which I think a lot of Australians express, is that people do recognise there are serious health and unemployment problems in the Aboriginal community. I think there is a desire amongst the vast majority of Australians to make sure that those problems are properly addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Equally, I think that there is concern amongst Australians who have the desire to remain&mdash;perhaps to use the words of the federation fathers&mdash;`one people with one destiny'. I think certain aspects of the debate have emerged which may perhaps suggest that the founding vision of this nation possibly may be compromised, unless the government ensures that the decisions which are taken reinforce the desire of Australians to be one people and one nation. Certainly, I believe that anything which smacks of creating special rights and privileges for particular groups will be strongly resisted by most Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Equally, I think there is very little acceptance in the community of the so-called black armband view of Australian history. Professor Blainey has drawn attention to this theme that has emerged in the public debate of a view of Australian history&mdash;one which I think is held by many people on the other side of the chamber&mdash;which I think is basically out of touch with mainstream Australian views and the great sense of pride that most Australians feel about their nation and its history. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In coming to grips with this Mabo decision, I had the opportunity, as I said, to listen to a paper presented by Mr S.E.K. Hulme at the Samuel Griffiths Society. I think it is probably indisputable that S.E.K. Hulme is one of the finest legal minds in Australia and therefore what he says is worth addressing by senators and members of parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I found the paper profoundly disturbing in what it said about the processes of the High Court in the Mabo decision and the process of legal reasoning adopted by some of the judges. As I have said, I felt it of value that this paper should be brought to the attention of the Senate with the expectation that perhaps others may wish to read it. Senator Sherry has given his permission for the tabling of the paper so that it may be available to the senators. Therefore, I am seeking leave to table the paper. </PARA>

Along with other people in this chamber, I am aware that in recent years the High Court has become very controversial indeed. Not too long ago in this chamber, Senator Schacht and former Senator Tate expressed extreme displeasure with certain actions of the High Court in relation to the political advertising decision. However, probably nothing matches the concern that has arisen over the Mabo decision.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his paper, S.E.K.

I suppose we should also be grateful that the government did not nationalise our properties, mines and a whole host of other things. That is how irrelevant that comment is.

Senator Burns is the chairman and you, Madam Acting Deputy President, are a member of that committee.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UW4">Senator CRANE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Panizza said, it is disgusting. Senator Burns failed to say that Senator Troeth also said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At a time when some areas of rural production are sadly in need of leadership, a long-term rural policy perspective shows the importance of government incentives directed towards the improvement of skills in farm management and production technologies.</PARA>
<PARA>How can Senator Burns come in here and misrepresent the position of what I think was a brilliant and magnificent speech? The speech quite clearly set down the principles for which Senator Troeth stands. At no time did Senator Burns try to defend the government's position, for example, on transport. Transport is very important to the cost structure, competitiveness and the productivity of this country. Transport is one area that needs reform. What has the government done for the rigs which travel backwards and forwards on our roads carting our goods and services for farmers, miners and workers? Senator Carr kept asking, `What about the workers?'. What would happen if there were no trucks to carry the goods and services or if there were no mines or farms? If they were all bankrupt and out of business, there would be no jobs for workers. We know that one million people are unemployed in this nation today, but what would happen?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Western Australian Road Transport Association has faxed some figures to me today. This hike in fuel prices means that the cost of fuel to the transport industry will increase by $200 million to $225 million a year. Who does the government think will pay for that? The consumers will. Who are the consumers? We are all consumers. This is just another example of the hidden goods and services tax that this government has foisted on this country. As I said earlier, the cost of fuel excise and the cost of wholesale sales tax prior to this decision was about $80,000 per annum for each rig travelling 250,000 kilometres. The industry tells me that is about the number of kilometres a rig has to travel each year to break even. This means an additional cost of $15,000 to $25,000 per annum on each one of those rigs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want Senator Sherry to answer to me, I want the government, Senator Carr and Senator Burns to answer to me as to how the people at the end of the road&mdash;the unemployed, those who are lucky enough to have a job, those businesses that are trying to survive&mdash;are going to avoid having the government come through and create enormous cost increases at a time when we should be addressing the biggest social issue in this country, and that is unemployment. This budget does not do one thing for the unemployed people. People on the other side of the chamber, who allowed this budget to come through, should hang their heads in shame. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One could go on talking about this for a long time, but I just want to wind up my</PARA>
<PARA>comments by saying that I hope&mdash;in fact, I pray&mdash;that when we bring down the report on the shearers inquiry Senator Burns can take a much more balanced point of view. I hope he will not misuse that report as he did with another report tonight&mdash;a report that was more about social justice than economic justice. We on this side of the chamber do care about social justice. We recognise that those people who genuinely need assistance should be given assistance. We do not care if those people who genuinely need assistance are farmers, miners, live in the city, in Tasmania or on Cocos Island&mdash;that does not concern us. But it is unacceptable to me to mix up economic justice and social justice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude my comments by saying this: I have only referred to one aspect of the budget tonight and that was fuel. One could talk about the wine industry and other things. Dr Hewson tonight declared our position on behalf of the opposition in his response to the budget. Senator Hill did likewise in this chamber. Tonight I hope that the Democrats and the Greens have clearly heard what we said. I hope that both groups, who often talk</PARA>
<PARA>about fairness and social justice&mdash;in fact, we heard talk about those issues tonight from Senator Kernot&mdash;have the same conviction and commitment to the people that the Labor Party have deserted; those people that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), on the night of the election, called the true believers. They have been left out in the cold and the Labor Party deserves to pay for that for a long, long time. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ministerial Council for Companies and Securities&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Council was established under the Formal Agreement dated 22 December 1978 between the Commonwealth and the States (and later the Northern Territory) which established a Commonwealth-State Scheme for Co-operative Companies and Securities Regulation. This Agreement still exists but for all practical purposes it has been superseded by the Heads of Agreement on Future Corporate Regulation in Australia between the Commonwealth and the States/Northern Territory which was reached on 28 June 1990. The Heads of Agreement, which underpins the national companies and securities scheme, commenced operation on 1 January 1991 and established a new Ministerial Council for Corporations which has the same membership but a different role. In view of the negligible role left for the Ministerial Council for Companies and Securities under the national scheme, the following answers relate to the Ministerial Council for Corporations:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) The Ministerial Council for Corporations was established by the Heads of Agreement of June 1990 between Commonwealth, State and Northern Territory Ministers on future corporate legislation in Australia. Its principal function is the consideration of legislative proposals relating to the national companies and securities scheme. It also has a consultative function in relation to the appointment of members of the Australian Securities Commission, the Corporations and Securities Panel, and the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee and its Legal Sub-Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) Secretariat services for the Council are provided by the Business Law Division of the Commonwealth Attorney-General's Department. Meetings are held at the same time and place as meetings of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General. It is the policy of that Committee to meet in the capital city of each member in turn, in accordance with an established schedule.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(c-d) The members of the Ministerial Council represent the parties to the Heads of Agreement, that is the Commonwealth, the States and the Northern Territory. Each party is represented by one member who is the minister responsible for administering companies and securities legislation in that jurisdiction. The Attorney-General of the Australian Capital Territory attends meetings of the Council as an observer and the Commonwealth Minister is the Chairperson of the Council.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(e) The Ministerial Council for Corporations has, during the past 12 months, met in Perth (2 July 1992) and in Adelaide (4 February 1993).

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At these meetings the Council considered papers and issues which officers representing each jurisdiction had proposed following officers' meetings held shortly before each meeting.

As part of Australia's efforts to promote the domestic infrastructure which supports human rights, including national institutions, I announced at the World Conference the provision by Australia of $300,000 to the UN Voluntary Fund for assisting States in the development of such measures.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Yes.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The price of such insurance appears to have increased as a result of the high costs of providing such cover in many cases and the withdrawal from the Australian market of a specialist insurer of this class of business. It seems that the financial difficulties encountered by this insurer which led to its withdrawal may have been the result of significant underpricing by it of the product when it first entered the market.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The Scientific Director of the Chemicals Safety Unit, in response to a telephone enquiry, advised the Registrar of Pesticides in Tasmania that there are no health concerns which would warrant a change in the regulatory status for atrazine. However, no formal advice was requested by, or supplied to, the Pesticides Advisory Committee of Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) and (3) The activities of the Pesticides Advisory Committee of Tasmania and the Tasmanian Forestry Commission are matters for the Tasmanian State Government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) Atrazine is a residual herbicide with relative persistence. The scientific literature indicates that, in soil, atrazine is broken down by microbial degradation and has a persistence of 6&mdash;17 weeks. In mammals the compound is rapidly and completely metabolised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) Atrazine is no longer approved for use in Sweden due to concerns over possible water contamination. It was used to control weeds in areas containing sandy gravel soils such as gravel paths, public and private gardens. Use in these areas invariably led to small amounts of atrazine being leached into water which was considered by the Swedish Parliament to be unacceptable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) Potential health risks of a chemical in food are dependent on the toxicity of the chemical and levels of residues of the chemical in the particular food. Maximum Residue Limits (MRLs) for atrazine in a number of food commodities have been recommended taking these factors into account and are published in the Australian Food Standards Code. Consumption of food containing atrazine levels below the MRL is considered, on the basis of present knowledge, to be without appreciable risk to human health. Advice to this effect can be provided in writing if requested.</PARA>
