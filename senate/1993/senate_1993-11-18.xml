<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Minister</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to the Australian Dried Fruits Board (AGM) Regulations, Statutory Rules 1993 No.144, considered by the Committee at its meeting of 2 September 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Explanatory Statement advises that the ADFB must hold its first AGM for the period 1991/92 on or before 30 June 1993. The Committee would appreciate your advice on why the Regulations were not made until as late as 22 June 1993, with commencement on gazettal on 23 June 1993, and the implications for the rights of those entitled to vote at the AGM.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In this context the Regulations provide that certain provisions do not apply to the first AGM. These include rr.4, 5 and 8. These provisions may have affected the rights of those entitled to vote.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Also, there are a number of provisions for which no exception seems to have been made for the first AGM and with which it appears impossible to comply. These include the 42 day notice period in r.10(1) and the 7 day notice period in r.19. Regulation 13 does not appear to overcome these difficulties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, r.11 appears to be uncertain. Regulation 11(2) may mean that unless there are 10 supporters the ADFB need not send out notice of the notice of motion at all. Alternatively, it could mean that the fact of a notice of motion must be sent out, although the details need not be included. The Committee suggests that this should be clarified.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In r.11(1)(b) the reference to r.18(2) should be to r.19(2). The heading to the Explanatory Statement should be 1993 rather than 1992. Attachment A of the Explanatory Statement is missing.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CANBERRA ACT 2600</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator Loosley</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you for your letter of 6 September 1993 regarding the Australian Dried Fruits Board (AGM) Regulations, Statutory Rules 1993 No 144.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your first point on why the Regulations were not made until 22 June 1993. The Australian Horticultural Corporation Act 1987 requires `product boards' to hold an annual general meeting within twelve months of the end of each financial year. I authorised the preparation of drafting instructions on 26 August 1992. My Department prepared drafting instructions which were then circulated to the Australian Dried Fruits Board (ADFB), the Australian Horticultural corporation (AHC) and the Australian Dried Fruits Association (ADFA) for consultation and comment. Actual instructions were sent to the Attorney General's Department (AGs) on 2 October 1992, nearly thirty-eight weeks before the scheduled date for the holding of the AGM. The first draft was received from the AGs on 22 January 1993. Subsequent drafts were received on 4 February 1993, 7 April 1993 and the final draft on 18 June 1993 just two working days before the scheduled date for the AGM. The AGs have told my Department of difficulties for them with other significant priorities, staff movements and staff sickness.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The annual general meeting of the ADFB for the period 1991-92 was held on 23 June 1993 as the preferred day by the industry. The ADFB and the industry peak body, the ADFA, advised my Department, during the consultation period prior to the drafting of the Australian Horticultural Corporation Amendment Act 1991, that the best time to hold an AGM would be the period late May to June. The actual date of the AGM had been set tentatively by the industry and the ADFB about twelve months in advance. Culturing practices and harvesting and drying procedures preclude growers attending an AGM till late in the financial year, after the dried fruit is delivered to the packing sheds.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the regulations drafting period, my Department consulted closely with the ADFB, the ADFA and the AHC. In accordance with the enabling Act the AGM was advertised in the national press and information was published in industry journals on various aspects of the AGM. From correspondence my Department has received from the ADFB, the AGM was held in substantial compliance with the regulations. The AGs, in its advice to my Department, confirmed this view.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would now like to address some of the detailed concerns in your letter. In regard to Regulations 4 and 5, the ADFB wrote to the packers on 26 November 1992, seeking the information subsequently set out in the regulations. With the notice to the packers, the ADFB included a copy of the drafting instructions as had been submitted to AGs on 2 October 1992. All the packers co-operated and supplied the information used to make the register of levy and export charge payers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The letter of 26 November 1992, referred to above, in fact substantially complied with Regulation 5. Regulation 5 was a suggested inclusion by the drafter and was accepted by the industry after the packers had already supplied the required information or had agreed to supply that information. Therefore, it did not have any effect on the AGM for the 1991/92 period.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Regulation 8 was substantially followed by the ADFB with correspondence of 14 April 1993 to all levy and export charge payers containing grower registration number, fruit tonnage and voting entitlement. Procedures to alter any of the levy or export charge payer's information was provided in an attached four-page leaflet. The Annual Report was also included in this mail out of 14 April 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In regard to your comments on Regulation 10(1), in practice, the ADFB followed the procedures set down in the then draft regulations by way of the "Notice of Annual General Meeting". This information was also contained in the letter of 14 April 1993 to all levy and export charge payers, to which was attached the four page information leaflet about the AGM. The requirements of the then-draft Regulation 19 were also covered in the same letter and information leaflet.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By the time Regulation 11 was being finalised by the drafter, consultation with my Department had established that the ADFB had not received any notice of motion by the due date, so it could not have a direct effect on the AGM arrangements. I am advised that Regulation 11 is drafted along similar lines to other legislation in this portfolio, covering AGMs for the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation and the Australian Wool Corporation. The reference in Regulation 11(1)(b) to Regulation 18(2) should be to Regulation 19(2) and the heading of the Explanatory Statement should be 1993, not 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amendments to correct these drafting errors and to address your concerns about the clarity of Regulation 11(2) will be made as soon as practicable. Attachment A of the Explanatory Statement was initialled by the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, on my behalf, on 16 June 1993. I do not know why your Committee did not receive this Attachment. Because it explains the separate Regulations, it is the same as Attachment A of the Explanatory Memorandum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you for bringing these matters to my attention.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yours sincerely</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Minister</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to the Occupational Superannuation Standards Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rules 1993 No.189, considered by the Committee at its meeting of 30 September 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Explanatory Statement advised that the purpose of the regulations was to provide for matters which would eventually be included in the proposed Superannuation Industry Supervision Act, the Bill for which was introduced in the House of Representatives on 27 May 1993. The Committee has no objection to this.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the Committee raises the effect of new r.18BB(3). That provision may operate to the detriment of funds and persons who had entered into an affected scheme before the regulations commenced on 30 June 1993. In such a case the scheme may consist of a contract which is partially performed, with part payments or deposits paid and with possible formal legal commitments. Here, r.18BB(3) would appear to operate, in practice, with prejudicial retrospectivity. The Committee would appreciate your advice on the effect of this provision on contracts partially performed. The Committee accepts that the regulations attempt to deal with retrospectivity by commencing on gazettal on 30 June 1993, rather than on 27 May 1993, but we would welcome your advice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In any event, it seems likely that r.18BB(3) could operate harshly. The Committee suggests that the provision could be improved if it was drafted to read, "If, after the commencement of this regulation, a person has entered into. . . ".</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to the Occupational Superannuation Standards Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rules 1993 No.213, considered by the Committee at its meeting of 30 September 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Regulations (rr.5AAA(4-5), 5AAD(3) and (5), 18Q(3) and 18QA(2) and (4)) confer a number of discretions on the Commissioner. There is no indication in the Explanatory Statement as to whether these discretions are subject to AAT review. On their face, the discretions appear to be important. For instance, they include power to decide whether a prospectus complies with requirements and does not contain any false or misleading statement; whether there is a substantial omission from the prospectus; and to waive a trustee from the requirements of a provision of the Act. It would seem appropriate for the discretions to be subject to AAT review. In this context the committee notes that both the parent Act and the principal Regulations provide for such review of other discretions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee is grateful for the promptness with which you corrected an incorrect reference mentioned by the Committee in its scrutiny of an earlier set of Regulations.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Mal</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you for your letter of 30 September 1993 to the Assistant Treasurer concerning Occupational Superannuation Standards Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rules 1993 No.189 and No. 213. As you are aware the Senate is scheduled to consider a motion to disallow these Regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With respect to Statutory Rules No. 189, your Committee specifically asked for advice on the effect of sub-regulation 18BB(3) on contracts partially performed. In order to assist both your Committee's and the Senate's consideration of this issue, I attach an opinion provided by the Attorney-General's Department that concludes the regulation has no effect on matters done before its date of commencement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With respect to Statutory Rules No. 213 you indicated that it seemed appropriate that the discretions conferred upon the Commissioner in Regulations 5AAA(4&mdash;5), 5AAD(3) and (5), 18Q(3) and 18QA(2), and (4) should be subject to AAT review.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You also noted that both the parent Act and the principal Regulations provide for such review of other discretions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Regarding the latter point, all of the reviewable decisions listed in Section 3(1) of the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act (OSSA) are decisions made under Sections of the Act. There is no provision for decisions made under the Regulations to be reviewable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, in practice, decisions made under the Regulations are reviewable because the matters prescribed by the Regulations are steps along the way to a determination of the Commissioner under s.12 OSSA which is a decision that can be reviewed by the AAT. More detail on how the Commissioner's decisions are open to review is provided below.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Regulation 5AAA derives from the power to prescribe operating standards for superannuation entities [ss 7(1), 8(1) and 8A(1)]. The prescription of standards is not open to administrative review under OSSA. In particular regulation 5AAA relates to the duty of the Commissioner to register a prospectus when he is of the opinion that the prospectus complies with the applied provisions. Until the prospectus is registered the fund cannot attract members or accept contributions [regulations 5AAD(3) and (5)]. In practice an opportunity to appeal to the AAT would be of no practical benefit to the trustee because of the time involved, since trustees require prospectuses in order to carry on business. Thus this is a commercial process for which direct administrative review as performed by the AAT would be inappropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A breach of regulation 5AAA standards is a breach for which the Commissioner may issue a notice of non-compliance under section 12 of OSSA. Since a decision of the Commissioner under section 12 is a "reviewable decision", which may be reviewed in full by the AAT, the provisions of regulation 5AAA are, in practice, accessible by the AAT.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The discretion of the Commissioner referred to in regulation 18Q(3) to form the conclusion that a fund satisfies, or should be treated as if it satisfied, superannuation fund conditions, and the discretion referred to in regulations 18QA(2) and (4) to disregard a breach of fund conditions and, therefore, treat the fund as complying with the prescribed standards also both refer to that function which is performed under section 12 of OSSA. Therefore these discretions are also in practice reviewable by the AAT.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I trust that this information allays your Committee's concerns. In view of the interest of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation in Clause 64 of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Bill and the general issue of review of discretions, I have copied this letter to Senator Watson for his information.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to the Australian Sports Drug Agency Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rules 1993 No.210, considered by the Committee at its meeting of 30 September 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Regulations, rr.8(7-9), provide safeguards for certain competitors who are selected for drug testing. These include competitors who are under 18 years, intellectually disabled, deaf, unable to speak English, or are otherwise unable to receive and understand a request. However, the safeguards are discretionary, not mandatory. This would appear to be an oversight.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator Colston</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you for your letter of 30 September 1993 outlining the Committee's concerns in respect of the amended regulations under the Australian Sports Drug Agency Act 1990.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The integrity of the drug testing program in Australia depends on the ability of ASDA to test competitors at short notice and to ensure that they are given little or no prior warning of a proposed test. This prevents competitors from withdrawing from an event or taking other action to negate the test. This was the intention of the original subregulation 8(7) which prevented the disclosure of the identity of a competitor selected for testing until the competitor is asked to provide the sample.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To ensure the interests of the competitors are safeguarded, provision was also included in the original regulations (regulation ll(l)(j)) for all competitors to be advised, as soon as they are notified of their selection, that they are entitled to have a representative (parent, guardian, coach etc) present during the collection and testing of the sample. This is also set out in the Information Sheet that the competitors are provided with (Schedule 2). This provision remains in the regulations and would appear, generally, to address the concerns expressed in your letter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In practice, subregulation 8(7) created a number of problems. It prevented ASDA officials from consulting with and seeking assistance from parents, coaches, officials, etc in identifying and locating competitors selected for testing. Hence, this provision was omitted and replaced by regulations (8(7)&mdash;8(13)).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These provisions have been made discretionary rather than mandatory because there are circumstances where it is not possible to notify third parties first. This would apply, for example, to competition testing where samples may be required immediately from the major place getters in particular events. In this situation it is often not possible to notify a third party prior to the notification of the competitor.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The privacy implications relating to the prior notification of a third party are also relevant in this regard. The Privacy Commissioner supports the discretionary provisions in the regulations and has observed that a significant number of competitors who are under 18 years of age may prefer to be contacted direct by ASDA officials and not through a parent or guardian.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ASDA is currently preparing a manual of procedures to be followed by field staff. The manual will include details of procedures to be followed in the notification of competitors selected for testing. Care will be taken to ensure that the intent of the regulations is complied with and that field staff apply appropriate sensitivity in dealing with competitors where discretionary provisions apply.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In view of the existing provisions to protect the rights of the competitors, advice from the Privacy Commissioner and the practical difficulties which would arise if the regulations were changed, I believe it is appropriate to keep the regulations in their current form.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I trust this advice deals with the Committee's concerns. If you have further queries, officers of ASDA (Mr Stephen Richards Phone 281 1553; Fax 281 1226) and my Department (Mr Graham Dempster&mdash;Phone 274 1850; Fax 274 1825) are available to discuss them with you.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill contains a technical amendment to the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 to remove a doubt surrounding the composition of a federal redistribution committee for a state.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Redistribution committees for each state and territory subject to a redistribution must be appointed `as soon as practicable' after the commencement of a redistribution. For a state, the redistribution committee must, under current legislation, include the Surveyor-General for the state, or the Deputy Surveyor-General if the Surveyor-General is unavailable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, both Queensland and Western Australia have abolished the Office of Surveyor-General, leaving a doubt as to the legal composition of a redistribution committee in those states, and any others that follow a similar path. This bill provides for alternative arrangements to be made in these cases.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill provides that, where there is no Office of Surveyor-General in a state, the state minister responsible for land, surveying and mapping matters may nominate the person who, in the opinion of that minister, holds the equivalent office or, if that person is unavailable, the person who holds the office equivalent to the Office of Deputy Surveyor-General. If that person is also unavailable, or there is no such person, the Governor-General shall nominate a senior officer of the Australian Public Service from the state concerned. This will ensure that, under any scenario, an appropriate officer from the state concerned will serve on the redistribution committee for that state.</PARA>

<PARA>Dr Nitschke appeared before the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science, Technology, Transport, Communications and Infrastructure in Darwin on 20 July 1993 in relation to a reference on disaster management.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response to the claim, I wrote to Dr Nitschke on 24 August 1993 asking him to outline how he had actually been disadvantaged. Dr Nitschke responded in a letter dated 5 September 1993, in which he advised the committee that on the same day as his appearance before the committee the Minister for Health and Community Services in the Northern Territory, the Hon. M.A. Reed MLA, issued a press release containing comments which, combined with subsequent developments, represents clear evidence of the adverse effects of speaking to the Senate inquiry. Dr Nitschke also advised the committee that his contract had not been renewed for 1994 and that such a decision was `without precedent'. </PARA>

The committee has received replies from the minister and the general manager denying Dr Nitschke's claims. The committee, having considered the information available to it, concluded that a case of breach of privilege may exist and requested me to write to Mr President for consideration of this matter to be referred to the privileges committee. As the result of a request from opposition senators, the committee reconsidered this matter, reconsidered our decision, and at a meeting this morning a majority of the committee decided that the original decision should remain. </PARA>

I believe it is appropriate that the Committee of Privileges, of which I am a member, carefully gives consideration to the conflicting arguments that have been put forward, and bring a report back to this chamber, and I have moved accordingly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are two matters I wish to raise in relation to this particular motion. The first one is a technical, Senate procedures matter. The Senate will recall that last year it unfortunately decided to join the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Technology and Commerce with the Senate Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure. At the time the transport, communications and infrastructure committee, of which Senator Panizza and I, amongst others, were members, was in the throes of an investigation into disaster management. By arrangement&mdash;I do not think it was terribly formal&mdash;it was decided that Senator Panizza and I would continue.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Panizza tells me that it was formally done. It was formally decided that Senator Panizza and I would continue on that committee as members of that committee, only for the purposes of completing the disaster management inquiry. This particular matter of privileges arises out of evidence given to that disaster management inquiry in Darwin. I think the people at that inquiry were&mdash;and Senator Panizza, Senator Murphy or Senator Childs will no doubt correct me&mdash;the chairman, Senator Murphy, Senator Panizza, myself and, I think, Senator Chapman. I do not think there were others there. Someone will correct me if I am wrong, but there were not too many other senators there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result, of course, Senator Panizza and I were both totally involved in that matter. In the first discussion on privileges when the matter was raised in the committee back here&mdash;and Senator Panizza and I both took part in the first discussion on whether the matter should go to the privileges committee&mdash;I argued against it because I thought, firstly, it was not an appropriate case to waste the time of the privileges committee. Secondly, I thought there were political overtones to Dr Nitschke's stand. As a result of that, the committee decided to write to the Darwin hospital to seek a response. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point of my concern, and I cast no aspersions on the chairman here&mdash;I understand the chairman has been acting on advice in doing this&mdash;is that when the matter was again considered by the committee, neither Senator Panizza nor I was even advised that the committee was to meet. Again, today when the committee met we were not even advised that the committee was going to meet. The chairman does have advice, apparently, that because Senator Panizza and I are not officially members of that committee we are not entitled to vote. Even if that advice is correct&mdash;and I do not accept that it is&mdash;then I would have thought, as a matter of courtesy, the committee might have simply advised Senator Panizza and I, knowing our interest in the matter, and allowed us to participate in the discussions even if we were not able to vote. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not have any argument to dispute the advice given to the chairman about whether or not we should have been permitted to be part of those discussions, but it does seem inappropriate considering Senator Panizza and I were formally part of that committee. We were two of the five senators totally involved in the matter. We know what it is about and yet we are not able to participate or vote on a question that arises out of a hearing of that committee. I think this is inappropriate. I have not formally raised this with my colleagues but I would suggest that it is a matter that the procedures committee should perhaps look at to see whether it is an appropriate ruling. If it is an appropriate ruling, perhaps something should be done to enable senators who are officially part of a committee to participate in all aspects of matters arising from an inquiry being conducted by that committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the substantive matter in question, in the meetings that I was involved in I argued against having this matter referred to the privileges committee. I am told that the privileges committee is chock-a-block full of work; it has a lot of references before it and I would have thought that this particular matter was one which really should not waste the time of that particular committee.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not care what his views are or what he wants to put forward, but when it comes down to using the forms of this chamber to promote a political cause in another state, in another parliament, with another government, I think it is most inappropriate. His complaint is that he was discriminated against in his employment. Dr Nitschke claimed this because the minister happened to issue a press release on the day after we were there. I thought the matter would have been over and done with very simply because the evidence clearly showed, and Dr Nitschke admitted, that, subsequent to him giving evidence to us and subsequent to the minister's press release, he was offered a job and re-employed for another six months. I would have thought that was the end of it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">His claim was that he had been disaffected in his employment and the evidence&mdash;his own evidence&mdash;clearly shows that he was re-employed, I think about a month later. It seemed to me it was a silly complaint, one with no justification, one that really should not give Dr Nitschke a forum to promote his view of politics and one that really should not waste the time of this chamber. I have subsequently been told that Dr Nitschke has had a series of incidents involving political comment on his employers and the health department which I understand have been documented to the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Dr Nitschke was going to be sacked because he had spoken against the Northern Territory government, there had been oodles of other opportunities for the government to do it. It did not have to wait until our committee came to Darwin and he got up and made his complaints against the government; he had done that many times before. If the government was going to be vindictive, it would have sacked him then. Why wait for our committee? Again, it seems to me that the reasons advanced by Dr Nitschke were inappropriate, wrong and should not waste the time of this committee. I understand that subsequent to all that Dr Nitschke has since been offered a job at the termination of his current employment. That completely runs against his claim and the reason he says the matter should be referred to the committee. He says he is being victimised and yet not only&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Macdonald has raised two issues. The first of those issues relates to those members who are either temporary members of a committee because it is a particular reference, or who have become temporary members of a committee because the reference has been shifted from one committee to another&mdash;the first committee having been disbanded. As I understand it, that issue has been dealt with by the Clerk. Advice has been given that it is the ongoing members of the committee who rightly consider these matters. Senator Macdonald has taken issue with that advice. I think his suggestion that the matter be reconsidered is an appropriate way to deal with it. However, for the time being, I think we are left with that advice. It seems to me that it is appropriate that the committee should have reconsidered this matter in the way in which it did this morning.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to the other issue in relation to the reference of Dr Nitschke's complaint to the privilege's committee, it seems to me that what the industry, science and technology committee was asked to do, and did do, was simply to consider whether there was sufficient evidence for this matter to be investigated. The committee was not attempting to determine whether the evidence amounted to a breach of privilege but, rather, whether there was sufficient evidence for that matter to be considered. I am really surprised at Senator Macdonald's outburst, particularly against Dr Nitschke. The evidence clearly shows that Dr Nitschke had been employed over quite a long period of time and that immediately&mdash;not the next day&mdash;following his evidence to the committee a press release was issued which stated that `Dr Nitschke has got some sad news coming if he thinks the Territory government is going to waste large amounts of valuable health funding satisfying his ideology'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that all sorts of people having all sorts of ideologies come before Senate committees. Dr Nitschke happens to be one who has a professional standing which has been recognised by the Darwin hospital over a long period of time and which competently allows him to provide advice to this committee on disasters in relation to the very matter on which he was giving evidence, namely, radiation hazards in Darwin. Irrespective of the particular political background from which he comes, even if there was a political motivation&mdash;and I very much doubt that&mdash;he has a perfect right to appear before a committee and put his professional point of view without any threat at all as to his employment, or any other threat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that, on the 12th of this month, Dr Nitschke wrote to me and sent down some documents. I will table these documents with the approval of the Senate in a moment. In his opening paragraph he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following our phone conversation today, there was a surprise media release from the Northern Territory Department of Health stating that they had offered me a 12 month contract at the Darwin Hospital. This is pleasing news, but coming after two months of hell here and three days before the Senate consideration, it makes one a bit cynical.</PARA>
<PARA>I think the members of this chamber have a right to be rather cynical also. As I think the Clerk of the Senate again has pointed out, it is irrelevant whether a threat is actually carried through&mdash;whether or not Dr Nitschke actually lost his job. The fact is that a threat was made and was sustained for a considerable period of time; and, on the eve of the reference of this matter to the privileges committee, miraculously a job appears and Dr Nitschke is reappointed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not trying to canvass the decision that the privileges committee might make, but it seems to me that that evidence should be sufficient for the matter to be referred to the privileges committee. Dr Nitschke&mdash;and when he appeared before the committee he did not hide the fact&mdash;has for a long time been a member of the MAPW, the Medical Association for the Prevention of War. He holds strong views in relation to radiation dangers. That is his right, and it his right to put those views before any Senate committee he chooses, without threat of any action being taken against him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They may be views totally different from the views that Senator Macdonald holds; they probably are. Almost certainly they are.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I seek to speak very briefly on this matter. As a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science, Technology, Transport, Communications and Infrastructure who was at the hearing and at subsequent meetings of the committee that considered this matter, I think it is important to note that what we really have to look at here is whether or not there was any doubt as to the matters that might affect Dr Nitschke in respect of his employment. On both occasions the committee found that to be the case. It found that also on the basis of advice given to the committee and to the chairman of the committee by the clerk and by the President. It is not a matter of considering any view or position that Dr Nitschke holds, whether it has political overtones or anything else, and whether the privileges committee is busy or not is not relevant.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was a matter of the committee considering whether there was any doubt as to whether there might be any effect or threat contained within the circumstances that surrounded Dr Nitschke's giving evidence to the committee. Contrary to what Senator Ian Macdonald has said, the committee found, by majority, that that was the case. In further consideration of the matter today, it also found that to be the case, and it ought to be referred to the privileges committee because that is the appropriate committee to consider whether or not there is a case to answer. I do not believe it is a matter for this chamber to consider. Rather, the issue has been determined by the committee, and the motion put by the chairman ought to be carried. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I repeat what Senator Coulter said in respect of the meeting today. It was not the Australian Labor Party using its numbers. The matter was decided by majority, and I believe that some of Senator Ian Macdonald's colleagues there supported that position. Senator Macdonald did leave out one honourable senator who was in attendance at the meeting in Darwin, and that was Senator Ferguson. Quite frankly, what Senator Macdonald has done is to express a view in this chamber about whether the matter or the substance ought to be dealt with by the privileges committee. He has expressed views about the substance of the issue, which I do not believe he should have done. The issue is that there is some doubt. That is the majority view of the committee. We ought to stop this debate, allow the motion to proceed and get the matter appropriately dealt with. </PARA>

We already have, in a letter, a list of other complaints that had no connection at all with the disaster inquiry. I think it is drawing a long bow to suggest that the reason that he was not immediately reappointed was the evidence that he gave. I think that is something that the Committee of Privileges will decide. At this stage, I am quite happy that that should happen. But Senator Coulter is drawing a very long bow in using that as the evidence as to why it should go.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;There have been two basic themes of opposition. I wish to deal with the first issue that has been raised by Senator Ian Macdonald and Senator Panizza. Nobody knows better than I the results of amalgamating two committees&mdash;the Senate Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure and the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Technology and Commerce. I have attended just about all the meetings that have occurred as a result of the amalgamation of those two committees. There is a difficulty, and I certainly have no problem with referring to committee arrangements for the situation that has developed. In this industry committee we now have three separate teams representing the opposition, and that has caused a problem. In the first place it causes a problem because the industry committee, following a view that certain people were involved with that committee, had an initial discussion about this privileges reference.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Arising from that, we decided to seek advice on what was the appropriate situation, and we had that advice. When one thinks about it, it was correct advice&mdash;although I quite accept sending it to the procedure committee because that might codify the situation, so we do not have the upset that Senator Ian Macdonald and Senator Panizza feel because there was something with which they were involved but they were not in on the final decision. The advice was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although the matter of privilege arises out of the particular inquiry, it is not a matter which is wholly part of the inquiry, but relates to the general operations of the Committee, governed by paragraph (18) of Privileges Resolution No. 1. Therefore a decision in relation to it should be taken by the permanent membership of the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA>That really is the advice we had, as the basic thing. It is true that the advice included the fact that we could have invited other members of the committee to the committee. But when the committee dealt with it, I suppose in many of our minds the very strong views that Senators Macdonald and Panizza had expressed were well known to us.

So that first matter arising from this incident is something that could have a positive result.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, the truth of the matter is that Senators Ian Macdonald and Panizza, to some extent, are still under a misapprehension, and Senator Macdonald has said there are political overtones. Of all the honourable senators here, I think Senator Macdonald would acknowledge that he is as politically partisan as they come in representing his point of view. Some on this side would think that he has carried very strongly a political partisan view in this matter. I am a member of the privileges committee, and I have been a member from the seventh report to the 42nd report. I say that because I cannot go too far into the actual dispute&mdash;I do not think that is appropriate. I am guided by the resolution, and I will read the pertinent part of clause 18 of the privileges resolution. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where the Committee considers that the facts disclose that a person may have been improperly influenced or subjected to or threatened with penalty or injury in respect of evidence which may be or has been given before the Committee, the Committee shall report the facts and its conclusions to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA>Those two words `may' and `shall' where they appear indicate to me that there is a responsibility. I would like to think that, regardless of the political bias of the person charged or charging, I would make sure that he had the opportunity and was given every chance to articulate his point of view in his defence. If that debate took place here in this chamber, as it has started to do today, or if we had agreed with the two honourable senators and had a long argument, which we were moving towards in the committee, we would have denied people justice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me give one example. Senator Ian Macdonald in his partisan presentation, which is the other side of the story, has asserted that Dr Nitschke was offered the job, but let me refer to the correspondence from Dr Nitschke. I will mention one paragraph only to illustrate that we could do a disservice to a person in the dispute if we jumped to a conclusion and if we did not have the almost learned examination that will take place in all honesty by members of the privileges committee. Dr Nitschke asserts in correspondence to us, and this is all I can go by:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department put out a media release on Friday claiming that a job offer had just been made. I have had no confirmation of this and am suspicious while they continue to suppress the report that clears me.</PARA>
<PARA>I will not go into the case any further. I mention that only to raise a doubt, because it would be wrong if honourable senators made a decision in trying to examine who is right or who is wrong. There is one place to take it, and that is to the privileges committee. I am confident, from my experience on that privileges committee, that it will allow people to present their case and it will finally come down with a report. Then we can go into more detail of the issues that are involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is only one other thing to say. It is true that some members of the industry committee may or may not have looked at the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> and all the other things, but the important thing is that, at the privileges committee level, if people wish to bring evidence forward, they will have the opportunity, both in writing and, finally, if it is necessary, at a public hearing. I conclude on this point. If we do not send it to the privileges committee, we run a real risk that people will not be able to present their own case. No matter whether some of us have a bit of a case on either side, we will do it a disservice if we do not allow those people to present their case in any way they want to. The appropriate place is the privileges committee. I urge all honourable senators to forget the political overtones or the partisan political feelings that we have all got and allow the matter to go to the proper place to be resolved. </PARA>

<PARA>I wish to make some very brief comments. In accordance with the agreement that the committee members have made amongst themselves, the majority of our tabling speeches will be incorporated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. This referral would not need to have been made to the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs if at the time of consideration of the estimates more details could have been provided by the department. It is very easy to say that in hindsight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also brings up one of the issues that will always be confronted by the Senate, which is how to handle the difficult problem of police investigations and other charges that might be laid under Public Service disciplinary acts and things like that. There was uncertainty, and that was the reason given for the delay or the non-provision of full details at the time of the estimates. It is a problem and an issue that the Senate has to grapple with at some stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been on another estimates committee where we have had cases that are also under investigation that are totally different from this and involve totally different departments. It is a difficult issue for everybody involved to have to deal with. We should also look at whether provision can be made for estimates committees to deal with these sorts of sensitive issues so that they do not require to be referred on to standing committees. That is one of the requests coming out of the report, and it was unanimously agreed to. There is a dissenting report. All the way through there has been a difference of opinion amongst members on some of the other details, as to how much departments should have been able to give and whether they were trying to avoid giving information. It is certainly the view of the majority that that was not the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to have very clear guidelines and clear recommendations and suggestions as to how we handle the subject of in camera evidence, of which quite a deal was taken in this committee. At the time of taking evidence there were matters still under investigation by the Australian Federal Police and also the end of some disciplinary hearings and charges. How committees respond to that in camera evidence and how committees deal with it when they are writing reports is also an issue where I think all honourable senators would find some further material and clearer guidelines of assistance in handling this difficult issue. I seek leave to incorporate my tabling statement. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">SENATE STANDING COMMITTEE ON COMMUNITY AFFAIRS REPORT ON ALLEGED MISUSE OF PRINTING FACILITIES AT DSS TABLING STATEMENT</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.I am pleased to table the report of the Committee on the Alleged Misuse of Printing Facilities at the Department of Social Security.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.This inquiry was referred to the Committee on 10 November 1992, following a report from Estimates Committee D. It was originally to be reported on by 10 December 1992. However, hearings had not been completed by that time and an extension was granted until early in the Autumn sittings of this Parliament. A heavy workload for the Committee and other factors&mdash;such as a court case relating to the inquiry&mdash;have meant that further extensions have been necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.There is still some difference of opinion among Committee members about the issues considered. As far as the majority report is concerned, Committee members have taken on board some of the comments made by past and current Departmental officers on a draft of the report and believe that the report as it now stands has assessed all the evidence thoroughly and fairly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.The Committee's report states that:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">there are no serious problems with the Department's management; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Department acted efficiently and appropriately in its response to unauthorised use of Commonwealth goods and facilities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5.The Committee does consider, however, that Departmental officers, including the former Secretary of the Department, were unnecessarily abrupt and somewhat evasive at the Senate Estimates D Committee hearing of 17 September 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6.The Committee is aware that Departmental officers have some reasons for not providing some information at the time on aspects of alleged misuse. They were uncertain of the legal situation; some of the events had occurred some considerable period of time before; some aspects of the disciplinary process had not been completed; and the Australian Federal Police were also investigating some matters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">7.However, after careful consideration of each of these reasons, the Committee was inclined to the view that the Department was over-cautious in some of its responses. On a number of occasions, information could have been provided which would not jeopardise other inquiries or appeal processes. It is important for senior officers in major departments to be aware of the extent to which they are able to provide general information on issues, and those areas on which they might wish to seek further time to provide a more considered response.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">8.The Committee is of the opinion that more information could have been given about the fact that there were two separate inquiries. More importantly, it believes that more information could have been made available at Estimates on the matters which the Department itself had investigated. Most of the Departmental charges had been dealt with, and penalties imposed, before the Estimates hearing. General information could have been provided without affecting appeal processes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">9.The Committee was especially concerned about the use of bureaucratic terminology insofar as it was used to restrict answers and to limit the area of questioning. Some of the questions at the Estimates hearings were broad enough to require general answers; it was not appropriate for officers to provide a limited amount of information, and to provide it rather reluctantly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">10.The Committee considers that departmental officers should take some questions on notice when it is possible for a more considered answer to be provided at a later stage, rather than providing limited information&mdash;which may be inaccurate&mdash;at a hearing. While clearly this process should neither be used to avoid providing rapidly information, nor to seek to obtain substantial amounts of unnecessary data, it is one way in which departments are able to meet their responsibilities to Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">11.The Committee considers that the Department's approach and abruptness suggested that matters were being hidden from public scrutiny. While the Committee does not consider that there was a cover up of events at the Department, it does believe that the general impression of unhelpfulness and evasion was the major reason for this inquiry being referred. In this manner, the Department was responsible for an expensive and protracted inquiry which could have been avoided.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">12.The Committee is of the belief that in some cases it would be useful for Estimates Committees to be able to take evidence in camera. This would obviate the need for detailed written information, and would help ensure that sensitive issues could be clarified at the time of the Estimates hearings.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DISSENTING REPORT ON THE ALLEGED MISUSE OF PRINTING FACILITIES AT THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SECURITY</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.This report was referred to the Committee on 10 November 1992. Hearings were completed by mid-December 1992 and a report was drafted by 16 March 1993. A copy of that report was sent to the Committee on 29 March 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.On the return of the Committee to Parliament it was agreed, on 27 May 1993, that given there were some differences of opinion between Committee members, a new report would be drafted. This new draft, which contained substantially the same material as the revised report of April 1993, was completed by 17 June, further revised and sent to Committee members on 29 July 1993. It maintained the emphasis in the earlier version of the report on poor management by the Department; confused evidence; the possibility of false evidence having been given; serious discrepancies in evidence; unwarranted evasiveness by Departmental officers; and the behaviour of some Departmental officers and the poor attitude they appeared to have towards accountability to Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.This report, with some further statements relating specifically to the former head of the Department of Social Security&mdash;Mr Derek Volker&mdash;was agreed to by the Committee on 9 August 1993. On 10 August a copy of the draft report was sent to Mr Volker, to the current head of the Department of Social Security, and to the AFP. This step was taken because the draft report contained a considerable amount of in camera evidence. The Committee also wished to provide persons specifically mentioned in the report with the opportunity to comment on adverse findings. These adverse findings related both to individuals and the operation of the Department of Social Security.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.The responses to the draft report varied. The AFP provided two minor factual changes. The former Secretary of DSS, the current Secretary, and two other officers reacted quite differently. I will refer to these responses in a moment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5.On 19 August 1993 the Committee agreed to postpone the tabling of its report again. It did this for two reasons. First, it wished to consider the responses made by Mr Volker and others, and to give them further time to provide comments if required. Second, a court case relating to matters being considered by the Committee was to be heard. I should note that some concern was expressed by some members of the Committee about the use of sub judice as a reason for continuing to delay the report. The person involved in the court case was not named in the Committee's report at all.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6.Since that postponement of the tabling in August 1993 there has been virtually no detailed discussion of the Committee's report. What has occurred is that the report previously agreed to has been demolished by the Chair of the Committee to a series of disconnected paragraphs. The whole thrust of the original report has disappeared. In the new version the Department, it appears, has done nothing wrong at all. If officers gave varying evidence, this was because the Committee's inquiry was more than twelve months after events, and it was difficult for officers to remember. There were no management problems with the Department. There were no problems with the attitude of Departmental officers and the way in which the then Departmental head behaved towards Parliament. What the report now states is that it would be nice if Departmental officers were a little more forthcoming at Estimates; and that, if they have sensitive information, there should be a process by which this information could be discussed in camera at Estimates.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">7.I have not been advised by the Chair of the Committee of any reason why the comments made by the Department and by Mr Volker should have led to such a drastic change from the former detailed and thorough report. My examination of the comments made by Mr Volker, Mr Godfrey and others has, in fact, led me to ask even more questions about Departmental management and, indeed, the reliability and competence of various officers of the Department of Social Security.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">8.In these responses, new material never previously advised to the Committee was presented as if it was established fact. The Department suddenly advised the Committee of the presence of two people, rather than one, in a building on a day in July 1991. This information, innocuous as it might seem, actually indicated that much previous testimony could be compromised. Yet the Department did not even bother to note that this was a matter which it should have referred to months before, nor did it raise the issue of how much it undermined the quality of other information provided.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">9.It was also obvious from the Department's response that junior officers apparently knew more about what was happening than did the Departmental head and the Deputy Secretary&mdash;and failed to advise either. Information available in September 1992 was not advised to the Committee in November 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">10.Information provided to the Committee by the Department in April 1993 suggested that most of the charges against officers had been dealt with by August 1992. This conflicted with evidence provided at Estimates. The Department's response to this was that while a junior officer had prepared a minute to the Minister three days before Estimates about the charges, neither the head of the Department nor the Deputy Secretary was aware of this information. When they did become aware of it late in September, they did not provide more up to date information to the Estimates Committee, and Mr Godfrey did not provide clear information on the issue at the first hearing of the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs on this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">11.The Department also stated for the first time in August 1993 that it never intended to hold an internal investigation at all, even though it had evidence of wrong doing in July 1991 and later. This is surprising in that it is obvious that the problems in the Department were partly of the Department's own making and there was no evidence of extensive wrongdoing. Without knowing the extent of the unauthorised activity, the Department called in the AFP to investigate, rather than undertaking an internal investigation. But the AFP, a Departmental officer now states, was too slow in its inquiry; hence, the Department had to take action by examining a number of matters itself. There is no acknowledgment that common sense and firm discipline exercised by the Department would have made AFP involvement unnecessary.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">12.The Department has still not explained why it allowed a junior officer, known to have been involved, to resign prior to any internal inquiry; it states that it had no option but to let the officer resign. This is not true.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">13.The comments made by Mr Volker and by various officers in the Department have not convinced me to change the report of 9 August in any substantial way. Insofar as some of it is retained in the majority report, I support those paragraphs. However, there are several matters which have been removed from the majority report, presumably to avoid identifying further the incompetence of the Department. These should be made obvious. Furthermore, the accusations made by Mr Volker and various officers of the Department of Social Security against the Committee have convinced me that the Committee's earlier report&mdash;which commented on the arrogance of </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">those individuals&mdash;was correct, and should b maintained.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">14.In particular, the Department has accused the Committee of the following:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">changing its terms of reference and not advising these to the Department;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">not following proper procedure regarding in camera evidence;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">not allowing Departmental staff to have counsel at in camera hearings; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">taking secret submissions and other evidence into account.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">15.None of the charges made by former and current Departmental officers is true. They have been addressed in more detail in the dissenting report. I would simply like to state at this point that, difficult as it may be for some departments to accept that their actions are subject to total scrutiny, it is nonetheless necessary for some department heads and their senior staff to realise that when requested to provide information they will do so, and do so fully and truthfully.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">16.In conclusion, it is noted that this inquiry has demonstrated a number of problems which should be addressed by the Department of Social Security. In particular, the attitude and behaviour of the then Secretary and certain officers was inappropriate, particularly as regards the provision of accurate and adequately detailed information required by the Senate. Insofar as it is considered that the Department acted inappropriately through referring the matter to the AFP rather than utilising available processes; and insofar as it failed to provide prompt, accurate and detailed information at Estimates on 17 September 1992, the Department must bear the responsibility for wasting considerable time and resources. This cost to Parliament and to the Australian Federal Police was unnecessary, and could easily have been avoided if appropriate management and accountability processes had been an integral part of the Department's operation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At one stage we actually had a document that everybody had agreed to. It took a lot of time and a lot of effort. In particular, I want to pay tribute to Senator Michael Tate, who worked with the committee&mdash;only briefly, unfortunately&mdash;and helped us get a document that everybody agreed to. As we believed it only fair that those people mentioned in the report had the opportunity to have a look at it before it was made public, the committee agreed on 10 August that a copy of the draft report be sent to the Department of Social Security and, in particular, to Mr Volker, the current head of the department. A copy of the report, then in draft form, also went off to the Australian Federal Police.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was after comments came back as a result of those people having had a look at the report that the report changed considerably. What my dissenting report does is seek to put back into the original form what was a unanimous committee report. So the material that was taken out of what has become the majority report is to be found in my dissenting report. I support what Senator West has just said about process and about how departments must look very carefully at the evidence they give before estimates committees and be very aware that when parliament asks for information it has to be provided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I certainly want to support the statement that it has been an enormous cost to parliament, to our time, to the committee's time and indeed to the time of the Federal Police, when this matter could have been handled far more efficiently and effectively within the department. It certainly could have been avoided if internal management practices really were efficient and effective. Hopefully, we will see a change in the future and, if information is required at estimates, it is given efficiently, effectively and accurately.</PARA>

We got shunted from pillar to post. I do not believe that to this day we know exactly what went on and nor are we likely to. But at least it was highlighted in the report and in the dissenting report. I support Senator Lees in that.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with great regret that I am forced to raise the issues that I am raising today on the second reading of the appropriations bills. The issues relate to the good management and administration of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service. The reason that I say it is a great shame that I have to raise these issues in the second reading debate is that they should have been properly dealt with in the process of an estimate's hearing. Senator Brownhill and I have raised innumerable matters in relation to the management of AQIS. We have been fobbed off by either the administration of AQIS, the senior public servants, or by the minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For those who are unaware of this sorry saga, let me briefly encapsulate it. The Australian Quarantine Inspection Service is this nation's shopfront to the world in terms of the good standard of our exports. I will state right here and now that I have a pecuniary interest in this because of my interest in the beef industry. It is in my best interests, as it is in the best interests of all Australian beef producers, to have a thoroughly rigorous export inspection program because it guarantees the quality of Australian beef. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, we should not have an export inspection program that puts massive charges on beef producers, especially when those charges are based on excesses, and outrageous expenses incurred by a bureaucracy that is out of control, and is not subject to review or to scrutiny. We have in this regime at the moment the concept of full cost recovery. However, do we have a concept that says the costs have to be contained? If one looks at the evidence that I am about to present, one has to say that the answer has to be no. Do we have a concept that says the user who pays should have some input into the costing structure? The answer is no. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What Senator Brownhill and I have revealed over the last couple of months, based on information which has been given to us by confidential sources, is that most of the Senior Executive Service officers of AQIS who are based in Canberra have very real cases to answer in terms of their travelling allowances and in terms of their remuneration. When we first raised these matters, the government said that it would deal with them. Almost 12 months ago the government said that it would deal with them. How the government in fact dealt with them up until then was that the internal investigations unit that had found these prima facie rorts, the internal investigations that had gone through all the travel expenses and said, `There is something severely wrong with some of these expenses', was dismembered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A former Australian Federal Police officer who, we found out, had 22 years of investigative service was moved out of the internal investigations unit. It lost one-third of its manpower. That is how the government dealt with the allegations of rorts. That is how the government dealt with the allegations of excesses by the Senior Executive Service. What did it do? It dismembered the internal investigations unit. So much for accountability. So much for the rights of Australian primary producers, who are asked to pay the full cost of AQIS services in this country. That is how this government dealt with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We said, `We believe these matters should be investigated'. So what did the government do? It appointed an investigator who seems, on the basis of evidence that I have already tabled in this chamber, to have gone about the process of a whitewash. Mr Mackey's so-called review had in it numerous flaws; numerous misquotes of the Public Service guidelines; and numerous attempts to say that what people had done which was totally unreasonable, was reasonable. One can say that black is white and white is black; one can say that the sun rises in the west and sets in the east. But it does not mean that it is true. It does not mean that we should have a situation where, just because there is a whitewash, those of us who have very real concerns should pipe down, should go away, and should forget about the matter.

He arrived in London on 22 January in the year in question. He immediately took leave from 28 January to 31 January. They are the remaining working days of that week. He did not take leave on 1 February and 2 February. We do not know what he did, but it is unlikely that he did terribly much because it was a weekend. He then immediately took leave for the next two weeks before attending the four-day conference.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have said before, and I say again: everybody expects there will be a little bit of give and take in terms of people travelling overseas. I am sure most members of this chamber would not mind if officers take a couple of days leave when they are travelling overseas, because it is a long process and the workload can be very heavy. In the case of Mr Gardner Murray, he had already applied to travel out on 6 February, but he changed his travel itinerary to leave earlier and took all that extra time in leave. There was nothing productive at all done in that extra time that he was absent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the sort of thing that is going on. If Senator Sherry thinks that I have stretched the truth on that&mdash;if Senator Sherry can show me one thing that is wrong with those facts that I have outlined&mdash;I will be delighted for Senator Sherry to show me. Senator Brownhill and I have consistently attempted in a very responsible fashion&mdash;because we have been very reluctant to name people to date&mdash;to get some sort of response from the minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had a supposedly confidential and without prejudice meeting with Minister Crean which, to our great shock and surprise, was brought up both in this chamber and in the estimates hearings in a fashion which did not quite represent that meeting. We have been very restrained about that. After I was forced to leave that meeting and come to the chamber to do my Whip's duty, Senator Brownhill spent a long time with the secretary of the department, Mr Taylor, outlining his concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose the real test of the government's bona fides on this matter is what had the government done to bring people to justice before Senator Brownhill and I were forced publicly to make our concerns clear. The answer is nothing. Not one person was charged. We had the infamous Mackey review. We then had an Auditor-General's report. The government told us that the Auditor-General's report gave AQIS a clean bill of health. But when the question was put to the audit officers, `Had you given AQIS a clean bill of health?' they said, `Far from it'. They said moreover that they were not the people who had the necessary skills to do an investigation. They said that they were auditors, that they were not investigators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, we know what happened to the real investigators in AQIS. They were moved somewhere else.

Mr Bisset, whose status is still unknown to us because all the questions we asked on 8 November&mdash;and the government and the senior officers knew perfectly well we were going to ask questions about AQIS&mdash;still have not been answered. The reason why they were not answered on 8 November is that none of the officers which Senator Brownhill and I requested to be present at that meeting were present. Not one of them was there. We never had an explanation as to why they were not there. They all appeared to be ill or on leave of absence without pay or otherwise unaccounted for. But it is quite interesting that Mr Bisset, who could not make the meeting or the hearing on 8 November, did however turn up a week later at another Senate committee hearing, but it was not a hearing of the estimates committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what was the story with Mr Bisset? It is unclear why he was not at the meeting, but what is clear is that nobody who was there was able to answer any questions in relation to Mr Bisset's remuneration, or rather the money that was paid by AQIS for Mr Bisset's services to AQIS. For example, from evidence in the annual report of the department of primary industry, it is very clear that AQIS has paid over $403,000 for Mr Bisset's consultancy services over a 25-month period. That is in itself a little disturbing. But more disturbing is that, on top of $403,000 in consultancy payments, AQIS has also met the cost of Mr Bisset's secretarial services, it has met his travelling costs and out-of-pocket expenses and it has paid Mr Bisset travelling allowances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We asked at the hearing on 8 November whether there was any explanation for the amount of money which had been paid out. No explanation was given. In fact, Senator Gareth Evans seemed to be objecting to my asking each question and waiting for an answer. He said, `Why don't you just ask them all and we will take them all on notice?'. That is not good enough. Senator Evans and the public servants knew that this was the last estimates hearing, that they did not have to answer, that this bill was going to come to the chamber for a second reading debate, that there would be no committee of the whole and that we could not hold up the appropriation until we got the answers. They thought they were in the clear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to give them a very clear message: Senator Brownhill and I are not going to stop. We are not going to give in. We are not going to say, `The estimates hearings are over; we will pack up our bags and forget about it'. No, what we are intending to do from now on is to start naming names&mdash;and naming them here in this chamber. In some cases we may be wrong, but we will never know unless our questions are answered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why is it that $403,000 was paid for Mr Bisset's consultancy services? Why is it that additional costs were paid on top of that? Why is it that Mr Bisset also received travelling allowances? Why is it that Mr Bisset also had his secretarial costs met? Why is it that Mr Bisset also had his out-of-pocket expenses met? Is it the case that Mr Bisset is a public servant or has been a public servant? We do not even know what Mr Bisset's qualifications are to receive $200,000 a year or a little bit over that amount of money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To put it into perspective, why is it that a man who heads up the business services division of AQIS earns more than the Prime Minister? Why is it that a man who exercises the functions of a public servant would appear to earn more than the minister for primary industries? If I am wrong, Senator Sherry, please tell me that Mr Bisset has not received this money. It may be the case. But I have not had an answer. Senator Sherry has gone pretty quiet in the chamber.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hope we will. Let us move on to Mr Fiveash. Mr Fiveash is another interesting character. Mr Fiveash was from the corporate services division of AQIS. Mr Fiveash came to our attention because Mr Bisset was supervising Mr Fiveash's leave of absence without pay. We asked: why was Mr Fiveash on leave of absence without pay? The explanation is an interesting one: Mr Fiveash&mdash;bless his soul&mdash;was overworked, stressed and needed leave of absence without pay to improve his personal lifestyle. I can accept that. Maybe Mr Fiveash was a very hardworking public servant. Maybe he did need a break. But one would have thought the first thing that Mr Fiveash would do would be to take a break. What did Mr Fiveash do? He took a contract of employment with a company called Computer Power, as a consultant to Computer Power.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the significance of Mr Fiveash being a consultant to Computer Power? The significance of Mr Fiveash being a consultant to Computer Power is that Computer Power is a consultant to AQIS. And what section of AQIS agrees to the consultancy payments and lets the contracts to Computer Power? Why, none other than the corporate services division of AQIS, the very division of AQIS from which Mr Fiveash had just come. And Computer Power received half a million dollars in consultancy payments from AQIS during the two relevant financial years. That is where Mr Fiveash went and that is the section that approved it all, Mr Fiveash's own section of AQIS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Bisset, who is a consultant, we are told, is presumably not a public servant, because I do not think a public servant can be employed as a consultant. If a public servant is employed as a consultant, it appears that the guidelines that are in place in the Public Service have been breached, although we are unclear about that because we cannot even seem to get a copy of the secretary's instructions to the department. That seems to be some sort of great official secret as well. Mr Bisset, who is a consultant, seems to have received a delegation to exercise the roles of a public servant in supervising another public servant's leave without pay while he has got his snout in the trough. It is all very sad and sorry. But we are still waiting on the answers to all of these things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having seen just that snippet of evidence, Mr Acting Deputy President, I ask you, I ask honourable senators present in this chamber, and I ask people who will read this <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>: is it reasonable to say that AQIS is thoroughly clean? Is it reasonable to say that the management of AQIS is responsible, and is careful with the money that it spends, money that primary producers, struggling farmers, are paying? The answer would not appear to be yes. The answer would appear to be no, AQIS is not careful with the money it receives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here are all these rich bureaucrats; here are all these powerful men in the Senior Executive Service. The real question is: are the same rules applied to them that are applied to the junior officers of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service? The answer is no. Here we have people travelling overseas doing all sorts of things, and the first charge that was made was as a result of information that Senator Brownhill and I made public at the estimates hearing on 24 September&mdash;the first and only charge. It concerned thousands and thousands of dollars of money seemingly rorted from primary producers and from taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what is the treatment given to the SES officers? Dismember the internal investigations unit; have a couple of reviews to sweep it under the table; and hope that the nuisance senators from the National Party go away. What happens when a junior officer from AQIS alters a leave form and gets a benefit of $71.83? She gets charged in the Canberra Magistrate's Court and collects for herself a criminal record. That is the fairness we see in AQIS. As far as AQIS is concerned, all animals are equal but some are more equal than others. That is what is going on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What of the only charge that has been made to date? The only charge was against a gentleman called Mr Corrigan. Mr Corrigan had been named in some of the investigations unit work. Mr Corrigan appears to have a penchant for Ireland. That may or may not be with some basis. We do not know what the basis of the charge is; it is very difficult to say. It would appear that Mr Corrigan may have been charged for soliciting money from the private sector when he was a public servant; in particular, for writing letters to people asking for them to pay for him to go to conferences in Europe&mdash;for which he subsequently received travelling allowance, by the way&mdash;promising in his letter that, in return for giving him the money to go to conferences in Europe, he would promote whatever aspect of their industry they wished. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are the gentlemen who are supposed to be the policemen of our Quarantine and Inspection Service. What are they instead? They are people with their hands out. They are people who are seeking apparently to use their position for their own benefit. I would have hoped not to have to deal with it here; I would have hoped that we could deal with this in the estimates hearing. I would have hoped that the officers would have been able to answer the questions, and would not have been hidden away somewhere or have all been given leave without pay, sick leave or whatever it was. Look, unless we get the answers, we are not going to stop. We do have more information; we want answers to these questions; and we want the government to recognise that the money AQIS is frivolously spending comes from the pockets of struggling farmers and comes from the Australian taxpayer. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to comment on the matters that Senator O'Chee and I raised in the Estimates Committee A hearings. Despite the cooperation of the committee and the best endeavours of the committee secretariat, I had great difficulty in obtaining information from officers of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service. They simply did not turn up, for the most part. When they did, the minister representing the minister for primary industries at the time prevented them from answering questions. Senator O'Chee has already alluded to that. Both the non-attendance of the requested officers and the obstructive tactics of the two ministers who represented the minister for primary industries at the hearings were a discourtesy to the Senate and make a mockery of the estimates process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are on the threshold of passing the appropriation bills and we are still to receive answers from AQIS, answers that could have been provided to us had the officers appeared or, when they did appear, had they been allowed to answer. I have to repeat that this is a government department that is, in large part, based on cost recovery from farmers but it is 100 per cent funded by the taxpayers, because those farmers either pay tax or the people in the community pay tax. It is something the new AQIS executive director appears not to acknowledge, if his evidence before the rural and regional affairs committee this week is any guide. There he said that certain funds for consultancies were coming out of budget. Surely that does not come out of the government; it comes out of the taxpayers in the first instance and government passes it on through its departments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issues Senator O'Chee and I raised related to travel expense excesses, excessive consultancy fees and other administrative irregularities&mdash;some quite small and minor and others quite large and significant. We raised issues such as officers approving travel for other officers when they were not in Canberra to even sign the form, overseas travel taken without prior approval or approval backdated, extensive use of mobile phones and fuel cards for very identifiable private business when the regulations state that it is not permitted, and officers at the very top of AQIS repeatedly taking leave&mdash;which Senator O'Chee has just mentioned&mdash;while overseas to such an extent as to give the appearance that the trip was designed around the leave. These are questions that should be successfully answered if there is nothing to hide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have the most senior officer spending more than half his time out of Canberra, which may help to explain why there is such chronic mismanagement of administration within the headquarters of AQIS. Maybe that is where the problem lies. They are good officers and good people, more than likely, but they are just not doing the job right. There are consultants employed at three to four times the salary of a permanent officer carrying out administrative functions that could and should have been done by someone on a prescribed Public Service rate. Senator O'Chee has made that point. Consultancy contracts have been awarded to companies that then employ senior officers from the very section that awarded the contract. These are questions that should be answered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a burgeoning consultancy bill that this year has blown out from $1.7 million to $3.5 million, at a time when AQIS is claiming that it is streamlining its operations and cutting back on costs. It is just moving the deck chairs. Officers have been soliciting funds from private companies. Senator O'Chee has made that point. Funds have been obtained from international organisations but have not been recorded and receipted in a proper audited manner. We are not the only forum that has sought answers. The matter started when the internal review officers were thwarted in their task. They had their records taken and altered and finally had their activities summarily stopped. We have to ask ourselves why. </PARA>

Had the department acted openly and properly on what was discovered then, it might have prevented the whole department from coming under suspicion and attracting scorn, derision and discredit, as it has now. That is the sad thing for me as a user of the service, and it is a sad thing for Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The then secretary to the department, one Mr Geoff Miller, chose instead to arrange an authorised officer to review the matter, and that officer reviewed it in such a way that he was able to conclude that the first travel audit was improper and without foundation. He came to that conclusion without even examining any of the working documents. On that basis alone one would have to question whether he was really correct, or the veracity of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Notwithstanding that, the department issued a media release to suggest that the matter had undergone the proper departmental procedures and that everything was in order. But the issues would not go away. So the Auditor-General was called in to give it a clean bill of health. But try as he might, he could not; and he concluded that there were at least three instances that were in-principle breaches of the Public Service Act. The report is <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Auditor-General&mdash;Audit Report No. 3 1993-94&mdash;Australian Quarantine Inspection Service</EMPHASIS>. In summary, the report notes that some 330 individual matters were examined and, of these, 39 per cent were found to have no substance; 47 per cent were breaches of regulations which indicated inadequacies in management practices&mdash;I repeat: 47 per cent were inadequacies in management practices; 13 per cent were breaches of regulations which involved recoveries from officers to the net value of $2,000; and there were three instances that may have involved misconduct in the terms of the Public Service Act 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ANAO did not support the findings of the departmental officer that no misconduct had occurred in any of the cases examined. So the saga went on. One would think that at this stage the person in charge of the department would have been saying, `I want to clean it up'. But still nothing was done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then Senator O'Chee and I started asking questions; and a very strange thing happened. All of a sudden, the department decided that perhaps things were not as satisfactory as it first thought and the very matters we raised were addressed. An officer who had been cleared by the internal review processes&mdash;not once but twice&mdash;and who could not be prosecuted, according to the Attorney-General's advice, was now the subject of charges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have since raised the matter of the consultant who has, to our knowledge, received $403,000 in consultancy fees in the past 18 months. His qualifications appear to be in accountancy but could not be regarded as particularly unique or warranting such an income if he were employed as a full-time officer. As I have said, it would seem that he is costing the department three to four times what he would if he were employed as a permanent officer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister, Mr Crean, invited Senator O'Chee and me for a briefing which, I understood, was to be and to remain private but from which the minister has since chosen to disclose matters raised by Senator O'Chee and me. The minister assured us that it was his desire to ensure that AQIS was a credible, unblemished and efficient department. That was repeated at the Senate estimates committee by Senator Gareth Evans on 8 November. I quote from page 335 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of Senate Estimates Committee A:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Crean undertook to investigate any further matters that they might wish to raise in regard to AQIS. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Crean also advised the House of Representatives, in response to a question from the honourable member for Murray, Mr Lloyd, that he was `perfectly happy' to fully investigate any aspect where irregularity was asserted. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am prepared, as I say, to investigate anything that is put forward in concrete terms.</PARA>
<PARA>But just how sincere is the minister, because we have put other things forward in concrete form? Surely, he would be at this stage saying, `Look, I do not want this thing hanging over my head. I want to clean it up'. But the point really is, I suppose, that, if two coalition senators know what is going on in AQIS, why does the minister not know? Why is it that he addresses matters only after Senator O'Chee and I bring them to his attention? If he is genuine in wanting to clean up his department, why has he not acted of his own volition? Why must he wait for us to bring matters to his attention? He is, after all, the minister supposedly in charge of the department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He ought to know what is going on. If he does not, one has to question his ability as an administrator. I do not question his ability as an administrator. Obviously, he is a person of trust. He is a minister in charge of a department. His is a very important portfolio. I come now to the most serious ramification of all of this. I place on record the fact that threats, implied and otherwise, have been delivered to me directly and by messenger. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">AQIS is Australia's public face for our much envied veterinary and quarantine reputation. It is a reputation that has been hard-earned. I do not know of anyone who would want to see that reputation sullied. The officers about whom these allegations have been made are very senior administrators. They are the public face of AQIS. Australia's reputation rides on their credibility. So why are they daring to put at risk that reputation, a reputation that affects not only the primary producers of this country but all Australians, present and future? What right have they to do that and what right has the minister to protect them?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not merely an internal matter of some trifle. It is a serious reflection on Australia's reputation. The action that Senator O'Chee and I have taken has been taken after long and very considered thought. It is not being done to punish any individual. It is being done in an effort to protect Australia's international reputation and to ensure that Australian producers get a fair deal. Senator O'Chee has alluded to that. It is being done to ensure a fair deal is given to the farmers and the people who pay for the inspection service, which is a cost recovery service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is being done to try to restore the confidence of other officers within the department who believe in the worth of the service and who do not wish it to be destroyed by individual greed and careless mismanagement. I stress that I am not in any way impugning the reputation of the officers about whom we have been asking questions. They are acknowledged as international leaders in their field, and their professional abilities are not at issue. But they are jeopardising their own reputations, along with that of Australia, and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy is exacerbating the situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reputation of AQIS is already fairly low, if evidence taken by the rural and regional affairs committee is any indication. Earlier this week, we had evidence given to us by people who said that AQIS officers were negligent as far as consultation was concerned. They had inappropriate consultations with the industry regarding the new charges that people perceive are being put on. Basically, the industry was saying that AQIS needed to achieve real reform, not just a shuffling of the cards. Officers were accused by others of being negligent in preparing the industry for change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I asked a question about a letter that was written two months ago to Mr Bisset, the person who is getting the high consultancy fees. The letter has not been replied to yet. It was about multiple charges for packing works within the same confines. There has been no reply to that letter for two months&mdash;I think the letter was written on 10 September&mdash;and the witness said, `I think it is arrogant'. They were the very words he used. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This organisation is a division of the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. It is Australia's public face, yet throughout Australia it is subject to widespread criticism, so much so that there are measures in the budget to rationalise and reform the whole structure of AQIS to make it lean and efficient. It makes one wonder why a few jobs are being cut off, on the one hand, and a consultancy of $400,000 is being given, on the other hand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Efficiency in AQIS cannot improve nor can the attitude of AQIS change unless reforms start at the top, unless management is transparent and honest. Efficiency and productivity must be proven right from the top. That is not proven at this stage. If we do not get reform at the top there will be no desire to improve through the ranks of the inspection service. If Mr Crean has any decency, if he has any appreciation of what it means to be in charge of Australia's most valuable export commodities and to be responsible for protecting Australia's overseas reputation, he will move quickly to have the entire AQIS independently assessed and to have an open and thorough inquiry by professional investigators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what Senator O'Chee and I are asking for. We are asking the minister to realise the problems that he has had at the top of his department and to do something about it. The more he pushes the dust under the carpet, the more he tries to hide the people in AQIS behind his ministerial cloak, the more people will question why he is not cleaning it up, why he is not taking direct action to stop this saga that has been going on for so long. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In any investigation, in any inquiry, the innocent never have anything to fear; it is only the guilty who search for protection.

Are you brave enough to pick it up? Are you brave enough to run with it and clean up an organisation that has had all these accusations made about it so that once and for all it is a lean, mean, squeaky clean machine of which we can all be proud?'. </PARA>

With production costs in China and other Asian countries being one twenty-fifth of the costs Australian textile and shoe manufacturers have to meet, tariffs are clearly no protection. But we should note that we are now the only country to have abolished all import quotas. The last such legislation was passed late last year over the strenuous opposition of the Australian Democrats.

Business enterprise provided 40 per cent, down from 42 per cent in 1988-89. State governments provided 11 per cent. While the government's expenditure on R&amp;D is comparable to most OECD countries, the expenditure by the business sector lags badly and is responsible for our position of fourth from the bottom in the list of OECD countries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recent changes in Australia's company tax rates, from 40 per cent in 1988 to 33 per cent now, have meant that the value of the original 150 per cent concession for R&amp;D&mdash;since reduced to 125 per cent&mdash;has decreased from 73.5 per cent of the investment to 49.5 per cent. In contrast, Singapore's R&amp;D tax incentive, which is modelled on the Australian scheme, is set at 200 per cent, as reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> in July 1993. This may not be the only option but, clearly, the issue of industry investment in R&amp;D must be addressed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us have a look at another country where R&amp;D is clearly playing a major part in that country's progress. In Germany, the ministry of research and technology is specifically responsible for coordinating all federal R&amp;D expenditure. The German technological innovation system is clearly a major factor in making German firms world-class producers of high quality goods. Industrial innovation is a specific goal rather than an indirect result of defence spending, as it has been for decades in the United States, or a by-product of basic and broadly based academic research, the historical avenue in Anglo-Saxon countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Industrial innovation in Germany is generated through an extensive network of institutions, largely structured on a regional basis. The application of new technologies to the existing manufacturing process is supported very widely with financial incentives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This innovation infrastructure serves the different needs of large and small firms. While industries dominated by a small number of large firms provide the bulk of R&amp;D funding in their sector, industries consisting of many small innovative firms&mdash;for example, working on machine tools&mdash;depend on resource pooling and information exchange. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Industrial research cooperatives and trade associations help set the government's national research agenda. While the private sector is clearly the driver of industrial R&amp;D, the federal government adds value to research conducted by individual firms by adding public funds to private R&amp;D resources and by making technological information from academia available and useable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Japan a determined R&amp;D push designed to stay in the forefront of technological developments is the result of close cooperation between industry and government, a traditional feature of Japanese economic and industrial development. In addition, Japanese firms regard global scanning for technological insights as an integral part of their business strategies. This includes sending researchers, engineers and technicians to international conferences and trade shows or to visit their global competitors and to work in overseas laboratories. In 1988, over 5,000 scientists worked in the United States alone. Japanese government agencies also gather technological information from around the world and make it available to industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its 1991 report on competitiveness, EPAC identifies two ways of enhancing innovation in Australia: one, by integrating research and development into the generation of new products and processes within individual enterprises; and, secondly, by tapping the vast pool of overseas R&amp;D. This process could be accelerated by allocating more government resources to research programs with an industry focus, as is increasingly the case with the work done by CSIRO, and by establishing a system of targeted incentives and a framework for close cooperation between industry and government agencies on a sector by sector basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Training and education is the other leg underpinning industrial innovation and excellence. As is the case with its contribution to R&amp;D, Australian business contribution to training also lags well behind that of other countries. For example, German industry spends five per cent of its payroll on training while Australian industry spends only 1.5 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The contrast with Asian countries is stark. More than half of Singapore's male university undergraduates and one-quarter of the female undergraduates study engineering. Science and business related subjects are close behind. In Singapore every student is getting on with some form of vocational education. In Australia it is just one in five. However, citing these examples should not be taken as a push for narrowly specialised vocational training. Singapore itself is conscious of this by focusing on picking the skills that pick winners. On the ABC's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> program on 7 September 1992, Brigadier-General Lee said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You never know which industries are going to be in the ascendant in five or 10 years time, and to identify which company will do well, and make sure that (it) is here, is even more difficult. But we know what skills will be necessary in five or 10 years time, whichever the industry is. You must be numerate, you must be literate, you must be mechanically oriented.</PARA>
<PARA>Perhaps I could add that one must be creative and innovative, and that requires a broad educational base, the capacity to think and the capacity to draw connections. These are just some of the considerations the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development, Alan Griffiths, should include when he prepares his new, activist, industry policy. Research and training initiatives clearly must be an integral part of such a policy. It is critically important for the future of Australian industry, indeed for Australia's future as a nation, that this policy is based on a careful, intelligent assessment in each industry sector carried out in close cooperation between employers, workers and government agencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Above all, we must ensure that we do not exclude any of the array of measures available, ranging from selective and time limited import containment to stronger support for research and education, to financial and tax incentives, low cost finance, labelling and quality control of imports and government purchasing policies which favour Australian producers.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It will not be surprising that I will be making remarks which are complementary to those of Senator Spindler, particularly his earlier remarks on the need for a comprehensive and total overview of both the economic and the social management of the country. For too long it seems that we have taken an ideological position&mdash;an economic rationalist position&mdash;in relation to industries, industry by industry, and have ignored some of the wider implications of those decisions. For example, we have often destroyed industries which has led to unemployment. While the cost of that unemployment does not appear against the budget of the particular industry, it nonetheless shows up somewhere else in the overall Australian economic assessment. If those people appear on the dole then there are very significant implications, both social and economic, associated with that even though the industry itself may, in a narrow sense, be made to look more economic as a consequence of those decisions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The area I particularly want to dwell on today is the forestry area. I think this is an example, par excellence, in which the management by state governments over many decades has meant that essentially there has been a very substantial state subsidy of forestry. Not only are we seeing enormous environmental damage and destruction of old-growth forests; not only are we seeing extinction of species in these forests; we are also actually paying the forestry industry to cut our forests down and, in many cases, to cart those trees away as woodchips for export to other countries. We are actually paying for this destruction to occur. The activities in the forests are not, as one would be led to believe, economically propitious and economically advantageous to this country. In fact, they are economically damaging. So, in addition to the environmental damage, we have an economic damage. Taxpayers are actually subsidising the damage which is going on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite recently, the Federal Government, together with the states, entered into what is known as the national forest policy statement. That policy was signed last year by the Commonwealth and by all the state governments with the exception of Tasmania. The policy requires that state forest agencies avoid activities that significantly harm areas of old-growth forest and areas of wilderness value or high conservation value. The reality is that the state forest agencies in New South Wales, Victoria, Western Australia and Queensland are logging at this very instant areas of high conservation value, in total violation of that policy. Areas of world conservation value are right at this instant being logged in Tasmania. Areas of the National Estate&mdash;part of our natural heritage, part of our national heritage&mdash;are being razed right at this minute. The Commonwealth, as a signatory to that policy and as the body that should be a leader in environmental matters, must act to stop this crime against the environment and against future generations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over and above that aspect, I want to concentrate today, since we are talking about appropriations, on the economic damage that is being done to Australia, because we are paying for this damage to occur. It is not as though we are getting an economic benefit against an environmental damage. We are getting both economic damage and environmental damage as a consequence of this forestry. The logging of these old-growth forests is a debt-making process; it is not a benefit. Taxpayers are actually paying state governments to destroy our natural heritage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Conservation groups have pointed to this situation for years, yet governments have refused to listen, despite the fact that many of the investigations that governments themselves have carried out have produced this evidence. So it is not just a matter of evidence from the environment and conservation groups, groups that may be regarded as having a particular view; there are many government-initiated reports that establish exactly the same situation. For instance, the Resource Assessment Commission said in its forest and timber inquiry final report that in all states, with the exception of South Australia, there were negative net revenues for the period 1927 to 1989. The 62-year time frame is important because of the long periods between logging and the necessity to rotate the old-growth forests into new plantations. One does not replace overnight a 400- or 500-year-old forest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The figures indicate that the debts run up by state forestry are as follows: Queensland, $1.536 billion&mdash;we are talking about very large amounts here; Victoria, $1.086 billion&mdash;these are debts that have been incurred over that time by state forestry; New South Wales&mdash;again, there is the independent report in New South Wales&mdash;$1.033 billion; Tasmania&mdash;in terms of per capita debt a very small state but a very large debt&mdash;$520 million; and Western Australia, $443 million. In other words, an enormous debt has been built up over years because forestry has simply not paid its way. We have been paying for our forests to be carted away as woodchips and exported to other countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Resource Assessment Commission forest and timber inquiry report stated that in 1989 alone Victoria's forest service made a loss of $40 million: $40 million of taxpayers' money was paid to the forestry industry to cart our timber and woodchips away. In May of this year the Victorian Auditor-General's Office released a special report on Victoria's timber industry strategy. The report stated that in 1990-91, in the case of hardwood operations, there was a loss of $13.2 million. The report said that the department was unable to refute claims made by conservation groups that the industry is heavily subsidised by the Victorian public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is happening is that the infrastructure costs associated with forestry&mdash;the building of roads, the repair of soil, replanting&mdash;are being borne by the public while the private industry is taking the timber away. In New South Wales in 1990 the Public Accounts Committee released a report on the New South Wales Forestry Commission. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The entire timber industry in New South Wales revolves around a system of substantial public subsidies.</PARA>
<PARA>If we want to get the economy of this country onto a proper footing, we should at least be recognising that industries that rely on such substantial public subsidies should not be allowed to continue. The committee reported that in 1989-90 the commission subsidised the forestry industry to the tune of $16.2 million&mdash;a $16.2 million subsidy in just a single year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The economics of the native forest hardwood industry simply do not stack up. The industry survives on government subsidisation. No other industry in Australia is subjected to the same degree of protection or privilege, except perhaps in the case of the nuclear industry, and we have seen recent examples of this in relation to the amount of money soaked up by ANSTO. The debt is created by state governments' willingness to underprice the eucalypt logs and to bear the full costs of much of the infrastructure, such as road construction, maintenance of roads, soil reclamation, and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry still requires substantial reform. Governments must stop the uneconomic and environmentally disastrous activity of old growth forest logging. It is illuminating to note that South Australia is the only state that operates at a profit in terms of forestry, and the South Australian timber industry has relied on plantation timbers for many decades. The royalties charged by the South Australian government internalise the costs of government-supplied services, such as road construction and so on. In the other states, royalty charges do not meet the costs of government subsidies to the forestry industry. In Tasmania, the Forestry Commission has this year lowered its royalty charges even further. This will create an even larger debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why should we continue to carry on an activity which is not only environmentally destructive but where we pay for that destruction to occur? It is not as though we are getting a benefit from this destruction. The extraction quota for sawlogs in Tasmania is 743,000 cubic metres per annum. The export quota for Tasmanian woodchips is 2.889 million tonnes per annum&mdash;an enormous amount of destruction for which the taxpayer, in Tasmania and generally, has to pay. That enormous destruction of our forests has to be subsidised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A few weeks ago the Minister for Resources, Michael Lee, gave in-principle support to the construction of a mill at Hampshire in Tasmania. The minister said that the mill would derive 85 per cent of its feedstock from plantations. However, what the minister did not say was that this was a target and that in order to met that target the forestry industry would clear large tracts of old-growth forest to pave the way for the plantation estates. So the initial situation is certainly not that 85 per cent of the feedstock for that mill will come from plantations; far from it. In the early years a large proportion will come from the clearing of old-growth forests. Only subsequently will those areas be replanted and become plantation estates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are seeing in Tasmania, as in the other states, is logging at unprecedented scales being paid for by the taxpayer. It is not a profitable industry. It is not an industry that should continue to attract subsidy. The forest sector trade deficit is $1.6 billion. This is a national disgrace. Despite over 50 inquiries, many environmental impact assessments and countless blockades, the forestry industry is still in a mess, both environmentally and economically. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal government has to take its environmental and economic responsibilities seriously. It must ensure that state forest agencies internalise all their costs, appropriately price sawlogs and pulp logs, and stop logging old-growth forest and wilderness areas. It is fundamental to the whole idea of market economics that proper costs are represented in prices, something with which I am sure Senator McGauran would agree. If that internalisation were to occur, that action in itself would stop a great deal of the logging of old-growth forests. As I have indicated throughout this speech, there are enormous subsidies going into the logging of old-growth forests, into the damage that is occurring to our forest environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proper pricing of sawlogs and pulp logs would see much of the industry move out of native forest logging as it would simply not be economic to do that. It appears to be economic only because of the enormous subsidies that are given to forestry. The sustainable way forward&mdash;this government has committed itself to sustainability&mdash;is to fast-track the development of plantations on cleared agricultural land and for the federal government to ensure that it takes the lead and enforces its own agreed national forest policy to protect Australia's natural heritage. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very rare, of course, that the government would call upon an opposition member to chair one of the Senate committees. It is not only rare&mdash;I do not think it has happened before. It is a mark of how tangled our superannuation laws have become in this country and how incomprehensible they are that the government has had to call upon the great brain of that Tasmanian senator, Senator Watson; and he is doing a marvellous job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is known in the industry, and more particularly by the employees, that the compulsory superannuation scheme is a failure because of its exorbitant administration charges. Workers have seen their contributions to the superannuation scheme reduced to petty cash because of the inefficiencies and exorbitant administration charges of the superannuation firms. Other than this unsatisfactory response by the Treasurer and the government, the government has put aside any national savings policy to meet Australia's saving problem. It has totally put aside any other policy. Yet Australia's low level of national savings is the single most important factor in reducing Australia's foreign debt and stabilising this country's economic slide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is, then, timely to restate what we mean by savings and why Australia must save more, two simple points that the government has neither the intellect nor the wit to understand. Savings are that part of national income not spent. Private savings are predominantly made up by households, while public savings can best be seen in budget surpluses. The importance of savings is that their investment can be financed at home by borrowing on national savings and not relying on foreign savings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's national savings have fallen to 16 per cent of GDP, which is the lowest it has been since federation, except, of course, during the times of the world wars and the Great Depression. While it is difficult to estimate what the ideal level of savings figure would be, it is generally believed that 25 per cent of GDP would be a satisfactory level to achieve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's reliance on foreign savings has pushed its foreign debt to $175 billion net as of the June quarter 1993. The decade of Labor has seen our foreign debt jump to that exorbitant level. Added to that, of course, is the one million unemployed. That will be the legacy that this government will leave&mdash;the one million unemployed and the foreign debt. That is what it will be most remembered for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Japanese rate of savings is often held up as the root cause of Japan's economic success. Even in these times of recession, it will be the high rate of savings in the Japanese economy that both government and households can rely on to cushion them against their recession. In Australia we have been unable to avoid the deep traumas of recession because we have been loaded with debt. We have not had a satisfactory savings level in this country, so the traumas of the recession have been deeper. On a recent parliamentary trip to Japan, an interesting summation of Japan and Australia's situations was made by one of our senior hosts at the time. He said, `Japan's success is that Japan's business borrows from the Japanese people. Australia's failure is that Australia's business borrows from the Japanese people'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we wish to lift ourselves out of recession, raise our living standards, create jobs and reduce unemployment, we will need higher levels of investment. Investment is presently weak for a range of reasons, but the revival of business confidence and stronger investment financed by higher domestic savings would provide the basis for durable and strong growth in the 1990s and beyond. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A starting point for raising national savings is for the government to reduce its call on national savings by producing budget surpluses. However, the best that can be achieved by this government is the commitment of an overall budget deficit of 1.3 per cent of GDP by 1996-97. This commitment cannot be relied upon, of course, as it is no more than a political statement by the Treasurer, Mr Dawkins. Even under the present conditions of a no policy change basis, the Treasury itself predicts that a budget deficit in 1996-97 would be at least  3.4 per cent of GDP. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Household savings being the crucial area of savings requires policies of incentive. These policies must include three key elements. One element must be a low inflation regime, yet it has been estimated in the budget papers that Australia's inflation rate will be over 3.5 per cent, and there is a growing market expectation that this is the lower end of the expectation. It was high inflation and high interest rates that stripped away household savings in the 1980s. It was the then Treasurer, Mr Paul Keating, who introduced that policy of high interest rates that had much to do with the slump in national savings. The second element must be a policy of low tax and fair administration charges for employee superannuation schemes. The third element must be a tax free savings scheme for all Australians savings accounts where interest income on savings up to a limit attract a form of tax rebate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I would like to go back to the original source commissioned by the government, the FitzGerald report on national savings, to highlight the crisis that Australia has reached, the government's inaction and its importance. Mr FitzGerald says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Over the long term if we want strong growth and if we want to accumulate wealth, then we cannot continue to access foreign savings at an increasing rate. We must lift our own national savings. Savings may have little direct impact on investment. It does, however, permit the investment to grow without foreign liabilities also rising. In short, looking out over the 1990s and into the next century, the rate at which we can grow, bring down unemployment and sustain strong job growth within rising living standards depends on how we perform in raising national savings, coupled with how we perform in raising productivity and competitiveness.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise a matter relating to local government generally, which is my shadow responsibility in this parliament and, in particular, to one shire council, the Whitsunday Shire Council in Queensland. One of the complaints I receive from councils as I visit them around Australia relates to their self-perceived lack of autonomy and the fact that they do not always have control of their affairs. Many of them have called for constitutional recognition to, in some way, confirm their very existence. The question of constitutional recognition is something I am currently looking at, and which the Liberal and National parties are reviewing. Obviously, we will come up with some proposal in relation to that at the appropriate time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Whitsunday Shire Council is a very clear example of how autonomy has been taken away. That has been done by the Queensland Labor government taking legal action to prevent the council from carrying out its duties. The council has had what I can only call an unhappy relationship with its shire clerk for some time. The council voted, for reasons which I will not go into in detail, to dismiss the shire clerk principally because members of the council were not able to work with her, and for other reasons. But the Queensland government has come in with a claim to the Supreme Court for an injunction to prevent the council from carrying out its decisions, the duty it is elected to do by the people of the Whitsunday shire. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is rather sad that the Queensland government has chosen to take that action. It is taking the action on the basis that it is alleged that the shire clerk was a whistleblower involved in some investigation being conducted by the Criminal Justice Commission. But this, of course, does not seem to be the case. It seems the state Labor government is leaving her there simply to embarrass the Whitsunday Shire Council. The CJC investigations into some aspects of council operations were, in fact, investigations which the council itself&mdash;and particularly the shire chairman, Councillor Glen Patullo&mdash;took some time ago in asking the CJC to come in and investigate a particular matter. The CJC has been very slow on the matter. It never seems to get closer to coming to any determination and one wonders why it has adopted this attitude in relation to the Whitsunday Shire Council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am concerned at the length of time the CJC has taken because it does cause unease in that council. The investigations are being used as an excuse for keeping on a staff member who has obviously lost the confidence of the majority of the councillors on that council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also concerned that the state Labor member for Whitsunday, Mrs Lorraine Bird, has taken a very anti-Whitsunday Shire Council and very anti-Whitsunday stance since she was elected about four years ago. As many honourable senators would know, the Whitsunday area is one of Australia's greatest tourist destinations. The islands of the Whitsunday are absolutely magnificent, and I would urge all honourable senators to visit that area and just see what a spectacular place it is. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Even Senator Burns agrees with me. People have compared it with the Greek islands, but I do not think there is any comparison at all. The Whitsunday are far and away much better than those. The towns of Airlie Beach on the coast, and Proserpine a fraction inland, are modern, progressive and lively communities. It is a very progressive shire. Proserpine was originally built on the sugar industry and the wealth from sugar. In more recent years, the spectacular tourism attractions, both natural and man-made, make the shire one of the most desirable places to live in and to visit. It is a place that is going ahead in leaps and bounds under very good management. It is a shire in which we would all be proud to live and have some part of the management of.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, Mrs Bird does not seem to share that view. She spends a great deal of her time denigrating the Whitsunday area and the Whitsunday Shire Council. She does nothing to instil any investor confidence into the area and refuses to cooperate with the council in things which would be of major benefit to that community. For example, in relation to the Laguna Quays Resort&mdash;this is a new tourist facility in that region, which has been very well received environmentally and is delightfully planned&mdash;Mrs Bird, I think it was in her maiden speech, said that that resort would go ahead, `Over her dead body'. She has no interest in promoting the area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She has been appointed to the parliamentary committee of the Criminal Justice Commission. This appointment would seem to be pretty inappropriate in view of her attitude to the Whitsunday Shire Council, and in view of the fact that the Whitsunday Shire Council asked the CJC some time ago to do some work in the shire. Her use of parliamentary privilege in Queensland to attack the councillors on the Whitsunday Shire Council is something to be regretted. She has been able to make what were, if she made them outside parliament, quite defamatory statements. She does this under parliamentary privilege, without giving the people she attacks the opportunity of responding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been some leaks from the CJC, designed to embarrass some of the councillors on the Whitsunday Shire Council, and there is a suggestion that Mrs Bird is the source of those leaks. Her continuous criticism of the council has reduced public and investor confidence in the area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think there is a need for the Queensland government to come forward with some whistleblower legislation. The Goss government promised some legislation four years ago, but it has never come. The lack of any rules has caused problems generally and in this instance in particular. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am concerned that Mrs Bird, the member for Whitsunday, is using her position on the CJC in an improper way. I am very concerned about her continual denigration of the Whitsunday Shire Council and of the people of that area who are making a very good and positive attempt to continue progress and development in that area. Mrs Bird seems to think that people who have a different political view from hers are fair game to be attacked, even though they are not in a position like hers where they can defend themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I certainly hope that the CJC will very quickly conclude its investigations into that council&mdash;investigations which were called for by the council&mdash;so that that issue can be got out of the way. One could perhaps be excused for thinking that this cloud will be left hanging over the council until just before the Queensland shire council elections are held towards the end of March next year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a rumour around, and I do not know if it is much more than a rumour, that Mrs Bird's husband&mdash;I think he is a former Treasurer of the Labor Party in Queensland&mdash;might be out of a job. He is currently a member of an adjoining shire council, the Pioneer Shire Council, and that council is being amalgamated with the Mackay City Council, so there are suggestions that Mr Bird might be out of a job. There are also suggestions that he might be running in the Whitsunday Shire Council elections against the incumbent shire chairman. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The incumbent shire chairman and his council have done a lot for the Whitsunday area. It is a very progressive council&mdash;a council that obviously feels that it has the best area in the world and wants to make sure that it continues to progress and develop as it has in the past. I would simply call upon Mrs Bird to cease her campaign of denigration of this area, to get behind the Whitsunday Shire Council, to support the area which she is supposed to be representing, and simply to let that area continue to develop as one of Australia's greatest holiday destinations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on a matter of considerable importance and, I must say, some urgency. It is an issue, unfortunately, which is regarded as arcane and technical, so it has not had the widespread attention that it deserves. I refer to the question of differential shares and, more specifically, the question of super shares currently being considered by the Australian Stock Exchange.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The matter has arisen following submissions to the Australian Stock Exchange by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp seeking a waiver to existing listing rules to allow changes in News Ltd's shareholding structure. In essence, the proposal seeks, firstly, the introduction of a new class of shares in News Corp, giving each shareholder super voting rights. Instead of a share in News Ltd having the value of one vote, super shares would have the same initial face value in money terms but entitle the holder to 25 votes instead of one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Super shares would be issued as a bonus to all current shareholders in News Corp in proportion to their current holding. They would receive one super share for every 10 shares they held at date of issue. Since there are currently on issue approximately 1.8 billion shares in News Corp, the issue of the new shares would increase that by approximately 10 per cent to just under two billion. The voting shares structure would be altered, of course. Instead of 1.8 billion votes, there would be 6.3 billion votes because the super shares would be worth 25 votes each. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the proposal, every time a super share is sold it would revert to being an ordinary share and lose its inflated voting value, but not its dollar value&mdash;the so-called poison pill proposal&mdash;although I noticed that Rupert Murdoch in yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> was offering a concession on that to cut out that part of the proposal. Under the proposal also super shares would not be listed, so they would not be available for regular trading&mdash;that is in the initial proposal&mdash;although I understand that a concession is also possible there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is little doubt that the proposal would entrench the Murdoch family's interests as majority voting shareholders. In effect, what they would be doing would be making a public company into a private one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Stock Exchange response is to produce a discussion paper. It is a good, objective discussion paper fairly balanced in its view, but it has given three weeks for people to respond to it from its delivery date last Wednesday and it will be considering the matter in the middle of December. I regard that time as an absurdly short period of time to be discussing such an important and wide-ranging issue with so many implications which are so difficult to anticipate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have become involved in the debates surrounding the issue in my capacity as Chairman of the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities. I made the simple statement, which I stand by, that the response time, as I have said, is far too short for sensible debate around a very complex issue; that that response time in itself would indicate to any observer that undue&mdash;some would say obscene&mdash;haste is being used in such an important matter; and that it would send a signal that the Australian Stock Exchange has already made up its mind, regardless of the merits of the argument, and that it has cavilled under pressure from a powerful member. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My public request for the Australian Stock Exchange to extend the time for consideration of the matter was rejected in a tirade of abuse from the stock exchange through its chairman, Laurie Cox. I, and others, have become used to this from the Australian Stock Exchange. It has a lot to learn about productive relations with government and productive relations with the parliament. It has a lot to learn generally about public relations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The matter is a complex one which I do not intend to take a position on here, although the corporations and securities committee will put a submission before the Australian Stock Exchange and we will also be tabling a statement in parliament and writing to the Attorney-General about this matter. Suffice it to say that there is significant unease in the business community about the super share proposals. The Australian Investment Managers Group, for example, which represents 43 of Australia's largest fund managers, with investments of over $45 billion&mdash;so it is not to be sneezed at&mdash;is totally opposed to it and will be writing a submission. It has made its views very publicly known. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Securities Institute of Australia has made its opposition known and investment groups from overseas have also made their opposition known. For example, there was a visitor just last week to Australia from the American organisation CALPERS&mdash;the Californian Public Employees Retirement System&mdash;who are very big investors. They have an investment portfolio of $80 billion, $13 billion of which is in overseas investment and $250 million of which is in Australian investment. They have come out very strongly opposed to the proposition that has been put by Murdoch and that is being currently canvassed by the ASX. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Concerns range from the simple but usually unequivocal support for the principle of one share one vote&mdash;which is something that must be taken very seriously; there has to be a very serious reason for wanting to change that position&mdash;to the belief that the proposal may breach the Corporations Law. Certainly, in that regard it would circumvent at least the principles of the takeovers code, if it does nothing else. A particular concern which I share is that such a decision, particularly if taken in such haste, would undermine the integrity of the Australian Stock Exchange and undermine its capacity to be seen around the world as an upstanding exchange market which is fair, open, stable and well thought of. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also considerable concern at what is seen by many as the undue influence applied by the proponents of the super share proposal and some clear conflicts of interest in what is by international standards a very small securities market&mdash;I am talking about the Australian market now. There is concern, for example, that Rupert Murdoch, through Newscorp and his other interests&mdash;interests which represent a substantial percentage of the Australian Stock Exchange's market capitalisation&mdash;can apply undue influence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is concern that in the small Australian capital market a decision in favour of the change in voting shares would open the way to the entrenchment of major shareholders and powerful interests in many listed Australian corporations. This is not a desirable situation. It is situation which can have a profound negative effect on the standing of the Australian Stock Exchange. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Add to this the shameless and supine way the finance writers of the Murdoch press have tugged their collective forelocks and done the bidding of their masters. Add to that the fact that Mark Burrows, the Chairman of the Corporations and Securities Advisory Committee&mdash;the Australian Securities Commission's business advisory committee&mdash;is spearheading the Murdoch proposal. Add all these things together and one has to wonder whether any objectivity can be applied by the normal regulating agencies&mdash;the Australian Stock Exchange and the Australian Securities Commission. It begs the question of whether the government should not be involved as the only body which could apply reasonably detached judgment to the issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, government may well be involved. Under section 774 of the Corporations Law, the Attorney-General has the power to disallow changes to the listing rules of the Australian Stock Exchange. The government, however, has no powers if a waiver from the listing rules is applied. This would be, of course, the worst of all decisions. If the proposal has merit in principle&mdash;I do not think that has been substantiated yet&mdash;this should be reflected in changes to the listing rules. The Australian Stock Exchange, which was established to raise standards and to maintain an open and fair market, will damage its well deserved high reputation by regulating by exemption. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the argument that, if the Australian Stock Exchange fails to accommodate Murdoch, some other exchange will, is flawed for two reasons. Firstly, the logical conclusion of this argument is that standards would be set by the most loosely run exchange. I am sure Murdoch could easily move to Shanghai or somewhere like that. I do not think we should be bothered by that. I think we should set our standards and maintain them. Secondly, the trend overseas is running against such arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While some exchanges have dabbled in various forms of differential share arrangements, there is a clear movement back towards the equitable enfranchisement of shareholders. That is true in the United Kingdom, it is true of continental Europe, and it is true of the New York stock exchange, which had a pretty messy experience in the 1980s&mdash;it was described by some as a race to the bottom&mdash;that led to the involvement of the US Securities and Exchange Commission and the Congress, a process that I predict will occur in Australia as a result of this proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, I am critical of the way the Australian Stock Exchange has handled the issue, both in terms of the time frame it has allowed for it and in terms of the way it has attempted to move through it. It has all the hallmarks of a predetermined decision. While the issues are complex, there is widespread unease and some concern that it will be difficult for the Australian Stock Exchange to make a decision in a detached and objective way. I believe that the government should be involved and that we should look at ways in future in which such fundamental decisions are made. I do not think it is good enough to allow such fundamental decisions to be made by a body which is so easily influenced by power groups. I indicate that the Corporations and Securities Committee will be making submissions to the Australian Stock Exchange, firstly, and to the Attorney-General, secondly, and that I will table a statement in parliament in due course. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise a concern about the unacceptable delays that have been indicated by the Victorian government in its deliberations regarding the relocation of the Coode Island chemical storage facility. In this morning's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>, under the heading `State did not act on Coode report, says Pescott', it is reported:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister for Industry Services, Mr Pescott, admitted yesterday that the State Government had not acted on a recommendation from the Safer Chemical Storage Taskforce that it proceed with moving the Coode Island chemical storage.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Pescott said a submission prepared by the taskforce for Cabinet&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is the state cabinet&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">in August had not been taken to Cabinet because he had been trying to clear up uncertainty over the taskforce's authority to make recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA>This is a matter of great concern in Victoria because of the importance of the chemical industry. It is also reported in today's newspaper that members of the Safer Chemical Storage Taskforce are becoming very frustrated about the Victorian government's indecisions and procrastinations, to the point where Alan Seale, a respected industry representative, has resigned from the task force. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> report today indicates:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's failure to act on the taskforce's recommendation is believed to be behind the resignation of the chemical industry's representative on the taskforce, Mr Alan Seale . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It is also important and significant in the revelations that were put before the Victorian parliament yesterday that Mr Pescott had told that parliament that a letter he had sent to the Minister for Defence, Senator Ray, in May asking that Point Wilson be considered a real option to house the proposed armaments complex had been `written on the Premier's instructions', that is, Mr Kennett's instructions. So it appears that there may be other motives and other factors behind the state government's delay in moving the Coode Island facility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of Coode Island has been on the political agenda in Victoria for a number of years. I repeat that the chemical industry is of great importance to Victoria. It employs some 37,000 people. It is a key component in the state's manufacturing industry. It is an industry of enormous political power, particularly within a coalition government. It would appear that its more backward looking sections have increased their power in recent times within the Kennett government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is unfortunate that short-sighted and irresponsible employers seem reluctant to spend money on safety. It is unfortunate that they do not appear to be willing to invest in their own future and that of their employees and their community, which is directly affected by the actions of this giant industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1990, the then Victorian Liberal-National party coalition spokesman on the environment said that in government the coalition would close Coode Island and transfer the complex. Two years ago, a chemical storage tank at the complex ruptured, sending a fireball and toxic cloud over Melbourne's western suburbs. Some 50,000 people live within five kilometres of Coode Island. There are houses 550 metres from the storage facilities at that site. I am very familiar with the area; I have been associated with it for a long time. It is a matter of great significance to the people who live next to that facility and of great significance to the people of Melbourne as a whole. As indicated by the fire two years ago, the people of Melbourne were put at great risk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The state Labor government at that time established a Coode Island review panel, chaired by John Landy. The review panel undertook enormous public consultations. Some 300 submissions were received. The panel looked at all the options and recommended the relocation of Coode Island to Point Wilson, just outside Geelong. In its 265-page report, it recommended a process whereby an interim task force would be established and replaced by a statutory authority in 1992. The cost of relocating Coode Island was estimated at approximately $200 million&mdash;$100 million in public funds and $100 million in private funds from the chemical industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The state Labor government pledged to move the chemical complex by the year 1996. Based on the Landy report, two years were assigned for planning and two years were assigned for the relocation of the tanks. At the time the chemical industry also supported the move. Because the lease on Coode Island expires in the year 2000, it made good sense for the chemical industry to take such measures. As that time is now rapidly approaching, it is of major concern to significant sections of that industry. It is important that some certainty be provided to that industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The progressive elements of the chemical industry and the Victorian Labor government at that time were committed to the world's best practice in the chemical industry. They were very keen to pursue the relocation plans and to protect the $195 million worth of chemical imports Australia receives each year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The conservation movement has also strongly supported the relocation of Coode Island. At the time of the last Victorian election, the public and, in particular, the voters of the western suburbs of Melbourne also believed that the Liberal Party supported the relocation of Coode Island. Unfortunately, events since the October election have made people seriously doubt that commitment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In May, the Victorian Minister for Industry Services wrote to the defence minister, Senator Robert Ray. As I indicated, he supported the proposal that the Commonwealth ammunition complex be built at Point Wilson. In today's newspaper he has indicated that he did that on behalf of the Premier of Victoria, Mr Jeff Kennett. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Kennett indicated in parliament yesterday that he did not ask Mr Pescott to undertake that action. That is the sort of contradiction one gets used to in the Victorian parliament these days. It is important that I indicate that Alan Stockdale has also suggested that the actions of Mr Pescott were unauthorised in the way he approached the Commonwealth government seeking support for the ammunition complex to be placed at Point Wilson. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Three months ago the Victorian government, in what can be described only as a stalling tactic, employed Alan Oxley to conduct a review of the Safer Chemical Storage Taskforce secretariat. Mr Pescott now claims that the task force recommendations were made without authority. I understand that the Victorian government is sitting on that review and has not released it to the public, not even to the task force chairman. Mr Pescott claims that the delay in presenting the cabinet submission is a result of what he describes as jurisdictional problems. It seems to me that there are serious doubts about the minister's motive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Safer Chemical Storage Taskforce prepared a detailed cabinet submission three months ago. It is believed that this submission recommends proceeding with the new facility, and puts the cost to the government of Victoria at some $50 million. That is half the original estimate of the government contribution to the relocation of the storage facility. Clearly, this is a significant retreat for the Victorian government, but not significant enough for the current Victorian minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that this submission has not been proceeded with because the Victorian government is stalling on fulfilling its earlier commitment to the Victorian people to relocate the Coode Island facility. The relocation of Coode Island will not only eliminate the enormous risk the facility poses to the people in Melbourne's western suburbs but also be a boost to the Victorian economy. The complex will be built, owned and operated by the industry and will create many much needed jobs for Victorian workers. The chemical industry has a major responsibility to the people of the western suburbs of Melbourne. It has a responsibility to all the people of Melbourne. The 1991 Coode Island fires highlight just how much that responsibility means to the people of Melbourne. Recently, $17 million has been spent on upgrading fire facilities at Coode Island, and this is to be commended. But it is not in itself an excuse to maintain the facilities at their current location. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Kennett government must stop equivocating and act on the task force recommendations. It must release the Oxley review and make a clear public commitment to the relocation time frame and to provide the $50 million public contribution that is needed to secure that relocation. The Kennett government prides itself on what it believes to be its decisive decision making. It has been very quick to sack thousands of public servants. It has been very quick to close down hundreds of state schools. It has rushed through legislation without adequate public consultation and debate. It undermines traditional liberal democratic cultural values. It undermines an independent judiciary. It undermines an independent public service. It sacks judges. It sacks statutory appointees. Yet on an important issue such as this it is unable to come to a clear decision. This delay is sending quite considerable conflicting signals to the community. I  think the people of Melbourne are entitled to ask why. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Kennett, the message from Canberra is very clear. Senator Ray, the defence minister, has put it very bluntly. He is a man who has no trouble getting his message across. Yet it would appear that that message has been lost on the Victorian government. He made it clear on radio in Melbourne in September that he is waiting for an announcement from the Victorian government, and that message is very simple: if the government of Victoria is prepared to move Coode Island, it should announce it publicly. Once that is done, the question of Point Wilson will not be an issue in the relocation of the arms dump. Why has that offer not been taken up? Why is there a delay? I think the people of Melbourne are entitled to ask those questions and they are entitled to receive an answer. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be very brief. I rise to support the comments of Senator Beahan, the Chairman of the Corporations and Securities Committee, of which I am a member. In supporting Senator Beahan in regard to super shares, I should point out that the behaviour of the Australian Stock Exchange in this affair has been odd. It really has been disgraceful. It may be that Mr Murdoch is trying the stock exchange on. That is probably what it is; it is true to form&mdash;and true to Mr Murdoch's good form. Maybe we should say good luck to him, but I think not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the Australian Stock Exchange that is the focus here in relation to Mr Murdoch's request for super shares. Like Senator Beahan, I greatly admire the financial journalists of the Murdoch press, such as Mr Terry McCrann; I follow them closely day by day. However, on this issue Mr McCrann's writings have leaped over principles. On many occasions his logic is twisted when he writes about the super shares. I would have thought we had left behind the 1980s. Apparently we have not even mopped up the 1980s and all the rogues of the 1980s in the public eye. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would seem that nothing has been learnt by the Australian Stock Exchange from the lessons of the 1980s, and that is proven by its unseemly haste to open and shut this case on super shares and not to allow greater discussion on the subject. Mr Cox has attacked and criticised Senator Beahan as chairman merely for raising the matter. To that end, the Attorney-General, Mr Lavarch, ultimately has the power&mdash;more power than our committee; we can go only so far&mdash;to disallow any decision by the Australian Stock Exchange on this matter. The ball is very much in Mr Lavarch's court. I call upon him to step in, following our committee's submission to the Australian Stock Exchange. It would seem that no sooner are we into the 1990s than the Australian Stock Exchange is letting Gordon Gecko back into the boardroom. That will be very much the effect of the introduction of these super shares. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Chairman of the Australian Stock Exchange should look at the loss of credibility he has now brought upon himself through the way he has handled this matter and his criticism of the parliamentary committee merely for seeking more details. Quite frankly, I think the Chairman of the Australian Stock Exchange has lost a great deal of credibility and respect in regard to this matter. He should understand that we have a role to play in questioning such regulations in the Australian Stock Exchange, particularly in view of what the public has asked us to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> After the shambles of the 1980s, does the Chairman of the Stock Exchange really think we will turn a blind eye to this? He did and, quite frankly, I think his position has become untenable. Either Mr Cox should be severely disciplined by the Attorney-General or he should step down from his position as Chairman of the Australian Stock Exchange. We are not going to turn our backs on the matter of the super shares. I fully endorse what Senator Beahan said, and he has the support of his committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 7 October, Senator Panizza and I spoke in the Senate on a matter which was reported in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard </EMPHASIS>and headed `Alleged Physical and Sexual Abuse in Catholic Institutions'. That should have read `Admitted Physical and Sexual Abuse in Catholic Institutions', because it has been publicly admitted by the Christian Brothers organisation in Western Australia that both physical and sexual abuse has occurred in four child-care institutions in my home state of Western Australia. It was publicised earlier this year, together with an apology for that abuse happening.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been a number of developments since both Senator Panizza and I spoke on the matter. On Tuesday of this week the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Perth, Barry Hickey, was reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper as refusing to support a call for a judicial inquiry into allegations of abuse of children in Christian Brothers institutions. On page 6 of the article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> the archbishop is quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no doubt, in my mind, that the victims of physical and sexual abuse will continue to feel aggrieved if the truth does not come out. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, I do not think a judicial inquiry will necessarily achieve the desired result.</PARA>
<PARA>I am disappointed with that reaction. I understand the reaction but I am very disappointed with it. A judicial inquiry, to my mind, is the only way we will get to the bottom of this very nasty situation, and many people continue to suffer because of it. Further developments have occurred. I have today received a letter from the Western Australian Attorney-General, Mrs Cheryl Edwardes MLA. I will read the letter in total:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator McKiernan</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CHRISTIAN BROTHERS INSTITUTIONS</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you for your letter dated 17 September 1993 regarding the above matter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have noted the comments you have raised in relation to this very sensitive and difficult situation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You will be aware that steps have been taken recently by the Christian Brothers to establish a helpline and professional counselling service to assist former residents of its child care institutions in Western Australia. The provision also of a panel which will work independently to provide advice to the Christian Brothers is an important step. I understand that this panel will also invite submissions from individuals and groups in order to facilitate an accurate overall assessment of needs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For these reasons and in order to address the needs of former residents of Christian Brothers homes, I believe that the process of conciliation is a positive step in ensuring that the victims are given the opportunity to access appropriate support.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, serious allegations have been made by a number of former residents and some may not wish to make use of this avenue of conciliation. These allegations may be more appropriately referred to the Police for investigation. Further, as there is some action presently before the Courts, it is not appropriate for a judicial enquiry to be considered at this stage.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I trust that I have clarified this issue for you and thank you for advising me of your concerns in this matter. I also thank you for your comments about my action to ban the showing of the film `Salo' in Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yours sincerely</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Cheryl Edwardes</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Attorney-General</PARA>
<PARA>I read from that letter that the Western Australian Attorney-General is not going to establish a judicial inquiry to look into this matter. It is very interesting that she refers in the fifth paragraph of the letter to these words:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These allegations may be more appropriately referred to the Police for investigation.</PARA>
<PARA>Yesterday the Director of Public Prosecutions in Western Australia announced that he will not launch prosecutions on any of the 16 cases of alleged sexual and physical abuse complaints that have been made to him. In today's newspaper there is a photograph of a gentleman called John Lawrence, who indicates that he is going to go on a hunger strike until he gets an inquiry. I can understand Mr Lawrence taking that course of action because it looks, from the information we have got here, that there will be no official government or, indeed, church action on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is the church itself that is suffering most because of its inactivity. I am loath to make calls of a cover-up or to draw inferences about the power and the influence of the Catholic Church in Western Australia. I know that it has enormous influence in the country I was born in. I did not think it had that same degree of influence in Western Australia or, indeed, in Australia, but certainly it looks that way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response to the decision by the Director of Public Prosecutions not to launch prosecutions, Mr Bruce Blyth, a spokesman for the Victims of Institutional Cruelty, Exploitation and Supporters&mdash;the VOICES organisation&mdash;says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has taken great courage for them to go through the trauma of going to a police station and making statements on abuse. But the group hope to turn yesterday's disappointing announcement to its advantage. The government had previously pushed aside a judicial inquiry to establish the truth on the basis that police investigations were under way. Now that Mr McKechnie has dismissed the idea of police prosecutions there should be no impediment to an inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA>This scenario of events puts me in a difficult position. I indicated in my speech on 7 October, which I have referred to before, that I would use my office, as an elected member of parliament for the state of Western Australia, to pursue this matter. I cannot let these people down now. I will have to press on to have some action taken in this parliament because the Western Australian government appears not to want to take any action on it. So I will have to press forward in this parliament, using whatever avenues are available to me to represent the interests of these people who I think are getting a very raw deal from the Director of Public Prosecutions, the police forces, the state government of Western Australia and the Roman Catholic Church, in Western Australia particularly but in Australia generally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not exactly sure at this time what we can do from this parliament. I hope to consult Senator Panizza, for one, and my colleagues on this side of the chamber about what we can do. I do not think this matter can appropriately be investigated by a parliamentary committee. The matters are far too sensitive and it would be wrong to expose the individuals who are victims, many of whom I have met in my electorate office, to a parliamentary inquiry. But, if that is the last avenue open to us, that is what I would be pushing for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I use this speech now to make a final plea to the Western Australian government, to Mrs Edwardes, to have a judicial inquiry. An inquiry is desperately needed. There are many hundreds of individuals, victims in their childhood, that need somewhere to tell their story. What the church has done so far is inadequate. It is not enough. We will have to get to the bottom of this. I certainly am not going to rest on this matter. I would hope that we could do it in a conciliatory way rather than setting up a battle with the Western Australian government or indeed the church. I will do whatever I can to ensure that the victims of the physical and sexual abuse that took place in child-care institutions in my state of Western Australia do have some approach to justice so that justice can be given to them. </PARA>

I am very glad that Senator McKiernan did say that the Western Australia government appears not to be heading towards a judicial inquiry at this stage. Senator McKiernan showed me the letter he received from my good friend Mrs Edwardes in the Western Australia parliament. I spoke briefly on this matter in the parliament on 7 October, as Senator McKiernan mentioned.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Occupational Health and Safety (Maritime Industry) Bill 1993 and the Occupational Health and Safety (Maritime Industry) Consequential Amendments Bill 1993 set out the codification of the common law duty of care and provide a modern regime for the health and safety of persons working on ships and oil rigs. It complements the Seafarers' Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1992 which reformed the workers compensation system for seafarers. All parties must take all reasonable steps to ensure that the workplace, and the work performed there, does not endanger the safety and health of the workers or any other person in the vicinity. There is no doubt that ships and oil rigs should have equipment and facilities that are healthy and safe.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regulation for the maritime industry has previously been through the requirements of the Navigation Act 1912 which gave the industry ample authority to impose the highest safety standards and to maintain the preparedness, training and competency of the crew. Australian employers have always maintained extremely high standards. Indeed, many operators, such as BHP, have been over standard for some time. Until now, there has been no legal obligation for a union or employee to participate. Any provision for health and safety imposes obligations on employees as well as employers, and they should be required to cooperate to ensure the highest possible standard. As part of those obligations industry employers and the unions are developing industry wide training packages suitable for use on board ships. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In reality, of course, there are no artificial divisions or barriers of this nature between those who co-exist on board a ship. It is not as though the employer or master is enclosed in an office or boardroom while employees are on the factory floor or employed in another area. Safety requirements affect equally all those on board a boat. It is pleasing to see that the highest standard of safety in the world, previously maintained by the Australian maritime industry, is maintained and encouraged by this legislation. It puts in place that these standards must be the benchmark, and it gives legislative authority to have the standards maintained to a level below which they should not go. As I said, previously the standards have been in place but there has been no legal obligation to maintain them. Employers have expressed positive opinions about this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were previous concerns expressed on the early drafts of this legislation and I will briefly mention two of these. The training of the work force in matters such as this can often prove to be of great expense to management and operationally disruptive. However, because of the special circumstances of life at sea, this legislation provides that a significant element of the necessary training will be undertaken during off-duty periods at sea. Once again, this is an illustration of the particular nature of this industry in that some training can take place in the work place environment rather than having costly training at other locations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The costs associated with the operations of the inspectorate, under the auspices of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, will be fully recoverable from the industry. The functions of the inspectorate are to ensure that industry parties are complying with the legislation requirements. Inspectors will also conduct spot checks, respond to requests for investigations, conduct investigations into significant accidents and dangerous situations, and take such action as is required to ensure deficiencies are rectified. The costs associated with the implementation of the proposed legislation are not expected to impose an onerous burden on the shipping industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another concern was that an inspector coming on board a vessel would have the power to override the authority of the master of the vessel. However, clause 7 of the bill specifically states that the master or operator of the ship retains control of the vessel unless designated otherwise by him. A contractor does not become an operator. As stated, we assume that the government has, in clause 7, confirmed that the authority of the master or the operator is unchallenged and that it is the intention of government to encompass this very necessary provision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my opening remarks, I mentioned the Seafarers Rehabilitation and Compensation Act of 1992 which reformed the workers compensation system for seafarers. It seems to be government practice to put the cart before the horse, and nowhere is this better exemplified than the order in which these two pieces of legislation have been presented. Prevention, as set out in the bill we are considering today, will always be better than cure as set out in the earlier bill. Yet the government has chosen to ignore this logical progression. It is typical of this mate and union dominated government to have pushed through compensation payments before dealing with the working environment which would have made those payments unnecessary. It would have been, one would think, an entirely proper and much preferred course of action to have put these two bills together in a package. This is clearly demonstrated by the fact that the consequential amendments to the rehabilitation and compensation bill would not have been necessary if the two bills had been placed together. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rehabilitation and compensation bill was passed one year ago. Why has there been the wait? It has taken one year to get this bill, the occupational health and safety bill, up and running. The bill has lain dormant since June 1992. The industry had been extensively consulted up to that point, and nothing further was done. There was no further consultation until July 1993, when the industry was contacted again and informed that the bill was to be lodged for consideration by the legislation committee of cabinet one week later. The sudden imposition of this timetable after the bill had lain dormant for one year is most unsatisfactory and inexplicable, and I note that the industry will be raising this point separately with the responsible minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition regards it as a demonstration of a cavalier attitude toward the industry, where vital issues are left in limbo for no good reason for one year and then rushed through in a state of crisis that is of the government's own making. This cavalier attitude to the industry goes beyond the government's attitude to this bill, as in recent times the industry has not been well served. The maritime industry would have every reason to feel betrayed at this point. The Seamen's Union and employers have been at great pains to cooperate and have worked hard with the government to make sure that workplace reforms have taken place in the maritime industry. Everyone concerned with the industry has over the last while taken some very difficult decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In many ways, the workplace reform achieved in the shipping industry has been the government's only successful micro-economic reform program. The last round of reforms saved $270,000 per vessel per year. It will now be undermined by the unnecessary added cost of the fuel excise hike. Originally, this would have cost the industry $360,000 per vessel per year. However, the post-Harradine amendment cost has reduced this to $216,000 per vessel per year. Even though this is a reduction, it is still a tax on producers and exports, and therefore a tax on jobs. How can the government justify this course of action to seamen who bit the bullet and realised that redundancy was essential for the healthy state of the industry? The industry is now suffering from great disillusionment and realising that many of the hard decisions were in vain. That disillusionment is across the board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry is supportive of this legislation and has been closely involved with its development, since it lends enforceability to measures that employers have instituted but which they had to rely on the goodwill of employees to implement. This has not always been fully forthcoming and the employers have stated that the measures in the bill will give them the ability to require that their employees adhere to standards of health and safety that the employers regard as positive standards and that are fundamental to good and safe operation. Financial penalties can be imposed on employers or employees who breach the legislation. Similarly, manufacturers and suppliers will be liable to prosecution and fines for contravening these rules.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Migration Amendment ("Points" System) Bill 1993 amends the Migration Act 1958 to simplify the operation of the points system and the pooling mechanism for the independent and concessional family categories of Australia's migration program, first of all, by replacing the current three-mark system&mdash;namely, priority, pass and pool entrance marks&mdash;with a two-mark system consisting of a pass mark and a pool mark; and, secondly, by introducing a 12-month limit after which time an application still held in the pool must be rejected. This replaces the current requirement of three gazettals of changed pass marks which could occur over a period well in excess of 12 months.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition supports those measures. We consider that the simplification of the operation of the points system contained in this bill is sensible and fair. We also support the transitional arrangements provided in the bill. It allows for applications currently in the pool to remain there for a further period of up to 12 months. The points system for independent and concessional family migration has operated since 1989. It was introduced as part of the extensive reforms to migration administration, following the excellent report by the FitzGerald committee on Australia's immigration policies. The coalition supported the introduction of this system back in 1989, and we were concerned then to ensure that it continued to operate in a manner as efficient and as fair as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill before the Senate does not change the essence of the operation of the points and pooling systems; rather it refines its administration. The proposals in the bill make sensible improvements to the current system, which has proved to be administratively cumbersome. The priority and the pass marks have, in practice, been set at the same level since May 1990, according to information provided to the coalition by the government. It is therefore reasonable, as the government has proposed, to combine these two into one mark. The bill will enable the government to determine the size of the pool at any one time by enabling it to increase or decrease the pool entrance mark with immediate effect. That will improve the current arrangements, which cause uncertainty and confusion, as well as being as administratively cumbersome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government will now have much greater control over the numbers in the pool at any one time. This contrasts with the existing situation where the pool cannot be reduced by increasing the pool entrance mark because of the requirement that applications remain there for three gazetted pass mark changes. I note in this context that there have been only two changes in the pool entrance mark for both the concessional family and independent categories since the system began in 1989. Since June 1991, the number of principal applicants in both pools has steadily increased. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The measures contained in this bill will give a clear statement to applicants in the pool of the circumstances and time frame in which their applications can be removed, either for further processing or for rejection. Therefore, the coalition has no difficulty in endorsing this bill. Had time permitted, there were various other matters in relation to Australia's immigration program that I would have raised. In view of the time and the circumstances, I will defer those matters until a future date. They go to the heart of the administration of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs and to the whole question of the access to the judicial system for appellants within the system and similar matters. I think all of these matters are extremely important to the future integrity of Australia's immigration program. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can state categorically that John Brumby did not ever misuse VIP aircraft.

Those records are obviously intensely scrutinised by members of the opposition. So, clearly, if Mr Brumby was at fault at any stage, the opposition members here would have picked it up. What Mr Leigh is implying is that they have not done their job.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the recommendations that has attracted some attention&mdash;and obviously that which is referred to in Senator Denman's question&mdash;is the proposal for the establishment of a taxpayers' charter, which even seems to have the endorsement of the dissenting report. It needs to be appreciated that taxpayers already have rights that have been established by the common law. I think the JCPA would support the right to be treated equally under the law, to object to an appeal, to rely on a private ruling, to seek an explanation, to be represented and to have documents remain confidential when they are prepared by a lawyer. Those rights do exist.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most fundamental right&mdash;and the JCPA's proposal endorses that this should be in the charter&mdash;is the right to enjoy privacy in one's tax affairs.

She knew that I would decline and she knew the tax office had to decline, so she asks questions to give herself a chance to trail a red herring across the path, and then say, `Shock, horror', when people fail to provide the answer, when she has asked a question that she knew they were bound by law not to answer.

This does not go to Senator Kernot's question concerning the margins which banks add on. What the government has done and will continue to do with regard to banking margins for customers is to provide competition in the banking system so that people can choose the bank from which they wish to borrow.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of the article written by Mr Gilmour in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> of late October. I also point out that Mr Gilmour is a member of the Small Business Council of Australia. In that article to which Senator Chris Evans refers, Mr Gilmour uses the description that small business is experiencing a boom. Those are his words; it is not a government description. He then goes on to give anecdotal evidence of his own small business as to why he believes the boom, as he calls it, is happening in small business in Australia, and I think it is very instructive.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, Mr Gilmour said that he wanted some printing done but the printer said he was too busy to take the extra work; Mr Gilmour wanted some radio advertising done but he noticed that a couple of free spots for advertisers was no longer on offer. Other people in the small business area have confided to him&mdash;and this is in the article&mdash;that business trade at the moment is very good. I inform Senator Ian Macdonald that when Mr Gilmour asked a cabinet-maker&mdash;another small business person&mdash;to quote for a job, he was told that it would take at least three months. He asked: what is going on? Despite all the doom and the pessimism which most members of the opposition are only too happy to talk about all the time to talk the Australian economy down, Mr Gilmour asked why the boom was starting to occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First of all, Mr Gilmour believes the official statistics are always one or two quarters behind what the real experience is. After discussions with his colleagues in small business, Mr Gilmour said the reason for this boom&mdash;and `boom' is the word he used, not what the government has used&mdash;is that costs are down sharply, wage costs are being contained, financing costs are collapsing as interest rates on borrowed funds are running at a third of the level of three years ago, occupancy costs are down and space is available for expansion, rentals are half those of 1989 and even tax is being reduced. The reduction in the corporate tax rate from 39 per cent to 33 per cent in the current year is almost the equivalent of a boom for many enterprises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So Mr Gilmour has identified a number of areas where small business is really starting to kick along. I think it ought to be taken as a matter of great interest by all members of the Senate. As we have said before, we recognise that small business will be leading this economy into new growth and creating new jobs and, for the rest of the decade, that is where the action will be in the economy. Unfortunately, most members opposite do not wish to recognise that. Whenever we talk about small business we get catcalls and hisses from the other side. I want to draw the attention of the members opposite to the article by Mr Gilmour in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> and, in particular, to his final conclusion in that article when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When the taxation data for the year to June 1994 emerge . . . they will prove what many small businesses know already . . . there's a boom.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is absolutely no basis for the concerns expressed by Mr Bradford. This government supports traditional families and all Australian families, but it does not&mdash;like some on the other side&mdash;seek to label or judge them. The government has developed a great record in the area of programs and policies aimed at meeting the needs of Australian families. Indeed, its efforts over the last 10 years in government have made it a world leader in provision of services for families.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 8 November, Mr Bradford was interviewed on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Life Matters</EMPHASIS> on Radio National about the formation of the Lyons Forum, described by Margaret Throsby as `a reasonably little-known ginger group in the coalition'. But when the honourable member for McPherson was asked to name the members of the Lyons Forum&mdash;named after Dame Enid Lyons&mdash;he declined. All he would say was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Around forty coalition senators and members and all of us are more or less committed to taking up the cause of the traditional family. . . Well I'd prefer not to (name the members). Not that it's a secret society. . . we want to turn back a bit.</PARA>
<PARA>That sentiment is in complete contrast to what the government is doing. We do not aim to turn back; we aim to move forward. On this issue, the government is joined by many Australians and many vital institutions and organisations. I note that today the Australian Catholic Bishops Conference, as part of its contribution to the International Year of the Family, released a landmark statement on families in Australia. In the forward to the statement, Archbishop Clancy from Sydney says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While reaffirming the primacy of the traditional two-parent family, the bishops acknowledge the development of other kinds of families and include them in this expression of their pastoral care and concern.</PARA>
<PARA>I believe that statement from the Catholic bishops is visionary and strong. I believe it also promotes tolerance and understanding for the diversity of families while recognising a central role for traditional families.

When Mr Bradford was asked what he thought about his party and whether he thought his party was doing the right thing by families, he had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No, I think in the past we have been influenced because many members, I guess, are exposed to contemporary thinking about families, which really tends to be anti the traditional and nuclear family, and there's a lot of pressure on, I suppose, for us to appear to be relevant for the purpose of getting elected.</PARA>
<PARA>What Mr Bradford was trying to express is that the pressure of being relevant to Australian families is a bit too much to ask of the coalition.

Therefore, the most serious matter that I dealt with in my report relates to the fact that the commissioner has failed to produce these estimates and that since the mid-1980s the financial accounts of the Australian Taxation Office have been qualified by the Auditor-General.

The issue is: what is the nature of the society that we will go to if capital gains tax is abolished again? We would have two different sorts of income: income earned by ordinary Australian workers, about whom Senator Boswell was so concerned, which is taxed on every dollar; and income which is otherwise earned, predominantly by those more affluent in our society, which is not taxed. That is not the basis of an equitable tax system. It also opens enormous loopholes for tax avoidance, as it was pre-1983 when the principal mechanism for tax avoidance was transferring income into capital. We have here an advocacy of going back to the bad old days. It would open the tax system to abuse.</PARA></TALK.START>

This builds upon this consistent pattern of allegation of preferred treatment which all her colleagues have repudiated. They said, `You have sought to make allegations that people got preferred treatment without any evidence at all that anybody has got preferred treatment'. The implication is that there are some people in the tax office who are acting improperly. There is a slur.

What we have here is the continuing attempt to do two things: to reduce the equity of the tax system and take it back to the bad old days; and to use the privilege of the parliament and the knowledge that there are secrecy provisions in the tax act to slur the reputation of individuals under the cover of privilege, while failing to give any evidence at any stage to support those unreasonable allegations. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I concur with many of the recommendations of the majority report but found the need to supplement those recommendations where they did not completely maximise the sovereignty of the taxpayer.</PARA>

<PARA>and so on. There is not one person in this house, in this chamber or throughout Australia who would object to that remark. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Bishop made some points which are slightly different from those recommended by the committee&mdash;again, this is Senator Bishop's point of view. I might say that those changes are fairly marginal. One point relates to public rulings. The committee decided&mdash;and I thought about this at great length before I decided to agree&mdash;that public rulings should just be tabled in the parliament rather than be subject to disallowance. But Senator Bishop decided that, because they are a form of delegated legislation, they should be subject to disallowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My reason for not going that route may be of interest. I thought that as there is already a form of appeal, perhaps at this stage public rulings should just be simply tabled; that if this does not work, let us look at disallowance. These remarks were made by the chairman of the committee at a press conference yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other major aspect of Senator Bishop's report is her preference for a board of taxation rather than a commission. I frankly did not see a large difference in the approach taken, but Senator Bishop did&mdash;and there is nothing wrong with that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Bishop highlighted the point that the current Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was given preferential treatment by the tax office when he was Treasurer. This was not part of the report; it was never considered by the committee because it was properly considered to be outside its terms of reference. But that does not stop Senator Bishop in her minority report from reminding the people of Australia that the man who is currently Prime Minister received preferential treatment from the tax office. I will just comment on that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Keating forgot to lodge his tax returns in 1985 and 1986. He received a very friendly letter reminding him that he had not lodged his tax returns. The letter stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I appreciate how busy you have been but I ask that you now give urgent attention to the filing of your returns . . .</PARA>
<PARA>The answer provided at an estimates committee hearing was that the ATO, the tax office, had obtained 10,794 convictions for non-lodgment of returns in the 1990-91 financial year. And yet the man who is now Prime Minister of this country got a cuddly, warm letter from the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation. Senator Bishop highlighted this simply to indicate that here we have a man, who is now Prime Minister, who went down the line written about by George Orwell.

<PARA>My question today to Senator Bolkus as Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Crean, related to statements made by Minister Brereton to the NFF conference this week with regard to problems in the meat industry in Australia, particularly in Victoria. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the export potential of meat is nowhere near being fulfilled.</PARA>
<PARA>He then went on to comment about outdated methods of production, low utilisation of rates for productive capacity and limited investment in market research and development. At least two of those components relate directly to the farm component, particularly the financing of the investment in market research and development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I rise to speak on this matter because in 1990, with the encouragement of the then Minister for Industrial Relations, Senator Cook, the AIRC commissioned an inquiry into the meat industry and the problems which existed then, which was known as the Harrison inquiry. It brought down its report just two years ago. The recommendations that came out of the inquiry were sabotaged even before they were brought out. It was sabotaged by none other than Mr Wally Curran, of the AMIEU in Victoria, when he made a categorical statement that he would not take any notice of the recommendations. That is exactly as it has turned out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since that time, we have seen the efforts to implement those recommendations totally frustrated. In my view they were good recommendations, albeit paid for by taxpayers. They included, as I said in my question, an overseas junket to collect information&mdash;a trip that was not necessary because all the information had already been obtained in this country from previous inquiries. The Industry Commission has now been commissioned to look into the meat industry, and we have exactly the same person frustrating that course of action. I will quote from the Industry Commission transcript dated 12 August 1993 of Dr Mauldon questioning Mr Curran. In answer to a question with regard to the Harrison report, Mr Curran said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Just a non-event.</PARA>
<PARA>Dr Mauldon questioned Mr Curran further on this matter, to which Mr Curran responded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, I will tell you now it's a non-event.</PARA>
<PARA>In reading the transcript, we find a deliberate attempt to totally sabotage this inquiry. Much of the comment in this transcript is quite derogatory. In another answer we once again see the contempt that is held for the rationale of getting serious about the problems which exist in the industry. Certainly, it has been acknowledged on both sides of this chamber, particularly by Senator Cook and me, that there are serious problems in the meat industry in this country. We saw another example of disgraceful contempt when Dr Mauldon said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I don't know who they are.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Curran responded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The rural community&mdash;cockatoos.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Later, Mr Gruen said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We might want to quote you.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Curran responded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yes, you can. When you see them out in the paddocks, you say, "Well, there's a group of the farmers, the galahs or the cockies, picking over the seed."</PARA>
<PARA>While this sort of attitude remains on one side of the equation, in terms of reform in the meat industry, it will never be reformed. I do not care what argument we hear from the other side of this chamber on this matter; until the government stops wasting money on these reports, picks up the recommendations of a series of reports into the meat industry that we have already seen, promotes the implementation of these recommendations, which have been sound and well based, and gets on with the serious job of doing something about it, we will continue to see this industry being treated with absolute contempt and being held to ransom by one individual&mdash;Mr Wally Curran of the AMIEU.

It has, of course, been stated here today that the problems of the meat industry can be put down to one person and that the problems that face the rural industries in Australia can be put down to one person. From what I know of Wally Curran, I am sure that he would regard it as quite flattering to assume that he has such extraordinary power and influence over the affairs of this country.

Wally Curran has a dedication and commitment to servicing his members and he has a dedication and commitment to ensuring that workers in rural communities, often isolated and often working in the most foul conditions, are allowed to have some sort of voice in our society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Wally Curran has a commitment to ensuring that there is decency in the way in which people are treated in rural communities. He has a commitment to understanding how and why our society operates in the way it does and the way in which some employers operate, particularly members of the National Farmers Federation, and particularly in Victoria where a war has been launched against meatworkers in that industry. I have not seen him do anything to warrant the sorts of accusations we have heard here today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have also noted that Wally Curran has ensured, through the various enterprise agreements that have been undertaken in Victoria, substantial improvements in the conditions of workers and the operations and effectiveness of the meat industry in Victoria. We have seen exports improve dramatically. However, we have seen a small group of people around the National Farmers Federation in Victoria, such as at Seymour Meats and various other places, such as around the Colac district, with the connivance of police authorities and various other instrumentalities of the state, undertake quite serious breaches of the law. Very serious matters have been raised in terms of fit and proper persons operating within the meat industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be appropriate, I would suggest, that if we are going to look in a balanced and fair way at the way in which things are operating within rural communities, for the National Farmers Federation to look at the sorts of people it has been supporting and look at the reasons why it has been such an abysmal failure in the various campaigns it has launched in Victoria. I draw this to the attention of the Senate because the matters that have been raised relate to Victoria. Yet, according to the honourable senator opposite, Wally Curran has such control over the national government that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) has to consult with him on every move.

The Democrats advised me that they were not able to support me as they have an informal arrangement that restricts their ability to move more than one urgency motion per fortnight and if they had supported my motion, they would not have been able to move a motion next week, if they so wanted. I regret that that actually brings about a situation where my motion about democracy illustrates a problem with democracy in this chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The standing orders relating to matter of urgency debates  require one plus four senators to raise a matter of urgency. This discriminates against the ability of independents and small parties to bring matters of urgency before the chamber. I would like it noted that this state of affairs is discriminatory and violates the principle of democracy in itself. I proposed this matter of urgency today to highlight the actions of the Tasmanian Liberal government to change the number of members of both houses of the Tasmanian parliament with only a week's notice of its intention and with no consultation with the electors of Tasmania. </PARA>

If she wants to deliver a substantive speech, other aspects of the standing orders are available to her. I also understand that she may have taken this course to save time rather than to cost time.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government will not be supporting Senator Chamarette's motion. When the proposition was put to consider this matter of urgency, let alone Senator Chamarette complaining about the overall barrier, there was not one single senator here to support the proposition. We are all realistic politicians and we realise that the timing of events in this chamber sometimes is unpredictable and that one can get ambushed. No-one thought it proper at the time to call a quorum to enable Senator Chamarette to get here. That situation should be noted for the record.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's position on this has always been that we will support our own urgency motions and matters of public importance and no-one else's. It is a consistent attitude we have taken, whether it be with the Democrats, the Nationals, the Liberals, the Greens or Senator Harradine. We support our own matters of public importance and no-one else's. What has traditionally occurred in this chamber is that the rest, if you like, the non-government people, get together if necessary to overcome the various hurdles to get a matter of public importance or an urgency motion up. The government does not interfere with those arrangements and we do not vote for anyone else's matter of public importance or urgency motion to come on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Chamarette today has complained about the effect of standing orders. It is not that this chamber has been insensitive to that. Some years ago, there was a problem for at least two senators in as much as each motion that was put before this chamber needed to be seconded. Through the standing orders committee, we removed that provision. If Senator Chamarette believes the provision for one senator plus four is wrong, she should take the matter up with the Procedure Committee, or ask the Deputy President here today whether he would be willing to refer it to the Procedure Committee, and then it may be looked at. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The original reason for having that provision in the standing orders was so that there would at least be some indication that a matter was of enough importance to be raised. I do not think it was there to persecute minority parties in the Senate, even though it may have that effect. There were and are today other opportunities for Senator Chamarette to have addressed and to address this issue. The matters of public interest discussion was on between a quarter to one and 2 o'clock today. Admittedly, there were quite a few speakers and, if we had our druthers, we would have preferred to get legislation through. Nevertheless, an opportunity was there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dare I say it&mdash;and I can say it with full confidence&mdash;there is ample opportunity in the adjournment debate tonight, in which I am not the duty minister, for Senator Chamarette to express long and fulsome views on this matter, having been frustrated here today. I am not going to comment on the urgency side of it&mdash;whether it is urgent that we discuss this matter or otherwise, and whether any discussion will have an effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand the points that I think Senator Chamarette would have made in her substantive speech. I refer her to an article I wrote in one of the fabian documents some years ago, which would give her a plethora of material on which to base an excellent speech. Basically, I concur entirely with the principle of Senator Chamarette's proposed motion; it is just a matter of the procedures of this place. If we had stood today to support Senator Chamarette's matter of urgency, we would be expected to do so on all occasions. At least we are consistent. As a government we say that we will support our own urgency motions and no-one else's. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We on this side of the chamber have been very responsible in terms of matters of public importance and urgency motions. We would be lucky if we moved one in a three-year period because we cede this particular ground to other members of the chamber as part of the balance in this chamber of who gets allocated time to pursue which issues. On those bases, the government is not minded to support Senator Chamarette's contingent notice of motion to bring on the urgency motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I understand it, Senator Chamarette is seeking to suspend standing orders in order to be able to move her urgency motion. That is correct, if nobody tells me it is not. It is in an unusual circumstance. I think we have been pretty generous to the government's program recently in relation to matters of public importance and urgency motions. We have called on very few, largely to facilitate the progress and processing of the legislative program. Generally speaking, the spirit of this place is that if somebody thinks a matter is of such urgency that it should be debated, the chamber facilitates that request.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I understand it, the problem on this occasion is that four senators did not rise in their places. This meant that the standing order could not be complied with. There is an alternative procedure that could have been adopted. Had Senator Chamarette given notice of this matter of urgency, it could have been dealt with in the time allowed for general business today. As I understand it, there was time allowed for general business today but we made the decision not to take up that time. So there is actually time within today's program for a short debate on this particular issue, even though the opposition neither agrees with Senator Chamarette nor thinks that the debate is urgent at the moment. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The attitude of the Democrats in not cooperating with the Western Australian Greens is very interesting. I suspect that it might have something to do with the fact that Senator Devereux, currently in the Labor Party, is confidently rumoured to be about to join the Western Australian Greens and work in Tasmania. This is something which the Democrats in Tasmania greatly fear because there will two parties of the ultra Left fighting for the environmental or other very left-wing votes in Tasmania. The Democrats fear that Senator Devereux might represent Tasmania as a Green and take away some of the very minimal backing that the Democrats have in that state. I suggest that that is the reason the Democrats have refused to support their far left-wing allies in this chamber, the Western Australian Greens, and give them the necessary numbers to enable this motion to be discussed without this rigmarole. </PARA>

In particular, I want to refer to the direction of higher education in this country, as revealed by this report and as revealed by a number of other committees that have met in recent times. The shape of what is emerging for higher education under this government was summed up this morning in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>  which said that what used to be Dawkinisation has now become the Beazleyisation of the university system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to distinguish between those two things. The Dawkinisation of universities was the jamming together of the CAE sector and the university sector, creating enormous trauma in the system in a period of growth. I alluded to this extensively whilst speaking about a DEET report yesterday. What has come out in this annual report and what has come out in the newspapers in the discussion of the Beazleyisation of universities is the grand plan under the new Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley). Basically, that will stunt the growth of the university sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here we have a party in control of a country at the moment which put out a document at the end of the Hawke era saying that it wanted to create a clever country, and it is creating a clever country by moving resources away from the university to the TAFE system. There is nothing wrong with the development and expansion of the TAFE system in this country; that is to be encouraged. This government neglected TAFE for over 10 years, suddenly discovered it again, and by the creation of ANTA and other means, it is putting resources into TAFE. That is great; that is to be commended. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But because its policies have been inappropriate in higher education for so long in terms of generating enough sources, the government has put a cap, as the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> called it this morning, on the university sector to slow down and stunt the growth of universities. It has dressed this up by saying, `Well, we're doing great things for new areas'.

It was not about redistributing money in the system to the growth areas, which is commendable and is what should happen. I was talking about the slowdown in the total growth of the whole university sector, which can be seen by the fact that the number of new places that will be created from 1996 on, specifically in 1996, is only 1,500 across 36 universities. That comes to a very small number of students per university. What we have seen is a tragedy for young children in this country who aspire to a university education.

<PARA>The report of the National Legal Aid Advisory Committee raises a number of extremely important issues. It deals with the Dietrich case, amongst other matters, which decided that a person charged with a criminal offence may be the beneficiary of a court deciding that that person requires legal representation and, therefore, legal aid, despite the fact that that person may have exhausted the normal avenues that are open to him or her to obtain legal aid through the legal aid commissions. It is difficult to disagree with that judgment. It would be a principle of natural justice for a person accused of a crime before an Australian court to be able to be legally represented by a professional person. I think that would be acknowledged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, it should be stated&mdash;I think the report acknowledges this&mdash;that this has resulted in a considerable drain on the funds available for other cases. There must be some concern about the pressure on funds, for instance, for family law matters where the threat of domestic violence and custody matters are concerned. Mr Acting Deputy President, you, more than anyone else in this chamber, would be aware of the traumatic experiences that people go through when they are involved in that sort of conflict. It would seem to me that this advisory committee might be able to give some attention to the priority rating that family law cases have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to raise one of the issues that I bring up on a regular basis. I note with some regret that, apparently, the committee has not addressed this matter, either during its proceedings during the year or in its report. I again make the point that the interest that solicitors derive from trust funds should not be allowed in part to flow to their guarantee fund, which in turn reimburses members of the public who have been damaged by the defalcations of fraudulent solicitors. It seems to me that the legal profession, if it professes to be self-regulating, should look after its own black sheep and not utilise the interest from trust funds. These are funds which do not belong to the legal profession; they are funds placed in trust. They should therefore be used for public purposes, including exclusively and totally for legal aid, and should not flow in part to make good the defalcations of fraudulent solicitors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to address one final point. I searched in vain&mdash;I may have overlooked this because I have not had much time to look through this report&mdash;but it does not appear as though the National Legal Aid Advisory Committee has recommended to the government to increase the allocation to legal aid funds. Legal aid funds in this current budget were increased very marginally, not at the rate of inflation. In other words, in real terms there has been a reduction of money available to legal aid commissions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that it would have been one of the functions of the National Legal Aid Advisory Committee to address that matter when up to 50 per cent of applications for legal aid are rejected for lack of funds. Could I suggest that the National Legal Aid Advisory Committee start doing its job and advise the government on the level of legal aid funding that is necessary in a civilised society. </PARA>

<PARA>I acknowledge the response of the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) to the United States concerning its decision to offer up to 100,000 tonnes of heavily subsidised barley for sale to China. However, I must stress that Australia should not lessen its pressure on the United States in regard to this matter. The Australian government must, at every opportunity, remind the United States of our close cooperation and friendship. We are that country's firm friend and ally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is vitally important to all Australia's grain growers that this continued attack on a market which has been traditionally ours is not allowed to continue. The United States cannot credibly use its usual excuse that it was using the export enhancement program to respond to subsidised grain exports from the European Community, because in China this was clearly not the case. The EC has not operated in the Chinese malting barley market for two years. Even then, it sold only a small volume to fill a shortfall in supply from Australia. Up to 40 per cent of Australian malting barley is exported to China, which is a vital and important trading country to us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The United States President, Bill Clinton, assured the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) that the effect of the export enhancement program on Australia would be limited and would not undermine Australia's interests. This is clearly not the case. The future role of export subsidies depends heavily on whether the next GATT round is signed on 15 December. If it is signed&mdash;and I am optimistic that it will be&mdash;export subsidies will be wound back over time. This will mean that there will be some light at the end of the tunnel for Australian farmers who are some of the most efficient and least subsidised producers of food in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Europeans are being dragged to the GATT table only because they understand that the game is up. Agricultural subsidies just cannot be maintained forever, because the cost of keeping the subsidy house of cards standing becomes unbearable to taxpayers. The French remain a main stumbling block for GATT. The French government has little proper political balance as far as its farmers are concerned. I simply say to the French government&mdash;not only in regard to Australians, to whom the French show great personal friendship, but also to the whole of the farming world&mdash;that France should be better world farming citizens for everybody's sake. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's export markets are forever being squeezed between the United States and the Economic Community. We must continue to support the GATT rounds. We must protest in the strongest possible terms to the United States government and highlight the corruption of world trade through subsidisation. Australian farmers will be in the forefront of the export recovery necessary to get out of our unemployment hole. Their prosperity is Australia's prosperity. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This response from the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) arose from a formal motion that I moved on 21 October in this place after the United States had signed a 100,000 tonne barley deal with China under the export enhancement program. The United States may claim that China is a traditional market for the sale of its barley. But this has never been the case. Australia is the traditional supplier of barley to China.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year, grain growers from the eastern States had a disastrous season, although grain growers in the west had a good season. Because Australia was not able to supply all the barley that China needed, the United States, probably at the invitation of the Australian Barley Board, supplied the balance. It was hoped that this arrangement would operate for only one year. On the pretence that barley could be coming into China from the Common Market&mdash;it is always a pretence when the Americans go into our traditional markets&mdash;the United States has done a deal involving up to 100,000 tonnes of barley at a highly subsidised figure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This development is doubly disastrous for Australian barley growers, and Australian coarse grain growers in general. There has been a swing away from wool growing because of low prices. Generally speaking, higher rainfall areas that traditionally grow wool have swung into coarse grain growing&mdash;that is, barley and oats. As I say, Australian coarse grain growers are facing an extra hazard as a result of the action of the United States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I certainly hope that the government keeps up the pressure. To date, all it has done is write to the US embassy in Canberra and pass on the resolution to our embassy in Washington. I suppose that is all the action that the government could have taken to date, but let us hope that it does not forget to follow it up if a response is not made available soon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I, like the rest of the Senate, value the friendship of the United States.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>I would like to take a few minutes of the Senate's time this afternoon to pass some comment on the Auditor-General's report No. 11 of 1993-94: <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Efficiency Audit&mdash;Department of Defence ANZAC Ship Project Monitoring and Contracting</EMPHASIS>. This is a report of more than 50 pages, which I have not had time to more than skim. But there are a few general observations that can be made that are pertinent to this report at this time. The findings of the report, in summary, are:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The arrangements put in place by the Department of Defence for the purposes of monitoring progress of the ANZAC Ship Project are satisfactory. Nevertheless, the ANAO considers that the ANZAC Ship Contract should have included better provisions to reduce risk and costs to the Commonwealth in the event of non-compliance with the contract or a worst-case scenario of contractor default. . .</PARA>
<PARA>Then it goes on to develop those themes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would say at the outset that anything I say that is critical of the shipbuilding arrangements should not be taken in any way at all as being critical of the quality of the product we have got out of AMECON or Transfield, as it is now called, in relation to the frigate program. I have not had the opportunity to see those ships yet but I do believe, from the advice I have received, that it really is a world class product we are getting there, just the same as we are getting out of the Australian Submarine Corporation in South Australia. I have the greatest of admiration for the men and women in the design, management and construction side of both those facilities. Nothing I say reflects on what they have done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I have some very serious concerns about both these programs, and they really relate to getting value for money. I think the Commonwealth was remiss in both of those contracts in not demanding the tightest terms possible to reduce costs to the nation and to the taxpayer. It is not true to say, as I am sure the minister will, that it is all very well to say that with the benefit of hindsight. By the standards of the times, both contracts were extremely lax. We cannot blame the commercial contractor for that; he is involved in a commercial operation and, if his client is prepared to pay many times more than should be paid for the product, good luck to the contractor&mdash;although, sadly, it is the taxpayer that pays. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In plain language, what the Auditor-General is saying here is much the same as he said about the submarine contract in the report he presented at the end of last year: that it really was quite a loose contract that the Commonwealth signed with the manufacturers with respect to getting value for money. In that sense, there certainly was a failure to protect the national interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The particular point of both Auditor-General's reports&mdash;although they do vary considerably in detail&mdash;is that there is an exposure by the Commonwealth to any risks that might emerge later on in the performance of the contractor. I have no doubt that there is absolute integrity and security in the ASC and in AMECON-Transfield in that they are not going to default on us. But it is not so much a matter of a major default; it is the problem of the integration of the weapons systems into both platforms that is a very difficult process where very high cost overruns can occur. While that is not spelt out in much detail, it is certainly hinted at in reading between the lines of the report I have read so far. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to come back to this point of getting value for money, which is something that is not raised in either report. We really have got involved in two hugely expensive programs here. In 1986, the Joint Committee on Public Accounts of this parliament recommended that Defence adopt incentive pricing programs for major contracts of this nature. I do not know when incentive pricing came in. From my own personal experience with major defence manufacturers in the United States, I found that it was routine and established practice by the early 1980s. So I presume that it was at least invoked in the United States and was operating in the 1970s. In 1986 the Public Accounts Committee recommended that the Australian government follow that with Defence contracts&mdash;and it was not done in this case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difference between this contract and the submarine contract is that the submarine contract included large parts which only had provisional costing figures, PCs, against them and which later on were refined and added in. So at the time that contract was signed we did not know precisely what the liability of the Commonwealth was. In this one, it is allegedly a fixed price contract, but that in itself is misleading in so far as the provisions are there for escalations in respect of currency, inflation rates, presumably changes in labour rates and payments of that nature. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mention that because the movement in defence manufacturers and suppliers in both the aerospace and marine industries has changed dramatically. We signed a contract that was allegedly a fixed price contract for these ships but which included escalation clauses which have allowed nearly $1 billion to be added to the contract price of this contract since it was signed in 1989. By the time it is finished we will be looking at a ship that costs at least $600 million&mdash;a ship that has relatively limited use in a naval sense, in a military sense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, putting that aside, I return to the conditions that Australian aerospace manufacturers, which subcontract to companies like Boeing, have faced for a number of years. Companies in Australia that have been subcontracting to the American aerospace industry were told some years ago, `We know your baseline figures for the 1980s; they are the benchmark we start from. You will have to discount by 20 per cent your 1980s prices and agree to no escalation clauses under any circumstances if you're interested in tendering for us in the 1990s'. We have a number of manufacturers in this country which produce flaps, rudders and fins for big American companies like Boeing. They are the terms; that is the invitation they get: 20 per cent less on their 1980s prices plus no escalation clauses&mdash;`If you're interested, we'll talk and refine details; if not, we're not interested in proceeding'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth has got locked into two very massive contracts in the submarine program and in the frigate program, which commits us to extremely high cost weapons systems. I am not arguing about the quality of them; I think the quality, particularly of that submarine, is excellent. But we have to consider price. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At $1 billion a copy for the submarine, we are buying the most expensive diesel electric boat in the world. When one looks at a group of them, one has to ask oneself: what is the best in Australia's national interest? Is it best to put $1 billion a copy into a number of submarines and, in this case, nearly $600 million for a ship or are there alternative ways of spending that money which would give us more flexibility for Australian's defence needs? Clearly that question was not answered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was not answered because both of these programs were largely driven not by strategic guidance, which the government flaunts all the time, but by the basest of political imperatives&mdash;the need to win elections for the government's friends in the state parliaments of Australia. I well remember, before the submarine contract was signed, Mr Bannon, who was not sure that he was going to win the election, doing his electoral advertising at his desk in his office in Adelaide, smirking into the cameras, with a model of the submarine in front of him on the desk sending the message to every viewer in South Australia&mdash;`Vote for me, you get the submarine and a $5 billion contract'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, as in the case of Mr Bannon, the frigate contract was driven through to save Mr Cain in Victoria. Mr Cain was in a great deal of trouble. So the ever obliging and impetuous Mr Beazley, supported by Dr MacIntosh, who was the chief of materiel procurement&mdash;neither of them were ever fussed with details or making a long-term analysis of what they were doing&mdash;rushed in and signed the contracts. There have been a lot of consequences from that. It is all very well to protect the unemployed and try to give them work in the rust bucket states but, surely, if that is going to be done, part or all of that should come out of the social welfare program, not out of the defence vote. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With both these programs we now have an unbalanced expenditure with respect to capital equipment&mdash;so much money is now going into ships for the navy. The rough figures are, of every $10, $6 goes to navy capital equipment, $3 to the air force and $1 to the army. It not only causes problems today in the air force and the army but it also creates a situation where Australia's defence capability will become very inflexible. It will dictate the nature of the response we can make to situations in our region because of our equipment and the investment in that equipment that we have made, which will be with us for 30 years. We will be able to send ships. We will not be able to use the greatly increased flexibility and adaptability of air. We will not be able to develop air power. We will not be able to develop any land forces because of this imbalance that has been created by the wish to create employment in both Melbourne and Adelaide. These matters should have been foreseen at the time but were not foreseen by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come back to the report itself. It makes detailed comment on the ways that the government should reduce its exposure to the contractor. The ANAO has a number of concerns regarding the contract which it believes involves a lack of protection for the Commonwealth's interests. The ANAO notes, for example, that when queries were made concerning the requirement that the contractor has to maintain a certain level of shareholders' funds it was necessary to get legal advice. The Anzac ship project office within the Department of Defence was unclear as to whether the contract requirements regarding shareholders' funds could be satisfied using the consolidated group financial statements. That gets back to what I was talking about earlier as to whether, in the event of difficulties and cost overruns, the funds are there in the company to overcome those difficulties or whether the company would default on them and leave the taxpayer to pick up and complete the program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I re-emphasise once more that I am not critical at all of the nature of the work being done. I think both constructors have done an excellent job on both projects. But I think the Commonwealth has been grossly out of step with best practice internationally&mdash;best practice that was established at least in the 1970s and in the early 1980s in the United States&mdash;of providing incentive payments to contractors so that both the Commonwealth and the contractor benefits. We are now going to be lumbered with some very expensive equipment and the consequence is that, as well as all the other disabilities I have mentioned, at the end of the day, the defence forces, with diminishing budgets, will not have the capabilities and the modern equipment that they need because there simply are not the funds to go around. </PARA>

<PARA>This report of the joint committee endeavours for the first time in the history of the Australian parliament to define Australia's relations with Indonesia broadly and to explore that relationship in detail. The report reflects a very determined effort by the committee to write a comprehensive document covering the totality of Australian-Indonesian relations. I think the detail of the 14 chapters and recommendations serve to underline that determination on the part of the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report acknowledges the history of the relationship from the postwar period to the present. It acknowledges the fact that, along with relations with Japan and the United States, Australian-Indonesian relations are among our most important bilateral concerns. The report makes very clear and definite recommendations. I will endeavour to deal with some of the major ones later, especially in the fields of education and culture, defence cooperation and political ties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report represents some 20 months work. I  acknowledge at this early time the contribution made by my predecessor, Senator Schacht, and by Dr Andrew Theophanous and Mr Laurie Ferguson from the House of Representatives. Mr Ferguson tabled the report in the House of Representatives earlier today in his capacity as chairman of the foreign affairs subcommittee of the joint committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also appropriate at this early time to place on record on behalf of not only the committee as a whole but also the parliament our appreciation of many people in the secretariat who worked so hard on this report&mdash;Margaret Swieringa, Judy Middlebrook, Denise Picker, Mearl Price, Margaret Brown and Di Singleton. They all worked on the inquiry in its early stages. Our thanks go to those involved in the later stages or for longer periods&mdash;Kate Stark, Elizabeth Robertson and a parliamentary intern, Zoe Chambers. Jane Vincent and Peter Stephens were secretaries, in turn, to the committee. In particular, I place on record the appreciation of the committee&mdash;and I believe of the parliament&mdash;to Patrick Regan, the secretary of the foreign affairs subcommittee. The performance of those people was utterly outstanding and the report could not have been written without their manifest contribution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The joint committee is working its way through a number of inquiries which examine our relations with the countries of our near region. Reports have been tabled previously on the Pacific islands and Papua New Guinea. We have just undertaken to commence a report on Australia's relations with Thailand. The report that is before the Senate this afternoon makes some very firm and unequivocal statements on the universal application of human rights which I believe every Australian would endorse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that there has been some improvement in the human rights climate within Indonesia. There is also no doubt that, in respect of Australia's concerns and international obligations, we will continue to make representations at the highest levels from time to time when we believe it is appropriate to draw the attention of the Indonesian government to human rights issues that ought to be subject to focus. It is fair to say that currently Australia-Indonesia relations are at a high watermark. We would like to maintain that circumstance while being able to talk in a very reasoned but very direct manner with the Indonesian leadership about broad matters of mutual interest, concern and obligation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is useful to note at this time that there are currently very good relations, at a personal level, between the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the President of the Republic and between the foreign ministers of the two countries, and among a great many other Australians and Indonesians. The committee would like to see these kinds of relationships broaden throughout our two societies. We make some recommendations which endeavour to achieve that, particularly in the area of education and cultural linkages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that great changes are occurring within Indonesia in a political and economic sense. There is also no doubt that the significance of the President's Indonesian National Day speech should not be underestimated. There is a substantial Australian media contingent now in Jakarta. That presence has been positive and constructive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a truism to say that the next century will be the century of Asia and the Pacific. I think it is also a truism to say that Australia and Indonesia both have a role to play in that respect, in terms not only of the multilateral agencies but also of the bilateral relationship. The committee trusts that this report is a benchmark by which the relationship between our two countries can be judged, not only in 1993 but also in the years to come, and against which the relationship can be measured in terms of growth and expansion, as well as consolidation and the deepening of the relationship in the decade ahead. I urge all honourable senators to read the committee's recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the report I table this afternoon is significant for two primary reasons: first, because it sets out the unanimous view of the broadest committee of the parliament, a committee that has representation from both Houses, from all the major parties, and from all shades of opinion within the Australian parliament; secondly, because, as I said earlier, the tabling of the report completes the survey of our immediate region that began in 1989 and is now to be extended to cover relations with Thailand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For many Australians, quite justifiably, human rights seems to be the issue they think about first in terms of our relationship with Indonesia. As I will endeavour to make clear, this report is about human rights in Indonesia, but it is not exclusively about human rights. It makes recommendations about ways of improving the relationship with that country. Some of those recommendations apply in the human rights area; others do not&mdash;they apply in terms of politics, economics, education, the legal system and the culture of our two nations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has sought to give its perspective on the issue of human rights in a manner that is consistent with neighbourliness and also with sensitivity. But our position is entirely consistent with our international obligations, with our views and with our values. Because human rights is an issue in the relationship between our two countries it simply cannot be ignored, and the committee was absolutely determined to ensure that this did not happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australians may care to reflect on the proposition that Indonesia is perhaps more important to us than we are to it. This point was made on a number of occasions during the inquiry. At one time, though, the slightly more comforting observation was made that perhaps we are more relevant to Indonesia than we were five years ago. To further improve this position is one of the many challenges in the relationship, and the committee hopes its recommendations will assist in meeting that challenge. Our recommendations cover a range of issues set out in the inquiry's terms of reference. Some of them were discussed by Mr Ferguson earlier today in the House of Representatives. I will seek leave at the end of my remarks to incorporate the speech he made today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a few points I would like to make on certain specific aspects of this inquiry. In previous times, Australians had to rely on images of Indonesia that perhaps were somewhat restricted&mdash;to wartime experiences, to contacts made during the Second World War, in later times to images of East Timor, and in more recent times to Bali. Press reportage of Indonesian affairs did not do a great deal to extend the knowledge or the sympathy between our two countries beyond coverage of natural disasters. However, this appears to have changed, and changed for the better. When the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's Radio Australia was readmitted to Indonesia two years or so ago, it sent one of its most senior and experienced correspondents to Jakarta. That person was replaced by another equally experienced person. The change has been evident. Moreover, the quantity and, above all, the quality of reportage of Indonesian affairs by the Australian media has improved greatly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the past few years that improvement in particular can just about be measured. While perhaps it has not yet reached the standard of routine reporting of affairs in Europe, Japan or North America, coverage of events in Indonesia is now more detailed, more consistent and, I would argue, more thoughtful in terms of its assessment and, therefore, its impact. This development has occurred over a period when not all the news from within Indonesia and about Indonesia was positive. While the Indonesian election of June 1992, for example, was not controversial, the same can never be said of the response to the killings in Dili just over two years ago. Those killings, rightly, caused outrage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should, however, mention that the timing of the tabling of the report has everything to do with the parliamentary timetable. The committee's determination to finish the inquiry this year, in terms of the timing of its delivery this afternoon, is not related to the tragedy in Dili. That there could be reportage of Indonesian affairs of the sort we are now seeing, especially from Australian foreign correspondents located in Jakarta and elsewhere in the country, is an indication that the old picture of an inflexible military-dominated regime, as it often was painted in the past, is now disappearing, if it has not altogether disappeared. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indonesia is changing, and some of the dimensions of the changes that have occurred over recent years were clear to those committee members fortunate enough to visit the country in October 1992. This study tour by 10 members was a notable part of the inquiry process. Those who were fortunate enough to travel to Indonesia visited Jakarta, East Kalimantan, South Sulawesi, Surabaya, West Timor, Ambon and Jayapura. Although time was limited, use of a dedicated RAAF aircraft ensured that the party saw as much of the country as was practical in the time limit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The emphasis during the tour was on looking at Australia's involvement in the eastern provinces of Indonesia and examining Australian activities, such as mining and joint ventures. The value of the study tour to this report cannot be underestimated. While it is a pity that the party was not able to visit East Timor, it did give members the opportunity to see a great amount of the rest of the republic and to speak to ministers, research bodies, provincial governors, officials and business people. The benefits of the study tour can be seen throughout the report. The committee is of the view that the report gained immeasurably as a result of that direct experience. We also believe that to produce a report of this sort without at least some members visiting the country to make specific examinations would have strained the committee's credibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to use this occasion to thank the Indonesian government for the assistance given during that visit. The committee is also very aware of the contribution made to Indonesian-Australian relations by His Excellency Mr Sabam Siagian, the Ambassador of the Republic of Indonesia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This inquiry received over 200 submissions and held 18 public hearings. We took evidence from a number of government organisations and from many individuals with interests in things Indonesian and with specialist knowledge of that country. Many of the submissions were of a very high quality. In particular, the various responses by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade were of a uniformly high standard. Some other Commonwealth departments distinguished themselves by the ordinariness of their contributions&mdash;at least one by the agonising slowness of its response. I believe that 13 months or more is too long to take to provide material promised by senior officers at a public hearing. It is not appropriate to mention names, but the committee is aware of which agencies fall into particular categories. Parliamentary committees have a role to play in scrutiny of Commonwealth activities. They are, therefore, somewhat more than a nuisance for one or two departments to cope with in their normal activities. This simple fact does not seem to have been universally understood, or recognised, or appreciated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before concluding my all too brief remarks on this important report, there is another topic related to administration of committees with which I would like to deal in my capacity as chairman of the joint committee. I paid tribute earlier to the yeoman service given by the men and women of the committee secretariat. I think every honourable senator would be aware that, without the staff of the various secretariats, parliamentary committees simply would not function. Without the skills and dedication of committee staff, committees would not function as well as they do. Staffing does not seem to have very much to do with workload or the pressures generated by particular inquiries. That was certainly true of this inquiry. In many cases it seems that staffing bears little or no relationship to workload. Compared to the resources provided to congressional committees in the United States Congress, our committees are significantly understaffed and under-resourced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, we still demand full programs, well-run hearings and high quality reports finalised within very tight deadlines. It is not unreasonable to make demands on staff, but I wonder whether the demands we make as senators and members of the House of Representatives, unrelated to the resources provided, are not beginning to reach excessive heights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The theme of this report is opportunity and challenge. The two run together because there are so many opportunities to develop what already exists in the Australian-Indonesian relationship, while not allowing difficulties to dominate that relationship. There is considerable goodwill on both sides which can and ought to be harnessed for the benefit and improvement of the relationship as it currently exists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The activities of the Australia-Indonesia Institute, concentrating as it does on people-to-people contact, have done much to benefit the relationship overall. Many witnesses commented favourably about the institute and its work. I add my voice on behalf of the committee to those favourable references. It is, therefore, a matter of some concern that the financial and staffing resources of the institute have been reduced since it was established in 1989. It is not enough that bodies such as the institute exist. For them to be effective and to honour the commitment to relationships with other countries implicit in their existence, resources must be made available. We have, therefore, recommended a reaffirmation of support on the part of the Australian government to the work of the institute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a substantial report about a very significant neighbour. Many people have made a contribution to it, and the committee is grateful for all those individual contributions. When dealing with a subject as complex as another country and our relationship with it, it is not possible to write everything that people would like to write. Nor, in any event, is it appropriate for us, as outsiders, to try to encompass everything about another people&mdash;another nation&mdash;between two covers. Because of the volume of evidence and ultimately some limitation on the size of this document, it will probably not be difficult for those who expressed their views to find what they believe are omissions or perhaps even distortions. This report will not, and cannot, please everyone who reads it, but I do believe that it will stand the test of time, scrutiny and evaluation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the commencement of my remarks I talked about human rights in Indonesia. In closing, I want to return to that subject, the most difficult and sensitive in the relationship. I raise it again, not simply to give it prominence&mdash;for it deserves prominence&mdash;but to address it, to accept that there are different views on this subject in our two countries from time to time. There can be, and there are, warm and fruitful contacts between Australia and Indonesia in a wide range of fields. Provided that the goodwill continues on both sides, as I believe it will, those contacts will improve, broaden and strengthen. Such goodwill seems to be very much in evidence at present and it is up to both countries, to both governments and to our two peoples, to ensure that that goodwill is not in any way dissipated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Australia and Indonesia cannot accommodate differences of opinion from time to time about certain matters for the good of the whole relationship, then that relationship cannot develop in accordance with the hopes and aspirations of our two peoples. This report has sought to recommend ways of broadening and strengthening our relationship. As I said a short while ago, I believe this report will stand not only the test of time, but also the demands of the future for the relationship between Australia and Indonesia.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The document read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report I have just tabled completes the Committee's survey of the countries in Australia's immediate region. This survey entailed the 1989 South Pacific countries report and the 1991 report on Papua New Guinea.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This report into relations with Indonesia results from a reference to the Committee on 20 June 1991. In its activity, the Committee received over 200 submissions, and held 18 public hearings in various capital cities and one in Broome, WA. The report makes 36 recommendations about the relationship with Indonesia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee also received a reference to examine the 1990/91 and 1991/92 annual reports of the Australia-Indonesia Institute.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Before outlining some of the more significant recommendations in our report, I would like to make some more general comments on the relationship this country has with Indonesia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the current relationship is open and positive, it has not always been this way. There are still issues of the greatest sensitivity which must be dealt with on a regular basis. Rather than concentrating on the difficulties of the past, the Committee has sought to emphasise ways to broaden and deepen what currently exists.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While our two nations do have contrasts, these differences should not be over-emphasised.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the differences which is significant is the major role played by the Armed Forces in Indonesia, compared with the role of the Defence Force in Australia. Because of the role the Indonesian Armed Forces played in the struggle against the Dutch after 1945, they have a special place in Indonesian society. A significant number of positions are reserved for military representatives in the Parliament. Many officers work outside what we might consider formal military structures. The military have an important nation-building role, in addition to the one we would recognise.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It seems, at times, that it was easier to concentrate on the differences, rather than on the similarities. Reactions on both sides to the actions of the other have sometimes smacked of xenophobia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has also been easy to ignore or play down the similarities and the things which bring Indonesia and Australia together.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In a regional context, the two nations have outlooks which are surprisingly similar. For example, we both value the concepts of `self reliance' or `national resilience'. Moreover, Australia and Indonesia share fundamental security interests in a strong, politically stable and economically dynamic region, free from the involvement of external powers with  interests inimical to our region.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Indonesia is a central player in ASEAN, consistent with having the largest population and GDP. The ASEAN Secretariat is located in Jakarta. Australia is one of ASEAN's seven Dialogue Partners and meets annually at Ministerial and official level to discuss economic and a range of other issues. In recent years, Australia has aspired to an acceptance of a closer relationship on these fronts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although still cautious about the way APEC might develop, Indonesia has shown a lively interest in a range of matters involving that body. It is an active contributor to several of the APEC work projects and has provided valuable support to Australian activities. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Indonesia and Australia have cooperated in other international matters such as initiatives for a settlement to the Cambodian tragedy, and on the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade negotiations. Indonesia's international role has been augmented by its leadership of the Non-Aligned Movement and its re-election to the United Nations' Commission on Human Rights.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Fortunately, it is not now difficult to provide a range of examples of cooperation and ties between Indonesia and Australia, in both regional and multilateral matters. One of the more surprising features of this inquiry was discovering just how many and deep these ties are. The relationship has grown and developed substantially over the past five years or so. The intensity and diversity of State-provincial connections also impressed the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The welcome the Study Tour, by ten members of the Committee, received throughout Indonesia in October 1992 was clear evidence of Indonesia's interest in Australia. Members were generally impressed by the willingness of Indonesian authorities to enter into dialogue on matters of Committee interest.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As this report makes clear, there are many opportunities for Australia in the relationship with Indonesia: in trade, education and technology particularly. The defence links are very concrete, and significant personal relationships have arisen through exchanges and visits of the Service personnel of each country.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The flow of tourists between the two countries is, perhaps fortunately, now more two-way than it used to be and not only to/from Bali. Thanks in part to the work of the Australia-Indonesia Institute, people-to-people contact has increased. Some high level cultural programs and exchanges are also taking place.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All of these positive developments bode well for the relationship and it is pleasing to document them briefly in this House.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Inevitably, during any discussion of relations with Indonesia, the issue of human rights is raised. This issue engendered the greatest amount of interest in the inquiry. Many witnesses with deep interests in these matters made valuable contributions. The Committee has made a number of recommendations on this subject.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Two major concerns guided our considerations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first was the recognition of the limits of national sovereignty, together with the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of other nations. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second was an earnest desire not to sermonise or be offensive while, at the same time, being fully aware that many Australians are deeply and justifiably distressed about general and specific abuses of human rights in Indonesia. To ignore the strong input of the evidence on human rights in Indonesia would also deny a significant strand in Australian foreign policy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In this report, there are a number of references to an earlier report by this Committee: A Review of Australia's Efforts to Promote and Protect Human Rights. It provided a useful reference point on these issues and a valid framework for our ideas on human rights in Indonesia. That also was a unanimous report. It is reasonable to point out that, in that report, the Committee was critical of some aspects of human rights in Australia; it was tabled in December 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our major recommendation in this matter is that the Australian Government should continue to make representations about the principles and practice of human rights in Indonesia. East Timor, Irian Jaya and Aceh are areas of special concern. We have also recommended the re-opening of the Australian Consulate in Dili. The Committee believes this would be a recognisable and diplomatic statement of Australia's concerns about East Timor and provide the Australian people with worthwhile information of any advances in this matter. It was unfortunate that the Study Tour could not enter East Timor.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The other subject which generated a great amount of evidence was fishing by Indonesian nationals off the north and north west coasts of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many of those who fish illegally have been forced to do so because of economic necessity. Some species have been so over-fished in Indonesian waters that it is understandable that attempts are made to seek stock in southern waters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The 1974 Memorandum of Understanding with Indonesia was negotiated to solve a number of problems. Among other things, it governs the right of traditional Indonesian fishermen to visit and fish in waters on the outer edge of the Continental Shelf.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since then, other situations have arisen and the MOU does not deal with all categories of fishermen who should be considered as `traditional.' Moreover, arrangements for fishermen of both nations in the Arafura Sea are not satisfactory.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have recommended a thorough examination of all aspects of Indonesian fishing in Australian waters:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">to renegotiate the MOU with Indonesia;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">to define `traditional' fishermen more appropriately; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">to arrive at more satisfactory arrangements for fishermen in the Arafura Sea.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While we made a number of suggestions about human rights and fisheries matters, we also made recommendations to encourage Australian business in Indonesia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In this area, we recommended that the Australia-Indonesia Business Council and the Chambers of Commerce and Industry be involved in the distribution of a publication: Austrade's Business Guide to Indonesia. The Committee has also recommended that an Australian consulate be opened in Surabaya in East Java, an area of growing importance to Australian business in Indonesia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was, however, in the scientific/educational field that the Committee made the greatest number of recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Principal among these was a proposal that there be consultation with Indonesian authorities about providing additional resources to schools in the eastern provinces of Indonesia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the inquiry, we took evidence about the importance of the existence of the Australian Studies Centre at the University of Indonesia in providing Indonesians with the knowledge to explain Australia and its ways to other Indonesians.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The eastern provinces of Indonesia are significant recipients of Australian development assistance. In addition, because of the proximity of Darwin to such places as Ambon, there are already other connections between these provinces and Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have therefore recommended that there be a study of the costs and feasibility of establishing an Australian Studies Centre in the eastern provinces. If the outcome of this study is favourable, we believe there should be an approach to an appropriate university in these provinces to assist in the establishment of such a centre.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australia-Indonesia Institute was set up in 1989, among other things, to increase people-to-people contact. Members were concerned to discover that, not only has it to cope with the same allocation of funds as in 1989, but it now also has to pay for the printing of its Annual Report and for administrative expenses incurred in supporting its Board. Of greater concern is a proposal to reduce the Institute's dedicated staff from four to two. The Director's position, which would be downgraded as part of this proposal, has been vacant since February 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee does not regard this as a satisfactory state of affairs for an Institute central to our continuing relationship with a neighbour which the Government itself acknowledges is of crucial importance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although there are now a number of such bodies within the Department of Foreign Affairs, their future effectiveness is by no means certain. To restrict their activities by limiting their funds and staffing makes a mockery of their existence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have recommended that there be a strong re-affirmation of support for the Institute, its staff and programs, and that its funding be increased to offset the additional costs it now has to absorb.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This was a long inquiry on an important neighbour. My colleagues and I hope that it will be received as a thoughtful contribution to the relationship.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We also hope that the Government's response will not be tinged with the patronising overtones which were detectable in the response to the Committee's 1991 report on relations with Papua New Guinea.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, as is customary, I would like to thank all the staff, past and present, of the Secretariat who worked on this inquiry. We owe them a debt for the standard of their work, and for their dedication to the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend this report to the House.</PARA>

I do not pretend that in the time since it was tabled in the House of Representatives I have read it from cover to cover, but I surely will be doing that. I commend the reference given to the committee; that is, a study of Australia's relationship with Indonesia. On first reading&mdash;and I will be returning to the report to get a more detailed understanding of it&mdash;I was very disappointed in the report and that is what has prompted me to rise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think the report really goes deep enough at all. It seems to me to be a rather mechanical report with a rather mechanical understanding of our relations with Indonesia. It does not seem to have scratched the surface of Indonesian society&mdash;the ever-changing sociopolitical and socioeconomic society and, now, the separation of that type of society from the military society that has built up in Indonesia and that Australians see Indonesia as being. Those changes in Indonesian society and the opinions on human rights now coming out of the middle class growing up in Indonesia were not addressed. I believe the 10 members, who rather extravagantly and uniquely flew around Indonesia gathering evidence, have come down the middle yet again. It seems to be the government's policy to come down the middle on human rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite frankly, in the eyes of the Australian community the real issue is East Timor. It is very hard for the Australian public to give this report any credibility if the committee did not even visit East Timor. Does East Timor not warrant more than just the couple of pages given it in the report? Surely the fact that the Indonesian government would not even let this 10-member committee into East Timor warrants comment. I think that is of serious concern. I cannot see that the committee's comments on human rights have any validity or can gain the respect of the Australian people if the committee never even visited East Timor. The questions have to be asked: why did it not visit, and why was it not allowed to? I will address that matter later on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I place on the record that I think, on first reading, there is more ducking in this report than there is substance. It is a lengthy report and I intend to study it in the future, but at first blush it is disappointing. I say again that I think the real issue for the Australian public is human rights in East Timor. The committee did not even visit East Timor. I think it has been soft in its approach to East Timor and to human rights. Quite frankly, that is the policy of the government. The stated policy of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is to take a soft approach on East Timor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government can dress it up any way it likes&mdash;Senator Gareth Evans declares that he has written a book on human rights and Senator Loosley has shrouded his concern for human rights in flowery language&mdash;but the report does not come down in the right place for the Australian people. The Australian public expects to see in any foreign policy a strong, distinct human rights policy and we are not delivering that. It is a fair comment to make that, on first reading, this report ducks the issue of human rights, and particularly East Timor. </PARA>

I wish it had been a little tougher on East Timor, but considering the composition of the committee, it is actually quite a good report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to recommend to the Senate a couple of specific recommendations. Recommendation 4 relating to military training is an important one. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the Department of Defence review the appropriateness of training provided to Indonesian military personnel to ensure that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.training in international standards of human rights behaviour is provided as an integral part of the defence cooperation program; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.training which is provided is directed towards the acquisition of operational military skills and not those which should more appropriately be given to civil police.</PARA>
<PARA>The committee discussed that recommendation at length trying to get the wording right and I think we have got the wording right. It is a very difficult one. It is not just Indonesia that we should be looking at when we are looking at the appropriateness of military training or, indeed, military transfers, but that is another inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recommendation 9, which concerns human rights training, calls for a course on human rights to be introduced and made compulsory for all officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and AIDAB before they take up their postings. That is very important. I understand that AIDAB is just starting to put that course together. Several other people and I have been asked to talk to officers. This is something that we can all look forward to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recommendation 10 calls on AIDAB to include an assessment of progress towards the establishment and protection of human rights, consistent with the universal declaration, in criteria by which it evaluates the feasibility and success of official development assistance projects.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was one of the members of the committee who visited Indonesia last year. We visited some amazingly diverse areas.

But I agree with Senator McGauran that East Timor is, and must be, the aspect of our relationship with Indonesia which affects and influences probably most Australians in what they think of Indonesia and the way that our government is dealing with Indonesia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find it very difficult to come to terms with the fact that we did not get to East Timor. We tried very hard and we pushed very hard to get there. We made that request everywhere we went, but it was not agreed to. In the end, we got as close as West Timor, which I found to be a very poor area and a distressing area to be in. I am sure that East Timor would have been an absolutely fascinating area. It would have been in the best interests of the Indonesian authorities to allow us to go there. There was nothing we could have, or would have, done there that could have upset them. We just wanted to see it, and we were not allowed to. That speaks volumes in itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank the officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade who were with us and who helped us on this trip. Mr Phillip Flood, who was our ambassador in Jakarta at the time, was very helpful.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator McGauran said that we extravagantly flew around Indonesia. If he had ever flown in a Hawker Siddeley 748 VIP aircraft, I do not think he would use the term `extravagant' when talking about flying around Indonesia. I also put on the record my appreciation of the thoroughly professional, very helpful and always pleasant manner in which the members of the aircrew conducted themselves throughout that tour. I still have the names of the aircrew who helped us. The captain Squadron Leader Richard Smejlis, the co-pilot Shawn Matthews, the sub-pilot James Tilbrook, the steward Paul Fleet, and the ground crew Ron Erskine and Colin Thompson were constantly good humoured, efficient and thoroughly organised. They coped extremely well with the needs and whims of a motley group of 10 federal parliamentarians, which probably amounts to a nightmare for any officer of the Department of Defence or the Department of the Foreign Affairs and Trade. They were always immensely helpful and pleasant. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to commend to the Senate this report of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade on Australia's relations with Indonesia. I do so with considerable nostalgia and gratitude. The foreign affairs, defence and trade committee, from which I have recently retired&mdash;I have handed over my position to my colleague, Senator Margetts&mdash;has easily been the highlight of my experience of parliament during the last 18 months.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, I was unable to be present for the final drafting of this report. But I certainly was involved in all the inquiry stages and almost up to the final draft stage. So I understand what Senator Bourne was saying about the necessity of reading every word of the report. I wish to express my appreciation to the chairman and members of the subcommittee which conducted the inquiry leading to the writing of this report, and especially to the subcommittee secretary, Mr Patrick Regan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to comment briefly on four aspects raised in the report. Section 11.6 relates to nuclear power. The decision by Indonesia to construct 12 nuclear power stations is of great concern to Australians, yet the government is about to sign a nuclear cooperation agreement which will, in effect, aid the development of these reactors. In its report, the committee recommended that the Australian government take every opportunity to impress upon the Indonesian government the serious consequences of a nuclear accident for us and the region. Unfortunately, it stopped short by concluding that it is not appropriate for people to express their desire to live in a nuclear free world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The nuclear energy option for Indonesia is not an issue that concerns only the decision makers in Indonesia. The immense problems of radioactive pollution and nuclear proliferation affect people all around the region and, indeed, the globe. The islands of Indonesia are on fault lines and there are earthquake threats. Any accident would have inevitable consequences for the northern parts of Australia, if not the whole of Australia. I witnessed concern about this issue from the community in Darwin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, it is not enough to condemn the use of nuclear power. It is important to pull together and construct the means by which nations can employ alternative technologies and renewable energy sources. I sincerely express the hope that the Australian government and the Indonesian-Australian high level group on energy and minerals will take up the recommendation made in the report to that effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Assistance in Indonesia's nuclear power program is not appropriate for Australia in this age of ecological awareness. Australian expertise in renewable energy technologies must form our exports to Indonesia. We are guilty of having a double standard in advising against and yet being willing to enter into science and technology arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 7.8 deals with East Timor. Senator McGauran spoke strongly of his disappointment on this section on East Timor. I must say that I agree with him. As a member of the committee who raised the matter during the questioning of witnesses, I can only say that there was extreme concern among the members of the committee. The concerns that were raised and answered are not reflected in the report to the degree that I think was warranted. As Senator Bourne pointed out, there was not a consensus in the committee. I believe that what has been written falls short of what could well have been said. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation in East Timor, the invasion, the Dili massacre and the abuse of human rights that continues today are of major concern to me, many of my fellow senators here and many people in the Australian community. The committee has been rightly aware of this and has recommended, in recommendation 7, that the government press for the opening of a consulate in Dili. Australia cannot turn its back on the abuses of human rights in the region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recommendation 8 calls for the reopening of the Darwin-Dili link. I believe that there is a need for the greater involvement of Australia in the situation in East Timor. I particularly commend to the Senate the East Timor peace plan, which members of the East Timor support groups have been pressing. This requires support from this government. Phase 1, which is of one to two years duration, calls for an immediate end to all armed activities in East Timor; the removal from East Timor of all heavy weapons, long-range artillery pieces and armed transport equipment; the removal of restrictions on the use and teaching of Portuguese and Tetum languages; and the setting up of an independent human rights commission in Dili. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I regret that these kinds of peace plan recommendations are not in this report. I believe that, if supported, the three-phase peace plan would have been a worthy recommendation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would respond to Senator McGauran by saying that I support the members of the committee who were not on the study tour but who very strongly agree with his concerns and who feel that their concerns, as expressed to the committee, have not been reflected in the final report. I concur with Senator McGauran's criticisms, but as a member of the committee I have to wear the criticisms. We were not able to prevail upon the entire committee to share our views. I believe it is very valuable to express those views here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been distressing to suspect that the military training provided to Indonesian personnel by the Australian government has enabled them to commit acts of violence against civilians. So it is encouraging that the committee at least recommended that the Department of Defence review the military training provided to Indonesian military personnel. We must ensure that Australian military assistance is not used in the abuse of human rights or suppression of political beliefs. This can be partly achieved through training and international standards of human rights behaviour, as recommendation 9 suggests. Training that is directly focused on operational military skills will help to emphasise the appropriate distinction between police and military forces. I think that Australia has to look very strongly at its own conscience in the kind of provision of military training that it is offering to Indonesia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final matter I wish to raise is fishing, which is mentioned in section 8.1 of the report. There was a recommendation to standardise the treatment of Indonesians fishing in Australian waters through a conference of the Western Australian, Queensland and Northern Territory attorneys-general. That recommendation is a step forward. An important extension of that recommendation would be to involve the state ministers for Aboriginal affairs, as it is often the indigenous peoples of Australia who are affected by Indonesian fishing practices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was remarkable testimony given at the inquiry regarding the Bardi people and their visit to the Roti area to have discussions with the fishermen from there. I believe those discussions were very constructive. The testimony of some of the expert witnesses was extremely valuable and informative and brought to light the complexity of the relationship and the need to be positive. I believe that Australian legislators and jurists must take into account that using methods of western deterrence such as confiscation of fishing boats is not having an impact upon hundreds of years of traditional Indonesian fishing practices and is possibly in danger of exacerbating the problem. In conclusion, I commend this report to my colleagues as a very timely and worthwhile document which lays an important foundation to the ongoing relationship of Australia with Indonesia. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows&mdash;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee's sixth report of 1993 relates to a proposal sponsored by Australian Estate Management (AEM) for the partial refurbishment of the Hobart Commonwealth Centre stage 1. AEM proposes to refurbish and upgrade the five upper floors of the office accommodation, the ground floor lobby area and associated building infrastructure. Some asbestos present in the fourteenth floor plant room will also be removed. The net lettable area of office space to be refurbished is four thousand six hundred square meters. The limit of cost estimate for the project when referred to the Committee was $8.3m at September 1993 prices.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AEM is a budget funded operation of the Department of Arts and Administrative Services and has overall responsibility to Government for the management and development of the Commonwealth's office estate. In 1989 the Commonwealth's office estate was commercialised and departments were charged for the first time for the use of accommodation. In 1991, as part of the public sector reform process, the government decided to allow all departments to negotiate office leasing arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This effectively means that AEM is now in direct competition with the private sector in providing office accommodation to departments. The only exception to this is in the ACT where departments are still tied to the Commonwealth for the approval of changes in office accommodation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Hobart site was acquired by the Commonwealth in 1969 and the stage 1 building was completed and occupied in 1974. The stage 1 building provides over fifteen thousand square meters of office accommodation or about 25% of the total Commonwealth requirements in Hobart.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The stage 2 building was completed in May 1992, and comprises some nine thousand square meters of office accommodation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In August 1991 the government approved the development of cost estimates and detailed design for the refurbishment of the stage 1 building. Later investigations however, established that a refurbishment of the entire building was not at that time viable due to insufficient tenant interest for the space available. In December 1992 a reduced scope of refurbishment work was agreed by government subject to tenant commitment to occupancy of the refurbished space. The commitment was subsequently obtained and approval to proceed to reference to the Committee was given on 14 April 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Until November 1992 the stage 1 building was fully tenanted. At this time, the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) relocated to an adjacent building leased from the private sector under a pre-commitment lease arrangement. The ATO relocation left some seven thousand square meters of space in the building vacant. Although AEM sought to retain ATO as a tenant it was unable to guarantee funds for the refurbishment of the building in a time frame which suited ATO's operational requirements.  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The stage 1 building is ideally located close to major retail, business and service outlets. It is also close to public transport and public parking facilities and is readily accessible to both the public and building tenants.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The present condition of the stage 1 building and the standard of accommodation it offers is, however, below the requirements of expectations of tenant departments and also well below that provided in the market generally. It is therefore unattractive to potential tenants and is not competitive in its unrefurbished state. The building does not comply with current building standards and the condition of the decor and finishes has deteriorated with protracted use. In addition, the building services are nearing the end of their economic life and do not meet the operational or energy efficiency needs of modern office accommodation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth owns some twenty seven thousand square meters of office space in Hobart and also leases a further thirty-three thousand square meters from the private sector. The Committee was concerned to note that stage 1 of the Commonwealth Centre contains some 9 floors containing eight thousand square meters of office space that it is not proposed to refurbish until tenants have been identified. However, at the public hearing AEM advised the Committee that it believes there is a potential market among Commonwealth tenants currently in privately leased building of some ten thousand square meters over the next 3-5 years. In addition AEM believes that it is possible that there will be some growth by the tenants that have committed themselves to the five floors to be refurbished over this proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recognises that the new government policy regarding the renting of Commonwealth accommodation does make departments more aware of the real cost of accommodation. However, it is concerned that policy may not be in the best overall interests of the Commonwealth if it leads to Commonwealth facilities remaining vacant while government departments lease private accommodation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee does not believe that it makes good sense for such a high proportion of the space in an asset such as the Hobart Commonwealth Centre, which is located in a prime position, to remain vacant while departments are renting private accommodation in adjacent buildings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President&mdash;the Committee while agreeing that there is a need to refurbish the four thousand six hundred square meters of stage 1 of the Commonwealth Centre as proposed in this reference has also concluded that there is a need to refurbish as part of this project the remaining floors of stage 1 in order to attract additional tenants.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has also recommended that the Minister for Arts and Administrative Services should undertake a review of the current policy regarding the provision of office accommodation for Commonwealth departments to ensure that the operation of the policy is in the best overall interests of the Commonwealth and encourages the maximum utilisation of existing Commonwealth office accommodation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second report which I have tabled deals with the proposed construction air traffic control centres in Brisbane and Melbourne required for the Australian Advanced Air Traffic System, otherwise known as TAAATS.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This project has had a long and somewhat tortuous passage.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I remind the Senate that the proposed works were originally referred to the Committee early last year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We had numerous public and private hearings in Brisbane, Canberra and Perth amidst considerable controversy concerning the awarding of the TAAATS contract to Thomson Radar Australia Corporation Pty Limited.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This controversy spilled over into the Committee's inquiry, although the Chairman made it plain at the outset that the Committee did not wish to involve itself in issues relating to equipment contracts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A large number of witnesses expressed unease about the processes which had resulted in the CAA awarding the contract to Thomson.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result, and the unwillingness or inability of key Civil Aviation Authority witnesses to answer key questions, the Chairman made a statement in the House of Representatives on 3 June which called on the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support to set up an independent panel to carry out a thorough review.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To Senator Cook's enduring credit, he appointed the Honourable Ian Macphee to undertake the review.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The rest is now history. Mr Macphee's report was scathing of senior officials of the CAA and recommended that the tender selection process should be restarted with both Hughes and Thomson being involved in specification development before submitting competitive bids.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposal was re-referred to the Committee in July. We had public and private hearings in Brisbane in October, and there was a profound change in attitude towards the Committee by the key players at the hearings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Chief Executive Officer of the CAA, Doug Roser, led the CAA's team of witnesses and answered all our questions in a frank and open manner. There was no equivocation. We were given detailed briefings on the building designs by both tenderers.  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee also had the benefit of advice from an independent auditor who was appointed to report to the CAA Board on the relevance, integrity, probity and fairness of the evaluation of tenders.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee's report itself recommends that the works should proceed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For too long Australia's Air Traffic Control system has been a patchwork of hybrid systems some of which are ancient, some of which are relatively modern, whose installation was subject to the vagaries of the budget processes every year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The TAAATS project is a bold initiative. It will provide integration of all en route air traffic control in two centres&mdash;one in Brisbane and the other in Melbourne. Both centres require to be in modern buildings incorporating sophisticated building services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Brisbane and Melbourne are suitable locations, being at the termination points of existing communications infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The private briefings which were given to the Committee by the tenderers demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Committee that the dimensions and functional layout of the centres proposed by them are adequate and provide for future expansion if necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee intends to maintain a watching brief on the project as it progresses and we have recommended as a first step that the CAA brief us on the detailed design of each centre following the awarding of the TAAATS contract in December.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Terminal Control Units, which will be responsible for controlling air traffic in the vicinity of major airports such as Sydney, Perth, Cairns and Adelaide, will also be provided as part of the project.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has concluded that the extent of the work required to accommodate these Units is justified and makes good use of existing buildings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In conclusion, the report makes the observation that the project has had a long and tortuous development. The Committee's report which I have just tabled, and the awarding of the TAAATS contract in December, will mark the end of a painful process, from which a lot has been learned, and the beginning of a new chapter in Australian aviation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The third report which I have tabled today refers to the proposed upgrading of broadcasting facilities on Mount Wellington in Hobart.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The existing Commonwealth owned transmission tower has been significantly modified during its life and carries additional services for which it was not originally intended. The tower is not capable of further major extension and is nearing the end of its useful life due to structural fatigue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposal by the National Transmission Agency (NTA) involves the construction of a tower consisting of a 70m tapered concrete shaft supporting a 60m steel frame upon which is mounted several transmission antennas and a protective fibreglass radar. The work also includes alterations and upgrading of the existing transmitter building, demolition of the existing broadcasting tower and site rehabilitation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The estimated cost of the work is $13.095 million at September 1993 prices.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A new tower is required in order to achieve government policy for the expansion of broadcasting services, to improve the quality of services already provided to the Hobart public by increasing their reliability through overcoming technical difficulties in the existing tower, to improve the safety of the public and maintenance workers at the site, and to reduce maintenance costs. Construction of the new tower will also provide an opportunity to reduce the environmental impact of transmission facilities on Mount Wellington.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The national services transmitted from the existing tower are subject to interruption for periods some ten times longer than equivalent services in other metropolitan areas of Australia. This is a result of faults caused by the poor condition of the tower and the NTA's ability to gain access to the structure in adverse weather conditions to rectify the faults. In order to bring further broadcasting services to Southern Tasmania and to</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">pre-empt the possible structural failure of the existing tower the proposal to erect a new structure at the existing site on Mount Wellington was developed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed tower must accommodate services currently transmitted from the existing tower and in addition it needs to provide capacity for the proposed new television licensee, Southern Cross TV and for additional FM radio services. The NTA has also allowed capacity for all foreseeable broadcasting and radio communication needs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consideration was also given to providing capacity for the existing Hobart commercial television licensee, Tasmanian Television to be accommodated on the tower on the existing VHF channel 6. This would have required a tower 151m in height compared to the NTA proposal to the Committee of 130m in height and an additional cost of approximately $2m. However, Tasmanian Television has not agreed to move from its existing facility on Mount Wellington and was not prepared to give any commitment to using the VHF capacity if such additional capacity was to be included in the new tower.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the inquiry it became clear to the Committee that a desirable objective is a consolidation of all broadcasting facilities on Mount Wellington into one tower. At issue is the ability to remove an existing transmission facility located on Mount Wellington owned and operated by Tasmanian Television. The NTA advised the Committee that the management of Tasmanian Television has consistently and repeatedly stated that they have no plans to share the proposed NTA facility. While provision was not made on the tower proposal referred to the Committee for Tasmanian Television's present VHF channel, provision was made to accommodate it on a UHF channel. However, at the public hearing NTA advised the Committee that it was now able to offer Tasmania Television VHF capacity without the need for the additional 21m of tower column. This would entail the installation of an antenna system on the NTA facility which would enable capacity for Tasmanian Television's channel 6 to be provided in the NTA proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In agreeing that the NTA proposal should proceed the Committee has also recommended that the Commonwealth should consult with the management of Tasmania Television regarding the possible use of a VHF facility by Tasmanian Television in the upgraded broadcasting facility.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has also concluded that there is no environmentally or socially acceptable alternatives to the continued use of Mount Wellington as a broadcasting transmission site. The Committee has further concluded that the proposed integration of the NTA's proposal with the proposed aerial tramway service to the summit of Mount Wellington is not practical and would lead to unacceptable delays in the provision of upgraded broadcasting facilities on Mount Wellington.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">I wish to say a few words on this matter and to respond in the strongest possible terms to Senator Beahan's comments which I regard as quite monstrously misleading and wrong. I have spoken with Mr Hand about this matter. He rang me after the estimates committee hearing last week and we have had a discussion about the matter. I said to him that, depending on developments over the next few days&mdash;including, as I was aware, the request by him to provide material&mdash;I would be saying something here in the Senate when the appropriate occasion arose, which is now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must say to Senator Beahan that I totally reject the proposition that I made a personal attack on Mr Hand. I also totally reject&mdash;I think the estimates committee <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> speaks for itself&mdash;that I in any way implied illegal or dishonest actions by Mr Hand. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> to which Senator Beahan referred, Senator Bolkus asked me:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Are you asserting that he&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Hand&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">may have performed the function of a migration agent without being registered as one?</PARA>
<PARA>My response was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is what I am trying to seek clarification of.</PARA>
<PARA>I was trying to seek clarification because of the reports in the press and the court transcript which, as I said, I had had checked; although I had not read it myself, I now have. Senator Beahan has quoted parts of that transcript. What Mr Hand said in court on 11 or 12 June&mdash;after he had made application to become a registered migration agent, but weeks before his application was approved&mdash;could have been interpreted as suggesting that he had held himself out to be a registered migration agent. In his correspondence to the estimates committee, he has quite accurately quoted from the court transcript. When he was being questioned about his present occupation, Mr Hand said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have registered as a migration consultant to comply with the law because you are unable to give advice to anybody, as you would be aware, without registering; that is now the law.</PARA>
<PARA>That statement was technically incorrect. He had not registered as a migration consultant at that time; he had made application for registration as a migration agent. Technically, he was incorrect. That was the point on which I was trying to seek clarification. The other point that I raised at the hearing related to the article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> at about the same time&mdash;I think the following day&mdash;which said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Hand, now a migration consultant and primary producer, was giving evidence in an application by three Cambodian women . . .</PARA>
<PARA>It was a case before the courts. I repeat that the report said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Hand, now a migration consultant. . . </PARA>
<PARA>In the letter received today by Estimates Committee F which has now been tabled, Mr Hand stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any implication in that article&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> article&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that I was already practising as a migration agent is incorrect.</PARA>
<PARA>I very much welcome that statement by Mr Hand. That is precisely the statement that I had been looking for when I first raised the matter at the estimates committee hearing in September. It was the point that I discussed with Mr Hand in a fairly vigorous conversation about the matter last Friday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, Mr Hand has today&mdash;and I very much welcome it&mdash;corrected the implication in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> article by saying that it was incorrect.

He said, `I do not read those papers. Why should I?'. That is a fair enough point. However, he did not take the action which he has now taken as a result of my question last week. So I welcome the fact that he has set the record straight through the parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not intend to spend a tremendous amount of time on this subject matter, but I welcome the debate. I particularly welcome Senator Short's closing remark that he intended no malice in his questioning at the Estimates Committee F hearing last Friday. I was at that estimates committee hearing and I got very close to coming out with a more vigorous defence of Mr Hand because I discerned a thread of what appeared to me to be innuendo and inference in the line of questioning that Senator Short was addressing to the minister and to the departmental officers about Mr Hand's current profession as a registered migration agent. I accept his final comments and I am prepared to give him the benefit of the doubt on this occasion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I am going to carefully watch and scrutinise him in the future. I recall some years ago in this chamber Senator Short attacking Mr Lewis Kent, another close friend and parliamentary colleague of mine, under parliamentary privilege. Mr Kent had the benefit of being able to defend himself in parliament. Mr Hand does not have that benefit. I do not think that as members of parliament we should be abusing the privilege that is given to us by virtue of the fact that we sit in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In defending himself, Senator Short referred honourable senators to the Estimates Committee F <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. He said that if one reads it carefully, one cannot say that he was in any way directly attacking Mr Hand. I will refer to two questions that were addressed to the minister and the departmental officers. Page F214 of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> says:</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We might. Did the department note that, in the course of the legal proceedings reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>, Mr Hand had incorrectly given evidence to the court that he was at the time a registered migration agent?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>In the court record, which Senator Short told us he checked, Mr Hand never said anything of the sort. He said that he was a registered migration consultant. That is completely and utterly different from a migration agent for which registration is required. In actual fact, in his letter Mr Hand said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee should note that I stated that "I have registered" not "I am registered".</PARA>
<PARA>That question Senator Short asked led me to believe and support the comments that Senator Beahan made in raising this matter this afternoon. A further question from Senator Short was recorded thus in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My understanding is that in the court proceedings that were reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> Mr Hand had advised the court that he was, at the time, a registered migration agent. If that advice is correct&mdash;as we can all check, but I understand it is&mdash;what action, if any, did the department take in relation to the incorrect statement?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>There was a thread of questioning, as indicated in those two questions, that did not directly attack Mr Hand but from my perspective certainly contained innuendo and inference. Senator Short will remember that on two occasions I made a contribution at the estimates committee. That is something I am very loath to do at estimates committee hearings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opening questions in this line of questioning drew implications as to whether or not Mr Hand had received any form of favoured treatment in his registration as a migration agent. The first two questions Senator Short asked, which were taken on notice, had an innuendo that registration had taken place earlier. Mr Hand's response, which has been incorporated this afternoon, clearly lays down when the application was made and when registration took place. From my quick calculation of the dates&mdash;from 6 May through to 9 July&mdash;it is not within that 64-day limit which is mentioned in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of Estimates Committee F. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased that the matter has come on today, not only because the actions of a friend of mine are being debated but also because it raises the matter of parliamentary privilege and of `coward's castle' as this place is sometimes called. We do, and I say `we' collectively, abuse that privilege which is given to us in this place. I do not think we should do that. I certainly hope that we do not see a repeat of what occurred last Friday when what I believe to be an attack occurred on the integrity, character and honesty of an individual who certainly does not deserve it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In closing, I accept Senator Short's closing remarks that there was no malice intended. I hope that Mr Hand is now satisfied with the comments that have been made and that we will hear very little more about this in the future. I also make a plea that if people are reporting this debate in the papers they report it accurately and not inaccurately like the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> newspaper did in this instance.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will make some short remarks about this matter. Senator Short has come in and acknowledged the misunderstanding that existed.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I rise to speak in this debate because I want to put the remarks in context. Mr Hand was called as a witness in a case by Mr Rose, who, as I understand it, was acting for the applicants or the plaintiffs. When any witness is introduced to a court he or she must give his or her name, address and occupation. If one reads through that part of the court transcript, it puts the whole matter in context. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Hand was called at 2.17 p.m. I am not sure who was hearing this case, but I am sure, being a member of the Federal Court, he was a man of great learning. Mr Rose said, `If Your Honour pleases, I call Mr Hand.' Mr Rose then asked Mr Hand to go to the witness box. Mr Rose had to take Mr Hand through the formal parts of the case before he reached the substance of what Mr Hand was called for. So Mr Rose asked for his name, address and occupation. When asked for his occupation Mr Hand said that he was a `primary producer, consultant'. He did not say that he was a migration consultant. I think he consults on matters other than migration. For example, he has been assisting people interested in Aboriginal affairs. After His Honour made a remark, Mr Rose asked Mr Hand:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The consultant&mdash;is that the migration consultant or. . . ?</PARA>
<PARA>I suppose that did need some explanation. If Mr Hand said `yes' he was wrong and if he said `no' he was wrong because, as Senator Short said, he had applied to be a migration consultant. Nowhere does he say that he has been registered as or is acting as a migration consultant. What he is saying&mdash;and this can be obtained from the transcript of the case&mdash;is that he had put himself down to become a legal migration consultant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then the matter goes on to the issue in hand. After the formal parts that needed to be gone through to get Mr Hand properly introduced to the court, Mr Rose then went on to the question of the Cambodian boat people. So this issue arose as part of the formal proceedings of the court, not the substance of the case. Senator Short no doubt looked at that and said, `Leaving aside the court proceedings, does that mean he has acted as a migration agent?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only other point I would like to make is in defence of the department itself. In pursuing the matter in the estimates committee, Senator Short said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My understanding is that in the court proceedings that were reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> Mr Hand had advised the court that he was, at the time, a registered migration agent. If that advice is correct&mdash;as we can all check, but I understand it is&mdash;what action, if any, did the department take in relation to that incorrect statement?</PARA>
<PARA>It was not for the department to take any action in respect of the incorrect statement; that was a matter to be clarified in court. Senator Short has now explained that, in asking that question&mdash;I hope I have understood him correctly&mdash;he was not suggesting that the department should follow up whether or not it was an incorrect statement in reference to the court proceedings but whether or not Mr Hand had undertaken work for which he was not registered. I use that as an illustration in both cases where we have to be cautious in the meaning we take from the use of words. Whether in court, estimates committees or elsewhere, it is always advisable to try to see what people mean by the words they use. </PARA>

<PARA>This report of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs deals with the operation of the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988. Amongst other things, the act sets up a body called AUSTRAC to monitor certain types of financial transactions. AUSTRAC is held by Mr Bill Coad, an outstanding leader of undoubted integrity. He is ably assisted by Mr Graham Pinner. If the issue before the committee was the quality of AUSTRAC's management, the committee would have no difficulty in reporting most positively on it. However, the committee was asked to inquire into the way the act has worked since it became law and the report is directed to that issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988 is one of a range of measures taken in the last decade to prevent and detect crime.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia contains many bodies investigating people who live within its shores. The traditional police forces of the territories, the states and the Commonwealth are increasingly having their work carried out by other authorities.

I make those opening remarks because I have a few things to say about some of the committee's recommendations. I noticed in some notes prepared for me that attribution is given to the Costigan royal commission as being one of the origins of this act. I am not sure whether that is so or not but I can say that it was the Costigan commission that began following the money trail in a big way. That was very successful. But there is a distinction to be drawn between having a royal commission investigate a particular matter and having the powers of a royal commission institutionalised, as they have been in recent years, in bodies such as the Independent Commission Against Corruption in New South Wales.

It is not that the committee in any way approves of people who commit offences against the Social Security Act but, if a body is set up that is meant to detect major crime, its resources should not be devoted to fossicking out and investigating crime that is minor in comparison to those big crimes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If major fraud is being carried out against the Department of Social Security, then information of that would be picked up by the Federal Police and no doubt investigated by that body. But minor breaches of the law should not be the object of bodies such as AUSTRAC or the National Crime Authority. Indeed, talking about the Federal Police, I think there is an argument yet to be had that it should be doing more work than it presently does in respect of major crime. We have the Australian Securities Commission set up now and the tax office does a lot of investigation. Perhaps it is time to question whether or not that sort of crime should be investigated by the Federal Police. In any event, that was the committee's recommendation about the seeking by the Department of Social Security of a right or permission to use material coming through AUSTRAC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first recommendation that the committee made is that any activities involving the exercise of power by an investigative body or a body that collects material about the residents of this country should be sanctioned by parliament. In the cause of the civil rights of our citizens, whatever is done by bodies such as AUSTRAC should be sanctioned by a law passed by this parliament. If people are going to have their rights and liberties interfered with, it should be done according to the law and on no other basis. I am not suggesting for one minute that Mr Coad has allowed that to happen, but during the committee's hearings there was a suggestion&mdash;on one occasion at least&mdash;that AUSTRAC may have, quite unintentionally, moved beyond the jurisdiction given to it by the statute upon which it depends for its existence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second recommendation was that the threshold for significant cash transaction reports should not be allowed to erode through inflation. In other words, the amount of money that has to be reported as being a significant transaction is presently $10,000. If inflation takes place&mdash;which, of course, it will not under this government&mdash;then that ought to be taken into account and the threshold amount should be increased. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next recommendation is a very sensible one that, if a cash dealer can report significant cash transactions by electronic means, it should do so. Recommendation 5 was that the present law dealing with the opening of accounts by customers with banks or other financial institutions should be changed. It was thought that the procedure that people opening accounts in banks or other financial institutions presently have to go through to prove their identity was too awkward, too cumbersome and not as effective as it might be. The committee has recommended a change in that procedure to allow cash dealers to satisfy themselves by their own tests whether a person is who he or she says he or she is, but that that process ought to be audited by AUSTRAC. Each should be given sufficient money to enable them to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recommendations 7, 8, 9 and 10 deal with civil rights issues. Recommendation 7 recommends that the act be amended so that the tax office no longer has a right of access to the data from AUSTRAC, but that it has to enter into a memorandum of understanding with the director. Recommendation 8 recommends:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that a civil liberties representative be appointed to the Ministerial Advisory Committee on the FTR Act.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 9 recommends:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that the advice of the Privacy Commissioner be sought by the Director of AUSTRAC whether to appoint a civil liberties representative either to an existing AUSTRAC advisory committee, or to establish a separate committee on privacy and civil liberties issues.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 12 recommends:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that State and Territory revenue authorities be given access to FTR&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, financial transaction reports&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">information on the basis of a Memorandum of Understanding to be entered into with the Director of AUSTRAC and subject to such conditions as the Director requires.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, just as the Australian Taxation Office has access to information from AUSTRAC, similar offices at state level should also have that access so that they are able to trace the money trail to see whether people are avoiding their obligations to pay tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee noted that the tax office itself did not seem to be taking as much advantage of the information provided by AUSTRAC as was possible. The committee expressed itself to be a little disappointed with the tax office's ability to make proper use of that information. So in recommendation 14, it has recommended that Australian tax officers be trained, and that a more fruitful relationship be established between the tax office and AUSTRAC which should lead to a better recovery of revenue which would not otherwise be recovered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to spend too long on this matter because others wish to speak, but I will deal with the dissent on one question from Senator Spindler. Senator Spindler's argument on this has a lot of intellectual merit but not enough to convince the rest of the committee. It is the question of whether or not solicitors should be included within the definition of `cash dealers'. I think the NCA, in particular, wanted solicitors included within the provisions of the act in respect of not only reporting significant cash transactions but also reporting suspect cash transactions. The difference between those two is that a significant cash transaction must be reported according to the amount of money involved; a suspect cash transaction must be reported on the basis of whether or not the receiver of the money entertains a suspicion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Spindler said he could see why solicitors should not have to report cash transactions within the second category&mdash;that is, the suspect category&mdash;but there was no reason why they should not have to report those matters that fell within the first category; that is, the significant cash transaction category. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two bases on which the majority rejected that. The first is the special relationship between solicitors and their clients. In fact, a law of confidentiality protects communications between solicitors and their clients in certain circumstances. There is some doubt about whether that protection would apply with the receipt of cash; nevertheless, the aura that should surround the relationship between solicitor and client ought not to be disturbed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second thing is that law enforcing bodies should not be able to come to parliament and gain power simply by asking for it. If the NCA and AUSTRAC want solicitors included in the category of cash dealers, they have to show on very convincing evidence&mdash;and I use the words `very convincing evidence' advisedly&mdash;that they should be included. They did produce some evidence. They did not descend to names&mdash;and I understand that there is always an embarrassment in stating names when talking about evidence associated with crime. Nevertheless, if they want solicitors included, they should show that they ought to be. Senator Spindler was convinced on the evidence; the rest of us were not, so solicitors are not included in the category of cash dealers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other interesting issue is the question of people who form the suspicion that there is something wrong with cash which is brought to them. A typical example would be bank tellers who receive, say, a bundle of cash which makes them suspicious and they report it. Even if they report a significant cash transaction they could be put in the position of having to give evidence. Employers, in particular, were concerned for their employees' safety and were afeard that, if the identity of tellers were revealed through them being called as witnesses, there would be some problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee recommended that the best way to deal with the protection of the identity of tellers as witnesses would be for agreements between AUSTRAC and law enforcement agencies to be drawn up along the lines of the draft agreement with the Australian Federal Police referred to in the report. In that agreement consideration is given to the position of tellers and others like them, and the essence of such an agreement should be taken into account by the DPP. Of course, we are not in any way trying to direct what the DPP ought to do but we simply make that suggestion. The committee recommended that the state law enforcement authorities be asked to take the same approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is one other matter where no recommendation was but it concerned the committee. There is a suggestion that law enforcement bodies such as the Federal Police, the tax office and the National Crime Authority, be asked to pay for information that they get from AUSTRAC. The committee was quite firm on this. Paragraphs 12.37 to 12.39 of the report state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">12.37 The dominant difficulty the Committee has with the proposition that law enforcement agencies should be made to pay for the use of those mechanisms which they need to properly carry out their duties is the concept of government upon which it is based.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">12.38 The idea that fundamental obligations of government can be more or less met, or not met at all depending upon the ability or willingness of its instruments to pay for information that will or may help them carry out their functions is ill-founded.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">12.39 Government must discharge those functions which are basic to its purpose. Seeing that justice is done is one of these. To allow the meeting of that purpose to be determined by market forces would be amazing.</PARA>
<PARA>In closing my address I thank the members of the committee who helped with this report; they are set out on page iii. I also thank the committee staff: Paul Griffiths, the secretary; the research staff of Rod Adams, Virginia Buring and James Warmenhoven&mdash;and I mention in passing that James Warmenhoven has recently had a son born to him, named Huw, which I think ought to be noted; Angela Misic, the Executive Assistant; and Margaret Lindeman who is up there eternally typing. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on this report by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs on the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988. I was privileged to be a member of the committee and to serve with the chairman and the other members of the committee on this inquiry. As usual, I appreciated the wise guidance that we received from the chairman.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to endorse the chairman's comments on the staff. I think we are not always cognisant of the tremendous support that we get from staff on committees and generally in this chamber, so I thoroughly endorse that. Having said these things, I regret that I cannot agree with the report on all matters. Since I accept the report as it stands, with one exception, I see no point in traversing again the matters that Senator Cooney has so carefully described. I will confine my remarks to the dissent that I am offering. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The dissent relates to my view that, on balance, the legal profession should be subject to the provisions of the act in one respect. I am not suggesting that legal practitioners be defined as cash dealers because that would require them to report suspicious transactions and I accept the arguments which were advanced that this could bring us too close to the bone, as it were, in going into the area of the professional relationship between client and lawyer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I really do not see why the legal profession should continue to be exempt from the reporting requirements which apply to a particular amount of money. I am suggesting that $5,000 should be the threshold requirement, and I will come back to the reason for that later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has heard compelling evidence during the course of the inquiry about the involvement of members of the legal profession in money laundering. The chairperson of the National Crime Authority, Mr Sherman, informed the committee that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there are some aspects of money laundering that it is virtually impossible to perpetrate unless you have the assistance of lawyers. By that, I mean the conversion of funds and the integration of funds by the purchase of real estate and setting up companies and so on.</PARA>
<PARA>This evidence that we received was not in the form of unsupported generalisation. Twenty-seven case studies were provided to the committee and most disclosed the involvement of legal practitioners. In one case study, a solicitor received $42,000 from a client to form part of the funds for a property transaction. The money was recorded in the trust account ledger and banked on eight different days over a two-week period. No amount exceeded $8,000. The solicitor explained this conduct by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that if someone deposited that much cash in one go it was bound to give rise to some sort of inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA>And it seems rightly so. Other case studies illustrated the case of complex and unusual arrangements to finance property transactions and indeed wilful blindness to the use of false names to operate bank accounts and to acquire property. A whole range of other case studies were appended to the joint submission by AUSTRAC and the NCA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response to this evidence, the Law Society of New South Wales and the Law Institute of Victoria referred to the role that solicitors have in keeping the justice system functioning, the duty which solicitors have to keep client information confidential and the fiduciary duty owed by a solicitor to the client. In response to these arguments, the NCA pointed out that the law on solicitor-client confidence admits, however, that there are exceptions to the duty of confidence. In evidence to the inquiry, the NCA chair quoted from the case Gartside v. Outram, which said, `there is no confidence as to the disclosure of iniquity'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier in 1991 the NCA had completed an exhaustive 12-month inquiry into money laundering in Australia carried out by four multi-disciplinary NCA teams and recommended that the definition of `cash dealers' in the Financial Transaction Reports Act be widened to include solicitors. This recommendation was not accepted by the government. However, it is worth putting on record that I was, and am, a member of the parliamentary committee on the NCA; I have access to not only the published report on that inquiry but also a confidential appended report which detailed a score of cases where solicitors had been used in transactions which can only be described as criminal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also refer to some earlier material that came to light in the inquiry by Mr Justice Stewart into drugs and drug trafficking in Australia. In one particular case&mdash;the Mr Asia syndicate&mdash;it became quite clear that the essential business of financing and then of laundering the proceeds of the operation of that syndicate was carried out through the office of a practising solicitor. It seems to me that we should take account of that evidence and should close what I believe is a major loophole in our efforts to pursue white-collar crime, and worse, in Australia. I believe that we should not hamper our law enforcement agencies unduly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said before, my own proposal does not go as far as the NCA's proposal. I accept that the reporting of suspicious transaction does pose a greater risk to the integrity of the solicitor-client relationship. However, I believe that there is also evidence that the legal profession accepts the distinction that I am making in not suggesting that solicitors be classed as cash dealers and therefore be compelled to disclose suspicious circumstances. A witness for the Law Society of New South Wales told the committee that there is a distinction to be made. The evidence is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In very broad principle, I have no objection to the reporting of facts of an objective nature&mdash;by that, I mean significant cash transactions.</PARA>
<PARA>And that is exactly what I am suggesting. The evidence continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But I wonder whether I am sufficiently taking into account the position of clients when I say that we would have no objection to objective reporting. On the other hand, the Law Society is totally opposed to the Act being extended to solicitors in regard to suspect transaction reporting.</PARA>
<PARA>Yes, indeed. I do appreciate the distinction which was drawn in this way, and I do understand the concerns that some solicitors would have about suspect transaction reporting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accordingly, I confine my dissent to the suggestion that solicitors, legal practitioners, should be required to report cash transactions of $5,000 or more. I am suggesting this amount, in contrast to the general amount of $10,000, to cater for the fact that it is also on record that solicitors do advise their clients to break up large cash transactions into smaller ones and thus evade the requirement of the act. Indeed, that happened in the example that I cited earlier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I regret that the committee did not see fit to include this recommendation in its report. I believe that it is necessary to continue to monitor the effectiveness of this legislation and, in particular, I will take care to examine carefully future reports from AUSTRAC and its recommendations and, if necessary, bring up this recommendation again at a future date. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was not a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs when the matter now before us was referred. I came in halfway through the inquiry. Nonetheless, I found it to be an extremely interesting reference for a number of reasons.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, the reference involves the classical balancing of the rights of a citizen to freedom and privacy against the interests of the state. The Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988 had its genesis in the royal commissions of the early 1980s&mdash;basically the Costigan and Stewart royal commissions. At that time there was a great deal of white-collar crime going on in Australia. The underworld was basically transacting large amounts of money and this was not being detected. So in 1987 the original Cash Transactions Reports Act was introduced with the proviso that it be looked at in three years time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will refer to a few of the committee's recommendations without going through them ad seriatim. The first recommendation is that AUSTRAC should engage only in those activities which are clearly and unequivocally allowed under the relevant act. AUSTRAC is a body which provides information to law enforcement agencies. It really should not participate in any investigative activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it was the Victorian Council for Civil Liberties which submitted that the agency would be acting ultra vires in undertaking any investigative activities and that the answer should really be to increase the investigative functions of the law enforcement agencies rather than expand the role of AUSTRAC. I have had personal experience in relation to the Australian Federal Police in this regard. A body such as the Australian Federal Police should be given increased investigative powers rather than an information-keeping body such as AUSTRAC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Flowing from that, the committee stated in recommendation No. 4 that suspect reporting should be retained in its present form so that not only any cash transaction over $10,000 but also any transaction which is suspect be reported. The committee, of course, had some reservations about this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recommendations Nos 7 to 10 deal with some restrictions which I believe go to protecting the individual's freedom and privacy. Suspect reporting involves a cash dealer making a value judgment as to a cash transaction. The amount is of no relevance; it is simply whether the transaction is suspicious or not. That places a great deal of pressure on a person such as a bank teller. Someone might roll up and bank a couple of hundred dollars. If the circumstances seem somewhat suspicious, the bank teller is at liberty to report that transaction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The frequency of the transaction, the manner in which it is carried out and the person's financial means are all attributes which would be looked at in assessing the suspicion of the transaction.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That opens the floodgates to the possibility that all sorts of cash transactions that we as citizens engage in during our daily lives could be reported. Of course, that situation would have to be looked at very carefully. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recommendations Nos 7 to 10, the committee was of the view that the Australian Taxation Office should not have right of access; that there be a civil liberties representative appointed to the ministerial advisory committee; and that the Director of AUSTRAC have power to delete any information from AUSTRAC records in appropriate circumstances. Quite obviously, after a period such transactions might well become irrelevant. However, whilst they are sitting on the AUSTRAC database, there is a possibility for officers&mdash;or anyone, for that matter&mdash;who can break into the system to find out information on individual citizens. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 8 p.m. </EMPHASIS></PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9X5">Senator ELLISON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the suspension of the sitting for dinner, I mentioned the committee's concern to protect the privacy and freedom of the individual in relation to the powers bestowed upon AUSTRAC. A further recommendation, recommendation 12, provides that state and territory revenue authorities be given access to AUSTRAC information, but that that be done on the basis that such access be permitted only to a small number of key officers of each authority. Of course, the commonsense there is to ensure that as few people as possible within the organisation have the information available to them, to limit any chance of the information escaping into the wider community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee recommended at recommendation 22 that the definition of a cash dealer not be widened to include solicitors. Much has been said by Senator Cooney and Senator Spindler on this matter. The point I make is that it was submitted by the National Crime Authority that solicitors should be deemed cash dealers because of money passing through their trust accounts. That would result in a solicitor having to inform on his or her client if the transaction was either suspect or over the sum of $10,000, which would be the sum if our recommendation is accepted. The committee found that situation unacceptable. It concedes that evidence was presented to it, but it was not sufficient to override that longstanding rule of privilege. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to page 135 of the report and the submission made by the Law Society of New South Wales, which summarises the situation quite neatly. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.it is conducive to justice for clients to be assured that communications between them and their solicitors will remain confidential, or at least not to be disclosed beyond the implied authority given to the solicitor by them;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.our system of law requires solicitors to refrain from making judgments impugning the veracity of what their clients tell them, unless they have reason to make further inquiry of the client. Requiring solicitors to inform authorities of their personal suspicions about the conduct of clients is wholly incapable of being reconciled with this fundamental principle of our legal system;</PARA>
<PARA>I respect the fact that Senator Spindler dissents only from the exemption for solicitors to report on cash transactions exceeding the sum of $10,000, and he agrees that they should be exempt from reporting on suspect transactions. Nonetheless, the average law firm would have a good deal of money passing through its trust account in the normal course of conveyancing, family law settlements and the settlement of litigation. It is quite common to find solicitors having thousands of dollars pass through their trust accounts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That would impose on solicitors the burden of notifying AUSTRAC of these transactions. Furthermore, I would estimate that 99.9 per cent of those cases would be innocent citizens going about their business, having their financial details reported to a government body. I am not saying that there is a lack of trust in AUSTRAC&mdash;quite the contrary&mdash;but the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs has to look to the rights of the citizens and has to review and guard those rights jealously because we live in a free democracy and we endorse government action only where it is needed. Where it is not necessary for government to act, it then becomes necessary for government to refrain from doing anything in its capacity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this case, there is a real need to keep tabs on organised crime and on the major tax evaders, but not so the average working man and woman going about their lawful business. I believe that in the circumstances the situation of solicitors not being cash dealers would not impede any investigation or the checking of large-scale crime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Cooney raised the matter of user pays, which I thought was a very good point. I am normally quite a fan of that principle; however, page 154 of the committee report states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The idea that fundamental obligations of government can be more or less met, or not met at all, depending upon the ability or willingness of its instruments to pay for information that will or may help them carry out their functions is ill-founded.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not believe that we can impose upon the Australian Federal Police and the National Crime Authority economic constraints in the exercise of their duty. Law and order is one of the biggest issues across this country and it is one that we cannot put a price on. In this particular instance, I believe that the budget measure to impose a charging regime on AUSTRAC was an ill-founded one and one which, in turn, will impede the operation of AUSTRAC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I refer the Senate to comments made by the committee which I believe sum up the issues at stake here. They are basically set out at page 139. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From time to time, law enforcement agencies in the proper discharge of their responsibilities seek further powers and greater jurisdiction from Government. Government should not readily grant them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because law enforcement mechanisms are prone to impact heavily on the life and liberty of members of the community they must, in a free and open society, be instituted only after close analysis and with considerable caution. Other than in exceptional circumstances evidence on the basis of </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">which they are established should be comprehensive, complete and compelling.</PARA>
<PARA>I believe those two paragraphs more than adequately sum up the approach to be adopted in this case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the work the committee did. As I say, I came in only halfway through. The committee staff did a very good job and we were ably guided by our chairman, Senator Cooney. Senator Cooney remarked that it is not a particularly thrilling subject, but it is one which upon further inquiry reveals its importance all the more, because here we have a very useful tool in the combat of organised crime and large-scale tax evasion. On the other side of the scale, the interests and freedom of the citizen have to be considered. In the final analysis, if we are to demand that citizens' private financial affairs are to be made available to government organisations and instrumentalities, then those organisations and instrumentalities must jealously guard that information which it is a privilege for them to have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the report to the Senate. I respect the views that Senator Spindler expressed in his dissenting report and I can well understand his reasons for that. Nonetheless, I believe that on the most important issues the committee had a unanimous view for those most important reasons that I have outlined. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate for agreeing to allow debate on this motion as part of general business. Due to the pressure on the program, which I recognise, I plan to speak for 10 minutes initially and exercise a right of reply of five minutes after the contributions of any other speakers. I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate recognises, and in this resolution declares, that all Australian governments should adhere to their international obligations on democratic electoral procedures and that the Tasmanian Government should respect the current process for election for the House of Assembly and, in line with accepted democratic principles, stop the precipitate action of changing the electoral system without consulting the electors of Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA>The reason for presenting this motion to the Senate today&mdash;as my colleagues know, I wished it to be debated as a matter of urgency&mdash;is that today the members of the Tasmanian parliament has been passing laws which will change the representation in the Tasmanian parliament without having consulted the electors who elected those members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raised this as a matter of urgency and I have moved this motion today to highlight the actions of the Tasmanian Liberal government to change the number of members of both houses of the Tasmanian parliament with only a week's notice of its intention and with no consultation with the electors of Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberal government's proposal is to reduce the number of members of the House of Assembly from 35 to 30. I am not here to question the ability of that state government to make the changes, but I do question the opportunistic and conniving manner in which the government has moved to make the changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Surely it must be a principle of any democratic system that there should be an opportunity for outside scrutiny prior to making fundamental changes to the electoral system. The Premier of Tasmania has seen fit to allow only one week of public debate, without the release of the legislation, before moving swiftly to legislate the matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By linking the reduction in the number of members of parliament with a 40 per cent increase in the salary of members, Premier Groom has deflected public attention away from the reduction in members to this substantial increase in salaries. On a superficial level, it is far simpler for the public to see the advantage in reducing the number of parliamentarians than it is to see the need for a 40 per cent increase in income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposal to reduce the number of members is an abandonment of changes made to the system of election in 1958. These changes were made to stop the instability caused by having only 30 members between 1906 and 1958. All expert advice then was that, unless the House of Assembly had an unequal number of members, and therefore the capacity for a majority, the instability would continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1984, the then Liberal premier, Robin Gray, accepted the advice of the Ogilvie report into proposals to reduce the number of members of parliament. That is still the advice to this day. The Ogilvie report also pointed to the difficulty of fulfilling all the obligations of the Westminster system of government with a house reduced to a government of 16 members and an official opposition with, therefore, no more than 14. The Ogilvie report stated this in its advice to the premier:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is our opinion that it would not be in the best interests of the State of Tasmania for a reduction of the number of Members of parliament to be included among the measures to be taken to economise in the cost of the Government of the State.</PARA>
<PARA>I must add that my main reason for being involved is that various members of this parliament have been approached by members of the Greens in Tasmania to ask us to speak out on their behalf and to challenge throughout Australia the undercutting of the principles of democracy that is taking place through this action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of Wednesday, 17 November 1993 states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">THE overhaul of Tasmania's electoral system announced last week by the Premier, Mr Groom, would substantially change the way the State's voters elect their governments. The balance of power between parties that has developed over the past 10 years would be altered, chiefly by reducing the ability of minority parties, such as the Greens, to win seats in Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA>I make no apology for the fact that my motivation is to speak out on behalf of minority parties, including the Greens, and the people who have elected green members of parliament throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Hare-Clark system has been a very fair system. It is very regrettable that a state government can simply legislate to alter its democratic representation. We are fortunate to have proportional representation in this chamber. I believe that, in that way, the community is reflected not simply by a majority of, for example, 51 per cent but by a percentage that reflects the support in the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind my colleagues in the Senate that it is perfectly accurate that 2.6 per cent of this Senate are Greens because 2.9 per cent of people around Australia voted for the Greens. It is also appropriate to remind the Senate that the Liberal and coalition members have an increased proportional place in this chamber because of proportional representation. It is very important to democracy that we extend the electoral systems of this country so that the community is adequately represented here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw the Senate's attention to the way in which this is impacting on Tasmania and the Greens, because I believe that that is my particular voice here. I hope and assume that other senators in this chamber are also concerned about the state of democracy in Tasmania. They may well have different views from mine, but I urge them to consider the impact on both the representation in that state and its effect if it were repeated in other parliaments of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A Tasmanian Greens press release states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the most fundamental change to <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The Constitution</EMPHASIS> ever undertaken without consulting the people of Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Premier has said that there is no need for consultation on changes to the electoral system of the state.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No one properly understands the ramifications of these far reaching changes, not the Premier, not the opposition, not the political commentators nor the Chief Electoral Officer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every expert, consultant, political scientist, commentator and journalist has condemned the changes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes have been undertaken with absolutely no community consultation and not a single expert is supporting the Government's position.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every report ever commissioned on reducing the number of seats in the House to 30 has recommended against it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1984 the Ogilvie report commissioned by the then Premier Robin Gray, recommended against the changes. Robin Gray fully supported the recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes to the Constitution fundamentally change the basic tenets of Parliament and the Westminster system of government. Unlike every other Parliament in the country, the most powerful position in the Parliament, the Speaker, will no longer be required to have the support of the Parliament. Only around 25% of the elected members will be required to elect a speaker. In effect the Speaker will be elected by the executive.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One individual member in the Parliament, the member elected as Speaker, will exercise the undemocratic power of two votes on the floor of the House. No where else in Australia does any member have the ability to exercise two votes. This abuses the principle of one vote&mdash;one value, and in most normal circumstances will give this member the power to block or pass all legislation. Electors' votes directed to the candidate chosen as Speaker will be worth double that of every other citizen's vote in the state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the current Parliament of 35, the Liberals with 54% of the vote could be unseated from government with a swing as small as 4%. On the proposed Parliament of 30, the Liberals could survive a swing over 15% and still get a second bite at the cherry by triggering the deadlock breaking mechanism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The deadlock breaking count back to determine which alignment receives the deadlock breaking vote, excludes exhausted votes cast to parties included in the final count. For example, if the Greens received 30% of the vote and as can be expected most of those people voted 1-6 for Green candidates, then those votes are excluded from the final vote to allocate the deadlock breaking vote. Therefore the deadlock breaking count could be determined by 35% of the voters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes themselves will dramatically increase the chance of deadlocks. Between 1948 and 1958 in a 30 seat house, every Parliament was deadlocked. Since the introduction of a 35 member House in 1958 specifically to overcome this problem, no Parliament has ever been deadlocked. A total of 6 elections have been deadlocked between 1906 and 1958.</PARA>
<PARA>I illustrate these problems because I believe that, although the principles are specific at this time to Tasmania, they do apply to the state of democracy in this country. The people of this country are increasingly disillusioned by a political system which does not reflect the variety and diversity of views within the community. I believe that proportional representation is the way forward. I understand that Senator Bell may well be speaking to a fairer system that could apply. I come from Western Australia, where the government has the numbers in both the lower house and the upper house. This means that there is no ability to have a house of review where people can see that they are not getting a full and proper say. The people of Western Australia are very relieved that we have a Senate where that diversity of voices can be reflected, that there is no single group within the Senate that can determine the vote and that therefore this does allow a greater community voice to be heard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are in a transition from a two-party political system to a multi-party system. We are in a move towards consensus democracy. In order to achieve consensus, we must protect our parliament from the fear ridden attempts to keep out the representatives of minority members of our community. I urge the Senate to consider deeply the impact of what is happening and to support the motion which I have moved in an attempt to prevent the utterly undesirable situation currently going on in Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator Calvert)</EMPHASIS>&mdash;Before I call the next speaker, I inform the Senate of arrangements that have been made. The debate will run for 45 minutes. There will be three speakers from three different parties.

It is my intention now to call Senator Sherry for the government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government certainly shares the concerns outlined by Senator Chamarette. I intend in this debate to touch briefly on the current position as it exists in Tasmania and the changes that have been proposed&mdash;I have to say without any discussion or public comment. Even now those changes are in the process of being amended in ways that not even the premier, who has proposed these changes, appears to understand. Then I will deal with some of the reasons why I believe this approach has been taken by the current Liberal government in Tasmania.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to touch on the points in the motion relating to international obligations and what is meant by consulting the electors of Tasmania. The legislation, which has been introduced to reduce the size of the House of Assembly in Tasmania from 35 to 30, was announced last week, together with a decision by the government to increase MPs salaries by 40 per cent to a new base salary of $65,230. Again, although it is a side issue, it is certainly a related issue because the issue of MPs salaries has not been put to any independent tribunal. It was decided upon by the caucus of government members. Interestingly, Premier Groom&mdash;I actually believe him&mdash;did not appear to know what he was going to end up with. On closer scrutiny by the media it was pointed out to him that he was going to be the third highest paid politician in Australia. He suddenly decided that he would reduce his own pay. But that is what you get when you adopt policy on the run. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Premier Groom has said he will also negotiate with the Legislative Council to reduce the size of the council from 19 to 15 members. We do not know what that means. There is no guarantee of that outcome. The constitutional amendment bill which is now before the House of Assembly will apply only to that house; it does not apply to the Legislative Council in terms of the reduction in members.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has justified the reduction in the size of the two houses of the parliament for a number of reasons. It says it honours its commitment to smaller government and reform. It says it completes the work of the select committee on parliamentary reform&mdash;interestingly before it is due to report, which I think is a fairly amazing claim. It will increase the productivity of MPs. The fourth reason given is that it is consistent with public sector and private approaches to pay rises; that is, slash public sector and private payroll numbers and increase the pay of those left. That is an interesting concept but certainly I have not seen too many increases in pay of around 40 per cent without any independent judgment of the basis for that increase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Interestingly there was no public consultation at all about the bill that has been introduced into the parliament. There has been no inquiry. It was just baldly announced in the media and it has been presented to the parliament. It reduces the number of members of the House of Assembly elected from the five existing electorates from 35 to 30. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The area of deadlocks is the critical area&mdash;interestingly this is an issue on which the Liberal Party made a great amount of propaganda during the last state election. It argued that there should be one party with a majority, thus removing the situation whereby the Greens had the balance of power. But with what the government is proposing there is a much greater chance of deadlocks arising. So it is totally in contradiction of its position at the last state election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is proposing that in a 15/15 situation or a 15/14/1 or 15/13/2&mdash;which is what I suspect it believes will occur, 15/13/2, although not on current opinion polls&mdash;that situation be resolved by a state-wide count of votes after the election to determine which party or alignment, as defined by the bill, forms the government. Then, whichever party is the largest in terms of the state-wide count, the speaker, who must come from the alignment having the state-wide majority of votes, will have two votes&mdash;one deliberative and one casting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Reducing the number of members of the House of Assembly to 30 increases the quota under the Hare-Clark system. That, in itself, is not undemocratic, and I have to disagree with Senator Chamarette's assertion that changing the quota is undemocratic. It makes it less likely that minor parties will win, but that does not make it an undemocratic quota. In fact, the new quota will be the same as is required for Senator Chamarette to be elected to this place in a half Senate election, because there would be six members. It certainly lifts the quota and it certainly does make it harder for independent and minor parties to gain seats in the house. But from my political experience I suspect that, when governments fiddle with electoral systems in this way, it generally comes back to bite them. It does not end up having the effect that they thought it would. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A leading Tasmanian expert on the electoral system, George Howatt, best described in his 1958 report how six member electorates would take away a fundamental premise of a democratic electoral system. That premise is that a majority of voters should have the right to return a majority of representatives. As Senator Chamarette mentioned, this view has been supported by every other expert in the area. There is not one person with a knowledge of electoral systems who is supporting the legislation introduced by the Groom government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Already flaws in the bill have been identified. This is only one week after it was presented to parliament. When the premier was questioned about these flaws, he did not appear to have any idea or answer on how to resolve them. For example, the definition of an alignment in clause 9B was amended by the government two or three days after the bill was introduced into parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More importantly, in a 15-14-1 situation, which could quite easily occur at the next election, it would be quite possible for the party having 14 seats&mdash;not a majority&mdash;to gain an absolute majority of the votes in a state-wide vote. Therefore, the smaller of the two major parties&mdash;even though it has only 14 seats, fewer than the other major party&mdash;could gain an absolute majority of votes in a state-wide vote and therefore be entitled to nominate the Speaker. However, this party would not have a majority on the floor of the house. Because of this state-wide election, and the double vote for the Speaker, which in itself is undemocratic, it will in fact create a deadlock situation, not break it. The current government appears to have no solutions to this problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a quite blatant effort by a government in power that is rapidly losing popularity. All the current polling shows that it is a very unpopular government. However, there are two years to go to an election; we should not assume too much at this stage. We have a government that is panicking; it was facing significant internal pressure to increase the pay of politicians. It decided that it could increase the pay by presenting it as a cost saving by reducing the number of members of parliament. Instead, it has been shown itself to be unprincipled in its approach to pay rises for politicians by not referring the matter to a tribunal for determination. And it has been unprincipled in its attempt to manipulate the electoral system which, by its very approach and definition, must give an advantage to the government of the day. The government of the day obtains an advantage. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZW4">Senator SHERRY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Because it is in government. It has that advantage. I was a bit amused when it was drawn to my attention that Michael Hodgman, someone well known to members of the House of Representatives, spent some thousands of dollars prior to the election for Speaker after the last state election. He had his photos taken before the election for Speaker. He donned his gown; he was standing in full regalia out the front of the House of Assembly. He then lost the vote; two of his own side defected. Such is the nature of politics in Tasmania. Although at times I do admire Michael Hodgman's gall and his publicity, I look with some wry amusement on the prospect of him having two votes after the next state election. They are two votes which I am sure Premier Groom would not want to be relying on too much, knowing Michael Hodgman's past penchant for playing to the gallery.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I turn to international obligations. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights is not in the form of a legally binding treaty. Many of the principles it contains are widely regarded as being part of customary international law and so binding on all countries. However, in this case, if we rely on the 1966 case, and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which repeats article 21 of the universal declaration in its own article 25, it is apparent that we cannot rely on this covenant to ensure that democracy continues in Tasmania. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I find it somewhat extraordinary that this motion should have appeared here today on what is obviously fairly limited information on the part of the participants. For a start, I was surprised at the wording of it. It talks about the democratic situation and so on. I suppose how you look at this depends on what you call democratic. How can you be more democratic when exactly the same process occurs in every electorate and when exactly the same number of votes is required for whoever is going to be elected, whether this be for a major party, an independent or anything in between. The figures required to elect a member are absolutely identical. Is that not exactly what democracy is all about?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sort of guff that I have been reading and hearing in the last few days would indicate that somehow this change is going to disadvantage some of the candidates. Why should it be disadvantageous for one person to be able to get elected with  14.3 per cent of the vote&mdash;exactly the same as it is in the Senate&mdash;when everybody else has to get 14.3 per cent of the vote? There is no difference&mdash;none whatsoever. If it is the same for everybody, what about democratic principles?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is somebody seriously suggesting that we should have different percentages for different people or different parties or for different electorates? What does `precipitate' mean in Senator Chamarette's motion? Something is implied in that of which we have not been told. There is also the inference that there is something not quite right about changes to the electoral act. The changes attempt to head off the problems that have existed over a period of many years. The instability of the Tasmanian parliament as a result of having close decisions has been very considerable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first method employed to change the situation was the Constitution Amendment Act of 1954 in an attempt to get over the tied votes of 15-all. That provided for machinery for overcoming deadlocks but still did not have much impact on the major problem, that of providing the government of the day with an effective working majority. A 1958 amendment increased the number of members in the House of Assembly from 30 to 35. The only thing Senator Chamarette omitted to say was that at the 1958 election we had&mdash;guess what&mdash;17/16/2. The very reason for employing five extra members of parliament blew up in the first election; it just did not happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there was the Constitution Act in 1936. There was a 1958 act, a 1969 act and a 1972 act. There have been all these changes. The Greens have probably not heard of this in Western Australia but all those change were made to the Tasmanian acts for a variety of reasons. None of them changed a thing. Tasmania has this great history. An article written in 1988 by Professor Townsley&mdash;a person that I do take some notice of&mdash;states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When it consisted of 30 members, six from each of the five electorates, there was a good chance of a deadlock between the two major parties. That it did not happen more often was due to the intrusion of independents. They oiled the works. There was scope for independents to work very closely with major parties as well as against them. But independents might only resolve a deadlock between the major parties by introducing instability.</PARA>
<PARA>That has been the feature of the whole of the Hare-Clark system since 1906. Tasmanian people have some fatal fascination for the Hare-Clark system that keeps it going. But its design, the very nature of the beast, is going to make sure that results will usually be close and often deadlocked. At one stage we had Mr Carruthers controlling the government, and, following that, Mr Townley, Mr Wedd, Mr Gray, Mr McPartlan, Dr Turnbull, Kevin Lyons, Doug Lowe, Mary Willey and Norm Sanders. All those people have, at various stages, put governments out of business. </PARA>

For instance, even though the last five governments in Tasmania have had a four-year term, they have averaged 33 months in office. That is as a direct result of the instability that is created in the parliament. It goes further than that. The unemployment rate in the area in which I live is 15.6 per cent. Why? Because nobody with any brains would go into a state where they know that the political situation can be unstable as a result of the government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One only has to look at the previous Tasmanian government. Those opposite may not have heard of the Field government, which was an absolute disaster.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the meantime investors will not invest, they will not develop and they will not employ. Those opposite probably do not know much about this, but it is how things work in the real world. I believe that it is time we looked at what Tasmania needs by way of a government. The thing that is needed most is stability. We have to know that there is room for people to invest and employ so that we can get by and do something for the next generation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe there have been something like 17 deadlocked parliaments in the past 60 years or thereabouts. There is nothing to indicate that that will change unless we change the system. The only way to change the system is to bring in something that will be workable. There is nothing particularly great about having a chairman who has a casting and deliberative vote. It is done in all sorts of places for all sorts of reasons. I see no reason why, considering that we have tried other amendments to the Constitution Act in Tasmania, this is not the most likely way to do it. We have to do what is best and what will produce some sort of stability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to sum up briefly by tidying up some of the misinformation and wrong impressions that have been gathered. The first of these returns to the basis originally proposed by Hare and Clarke. The original proposal was that there should be 30 seats. I believe there is nothing strange about going back to that. Secondly, the changes in the numbers will be exactly the same for all parties and independents&mdash;namely, 14.3 per cent will win a seat. Thirdly, there is no change in the position of the governor or the parliament in any way. Fourthly, providing the speaker with both a casting and deliberative vote is the best way to overcome the problems. Finally, the history of Tasmanian electoral stability is very bad and this has had disastrous effects on Tasmanian investment and development over many years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Regardless of what is claimed by Senator Archer, I would contend that Tasmania's Hare-Clarke electoral system is widely known and recognised as one of the most democratic electoral systems in the world.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Successive governments in Tasmania, Labor and Liberal alike, have acknowledged that the Tasmanian electoral system for the House of Assembly is the best in the world. But now and then governments or political parties find that it does not suit them. It is not designed to of course. It is designed to be a system to best suit the electors, that produces a parliament that best represents the interests of the electorate. The Hare-Clarke system of Tasmania does that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is precisely because the Hare-Clarke system best reflects the interests and values of the electorate that it comes under threat by the power seekers&mdash;by those who think they know best. We heard reflections of this in the last contribution. We hear this from those who think they know best and those who think they know what is good for us. Now the system is being threatened again. It is a subtle threat, but a threat all the same. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Groom government does not propose to radically alter the basic building blocks that make up what we know as the Hare-Clarke system. For example, it does not propose to revert to single member electorates. It does not propose to introduce how-to-vote cards. It does not threaten the principle of rotating names on the ballot paper. What it does do is propose a reduction in the number of members to be elected&mdash;a reduction from 35 to 30. </PARA>

The people have in a superficial fashion asserted that Tasmania is overgoverned and that we have too many politicians. To some extent there is merit in that proposition. Tasmania currently has 35 members of the House of Assembly and 19 members of the Legislative Council. It has about 300 members of local councils and quite a number of members of progress associations. Members of the Assembly and members of the Legislative Council are politicians and are paid by the taxpayers. The people elected to councils or progress associations are not paid but they are politicians nonetheless. Recently, the number of councils was reduced from 46 to 29. It is valid to question whether such a reduction actually enhances the quality of democracy in Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is a qualitative measure of democracy? It surely involves notions of degrees of participation. From there, however, it is also legitimate to question how that participation is measured and indeed how it operates within a system. In other words, we really do need to be examining a whole range of questions about the functioning of our political institutions before we can be categorical about assertions of threats to basic democratic principles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed a view that has been proffered recently calls for reduced numbers of politicians, but in a manner that accommodates a number of other changes to institutional structures. Nevertheless, it has been pointed out by acknowledged experts that a mere reduction in the number of members of the House of Assembly is simply wrong. A decade ago, as we have been told already, a previous Liberal government proposed a similar reduction. To its credit it appointed an expert committee to examine the proposition. Not surprisingly the idea was rejected by the committee and it was then dropped. The committee rejected that idea for good reasons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the members of that committee, who has been mentioned already, is an acknowledged world expert in the Hare-Clarke system, Mr George Howatt. He is formerly an American Fullbright scholar who has devoted a substantial proportion of his life to studying the Hare-Clarke voting system. For example, in 1957 it was Mr Howatt's recommendation that the numbers be increased from 30 to 35. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee, of which Mr Howatt was one of three members, pointed out serious anomalies that would result from an assembly reduced to 30 members. Apart from the problems of deadlocks which would be created, it would unacceptably increase the power of executive government. The reasons are quite simple. With a house reduced to 30, the number of members of a governing party might be 16. With a cabinet of nine or 10, that could mean that the cabinet would prevail within the governing party itself and within the assembly as well. The cabinet government would be unchecked by the governing house. It might as well be a dictatorship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But worse, governments need to be able to change ministers, to bring in new people and to develop expertise. A reduction in the numbers on the backbench would reduce the pool of talent from which ministers could be chosen. That would weaken the quality of government, not improve it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More generally, a reduction from 35 to 30 members would unacceptably reduce the number of members available to serve on committees&mdash;an increasing function of modern parliaments, as we in this chamber are well aware. A few years ago it was precisely that argument which was used to justify an increase in the number of members of the House of Representatives and the Senate. For Tasmania especially, that is a valid argument. Senator Sherry touched on that when he mentioned the committee examining the reform of the Tasmanian parliament. As I understand it, the consideration of committees forms a major part of the considerations of that committee, which has yet to report. It has now been gazumped by this proposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is high time that the structure of the total Tasmanian parliament was examined. It is being re-examined. It should be conducted against the need to focus on the best way to provide good government for the people of Tasmania, not the best way to provide an entrenched system for the benefit of those who happen to be in government at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposition to reduce the number of politicians includes the reduction in the number of members of the Legislative Council from 19 to 15. As Sir Geoffrey Foot, a former member of the council, has argued as recently as yesterday, this will merely create a small controlling cabal in the council which will have the potential to make the council even more reactionary than it is described at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That council's conservatism and parochialism has brought it under considerable criticism for many years. It is one of the most powerful upper houses in the world. It is able to reject budgets and cause elections without ever facing the voters itself for doing those things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The council has six-year rotating terms, coupled with a single member electorate system of representation that is grossly malapportioned and is a travesty of basic democratic principles because one person, one vote is not reflected in the make-up of that council. It is a blot on Australia's political landscape and it should not be permitted to continue in its present shape. Indeed, there is a strong argument that all state political institutions should have to meet national criteria of democratic principles. That is perhaps a topic that should be debated within the debate about Australia becoming a republic. It is certainly not appropriate to conclude such a debate today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such a debate, however, could start now in Tasmania. Tasmania has led political movements for reform before, with the most striking example being the anti-transportation movement led by the Reverend John West. Tasmania could do so again and it should, starting with a thorough review and debate about the way Tasmania's political institutions can be restructured to best provide for good government. Instead of the blatantly cynical proposals now being put by the Groom government, a panel of experts such as Sir Geoffrey Foot and perhaps Dr Ralph Chapman should be commissioned to promote debate about and conduct hearings on the range of options that are available to the Tasmanian people. For example, perhaps we should be retaining the Legislative Council but ensuring that it is elected from a state-wide electorate using proportional representation. That would immediately dispense with the petty parochialism that bedevils us and instead inject into the political arena a state-wide perspective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another view often put is to simply abolish the council, thereby achieving a significant reduction in the number of paid politicians and a consequent big reduction in the cost of governing. It is also argued, however, that the Legislative Council does, even if selectively, provide a check on the excesses of the House of Assembly. This is often seen by some as an anachronistic and unnecessary procedure in a modern democracy. Queensland might have been better served had the excesses of Bjelke-Petersen been curbed by an upper house. Perhaps this is overstated or there are other and better ways of ensuring that governments are accountable. I do not know and we will not know until it has had a full and fair airing in debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Should we not, for example, consider the presidential approach of separately electing premiers and representative assemblies? Indeed, an interesting argument could be mounted for such a structure for state governments. Or, as has been suggested by one of Australia's most conservative newspapers, the Hobart <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mercury</EMPHASIS>, in yesterday's editorial, a house of assembly expanded to 45 members&mdash;nine per electorate&mdash;would provide both the desired reduction in monetary outlays while retaining an inbuilt check on the executive. It would also provide a sufficiently large backbench pool to provide an adequate ministry and sufficient numbers to produce a modern, efficient and potentially effective committee system. The time is right for change. That change must be progressive and it must be consistent with the best principles of democratic government. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Understandably, Senator Archer did not agree with this motion and indicated that there was limited information on the part of the participants. I think there is limited information on the part of the proposers of this legislative change in Tasmania. Senator Archer also asked what the word `precipitous' means in my notice of motion. My colleague Senator Margetts suggested that it might mean that this is a bit steep. We believe that if what was being proposed was not so deadly serious it would be more like a joke. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a problem for all parliaments at this point because there is a change in the community and in voting patterns, and there is a move from what has previously been called a stable two-party system to a different way of democracy operating. I would like to point out to Senator Archer, who was concerned about the lack of stability in the current system, that the most stable form of government is dictatorship. People remember the time in Tasmania between 1989 and 1992&mdash;the Labor-Green accord&mdash;as a difficult time for everybody. In a debate in the Tasmanian Parliament Mrs Christine Milne noted that the deputy leader of the parliament had actually said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am willing to say that I believe we are overgoverned and I am against the Greens' trying to retain the number of members of Parliament . . . I think we can do better with fewer.</PARA>
<PARA>He also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I say now that I will be happy to see fewer members of Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not believe that feeling unhappy with a lack of stability should lead to electoral reforms that take the whole state of parliamentary democracy back 20 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also grateful for Senator Bell's comments. I believe that he has summarised some of the expert opinion that has been liberally available, criticising this move. He mentioned George Howatt, who pointed out serious problems in reduction of numbers. Ogilvie, Foot and Cartland, in their advice at the beginning of their 1984 report to Robin Gray, MHA, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We advise that having investigated the proposal to reduce the number of Members elected to both Houses of Parliament in accordance with our terms of reference . . . it is our opinion that it would not be in the best interests of the State of Tasmania for a reduction of the number of Members of Parliament to be included among the measures to be taken to economise in the cost of the Government of the State.</PARA>
<PARA>I thank the honourable senators who spoke in this debate. Senator Sherry and Senator Bell have informed me that they have problems with my wording.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak to the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training and to express some sadness and dismay at the reaction of the government to the report. The report is based on a very long watching brief of the Senate standing committee on the educational export area of the Australian economy. Just after I entered the Senate in 1991 the government was bringing down a piece of legislation which was draconian in nature and which would have had the effect at the time of killing off one of Australia's most vibrant industries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent times we have seen the government try to kill off the wine industry. Two years ago it was trying to kill off the educational export industry by bringing in legislation that would have put too high a level of control on this area. I would remind the Senate that what we are talking about is a billion dollar export industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time, the committee managed to persuade Mr Dawkins that his legislation was too draconian. We moved a total of 29 amendments to the legislation. The minister was so desperate to have some legislative framework in place for this industry that he agreed to all 29 amendments. As a result, I believe we set up a more deregulated structure under which the industry has operated quite successfully for the last two years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As would be expected, the scheme has had a number of minor blips in its operation. The only real problem that I have picked up in those two years of operation is the collapse of the Australian Business College in Perth. Tragic though that was, it is the only problem that I know of. Yet, we have the government coming in here wanting to revive again what it was doing two years ago by overregulating. Admittedly, the government is doing it in a different sort of way on this occasion, but again it is overregulating. This is likely to force up the costs of an industry which is in a highly competitive market. The industry is operating in an area which is price sensitive in Asia and is competing against our competitors in Europe, the United States and a number of emerging Asian economies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we need to do is modify the regulation of this industry. That was the view of the Senate standing committee. We came up with a unanimous report and we suggested a number of minor modifications. It is to the shame of this government that it has ignored a unanimous report of a Senate standing committee which is made up of members of the Australian Democrats, the Australian Labor Party and the coalition. I believe that the government will seriously damage this industry if it continues on this path. That is why when this bill was introduced into the Senate, a notice of motion was given to refer the bill to the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training so that we could look at it more thoroughly. We believe that the government should go back and consult with the industry more thoroughly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the main measures that the government is bringing in&mdash;it is doing so through a separate piece of legislation&mdash;is something called the tuition assurance scheme. This scheme will guarantee student funds and deliver courses or course equivalents. Unfortunately, the principles of operating such a scheme are to be placed in regulations. The recommendation of the committee was that they should be placed in an act. The coalition believes that the government's proposal is unacceptable. If major measures are to be established in an act then those measures should actually be stated in the act and not left to regulations. The effect of leaving it to regulation is that we will be given absolutely no idea of the structure of this tuition assurance scheme. We do not know who will be appointed. A levy is to be placed on all the providers and yet we do not know what this levy is, what amount it will be and how it will be charged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another problem in that originally in 1991 this legislation was to be a temporary measure and was to be rolled back when the states had brought in their own regulations. What we have with this tuition assurance scheme is a permanent centralised system of tuition assurance, which means that the federal legislation must stay in place. I would remind members of the Senate that this sort of material should be administered at the state level. Yet, the government, again, is becoming more intrusive than it need be by adopting a centrally regulated system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has seen the need to bring in a trust account. The committee recommended that prepaid student funds be placed in a formal trust account. The government's response in the bill is that notified trust accounts will be required for course moneys so that student funds are separated from the provider's capital and from the liquidator. We are glad that the government has seen the need for the trust account, but the committee, and the coalition in particular, regrets that the government has failed to implement the committee's recommendation properly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the strangest things about the trust account is that the government has again left a large part of it to regulation. The government carried out a fair bit of consultation with the industry. The two major areas of the industry finally agreed that there should be a 45 per cent draw down limit at the commencement of a course to the funds that the students place in the trust accounts. The committee found that acceptable. However, we find it rather strange that the government has not put this agreed specification of a 45 per cent draw down into the legislation. If it is agreed, then why not put it in the legislation? Yet again, the government has left it to regulation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the main features of the original bill was the need for a sunset clause. The legislative framework was put in place because the states across Australia did not really have their act together in this area. The whole idea was that as the States did get their act together, the measures in this bill would be rolled back. The government has decided to eliminate the sunset clause. It wants this legislation to stay in place permanently. The government is doing this despite the evidence that was given at the hearings that we held and despite the fact that all parties&mdash;the Democrats, the Liberals, the Nationals and Labor&mdash;agree that we should have a sunset clause. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, we are concerned about a number of major aspects of this bill. We are concerned about the government's arrogant response to a unanimous report. The government is totally ignoring not only the recommendations of the committee but also the views of the industry. What is the purpose of having a Senate committee that holds major hearings involving the major providers when the government just ignores the considered unanimous report that it has brought down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point of concern is the fact that the act contains so little detail and that the government is leaving so much to regulation. We consider this to be extremely dangerous. The third point that worries us considerably is that the legislation does not contain a sunset clause. We believe that the bill should contain a sunset clause if the spirit and intention of the original legislation to have these measures operate at a state level are to be fulfilled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet again, the parliament is being asked to support a scheme which is trying to hit an ant sized problem with a sledgehammer. This has been sparked by the collapse of only one college. The legislation will have the effect of putting up costs in the industry. I would recommend very strongly to the Senate, in the interests of one of our major export industries&mdash;heaven knows, we need as many as we can get&mdash;that this legislation should be rejected by the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA>A problem was experienced in Estimates Committee F which could present itself to other estimates committees.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will spell out the problem briefly. The committee experienced difficulty with one aspect of the new procedures. Paragraph 3 of the Senate's orders requires senators to lodge notices of matters for discussion at the supplementary meetings of an estimates committee not less than three days before the day fixed by the committee for the commencement of supplementary meetings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After consulting with Senator Sibraa and Senator Bolkus, the two ministers concerned, about their availability to attend a supplementary meeting, the committee had previously scheduled one day of hearings for each of their respective portfolio responsibilities 14 days apart. However, the practical effect of paragraph 3 of the Senate's order was that senators would have been required to lodge notices of matters to be raised at the second supplementary meeting at least 17 days earlier. In these circumstances, the committee opted to commence its supplementary meetings on the second date and, fortunately, both Senator Sibraa and Senator Bolkus were available to attend the supplementary hearings on that day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The intent of the Senate order was to provide at least three days notice to ministers and officials of the matters to be discussed at the supplementary meetings. The committee believes that the intent of the Senate's order could be met in circumstances where discussion of different portfolios is scheduled for different dates by varying the order to enable notices of matters to be given not less than three days before the first day of hearing of a particular portfolio. The committee therefore recommends that the Procedure Committee give consideration to this issue. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the effect of the amendment before the Senate.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think they would even pretend to know how to run a satellite licence raffle. Then, of course, it is likely that there will be a public float to try to raise the purchase price of this licence. Indeed, Australis has announced that it is very interested and is in the process of hoping to acquire the B licence from Lenfest which actually put up the money for New World. What will then happen, it appears, is that there will be a public float to try to recoup that outlay.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first issue it raises is that, if all the moneys are being put up in the first instance by an American company, one would have thought that, on the face of it, that contravenes the foreign ownership rule which says that one cannot have more than a 20 per cent interest in the licence. On the face of it, there is an immediate problem for the ABA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it would seem that the ABA is more concerned to simply go through the motions in terms of vetting the new directors of New World, whoever they may be. But, of course, once there is a public float, what we will probably find is that there will be an entirely new set of shareholders and directors. Indeed, it is quite possible that, if they are going to raise $138 million on the market, absolute ownership of a company whose market capitalisation is less than half that amount could be available to someone who is determined to acquire the lion's share of equity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In those circumstances it is conceivable that the Packer-Murdoch-Telecom consortium could come in once again, buy up those shares on the open market and find itself in control of licence B. In that case, we would have to have yet another inquiry by the TPC into the anti-monopoly implications, under section 50 of the Trade Practices Act, to consider whether there has been a substantial lessening of competition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it is not hard to imagine that there will be any number of contortions which will have to be gone through before this farce finally plays itself out. Indeed, my understanding is that, although the rules require the ABA and the TPC to give the licence a tick in the first instance, once it is issued and the service is up and running, if there is then a change in the ownership structure, there is no automatic power to intervene. The TPC may have a discretion in all instances to monitor changes in competition, but I am not sure that there is any obvious and automatic power for the ABA to intervene to assess the suitability of subsequent owners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also seems that, with the way the process has worked to date, the TPC is concerned that, if it gives a tick prior to the expiration of the 45-day period, there could be a change which it has not taken account of. So in every instance it will wait until the very last day so that it can close off the matter. That, of course, is yet another reason why this process will take much longer than it needs to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not know who the next in line is for the A licence. If one goes back six months&mdash;and one would have to go back more than that&mdash;to when Mr Beddall made his first announcement with a great flourish, one recalls that he trumpeted the names of both the A and B successful bidders and claimed that this heralded a new era in telecommunications. I suppose that it has in a sense, but it has been a very sorry one to date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since that time, the government has been badly burnt to the point where it now does not reveal the names of the successful bidders. The government now waits to see whether the deposit has been paid and then it announces it&mdash;for purely damage control reasons. There is nothing in the act that says one can or cannot. In fact, the government has done both, so either one can do both or it has acted illegally in one or other instance. The fact is that the government could disclose who is next in line, but it will not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we do not know, for example, whether UCOM, having just fallen over, is next in line for the A licence. If it managed to dredge up the deposit, and we had to wait another 30 plus 45 days perhaps, it might be next in line again. I think what is more likely to happen, the way things are moving, is that the B licence could well be up and running in the not too distance future and nobody will be interested in the A licence, because the A licence is limited to new entrants into the market and essentially Australian entrants. That is designed to provide a measure of protection but it is likely to ensure that it is just not possible for any serious international players to be involved in the process. As a result, it is likely, I think, from the way things are looking at the moment, that there might not even be an A licence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That has come about entirely because of the ineptitude and incompetence of both ministers&mdash;Beddall and Collins. This process could have been under way 12 months ago if there had been sensible legislation in the first instance; if, for example, the government had accepted our suggestion, made months ago now, that once the first bid had defaulted all remaining bids should be put on the table, disclosed, and accompanied by deposits. Then we would not have had multiple bidders because they would not have put up millions of dollars for a series of bids; they would have put up a deposit for their best bid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the government did not accept that advice&mdash;and that advice did not come just from us, of course; it came from the industry. So, again, the government is the architect of its own misfortune to the point where I think the window of opportunity is rapidly closing. We are in a situation where we are most unlikely to be regarded as a serious place to locate high technology enterprises, most unlikely to be anything other than a recipient of Asian services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a big question mark over what Mr Murdoch is likely to do once he gets the Star television satellite up and running. I would have thought that we would be almost acting like King Canute if we were going to try to stop that happening. Mr Beddall talked bravely about $2 million fines being payable if one happens to have a receiver in the backyard which is pointed in the wrong direction. But realistically, of course, there is nothing that the government will be able to do if someone is determined to beam signals in from an external satellite. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In those circumstances, I think there are very real doubts about the process to a point where I think it is about time that the government woke up to the fact that Senator Collins has absolutely washed his hands of communications. I think, quite understandably, he lost his nerve months ago after the hiding he took over the original inquiry. I would have thought that, if the government had any sense at all, at the next ministerial reshuffle Senator Collins, if he manages to hang on at all, at the very least ought to end up with just transport and let someone else look after communications. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the appropriation bills and to draw to the attention of the Senate a number of rather disturbing trends in the Department of Employment, Education and Training, as revealed by Estimates Committee E. I think one of the most disturbing things is the way in which this department has in seven years, over the years of Dawkinisation&mdash;now called Beazleyisation in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS> this morning&mdash;increasingly intruded on the autonomy of universities, manipulating the directions of universities, often in quite inappropriate ways, and creating an enormous amount of paperwork, including in one instance 1.6 kilograms of paper from the University of Melbourne to fulfil the requirements of one of DEET's requests. Having collected all this enormous amount of data, it did not then have the people to process and make much sense of it. Certainly, one of the huge complaints of universities around the country is that, having gone through this whole time wasting exercise in many cases, useful information that they could use in their planning is not fed back to them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People in DEET seem to dream up new schemes with which they can waste the time of universities, which are there basically for two functions; that is, teaching and research. This highly intrusive department that employs 17,000 people&mdash;and what they do with their time, I think, should be thoroughly investigated&mdash;interferes in the smooth workings of our current university system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">DEET's latest hare-brained scheme is called quality assurance. This program in the budget involves $76 million. This is not 76 million new dollars, I hasten to add. This is creamed off the top of the system and reallocated into the system on the basis of something called quality assurance. I am sure that most of the students around the nation&mdash;and certainly many of the academics&mdash;must think the whole notion of quality assurance with respect to this government and its role in the university system is a great joke, because what has happened in the huge expansion of student numbers in the last seven years is that the government has not put in the resources that are needed to back the expansion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, what we have occurring is the exact opposite of quality assurance. What we have is a great increase in student numbers in classes; a very severe and savage decline in the types of services and also the quality of the services provided by the libraries in the universities simply because of the lack of resources; building infrastructure running down; and research infrastructure, the basic equipment needed to support world class research, also running down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How do we fix this problem? Instead of putting real resources into the system, you devise something called quality assurance&mdash;sounds great!&mdash;and take the money that is already there and redistribute it to institutions that can demonstrate quality. How does one demonstrate quality in education? This is one of the most perplexing areas in the whole educational debate. We have had many researchers over about 50 years trying to work out what is quality and how to measure it. This government thinks it can do this at the drop of a hat.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But when we question the government on how it will measure quality, it comes up with a scheme whereby each particular university measures its own quality. This is the antithesis of good research methodology because what we would have is 36 universities with 36 different measuring instruments that have a different nature and different scales and which measure different sorts of things. DEET, in its great wisdom, will then measure these things one against the other. The common analogy in research is that that is comparing apples with oranges and pears with kiwi fruit. One cannot actually do that. One cannot come up with any valid conclusion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The one bit of information that we do have about what will come out of all of this is that half of the universities of this country will get more resources and about half of the universities will get less. It will not be valid, because we cannot measure quality in research, and quality in teaching, and quality in other things that universities do in a very valid way. I suspect that it will be the cleverest university in terms of the way in which it fills out the forms and backs up its submission. I think we will find, yet again, the universities wasting a large sum of money to fulfil a requirement of DEET. That is not the only type of waste that is going on in the university system at the moment, and it certainly is not the only mirage that the government is trying to create about the quality of higher education in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the government discovered that there were 50,000 more students wanting to get into universities than there were places, it said, `How are we going to fix this? Let's create a new scheme that we will call open learning'. Again, this is an approach through which the government is trying to seem like it is solving a problem. The new approach to open learning came about very hastily some nine months before the election last year. All of a sudden we discovered that, yet again, DEET was turning upside down a system that had been developing quite nicely over the previous 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government, in one of its better policy decisions in the 1980s, created in this nation 10 distance education centres, known as DECs, to centralise the provision of distance education. It was a great idea. But now what it is proposing to do&mdash;and, indeed, is well on the way to doing&mdash;is focus this effort on one university, with the other universities acting as satellites to Monash University. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This program, to which in the budget the government has devoted $52 million over the 1993-95 period, has the effect of draining resources from the smaller universities into the larger universities, particularly Monash. If they want to stay in the game, they have to provide courses and units through Monash. In terms of economies of scale, using technologies such as satellites in the production of resources, in certain ways on the surface it may seem like a good idea. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What Monash is doing, however, is saying that it can provide this service at $300 per semester unit. The bad news for the supporting institutions is that they do not get the whole $300. Monash takes an administrative fee off the top, so they only get a bit less than $200. I have taught in this area and talked to a lot of experts in the area. No-one says that these units can be taught for $300. No-one believes that those sorts of resources can deliver quality in terms of higher education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose, at its very basic, an open learning course could be provided by sending people a sheet of paper with a reading list on it. It does not cost very much to do that. Then again, there is not much quality in the course either. In effect, there is a very direct trade-off in open learning between the money that is spent on it and the quality received. All the experts say that open learning cannot be provided for any less a cost than on-campus learning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the government has created is a great charade. It says it is trying to provide for the gap of people who want to get into a university and cannot get in by creating this marvellous system called open learning. I remind members of the Senate that what it will do, at $300 a unit, is decrease the quality considerably. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In two years of questioning DEET in the estimates committees, no-one there&mdash;and, during my visit to Monash, no-one at Monash&mdash;could come up with any plausible explanation of how to make up the gap between the $300 and the real estimate of $800 to $1,200, depending on the type of course, that it costs to run these sorts of courses. Yet again we have the government being highly intrusive on the autonomy of universities, dismantling an excellent system that has been devised over the last 10 years and creating what is second-rate education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Probably the most disturbing thing to come out of the estimates in terms of what the universities are doing concerns research infrastructure. Mr Dawkins turned the universities upside down by creating what he called the national unified system and abolishing the original colleges of advanced education and institutes of technology. This program was to create 36 universities in Australia. What the government has discovered all of a sudden is that it really is not prepared to devote the resources to this problem that need to be devoted to it. Therefore, it has said, `We cannot have all these institutions carrying out research. We will, in effect, recreate the binary system'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1989 the government turned the system upside down to create a unified national system. Now it is dismantling it. It is not being up-front and telling us that it is dismantling it. Through a whole lot of smokescreens, it is saying, `Institutions have a right to fulfil their own mission statements'. That is a great idea, but when we get below the smog we see that it really means that in a resource starved situation a lot of institutions will give up research because the government is tilting the way it gives money for research away from the new smaller universities and back towards what some people call the big seven. The big seven, I remind the Senate, already consume two-thirds of the research dollars that are available in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the current system that is proposed in the budget will do over the next few years is suck resources for research out of the smaller universities&mdash;so they will go back to being basically teaching institutions&mdash;and put them into the bosom of the big seven institutions. So they have two-thirds of the money and they are going to get even more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a tragedy because people in those institutions&mdash;the new smaller universities&mdash;have turned their lives and their approach to tertiary education upside down by getting higher qualifications and moving into research; having done all that, they will find the rug pulled out from under them and they will be back to where they were before. What a highly disruptive process to go through&mdash;and it is all through the very poor planning of this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another way that the government is going to draw resources out of these smaller regional institutions is through the abolition of certain research support it put in after the abolition of the binary system&mdash;something called mechanism B, which provided the newer universities with extra research support. That will finish next year, after being in operation for only five years. All the experts in the field tell me that it will take about 20 years to make this transition properly and at least 10 in the case of most universities. Five is totally inadequate. It is again undermining a lot of the smaller regional universities with this stop-start approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a great pity that newer universities in my state such as the University of Western Sydney&mdash;which we have visited&mdash;which is developing an excellent research track record, and the Northern Rivers campus of the University of New England, which has a whole lot of new innovative approaches to research and teaching, will have the rug pulled out from under them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude with what I believe is the most disturbing thing of all in the whole budgetary process that we have been through with the Department of Employment, Education and Training. For the third year running, this department, which spends $11 billion of taxpayers' money and employs 17,000 people, has had the Auditor-General express considerable concern about the way in which it manages its financial affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General is satisfied in the case of student assistance, Abstudy and Austudy, that those payments are being made correctly and that the relevant amounts are materially correct. But for the third year in a row, universities have said that recipients were paid without valid certification. If the government is going to be running a budget of that huge amount, surely, with 17,000 people, there are some people there who can train people how to carry out their financial administration properly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that DEET must address the concern which has been expressed for three years running very quickly to make sure in the minds of the public that public moneys are being spent correctly. Most importantly, of all the different ways I have indicated that this very intrusive department has interfered with the successful running of many universities and reduced their level of autonomy considerably, this process must be stopped and reversed. If our universities are to achieve their potential, they need autonomy and responsibility, but probably most important of all, they need the resource base to deliver real excellence in education and not the sham excellence that has been put up by many of the programs developed by DEET. </PARA>

I plan to concentrate my remarks on the Loan Bill and my colleague Senator Campbell will be dealing with specific matters relating to the states grants bill. The Loan Bill 1993 is designed to finance the prospective deficit in the consolidated revenue fund. The minister, in his second reading speech, described the bill as a machinery bill. However, I would have to say that any senator or member who did not have a PhD in public finance would gain little from the minister's second reading speech&mdash;a very brief one, I might say&mdash;about the nature of this bill or its significance to the community.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister says that the bill provides authority for the Loan Fund to meet defence expenditures. What on earth does that mean? Does that mean that all of our defence expenditures are financed by this Loan Bill? I suspect that this would raise a few hackles at least in some sections of this chamber. Indeed, for those that are interested in financial rectitude it would certainly raise hackles of a different nature. What is not explained by the minister is that this requirement is included in the bill as an administrative convenience since borrowings for defence purposes do not require the approval of the Australian Loan Council. </PARA>

This shows the massive increases which have occurred over the last three years, including this year. The zero loan fund raisings was in large part due to the considerable tax raising capacities of Mr Keating. I have been critical of Mr Keating across a whole range of areas, but if the measure of the man is his capacity to increase taxes on the Australian taxpayer, then Mr Keating has certainly achieved his target. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I watched our leader tonight. I thought to myself, `How more closely in touch with mainstream Australian values is Dr Hewson compared to Mr Keating'. The fact of the matter is that those opposite have a Prime Minister who has lost touch with not only the traditional base of his party, as Senator Collins would know, but also mainstream Australia. There is no more fundamental demonstration of that than the Mabo bill which is being brought before this parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have pointed out, the loan raisings in this bill are significant and cause concern to any Australian taxpayer who is informed about the nature of this so-called machinery bill. The deficit which was predicted this year in another high taxing, big spending budget by Mr Keating is some $16 billion. To a certain extent, this is reflected in the sums required to be raised under the Loan Bill 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But even the $16 billion that the government projects is really a conjuring trick. Taking into account the asset sales, the Reserve Bank profits, the pillaging of government enterprises and, in recent years, the repayments of state debt, the figure is significantly larger than $16 billion. These various factors suggest that the real deficit is now reaching well over $20 billion. It is food for thought to consider that, if we add these one-off arrangements, the real deficit this year will be higher as a percentage of gross domestic product than even in the Whitlam years and the famous record 1975-76 deficit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of other things can be interpreted from these figures. Most importantly, I suspect that they are a sign of the complete collapse of the government's will to cut general spending and, in particular, to enact meaningful economic reform. As a number of observers have correctly interpreted, the Prime Minister has lost the reformist's zeal. This government lied its way into office without any program. Now that it is in office, it is unsure what it can do. It is blocked in every area of meaningful reform by the trade union movement and the special interest groups which support it. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Kernot, who will be speaking after me, may reflect on the industrial relations bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The State Grants (General Purpose) Bill gives effect to the arrangements agreed to at the July Premiers Conference and Loans Council meeting for grants to the states for the 1993-94 year. As Senator Kemp said, the bill authorises payments of general revenue grants, including financial assistance grants, arterial road funding and special revenue measures. The total amount of assistance provided by the bill is estimated to be $14.4 billion in 1993-94.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The necessity for parliament to approve this legislation is obvious. Without the annual cap in hand performance of the premiers and without the begrudging transfer of huge sums of money from the federal to the state level of government, the federal system in this country would collapse. In many respects this is because of the gross imbalance between the revenue raising powers of the federal government and the spending needs of the states. In 1992-93 state and local governments collected 33 per cent of government revenue in this country, but accounted for 48 per cent of total government expenditure. About 40 per cent of all state revenue comes from federal grants, and this raises the key question that federal grants play in state budgets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Figures show that the federal government over the last decade has required far greater expenditure constraints from the states than from its own sources. The University of New South Wales estimates that, in the seven financial years from 1985 to 1992, the level of financial assistance from the Commonwealth to other levels of government fell by 18.9 per cent in real terms. When one takes into account population growth on a per capita basis, the real cuts were even more severe. Federal government outlays were not required to be cut by amounts anywhere near this magnitude. Indeed, they grew in real terms. In 1991, faced with a collapsing revenue base, the premiers, as part of the then in vogue new federalism debate, persuaded the federal government to agree to guarantee that financial assistance grants would not be reduced in real terms for three years. The government has stuck to this commitment and the bill before us tonight marks the last of those three years of maintained grants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The forward estimates in the budget papers suggest that the grants will continue to be maintained through to 1996-97 in real terms. That remains to be seen. I think there is a bit of a question mark over the future. Treasurer Dawkins has set up a committee headed by the good old Industry Commission&mdash;this is the revamped one, the new John Dawkins Industry Commission&mdash;to pursue an additional $3 billion in state government budget savings by forcing each of the six states to reduce their levels of services through benchmarking to that of the lowest serviced state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sting is in the various budget papers and the regular lectures from Canberra to the states on their reluctance to increase their own taxes. This ignores the fact that state taxes tend to be highly regressive. Most state taxes take the form of flat fees or levies which do not take into account capacity to pay. By far the largest single state tax is payroll tax, which is frequently cited by business as a major disincentive to employing more people. So what the federal government has been telling the states is to collect more regressive taxes and more taxes on employment. I do not think that in the middle of a recession&mdash;or at any time&mdash;that is good public policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In all of this debate about figures we can lose site of the real issue. I think the real issue is that at the moment, under our federal system, states deliver many of the basic services to the community&mdash;services such as education, hospitals, social services, roads and so forth. I honestly think that we should take the opportunity between now and the end of this century to examine the appropriate powers of the different levels of government in this country, because something is not working. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, at the moment states have a particular role. They are required to fund their services from a declining pool of federal funds and from a narrow and regressive tax base. The result has been two-fold: funding of basic services has been stretched to the bone and state budget deficits, with the exception of Queensland, have risen significantly. Employment in the state budget sector has been dramatically pared back over the last decade as Canberra has attempted to shift its budgetary problems to the states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier in the week I met with representatives of the public sector unions. They provided me with figures which show that in the three years from 1991 to 1994 more than 145,000 jobs will have disappeared from the state public sectors. Job cuts of that magnitude in the middle of a recession are really quite staggering. The Keating government, aided and abetted by state governments of both political persuasions around the country, have deliberately increased unemployment by reducing by an excessive amount&mdash;not an reasonable amount, an excessive amount&mdash;the number of government jobs. To make matters worse, they have borrowed hundreds of millions of dollars to pay for redundancy packages. So we have been adding to our national debt to increase unemployment. </PARA>

Productivity, however, should be measured against better quality standards delivering better services. I do not think that the loss of 145,000 jobs can be called an efficiency measure. It can be called slash and burn, but finetuning productivity it certainly is not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> What I am increasingly concerned about is that a decade of Canberra enforced cutbacks on state governments is now seriously affecting the ability of the states to deliver basic services. Take education. Surveys by the Australian Teachers' Union have shown that in the last four years class sizes right across Australia are starting to rise. For example, almost half of early childhood classes now have more than 25 students, up by a third from four years ago. The proportion of senior secondary classes with more than 25 students has almost doubled. The worst increases have been in Victoria. With class sizes rising and subject choices falling, teachers are now noticing a marked decline in school retention rates, particularly in Victoria's western suburbs. Yet the redundancy packages which fuelled the fall in teacher numbers in western Melbourne, Labor's so-called heartland, have been funded willingly by the Keating government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Welfare services have been even more stretched at the state level. We all know that welfare spending is usually the first area to be cut by the states because their clients are least able to lobby and to defend their interests. Data from the Commonwealth Grants Commission shows that in the four years to 1992, spending on state welfare programs per capita fell in real terms in five of the six states. In Queensland per capita welfare expenditure has actually fallen by an incredible 35 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The gross inadequacy of current state welfare services is highlighted by the two incisive reports by Brian Burdekin, one into mental illness and one into homelessness. In both reports he identified a gross inadequacy in back-up and support services for two groups least able to fend for themselves. The mental health report exposed the failure of the deinstitutionalisation program. Mentally ill patients have been thrown out into the community with virtually no back-up, and they simply cannot cope. Something like 50 to 70 per cent of the overnight stays at St Vincent de Paul hostels are now estimated to be mentally ill people who cannot fend for themselves in the community. Burdekin's youth homelessness report displayed a similar unmet need for community services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We like Australia to do well. We like Australia to be the best at things. Well, Australia has the highest teenage suicide rate in the industrialised world. This can only be seen as a cry for help from a troubled generation. Yet the Burdekin report concludes that there is an overwhelming picture of inadequate funding, inadequate training, inadequate in-patient care, inadequate coordination between agencies, research and data collection and an inadequate commitment to the establishment of prevention and intervention services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Youth suicide and suicide attempts have increased alarmingly over the past 20 years. This risk is exacerbated for rural youth, particularly young males, young prisoners and homeless youth. There is a desperate shortage of child and adolescent psychiatric services, despite the fact that 10 to 15 per cent of children and adolescents show significant psychiatric disturbance and one per cent of them need urgent treatment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For young people with acute adolescent problems there are around 30 beds in New South Wales and Victoria, virtually none in Queensland, none in the public sector in South Australia and none in Western Australia. According to Mr Burdekin, there are serious deficiencies in even the most basic services for young people and state and federal budget priorities have been identified as the most fundamental problems. I will say that again: state and federal budget priorities have been identified as the most fundamental problems. One witness stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the 1990-91 Victorian Budget, resources allocated to child and adolescent health services were reduced. One facility was actually closed, and it was the only facility in the State which provided an inpatient service to the late adolescent group aged 16-20. Other facilities had staffing and general running cost cuts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . These cuts have been made worse by the reduction in other services for children and adolescents in general health, education, welfare.</PARA>
<PARA>An immediate funding boost for state and regional mental health care for young people is imperative to ensure appropriately trained staff, improved administration, community crisis services, effective in-patient services and out-patient treatment, as well as suitable adolescent accommodation, education, employment and training, and social and recreational activities for those recovering from mental illness. Otherwise, as Burdekin recognises:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The human rights of disturbed and at-risk young Australians are being seriously denied by such glaring omissions, with often tragic consequences for the individuals and families involved.</PARA>
<PARA>Another report by Justice Fogarty into Victorian child protection services showed that resources are now so sparse that 56 per cent of cases reported could not be followed up for over a week&mdash;key delays at a key time in 56 per cent of cases. Fogarty noted that the state child protection service had virtually abandoned the care of adolescents, due largely to budget constraints. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The state run public hospital system is having difficulty coping with demand as well. The proportion of health expenditure funded by the public sector decreased from 71.8 per cent in 1984-85 to 68 per cent in 1991-92. This decrease is entirely due to a fall in the Commonwealth proportion of health funding. For example, it has meant in Queensland&mdash;a state with an exploding population&mdash;some 2,000 jobs disappearing last year from the public health system in the middle of a massive health budgetary crisis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are just some of the effects of the cutting of 145,000 jobs from the state public sector. I think the policy is crazy. True, the public sector needs to aim for the highest possible level of efficiency, but not at the price of withdrawing services from the mentally ill, from disadvantaged youth and from other groups who simply are unable to defend their interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Public sector unions have raised what I think is an excellent suggestion for the Prime Minister's unemployment working party. They have argued that priority to job creation should be given to work in the community sector. Many of our pool of 982,000 unemployed have been storing life experience skills which could easily be put to good use in providing support services. Any attempt to reverse the growing disparity between demand for community services and the supply and delivery of those services must be a step in the right direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The necessity for this bill to be passed highlights the inadequacies of the Australian federal system. There are huge inadequacies. I just wish that we as a nation would grapple honestly and intelligently with them, instead of going on, year after year, knowing where the problems are and doing nothing about them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have called for an extension of the current debate about the constitution to include the issue of the role of the states and the appropriate levels of power of our existing three tiers of government. But before that debate continues, we need to seriously address the accumulating evidence that Canberra has been exporting its budgetary problems to the states. This is now affecting the delivery of basic government services and forcing increasing reliance on highly regressive taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is time that the interplay between the fiscal policies of the federal government and the fiscal policies of the states was properly debated. The cap in hand, heart on sleeve premiers conferences have become a joke. They have failed to resolve the problem since World War II. It will require a strong statement by the community that enough is enough before the bureaucrats and then politicians get out of their trenches, abandon the posturing and start talking rationally.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Some of the points that Senator Kernot made were quite valid, including the point that this government has, as an excuse for the hard work with the expenditure review committees, wound down the general purpose grants to the states. Particularly since Senator Walsh left the ministry for finance, the government has been slashing states' general purpose grants as a proportion of gross domestic product in substitution for the hard work of better economic management at the federal level, particularly better public administration at the federal level.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Specifically in terms of general funding, when Malcolm Fraser left power in early 1983, the Commonwealth's own purpose outlays as a proportion of GDP were 18.9 per cent; this year, on the government's own estimates, those own purpose outlays will be in the vicinity of 20 per cent. As a proportion of GDP, the Commonwealth's own outlays will have  significantly increased over the last 10 years. That is something that I know former Senator Peter Walsh is very upset about&mdash;quite genuinely so and quite justifiably so. Of course, this situation is in contradiction to the government's own rhetoric about being frugal when it comes to Commonwealth spending. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have some very fine examples on the micro scale of why that occurs. Something like $60 million has been handed out in the past five years by the various ministers for sports in the form of sporting grants on the fundamental criteria that those who live in a marginal Labor seat need sporting facilities, and those who live in a marginal Liberal seat or a Liberal seat do not need sporting facilities. They are the fundamental criteria for spending federal taxpayers' money that have seen the federal government's budget blow out. On an even more micro level, the taxpayers of Australia would be more concerned about spending thousands upon thousands of dollars on sketches of birds to put on the cabinet wall, if not imported rainforest timber tables at the Lodge and $24,000 chairs for the Prime Minister to sit on&mdash;that is, when he is not sleepless in Seattle. </PARA>

At the same time, as Senator Kernot pointed out in a most eloquent speech, the state's own general purpose grants have been slashed as a proportion of GDP from 9.6 per cent to 7.3 per cent. The coalition is particularly concerned that when one slashes state funding in this way someone else misses out. Either the states have to put up their own taxes or people miss out on services. From her own perspective, I think Senator Kernot has pointed that out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the areas of the States Grants (General Purposes) Bill that the opposition is particularly concerned about is what the Treasurer said in relation to the funding for states which allow students the freedom to join or not to join unions on campus. I was heartened to hear Senator Kernot say that she was concerned about the slashing of state funding. She would also be concerned that in clause 20 of this bill there is a measure that would ensure that if a state government chose to legislate to allow individual young Australians the choice to decide of their own free will whether or not to join a student association then the Commonwealth would cut the general purpose funding to the state by, in Western Australia's case, up to $5 million or more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the case in Western Australia because we are one of the few states that has before its legislature a bill to allow individuals to make a decision whether or not to join a student association. So the threat of a further funding cut of millions of dollars hangs over my state of Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Kernot said in her speech, if millions of dollars is cut from a state's funding that money has to be either found through increases in state taxes&mdash;such as increases in car registrations, water rates or any other forms of revenue raising a state may have&mdash;or the state is forced to cut funding to people in need. It would have to cut its assistance to crippled children, handicapped people, people in need, disadvantaged Aboriginal communities and so on. The $5 million plus that could be cut away from Western Australia as a result of this government's ideological obsession with ensuring that individual Australians do not have the freedom to choose whether or not to join an association means that those people in the state in real need will miss out on state funding or members of the general community will have their car registration fees, water rates or electricity charges put up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite often people in the Liberal Party are accused of having ideological obsessions. But I must say that this government has ideological obsessions if it is prepared to go to the lengths that it has done to ensure that students leaving secondary school and moving to university campuses are forced to join an association against their will. This federal government is actually prepared to go to the lengths of chopping off general purpose funding to a state government, which is available to every other state government, because that state government wants to comply with article 20 of the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights and it wants to allow people the freedom to choose whether or not to join an association.

The Labor Party has the choice to decide whether the $5 million plus blackmail over the state of Western Australia and any other state that chooses to give Australian citizens the choice of whether or not to join an association is a matter of ideological obsession or pure patronage of student unions. The National Union of Students continues to actively support the Australian Labor Party when it comes to federal elections. I think even the National Union of Students should start to wonder about the support it gives to the Australian Labor Party when it sees the way it has been legged over in the last election in relation to the handling of funding of student contributions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The crucial issue before us when it comes to voluntary student unionism is this federal government's blatant intervention in relation to either blackmailing or extorting out of state governments a commitment not to allow individual Australian citizens the freedom to make their own choice as to whether or not to join an association. Under the regime which is likely to occur in Western Australia, because of legislation which is before our parliament at the moment, students enrolling at a university will be able to make the decision of their own free will whether or not to join an association. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is probably a concept which is totally contrary to the principles of honourable senators opposite. This is a very strange concept for those opposite because people going to a university can have a choice whether or not to join a guild or a student association. It is hard for Senator Chris Evans to come to grips with the concept of a free sensible young Australian going to a university campus and being excited by the concept of learning and excited by the concept of moving into the world. The Labor Party in Canberra cannot come to grips with the concept that those students may have to make a decision of their own free will. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put it to the Senate that in this brave new world of freedom of association, where young students may make a decision of their own free will, student associations and guilds in Western Australia will do all sorts of things to convince students that it is a very good idea to be a member of their association or guild. They will offer them discounts at student bookshops, student sporting facilities and, dare I say it, student taverns. Other businesses in the vicinity of the university will offer people inducements to join the association. The local privately owned coffee shop might say, `We will give any member of the student guild at UWA, University of Western Australia, a 10 per cent discount on cappuccinos.' Furthermore, student associations will be able to offer inducements to students to join their associations by their pure performance, their performance in sticking up for students' rights and looking after the interests of their students. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the WA government passes its legislation and people have the freedom to choose whether or not to join an association, the guilds and the student associations will have an enormous incentive to perform very well to ensure they have a lot of members, they represent the broad student body and provide better services. This government and the Labor Party senators opposite are ensuring that if the student guilds do not attract members then they are paid money firstly by the commonwealth taxpayer and then by the state taxpayer of Western Australia. The government is saying that it will pay the universities and student unions a subsidy to make up for what they do not collect in student membership revenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What this creates is a perverse incentive to ensure that student unions, associations and guilds perform very badly. The worse they get the more money they get. The worse the guild is and the more unrepresentative it is, the more money this government ensures the Western Australian taxpayers pay to subsidise that guild. That is why the coalition will vote against clause 20 of this bill so that it is defeated. If that clause of the bill is not defeated then we will vote against this blackmail section of the bill which will extort the state of Western Australia and any other state that decides it wants to legislate for freedom for young Australians to make a choice of their own free will whether or not to join an association. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not detain the Senate for too much longer. A major principle at stake is clause 20 of the States Grants (General Purposes) Bill 1993. The principle is whether or not people should have the right to choose to join an association. I personally believe that getting involved in associations is a very good thing for the community, but I think it is a particularly bad thing when a government compels someone to join an association.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a very fundamental and important difference between the philosophies and principles of the coalition, particularly of the Liberal Party, and the Australian Labor Party. We believe fervently in the rights of individuals to make decisions for themselves in their own interests. Young Australians who go to university campuses at the age of 17 or 18 should be allowed to make a decision of their own free will as to whether to join a student association. They should equally be allowed to make a decision not to join that association. The student association and the student union should be able to prove to those people whether or not membership of that association is worth while and important. As long as those student associations are worthwhile associations, a majority of students will join them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Labor Party is making a fundamental mistake in compelling students to join unions. It is making an even further fundamental mistake&mdash;I particularly appeal to the Democrats in this&mdash;if we create a massive taxpayer funded inducement for student unions and student guilds not to perform in the eyes of their members. If student guilds are paid enormous amounts of taxpayers' money, if they are absolutely hopeless, if they do not represent the interests of their members and if they do not perform in the eyes of their members, we will ensure the destruction of student unions on Australian campuses. That would be entirely regrettable to the Liberal Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We would like to see strong student associations. We would like to see vigorous democratic elections on student campuses. We would quite genuinely like to see a battle of ideas on campuses. We would like to see the young potential future members of the Australian Labor Party battling ideas out in the forums of campuses with young potential future members of the progressive conservative side of politics, having active debates and fighting student union elections&mdash;but on campuses where people have the freedom of choice as to whether or not to join an association. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put those views before the Senate quite genuinely. People have accused the Western Australian government of trying to abolish student unions and cutting off the source of funds to Labor Party controlled unions. I and many people who have been involved in the voluntary student unionism debate&mdash;I am sure I speak on behalf of Senator Kemp as well&mdash;would like to see active student unions on campuses right across Australia. We do not think imposing a form of blackmail and extortion upon a state government by cutting off general purpose grants to states is a way of encouraging the health and vigour of student associations on campuses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a fundamental difference between those who sit opposite and those on our side. Members of the Australian Labor Party believe in telling Australians that they are not capable of making a free choice when it comes to joining an association. They say to them that they must join the association. We think that the dignity, pride and purpose in life of all Australians can only be enhanced by them being given the sorts of fundamental freedoms that the United Nations declaration enshrines to ensure that they have genuine freedom of choice. If a maturing young adult cannot be exposed to making a decision as to whether or not to join an association, we need to wonder about the sorts of choices the Australian Labor Party would like to see Australian citizens actually have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is where we are coming from. It is a quite simple proposition. The simple proposition is whether we allow Australian citizens the choice to either join or not join an association. We think it is a fundamental human right which, if one was born in Australia, one should have. The Australian Labor Party wants to take that right away. It also wants to ensure that not only a state government that seeks to legislate for that right is financially impaired but also the students and every single person living in that state are financially impaired. The coalition will be opposing clause 20. If clause 20 is not struck out by a majority of votes in the Senate, we will proudly vote against this grants bill generally. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The States Grants (General Purposes) Bill 1993 gives effect to arrangements arising from the Premiers Conference and the Loan Council meetings of 5 July of this year whereby the Commonwealth and the states agreed on revenue grants and general purpose capital grants for this current financial year. I wish to talk about two major issues that have been with us for quite some time with regard to the financial relationship between the Commonwealth and the states. The first issue goes by the terrible name of vertical fiscal imbalance and the second issue relates to disclosure of financial status of the governments and accrual accounting.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to vertical fiscal imbalance, Australia's federal arrangements are about the most imbalanced in the world. The Commonwealth currently collects 79 per cent of tax revenue and spends 51 per cent of total outlays. The states and territories collect 17 per cent of tax revenue and spend 43 per cent of total outlays. Before World War II the Commonwealth transfer payments to the states were only about 11 per cent of Commonwealth outlays; today they are 43 per cent of Commonwealth outlays. In my home state of Tasmania they actually represent 54 per cent. During World War II the Commonwealth took over the taxing powers from the states and since then there have been progressive increases in its revenue base and a decrease in the states' revenue base. In 1952 the land tax was left by the Commonwealth exclusively for the states. In 1971 payroll tax was left exclusively for the states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This fundamental imbalance between the Commonwealth and the states leads to very serious problems because responsibility is not tied to revenue raising. In its new federalism policy, the Fraser government introduced legislation to allow income tax sharing between the Commonwealth and the states and allowed the possibility of the states to have a tax surcharge. That was not taken up by the states and the act was repealed by the Hawke government in 1989. As to the problems with this imbalance, we have had increasing control by the centralist Commonwealth government and creeping increases in specific purpose grants. We have seen great increases over the last 20 years. In the early 1970s specific purpose grants were 20 per cent of Commonwealth grants; today they are up to 53 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Without that responsibility for revenue raising by the state governments and without the Commonwealth also being closely tied to the expenditure, we have silly decisions being made. We have a disincentive for creativity, efficiency and responsibility in government revenue raising and expenditure. Just recently we have had the crazy example of expenditure in southern Tasmania&mdash;where I come from&mdash;on a double highway to the airport, which was a Commonwealth government decision, when there was no proven need for such expenditure. This is at a time when other parts of the state of Tasmania could really do with expenditure on upgrading of roads, to the better efficiency and economic wellbeing of the whole of the state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have states spending 50c dollars and so there is little incentive to control costs and promote efficiency. This federal-state financial relationship has also been a problem in other countries such as Canada and the USA. To keep the matter short, the recent report of the Auditor-General entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">An audit</EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> commentary on aspects of Commonwealth-state agreements</EMPHASIS> also criticises the lack of clear objectives, absence of performance indicators and delays in financial reporting; in other words, no direct responsibility. The Auditor-General's report found that there was reduced incentive for the Commonwealth to monitor and manage special purpose payments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition's policy, announced in 1991, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Building a Better Federation</EMPHASIS>, firstly, advocated support for the federal system; secondly, agreed that the Commonwealth-state financial arrangements needed reform; thirdly, acknowledged that there needed to be a matching of revenue and expenditure by all governments, in other words, we believe in competitive federalism; fourthly, agreed with the proposals by the Hawke government, the premiers and chief ministers in 1991 to work towards cooperative federalism; and, finally, asserted that reform of these arrangements would be one of the most effective and lasting ways to boost Australia's economic performance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What happened? The Hawke government recognised these problems and, after conferring with the premiers, arranged a Special Premiers Conference for December 1991 to discuss the possibility of returning some income taxing powers to the states to reduce this vertical fiscal imbalance. However, this initiative, aimed at the strategic wellbeing of all Australians for the long term, was killed off by Mr Keating's attack on this process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Keating's attack was aimed at his own personal ambition in trying to secure the support of the Left to overthrow Mr Hawke, and it was also motivated by his very strong belief in the centralisation of power here in the Commonwealth, Mr Keating being a born centralist, as we have seen in recent days with the push for Mabo and the industrial relations bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we wish Australia to prosper, this issue of responsibility between the states and the Commonwealth and the imbalance between revenue raising and expenditure must be addressed. It is one of the most important things that has to be tackled in the near future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second issue that I will deal with very briefly relates to disclosure. Following the fiasco over the Kirner government's exceeding the Loan Council agreements, we must have a system of better disclosure of governments' financial status. One of the key parts of that&mdash;the Senate Select Committee on the Functions, Powers and Operation of the Australian Loan Council, of which I am a member, is dealing with this matter&mdash;is a move to accrual accounting by all governments so that there is a proper understanding of the real financial status of governments, the same as happens in the private sector. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This afternoon, having first contacted Senator Schacht, I intended to respond to an answer that he provided in the Senate largely about the extent of the recovery. Lest too many people be swayed about the extent of that recovery, as conveyed by Senator Schacht's response in question time&mdash;and particularly by virtue of the selectivity of his choice of one person's experience&mdash;and lest others, on reading the Senate <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, interpret the response too enthusiastically, I rise to make some comments about the state of the Australian manufacturing industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that it is possible that Senator Schacht may quite inadvertently have gilded the lily. Perhaps in response I should quote from my colleague Dr David Kemp, the shadow minister for science, when he drew our attention to the state of our manufacturing industry. I ask honourable senators to share a few thoughts from him:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia is now producing fewer manufacturing goods per head of population than it was two decades ago. Since 1985 the volume of manufacturing output has merely kept pace with population growth. Recent OECD data shows that between 1985 and 1991, factory output per capita in most OECD countries grew by more than 10 per cent (25 per cent in Japan) and yet Australia recorded a growth of only one per cent. Manufacturing production rose by only 0.6 per cent in the March quarter 1993.</PARA>
<PARA>It is important to realise that, unfortunately, the most significant restraint on manufacturing production in Australia has been the comparatively slow growth in the domestic demand for manufactured goods. I have perused the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Survey of Manufacturing Conditions and Future Prospects in NSW</EMPHASIS> for the September quarter 1993, which is conducted by the State Bank of New South Wales and the chamber. This survey indicated that the recovery in the manufacturing sector is mild and patchy and needs to strengthen considerably before it boosts profits sufficiently to create new jobs. A feature of the current recovery is its weakness compared with the recovery following the 1982-83 recession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also point out to the Senate that, despite the improvement in some of the main indicators, the level of activity of firms in that survey remained virtually unchanged between the June and September quarters. Some improvement is expected in the December quarter with 65 per cent of firms expecting to be operating above the 70 per cent of capacity level but&mdash;and this is the point&mdash;still well below the pre-Christmas levels experienced before the recession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The survey stated that manufacturers involved in exporting welcomed the added competitiveness gained from the current weaker Australian dollar. But, of course, I must remind the Senate that a weaker dollar ultimately means increased costs to Australia as a result of that weakness, particularly to the extent that manufacturing depends on imported items. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Manufacturers' optimism about export prospects over the next three months is reflected in the 17 per cent of respondents who expect to sell more overseas compared with only three per cent who expect a decline. I think it is regrettable that the increase in manufacturing activity seems to be fairly closely linked with a weak Australian dollar which, I put to the Senate, is not a good recipe for the future recovery of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I cannot allow the unfounded and uninformed statements concerning the New South Wales government's management of the south-east forests, which were made last night by Senator Coulter, to go unchallenged. Therefore, I would like to take a short time to set out the facts with regard to logging in New South Wales state forests and the national forests policy that Senator Coulter referred to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Coulter's remarks are just a repeat of the completely misguided allegations already made by the Greens. New South Wales is more advanced in implementing the national forests policy than any other state. The Timber Industry (Interim Protection) Act, enacted by the current New South Wales government, places substantial areas of old growth forest under moratorium until 15 separate environment impact statements have been completed and determined by the minister for planning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In the south-east of the state of New South Wales, the inter-governmental agreement on south-east forests transfers a further 55,000 hectares of state forest to national park. Other areas, including the Cathcart State Forest to which Senator Coulter referred yesterday, were allocated for timber production. I would like to point out to Senator Coulter that Mrs Kelly was one of the two federal members who brokered this agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The national forest policy also provides for ongoing timber production from old growth forests. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Governments recognise that integrated harvesting of sawlogs and pulplogs is an important use of native forests and that it can be done in an ecologically sustainable manner. . . </PARA>
<PARA>Further:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia will continue to use old-growth timber for many years. It will come from disturbed forests containing some old growth trees and from old growth forests that are not required for the nature conservation reserve system described. . .</PARA>
<PARA>I would also like to refer to Senator Coulter's notice of motion, which he gave yesterday, in which he supported the recent protest organised by the Wilderness Society in the Deua area of New South Wales. These protesters are amongst those who, in recent times, have been dealt with by the courts for a range of offences, including intimidation and assault. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It disturbs me greatly that a senator in this chamber would support such actions. It is a sad reflection on the Australian Democrats that they could support unlawful behaviour and apparently encourage those who do not observe the laws of the land. Other forms of protests have included the sabotage of equipment in forests, and tampering with power poles. These life threatening acts of protest should be condemned and are condemned by all law abiding citizens. I am sure that Senator Coulter does not support these actions, but it is a pity to line up with such hoodlums. Some of these people are unbalanced terrorists with little understanding of the effects of their acts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is absolutely no basis for the federal government to consider taking any action with respect to the national forests policy other than working cooperatively with the New South Wales government to finalise the south-east forest agreement and support regional assessment programs. I would like to point out that the logging compartments in the Cathcart State Forest, referred to by Senator Coulter, which have or will be logged, have been lawfully licensed by the National Parks and Wildlife Service. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) OPAC developed the National Standard for Organic and Bio-dynamic Produce which was released in February 1992 by Simon Crean, Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. At that time, the Honourable Minister indicated that the National Standard would provide the minimum requirements for all exports of organic produce.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the domestic market the National Food Authority (NFA), as the responsible agency, has been requested by both industry and AQIS to develop labelling provisions for organic foods for inclusion in the Australian Food Standards Code. A submission to the NFA, prepared by AQIS at the request of OPAC, proposes that the National Standard form the basis for such provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) The National Food Authority is represented on OPAC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) The Federal Government responded to the increasing world demand for organic produce in 1989 when the peak advisory council to the then Minister for Primary Industries, the Honourable John Kerin, endorsed a series of recommendations submitted by AQIS on accessing niche markets overseas. One of these recommendations led to the establishment of OPAC. Australia was the first country outside of the European Community (EC) to develop a national standard recognised as equivalent to the stringent EC regulations on organic production. In January 1993, following lengthy negotiations between AQIS and EC officials, Australia was included as one of only five approved third countries for the supply of organic product into the EC. AQIS has subsequendy introduced an accreditation program for organic certification organisations which is acceptable to the EC and will form the basis for exports to other major markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, in the July 1992 Government statement, `Australian Agrifood Industries', a range of measures was announced to boost exports of high quality fresh and processed foods, particularly to Asia. The Clean Food Export Program is a key element of the Government's initiatives in this area. The program aims to increase exports by reinforcing Australia's reputation as a source of clean food, and by implementing appropriate codes of practice to ensure consistent delivery of high quality, clean foods. Total funding of $5 million is to be applied over the period 1992/93&mdash;1994/95.</PARA>

This is being achieved through the promotion of initiatives which support the sustainable use of Australia's land and water resources.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Decade of Landcare Plans produced by the Commonwealth and each State provide for a national approach to sustainable land use. The National Landcare Program (NLP) is the primary Commonwealth program for implementing the Decade Plans. It has as its principal objective the implementation of sustainable natural resource management. Under the NLP, solutions to specific natural resource management programs are developed and implemented by land managers, landcare groups and catchment managers on a local and regional basis. Organic production systems are one of a number of approaches which may be applied by these groups to achieve sustainable agricultural systems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Organic practices are adaptable to any production system, although it may not always be possible to attain full organic status for specific commodities because of geographic or other prevailing conditions. The influence of such practices may be seen in conventional farming systems through the adoption of low input practices, integrated pest management, contouring and, greater use of crop rotations and green manure.</PARA>
