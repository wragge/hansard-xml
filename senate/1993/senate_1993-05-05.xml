<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The debate that took place when I started as Parliamentary Secretary and, subsequently, the second time around, which led to the final form of words contained in this motion, as I recall it, may well have taken place before I became Manager of Government Business in the Senate. There was a significant period during which I was a Parliamentary Secretary and not Manager of Government Business. It came from discussions that we had which did not relate to my capacity, in particular, as Parliamentary Secretary, but which related to dealing with certain Bills.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the first Bill I dealt with as Parliamentary Secretary, I operated on a fairly constrained interpretation of my rights in that matter. The Opposition raised some concern and said, `This is limiting the debate because you are not participating fully in a way that a Minister would'. I think either Senator Watson or Senator Baume raised some concerns which I thought were right. We undertook some further discussions and then had a subsequent debate in the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly, the exercise of these rights as set out in notice of motion No. 7 was indispensable to my conduct of the role of Manager of Government Business, but it was also fundamental to the basic discharge of debate in the Parliament on all those tax Bills and on the other matters of legislation with which I dealt both here and before the various committees of the Parliament, representing Ministers or in my own capacity as a Parliamentary Secretary. For example, the capacity of Senator Sherry to represent the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy before the estimates committee derives from this proposed resolution because the standing orders of the committees operate on the same basis as these Standing Orders. </PARA>

It should do so because it is the most efficient and sensible way to proceed.

There were those of us who objected very strenuously to the precedent being set of a man who was not a Minister with the responsibilities of a Minister being given the trappings of a Minister&mdash;let alone the pay of one. There were those of us who saw the use of our Constitution to swear them in as members of the Executive Council, simply because there is no provision to have junior Ministers, as a way of giving de facto pay increases to the favoured ones who dipped out on having a ministry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point we are discussing here is that, come 1 July, the Government will have only 30 senators in this chamber.

There is no reason why we should not examine the proposal to have Ministers from the lower House who are responsible for expenditure attend at estimates committees in the carriage of the debate concerning the proper expenditure of taxpayers' money.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next matter that was raised by the Opposition concerned estimates committees. There is only one Parliamentary Secretary here in the Senate, and that is my colleague Senator Sherry, who is Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. I thought it would be to the advantage of senators opposite to have a chance at estimates committee meetings to question the Parliamentary Secretary who obviously has knowledge of the primary industries and energy portfolio. I am sure that Senator Bishop and others would love to be able to get decent information at the estimates committee on which Senator Sherry will be representing the Government. </PARA>

That point is well taken by those on this side of the chamber.

That might not be achievable on every occasion, but Senator Coulter was being quite constructive in raising that point. </PARA>

I did not see people jumping up and down saying that they were not getting the right sort of information. I did not see that from Senator Bishop or from anybody else. Today we are seeing members of the defeated Liberal Party trying to get the angst out of their system due to the frustration that they will be sitting on the other side for the next three years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Manager of Government Business, Senator Faulkner, has moved a motion that would have the effect of allowing the order relating to Parliamentary Secretaries to operate as a sessional order. For those listening, it is important to note that the motion states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That any Senator who is appointed a parliamentary secretary under the Parliamentary Secretaries Act 1980 may exercise the powers and perform the functions conferred upon Ministers by the procedures of the Senate . . .</PARA>
<PARA>These very wide and very significant powers really go to the heart of constitutional issues in terms of the responsibilities of Ministers vis-a-vis other members of parliament, which would include, in the second category, Parliamentary Secretaries. The motion continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">but may not be asked or answer questions which may be put to Ministers under standing order 72(1).</PARA>
<PARA>I believe that we are moving into a very dangerous area. The Labor Government continually wishes to attack our constitution and its limitations. It is always moving at the fringes. As my colleague Senator Bishop said, using pre-metric terms, `Give them an inch and they will take more than a mile'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the fault was on this side. I might have to share some of that blame because as a shadow Parliamentary Secretary I certainly permitted some dispensation in terms of the complexities of the Income Tax Assessment Act and other relevant matters. Most people in Australia acknowledge the expertise that Senator McMullan brought to this area. He had certain responsibilities and he discharged them remarkably well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we remember that income tax issues go to the very hearts and pockets of all Australians, it is very important that such matters be well clarified. We must remember that this Government is attempting to reduce the amount of time spent debating matters.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has increased the number of Ministers in this place. Therefore, there is no need for the sort of dispensation that was given in one particular circumstance to be applied to a generic situation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I really rose to make a plea to the Australian Democrats. Typically, they are not in the chamber. The Senate chamber is the place where business should be transacted; it is the Parliament. I wanted to make a point to the Democrats about this issue, but, as usual, they are not here. Yet they will exercise a vote on this matter. They will come here and vote with the Government, so it appears, on these very important matters concerning the running of this chamber, yet they refuse to participate in the debate, or are negligent in participating, even to the extent of not having anyone present in the chamber who might be able to participate in the debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I want to make to the Democrats&mdash;hopefully some of them will read it in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> later&mdash;is that one argument that is apparently raised in favour of Senator Sherry taking on this position is that he has some expertise in the field of primary industries and energy.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ministerial representations show that Senator Cook is the representative of the primary industries and energy Minister in this chamber. If I recall correctly, Senator Cook performed this role in the last Parliament for a good part of the three years and in the Parliament before that. So one would have thought that he might have had some experience in those sorts of matters. Certainly the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) considers that he has that experience. That is why he has nominated him to be the representative Minister in the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I simply ask the Democrats how they can possibly allow this motion to be passed. I can understand their allowing it, as we did, for Senator McMullan, because nobody else on that side had any idea of those financial matters. But there are plenty of Ministers. Senator Cook has to be the nominated one who can handle those matters. I ask the Democrats, if they hear this or happen to read about it in the future, to think about that before they run willy-nilly and lie down to the Government again in the first controversial decision in this new Parliament. I ask them to think about that very seriously and, hopefully, do the right thing rather than what they have indicated they might propose doing. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, what about Senator Cooney? I do not think anyone on this side of the chamber would have said one word if it had been Senator Cooney, because then we would all have thought, yes, it was done on merit. But when we see some of the Parliamentary Secretaries that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has had to pay back, we on this side of the chamber say, `There are other reasons'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the people have to understand is that in this chamber, where the Hare-Clarke system of voting is undertaken, which is the true reflection of what the Australian public wants, the number of Government senators is now down to 30. Thirty members of the Labor Party got Senate seats. On this side of the chamber we got 36 seats. That is the true reflection of the voting of the people when it is not done on just those few dicey seats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has been occurring in this debate is a continuation of the downgrading of the Senate. We are all aware of the Prime Minister's  reference to this chamber as unrepresentative swill. We on this side of the chamber take strong exception to it, even though those on the other side of the chamber do not care. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Senator </EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">WALTERS</EMPHASIS>&mdash;Indeed, as Senator Coates would readily acknowledge, the aim is to abolish the Senate. It is the unmitigated truth that the Labor Party wants to abolish the Senate. Senator Gareth Evans has been quoted as saying that he would come into the Senate and white-ant it from within. Senator Evans has said at Labor meetings, `Yes, we will have to take that off our party agenda, but there is no need for us not to work at it underneath'. Obviously his main purpose in coming into the Senate was to white-ant it from within. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the moment the Government is wanting to take more and more power itself. As Senator Kemp has said, we now have additional Ministers and 10 Parliamentary Secretaries who will be pseudo-Ministers. Estimates in this place has been downgraded to such an extent that we have a Parliamentary Secretary, with no knowledge at all, taking the place of a Minister who is meant to be representing the Minister in the other place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not the way the Senate should proceed and I would object very strongly to any suggestion that Parliamentary Secretaries should take the place of Ministers in the Estimates or in any other respect, for example at Question Time in here. We must have Her Majesty's Government Ministers in charge of those responsibilities, not Parliamentary Secretaries. </PARA>

<PARA>Mastering the skills needed to effectively represent the labour movement in this place will be a challenging task&mdash;even a slightly daunting one&mdash;but it is a task that I am looking forward to. Already I have learned a great deal from my Caucus colleagues in this chamber and in the House of Representatives. I know that I will continue to benefit from their experience and comradeship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One politician whose example has been especially important to me is my predecessor, John Button. His commitment to Australian industry and sustainable industry development has helped to put this country in a stronger position to meet the challenges ahead than it might otherwise have been. He believed that Australia's future depended on its ability to maintain a strong, innovative and diverse industrial base. This is a belief I share. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">John Button's commitment to Australian industry marked him as an authentic Australian nationalist&mdash;unlike the sham loyalists who bristle whenever anyone suggests that we should have our own flag, but who could not care less where the flag is manufactured or who owns the ground it is planted in. John Button's reputation for honesty and integrity has enhanced the standing of politicians generally, as well as the cause of Labor in Victoria and beyond. His record of achievement will be difficult to match. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the efforts of John Button and Labor governments over the last decade, Australia remains a highly inequitable society. The recent federal election highlighted the great differences that exist between the obsessions of the parties opposite and the just society that Labor is striving to build&mdash;a society built on shared effort, shared rewards and a fair go for all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The election was resolved in favour of Labor's vision. The people of this country once again rejected the attitudes and the policies of the New Right which have held the Liberal Party of Australia captive for the past 10 years. The result on 13 March demonstrated the level of public commitment to social democratic values in this country. It indicated the direction that the majority of Australians wanted their society to move in. It demonstrated once again the confidence that the Australian people have in the Keating Government and the Australian Labor Party, and the ideals they represent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even in times of adversity, like those we are currently going through, Australians recognise that Labor's values are their values and that Labor's aspirations are their aspirations. Perhaps it is especially in times of adversity that we remember these things. Labor is the party committed to ensuring that each person in this country develops to his or her full potential. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor continues to believe that a dynamic public sector has a vital role to play in correcting inequalities, spreading opportunities and guiding the nation to greatness. Only the state can marshal the resources needed to ensure that all Australians&mdash;regardless of accidents of birth or the whims of fortune&mdash;enjoy a reasonable standard of living and participate meaningfully in the affairs of this country. Only Labor has the courage and know-how to use the enormous public resources at its disposal for the public good. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By way of contrast, the anti-Labor forces want to divide people, deprive them of their entitlements and debase their true value as citizens of this country. Hopefully, the dividers, the deprivers and the debasers in this country will have learnt something from the recent election. Hopefully, they will reassess their inhumane policies; they will abandon their bankrupt ideology; and they will join with the Keating Government and the people of Australia in creating a fairer, more equitable society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australians will not allow the prosperity of the few to be built on the hardship of the many. The sooner that all parties recognise that, the sooner they will find a place within the Australian compact&mdash;a compact based on the principles of social democracy. The great challenge that Australians face, as we move towards the centenary of Federation in 2001, is how to maintain that compact, maintain our commitment to Australia as one nation and enshrine it in our Constitution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One thing is certain, and that is that Australians' belief in themselves and each other will be severely challenged if we do not lift employment and improve the conditions of employment. The worst of the recession is over but the level of unemployment remains unacceptably high. The Government has made getting Australians back to work its first priority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a Victorian, the long-term economic decline of my home State is a matter of special concern. The 1980s brought to light deep structural problems within our economy and saw a major shift in resources from the south-east of the continent to the north and the west. Throughout that decade, economic growth in Victoria was often below the national average as measured by national account estimates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the recent recession, 60 per cent of Australian job losses occurred in Victoria. The reasons for Victoria's decline are complex. One will search in vain for a truthful explanation of the State's predicament in the self-serving propaganda of the Kennett Government. Victoria's current problems cannot be adequately explained purely in terms of debt, which is lower under Labor than it was under Henry Bolte; in terms of wage costs, which are lower under Labor than they were under Rupert Hamer; or just in terms of financial mismanagement, which is worse under Jeff Kennett than it has ever been before.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The depth of the recession in Victoria can be attributed to the interaction of structural factors like the State's reliance on protected industries; cyclical factors like the inevitable collapse of the speculative construction boom; and human factors like the failure of poorly managed enterprises such as the Farrow Group. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our effectiveness in dealing with the problem of protracted unemployment will depend on our ability to strengthen the link between manufacturing and industry services, particularly telecommunications, transport and marketing. The first Keating Government gave a fresh impetus to Victoria's economic recovery with its One Nation statement. The major infrastructure projects announced in One Nation provided the foundation for future development and will be of lasting benefit to this country, not least to depressed areas like Victoria in which many of the projects were based. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a member of the Commonwealth Parliament, my perspective will be a national one. I certainly do not have any time for parochial notions of States rights. Nevertheless, there is a strong need to articulate regional concerns at the national level and to ensure that all Australians work together to address those concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should indeed be one nation and, over our 93-year history as a united people, Victoria has made great sacrifices to assist the less prosperous States of the Commonwealth. Victorians do not begrudge those sacrifices. In fact, we are proud of the contribution we have made to the wellbeing of Australians beyond our own State borders. All Australians now recognise that, if we are to go forward, we must do so together. That may mean that some of Victoria's past generosity in the national interest has to be returned in kind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Forging a new republic will mean revising our relationship with other nations. But it is not enough to reform our external power relations. We must reform our internal power relations as well, and there are no power relations so fundamental in our society as industrial relations. For those who do have a job, industrial relations is a basic issue of concern. For those who do not have a job but are seeking work, the relationship between workers and employers is no less important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Industrial relations was the Achilles heel for the Liberal Party in the last election. Its promise to tilt the balance of industrial power even further in favour of employers was roundly rejected by the people of this country. We have outgrown our 19th century Constitution and we have outgrown 19th century notions of master and servant as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was precisely to combat those notions that the Australian trade union movement and the Australian Labor Party emerged. Trade unions still offer working people their best chance of improving their standard of living and securing some measure of real control over their lives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, it is the duty of social democrats in government to ensure that minimum standards, benchmarks and safety nets are enshrined in law to protect individuals and communities that do not have the organised capacity to defend themselves when pitted against the greater power of capital. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The arbitration system remains one of the supreme achievements of Australian social democracy. However, this is not to say that it cannot be improved. Labor's accord processes provide sufficient flexibility to allow the Government to respond to changes in social conditions while still protecting basic human rights. The last accord, known as mark 7, places responsibility for industrial organisation on workers and their unions, operating within a framework of minimum standards awarded by industrial tribunals. It throws out an enormous challenge to our trade unions to be relevant and effective in the changing economic conditions of the 1990s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just as employers vary in their approach to industrial relations, so unions vary in quality and competence. If a union is not doing its job, it is important that there exists a wages and conditions floor to ensure that community standards are protected. There are currently some 900 federal awards. Many of these are completely outdated and in need of major revision. Many offer wages and conditions grossly inferior to enterprise agreements currently being won by workers and their unions. In Victoria, hundreds of thousands of workers are fleeing to the federal industrial jurisdiction to escape the savage attacks launched on them by the Kennett Government. Today, tens of thousands of workers have struck against the Kennett Government's industrial madness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is obvious that we can never truly be one nation, one social democracy, one united republic, unless we can guarantee all Australian workers reasonable and comparable rewards for their labour. It does not matter whether they are victims of a political vendetta, like the workers of Victoria, whether they are isolated or poorly organised, or whether they are young, female or part-time workers, all Australian employees should enjoy the protection of one national industrial relations system along the reform lines described in accord mark 7 and referred to in the Governor-General's speech yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Education gives Australia a window on the world. For many working class Australians, education is the key to overcoming the barriers to social participation and economic security. Achieving a more equitable spread of educational opportunities will play a vital part in uniting the people of this country in one national purpose and allowing them to enjoy the fruits of our national life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current series of Labor governments' records of achievement in education are outstanding. They are to be commended for giving more and more people the opportunity to enjoy the benefits of schooling. The number of Australian children staying on to year 12 has increased from four in 10 to eight in 10 over the space of 10 years. However, much more can be done to provide not just equality of opportunity but greater equality of educational outcomes. The unequal educational outcomes we see today are primarily the result of differences in social background, economic circumstances and what educationalists have come to call cultural capital. Australians can no longer afford to go on wasting the talents of young people simply because they were born to working class parents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, in Victoria today the State Government seems determined to undermine state education. The long term effect of this policy could well be that working class people are deprived of the opportunity to fulfil their full potential. The Kennett Government's schools of the future program seems designed to further advantage already resource-rich schools in wealthier suburbs and to further impoverish those in less wealthy areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite these efforts in Victoria to undermine public education, the public education system in this country generally does a first-rate job. We must make every effort to make sure it can meet the exacting requirements of the future. We have to raise the status of primary education, which is where the foundations of educational success begin. We need to build on the advances we have made in secondary education and we need to enlarge the scope of technical, tertiary and further education. We should be giving all Australian children education which empowers them to understand and enjoy the environment in which they live&mdash;and even, if they see fit, to change it. This is what I call a democratic education, and I believe it will be the cornerstone of a new Australian republic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is essentially an urban nation, and the problems of Australian cities need to be addressed if we are to remake our society. Joint actions by the Commonwealth, the States and local government will be required to deal with the decaying infrastructure in our older urban centres and the demand for new infrastructure in growth areas. The public sector as a whole will need to expend not millions but billions of dollars over the coming decades to provide basic services to the majority of Australians who live in our major cities. Building and managing those services will be an enormous task, but there is nothing to be gained by postponing it. The Government is to be applauded for strengthening its urban development program at this crucial time in the life cycle of our cities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A republican Australia would at last be free of the confusion about our national identity which has baffled many people overseas and even some within our own shores. Australia's national identity is lived out each day by its people, and it lives on in the National Estate. During the past 20 years, Labor governments have established a proud tradition of protecting and enlarging our natural and cultural heritage. Labor has introduced legislation to preserve world heritage areas, the built environment and our Aboriginal heritage. At the Federal level, there has been enormous investment in national institutions such as the Australian National Gallery, the National Library of Australia, the National Maritime Museum and the National Museum of Australia. These museums and repositories contain the collective memory and the collective conscience of the nation. It will be essential in a new Australian republic that all Australians have access to this wealth of material, and I welcome the Government's commitment to the establishment of a foundation of Australian cultural development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Federal Government can help also by encouraging museums around the country to come together and establish genuinely national databases for research, educational and public use. The Commonwealth could use its good offices&mdash;and perhaps a little funding&mdash;to establish the necessary framework for cooperation. It should be possible by 2001 to create a series of national databases that will give all Australians, wherever they live, access to the collections of our major libraries, galleries and museums. Those collections define our past achievements and our future hopes. They will provide us with the raw material from which we can forge a new and truly independent Australian identity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While a republican Australia will be prepared to treat all nations of the world as friends and equals, its future will lie in Asia rather than among the rapidly multiplying nations of Europe. We will have to deal with new uncertainties as we endeavour to establish our place in a region marked by enormous cultural diversity and enormous economic potential. Even now we are operating in an environment where national self-reliance and independence are the essential pre-conditions of international cooperation. They are increasingly important&mdash;if increasingly difficult&mdash;objectives to achieve. National self-reliance can be measured in economic and foreign policy terms and also in terms of defence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the 1950s many in the Australian Labor Party have tried to sidestep the defence debate. It is no longer acceptable for those of us on the left of politics to abdicate our responsibilities in this area. Defence expenditure makes up a significant part of the national budget, and we need to consider our economic and social goals as much as military issues when weighing up defence policy options. Defence expenditure should be directed, above all, towards securing Australia's autonomy and supporting Australian industry. This is not necessarily an argument for higher defence spending. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rather than more money spent on defence overall, we simply need more money to be spent on defence priorities set in Canberra, rather than the conservatives' policy of following priorities set in Washington; more money spent on defence procurement which supports Australian industry; and more money spent on defence policies which reflect Australia's independent strategic interests and our strategic obligations to our regional partners. I am sure next year's defence white paper examining Australia's force structure and investment priorities will address these issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the Labor Party is committed to constitutional reform. We have a lot of unfinished business left over from the 19th century, when working people and their representatives were largely excluded from the constitution-making process. In my view, the republican debate has so far been too narrow in its focus. If we are to achieve meaningful constitutional change we should be thinking and talking about  broader  issues  than  who  should be the president of Australia. For instance, there can be no new republic without a reconciliation with  the  Aboriginal  people  of  this  country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The present ground swell for constitutional reform gives us a once-in-a-century chance to declare our independence, and that is not insignificant. It also gives us the chance to give constitutional expression to Australia's social and democratic values. I welcome the Government's commitment, as outlined in the Governor-General's speech yesterday, to ongoing constitutional reform, considered separately and on its own merits. It is important to remember that a constitution is not just a set of procedural rules or a description of political machinery; it is also a statement of beliefs and aspirations. The founders of the Commonwealth understood that political structures can embody certain principles, and they set out to write a constitution that reflected their belief that the interests of property could predominate over the interests of the majority. This is why Australia is a federation and this is why federalism has become essentially a device to fragment and frustrate the democratic will. That is why we have the section 92 free trade guarantee and other provisions designed to prevent people from exercising control over capital. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recent election result is a reminder that Australians no longer subscribe to the principle that property should come first, the people second&mdash;that is, if they ever really did. That result demonstrates once again that a majority of Australians are unshakably committed to the principles of social democracy, equal rights and opportunities for all. It shows that the people of this country recognise and cherish the fact that we should be one nation. We should be using the republican debate to review the fundamental shape of our federation, the division of powers between the various levels of government and the way they are funded. The debate gives us an opportunity to re-evaluate the prickly question of fiscal equalisation, which is currently working very much against the majority of people in this country who happen to live in the south-east of the continent. It is essential that funding is directed to regions of real need, in line with national priorities. We should be examining how best we can organise the public sector to serve our future needs. In particular, we should be exploring the possibility of an enhanced role for local government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The need for comprehensive constitutional reform is self-evident. However, it is essential that discussions about the future constitution include consideration of the sorts of social relations we want to protect and advance in this country. Writing England's monarch out of Australia's Constitution will certainly encourage greater pride and confidence in our national identity. But we need to do more than that if we want a constitution which enshrines our social democratic consensus, a constitution which fosters a more equitable and participatory Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude on a personal note by thanking the many people who have entrusted me with the responsibility of representing them in this chamber. First and foremost, I thank the Labor voters of Victoria for electing me and for their part in returning the Keating Government. I thank my party, the Australian Labor Party, for giving me the opportunity to embark on this great challenge. Thanks in particular go to the many tireless workers in the Victorian branch and their trade union affiliates, especially the Victorian branch of the Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union, its officials and its secretary, Wally Curran, who have given me tremendous support and encouragement. They have also given unstinting support to Labor in Victoria during the difficult times we have had in recent years. I know that they will continue to give that support in the even more difficult times ahead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I thank my wife Carole and my family, without whose love, care and tolerance of the demands of political life I would not be here today. My three daughters will come of age in the first decade of the 21st century. I will do everything in my power to ensure that they come of age in an even more equitable, prosperous and open Australian social democracy and in a new Australian republic. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak in this debate on the proposed resolution that Parliamentary Secretaries exercise the powers and perform the functions conferred upon Ministers. I support what my colleagues have said and I question the motives behind this move on this occasion. I also recognise the reasons why this was done previously. As Senator Bishop so aptly stated, `You give that crowd on the other side an inch and they want to take a mile'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only explanation we have been given by those opposite for doing this is so that Senator Sherry, in his capacity as a Parliamentary Secretary, may represent the Minister for primary industries in estimates hearings. This is similar to what occurred in this chamber yesterday when the Governor-General, in an hour-long speech, outlined the Government's policy objectives for the next three years. In the Governor-General's speech, 30 seconds was devoted to primary industry. There was not one mention of the wool industry, nor was there mention of the severity of the drought. Senator Cook represents the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Crean, in this place. It appears that, once again, there is an attempt to allow the Minister responsible for primary industries in this place to abrogate his responsibilities regarding estimates hearings. I object very strongly to that proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is totally wrong and unacceptable to allow this motion to be passed. I appeal to the Democrats in general and in particular to Senator Bell, who is not in the chamber at this time. Senator Bell has served on the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs along with a number of other senators, and has shown a rational understanding of the situation that exists in rural Australia. I add that Senator Sherry has also served on that committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not the point at issue here. The point is that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) appointed Senator Cook to carry out that particular function before estimates committees, and it should be Senator Cook who carries out that function, not somebody who is ranked third in order of responsibility for the position. This is a particularly important issue at a time when there is a very serious crisis in the wool industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make particular reference to an interjection made earlier by Senator Burns. Senator Burns is chairman of the rural and regional affairs committee. When the crisis in the wool industry was mentioned, Senator Burns interjected, `Whose fault was that?'. I say categorically that much of the fault lies clearly with the Labor Government. I make the point that when the reserve price scheme was in place it was approved at every step by the Labor Government. The Government also had its own representatives on the board of the Australian Wool Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the reserve price was in place&mdash;initially, I believe, at 870c; it was then lowered to 700c&mdash;the Minister at the time, Mr Kerin, made statements that the situation would not change, that it was set in concrete, that it was rock solid. He made those statements in wool-buying countries such as Italy and France, in Europe, Asia and elsewhere. In changing that policy position, which was said to be absolutely set in concrete, he totally undermined the confidence of the trade in purchasing Australian wool. Combined with that, we saw what occurred yesterday with the current account figures that came through: there was another loss to this nation of $2.1 billion. There has been a subsequent fall in the Australian dollar today. Once again, these economic policies are undermining the confidence of overseas buyers purchasing our product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These things I mention are not the only ones. The Government cannot abrogate its responsibility and the position it adopted, undermining an industry which last year, despite its problems, put $3.8 billion into the economy and which has one of the highest, if not the highest, employment multiplier effects of any industry in this nation. Much of Australia's infrastructure depends on a viable and healthy wool industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My opposing this motion and not accepting the reasons that are given by the Government is not a reflection on Senator Sherry but a reflection on the fact that the Minister named by the Prime Minister should accept his responsibilities and appear before estimates committees to answer the questions and to give the rationale behind the Government's policy position. Through you, Mr Deputy President, I once again appeal to the Democrats, and particularly Senator Bell, to accept the responsibility of making sure that those who are chosen by the Prime Minister to carry out certain functions in this Parliament do so. In this case it happens to be Senator Cook who is named on the ministerial representation sheet as the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and also as Minister representing the Minister for Resources. There is another very good reason why Senator Cook should appear. It fits very neatly into his responsibilities as Minister for Trade, and this matter should be addressed in terms of the operations of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. If this motion is carried, it will allow a Minister of the Crown to abrogate his responsibilities as the Minister representing primary industry in this place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak on this matter and to oppose what the Government is proposing to do, for the simple reason that this is yet another onslaught against the Senate. There is a well established tradition that Ministers should attend upon estimates committees because the estimates committee process is the mechanism by which the Senate makes the Executive accountable to Parliament. It is as simple as that. Even honourable senators opposite should be able to understand that it is an important mechanism for parliamentary and Executive accountability that Ministers should attend upon estimates committees. Yet here we have a proposal, on just the second day of sitting, that would let Parliamentary Secretaries do the job of Ministers so that Ministers do not have to turn up. That is what it is about: it is about letting Ministers get away with not doing their job.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a few suggestions as to why Senator Cook may not wish to attend a hearing of an estimates committee examining the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. I expect the real reason why the Government wishes to shield Senator Cook from the estimates committees in relation to this portfolio flows from the very tough time he had in the last estimates committee. One has in mind all the difficulties that we had with the Department of Primary Industries and Energy&mdash;as Senator Calvert and Senator Archer well know&mdash;and the implausible stories that the Minister tried to fob onto the committee about all sorts of issues concerning the importation of genetic material from Denmark. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Cook did not like it because he got a tough time. That is what it is all about. So what does he want to do? He wants to send Senator Sherry in his place to do his job for him. Goodness gracious, Senator Cook did not do so good a job himself, and now the Government wants to send a Parliamentary Secretary instead of the Minister. We believe that the Senate should not and should never be party to an instrument by which the powers, privileges and responsibilities of this Senate are weakened in favour of the executive government. We do not believe that the Senate should have a hand in weakening the practices that we have fought so hard to achieve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the greatest achievements of the Senate is being able to carefully and adequately scrutinise the operations of the Government and the departments through the estimates committee process. But here we will have a situation in which an errand boy is sent on behalf of the Minister, with no capacity to give undertakings to the estimates committee in the course of the hearings. If a Minister appears before a committee, at least he or she has the capacity to give undertakings that certain things will be done. But here we will receive a Parliamentary Secretary with no capacity to give those undertakings. Certainly the undertakings may be given, but the question is whether they will be adhered to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can have no certainty&mdash;and this is no aspersion on Senator Sherry&mdash;that an undertaking given by a Parliamentary Secretary will be acted on in the same way that an undertaking given by a Minister will be acted upon. That is also one of the reasons why we have to wonder why the Government wants to replace the Minister with a Parliamentary Secretary. We have to sit here and say, `These Ministers are paid an enormous amount of money to do a job. They actually have a particular responsibility to represent a Minister in another place in the same way that Ministers in the lower house represent Ministers who sit in the Senate. So why should we create a situation in which a Minister who is supposed to represent the Minister for primary industries does not have to do his job?'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I oppose this attempt by the Government to give Parliamentary Secretaries the powers and functions conferred upon Ministers in relation to estimates committees. I hasten to say that my contribution is certainly no reflection on my colleague and, I would like to think, my friend Senator Sherry. Indeed, I congratulate him on his appointment as a Parliamentary Secretary. I make the point that he may well have many more ministerial qualities and be far more adept at performing the functions of Ministers than some of those who were appointed.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the points made, particularly those coming by way of interjection from Senator Schacht, whom I have yet to congratulate on becoming a Minister, while Senator Bishop was speaking, were to the effect that `we won the election'&mdash;talking on behalf of the Government&mdash;`and that is why we can do what we want to do'. In a way, I think that highlights the problem of this proposal; that is, there is an enormous arrogance about the Prime Minister, having won this election&mdash;an election the Prime Minister did not expect to win. But he did win; the Australian people have passed their judgment, and I respect that judgment in the true democratic tradition. </PARA>

Of course, the election on 13 March has conferred much more personal power on him. I believe that this demands that those of us who were also elected on 13 March, as well as senators who were elected in 1990, acknowledge that an extra responsibility has been placed upon us in this Parliament; that is, that we should be extra careful and extra diligent in our scrutiny of the Executive Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Democrats, of course, would be. They go around the country saying that they are keeping us and the Government&mdash;the major parties&mdash;honest. But, in a series of so-called parliamentary reforms being proposed here today and in subsequent days, the very accountability of the Executive to the Parliament is being undermined bit by bit, drip by drip, knife cut by knife cut. This so-called reform, of course, is the first in a series.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support the argument put by my friend and colleague from Western Australia Senator Crane, who spoke about the wool crisis and the importance of the problems of the primary industries. There are many people, many specialist woolgrowers in particular&mdash;pastoralists, people who rely almost entirely on the wool industry for their livelihoods&mdash;who are going through enormous trauma at the moment. Their livelihoods, welfare and wellbeing are being affected; they are living under enormous stress. That stress is spreading not only through the rural communities, the small country towns that have been the backbone of Australia as a nation for so many years, but also into the city, as many people who are being forced out of the country move into our urbanised regions. This is increasing unemployment, crime and the general demise of the balance between country and city that Australia has grown up with in the past century. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A couple of weeks ago I had the pleasure of meeting with a group of specialist woolgrowers in a town called Boyup Brook, south of Perth. They put to me the concept that even the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) was not respected enough, or did not have enough seniority in the Government, to make statements in relation to the solution of the wool crisis and the problems of primary industry. They thought that the only way certainty could be returned to rural industries, and the wool industry in particular, and indeed to international faith in the wool market, was for the Prime Minister to make a statement in relation to the package for the wool industry. They suggested to me that we should demand a meeting with and a statement by the Prime Minister on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Crane quite properly pointed out, if I remember correctly, the problems caused by the former Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin, when he made a number of statements at international forums giving reassurances to international wool buyers and the market about the price of Australian wool and the reserve price scheme which were quickly overturned. The point I am seeking to make in perhaps a roundabout way is that we have an industry that is seeking the highest level of reassurance and commitment from this Government&mdash;indeed, from the Prime Minister, not even from the Minister. Yet the Senate, which is the only body in this nation that is responsible for scrutinising the activities of the department, the Government and expenditure through the very important estimates process, is being asked to have those questions and that scrutiny dealt with by, with no disrespect, a very junior Parliamentary Secretary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the Senate, and particularly the Australian Democrats, should give very strong consideration to whether they support this move. It is very clearly a backward step for the Senate in the very important estimates committee process to have to deal with a Parliamentary Secretary. The people of Australia passed their judgment on 13 March 1993. They also returned, in States such as Queensland, Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia, very high Senate votes for coalition senators. I would like to think that that is a reflection of the need people see to ensure that there is a check on the Executive Government and that the Senate has a very strong role to play. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Schacht has reminded us on many occasions on this first business day of the Senate, we lost the election and we have to wait for three years for our next chance. I can assure the Senate that Opposition senators are not going to sit around and wait for three years. We have a very important role to play in this Parliament. That role must be to scrutinise the Executive and the activities of the second Keating Government and to ensure that the people of Australia respect the processes of accountability and scrutiny and checks and balances in our constitutional monarchy. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Walters is welcome to ask me about that any time she likes. The Government obviously warmly welcomes the decision of the leader of the Bosnian Serbs, Radovan Karadzic, to sign on to all parts of the Vance-Owen plan for Bosnia-Herzegovina on 2 May in Athens. This is a positive first step in achieving a durable solution to the problems in the former Yugoslavia, although I note, of course, that that decision is yet to be ratified by the self-styled assembly of the Bosnian Serbs. We obviously hope that the Bosnian Serbs, through that assembly, which is scheduled to meet on today's date, will give their unconditional support to that move.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also obviously the case that, in addition to that agreement on paper, we still have to see concrete evidence on the ground in Bosnia that the Bosnian Serbs have abandoned the use of force to achieve their objectives and that they will participate in good faith in the peace process. Certainly, continued attacks by Bosnian Serb forces on towns in eastern Bosnia in the last couple of days show that that evidence is still very sadly lacking. It must also be said that the Serbs are not the only ones intent on using force, as is evidenced by the really quite atrocious and bloody fighting between Bosnian Croats and Bosnian Muslims over recent weeks in central Bosnia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is necessary now for the international community to maintain maximum pressure on all the parties to this terrible conflict to demonstrate the kind of political and moral will that is necessary to settle their differences other than through the use of force. The international community's resolve in this respect has been most recently demonstrated, I guess, through the imposition of further UN sanctions, with effect from 27 April, against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and its surrogates. We will just have to wait and see and hope that those sanctions will have some additional impact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the case that further options for more resolute action still have not been ruled out should the Serbs not abide by the agreements now signed. At the same time as NATO is working on plans for UN implementation of the details of the Vance-Owen agreement, it is also the case that US Secretary of State Christopher continues to consult right now with other international leaders on possible further action. The big problem for the international community in relation to each of the other options that are under consideration&mdash;air strikes, lifting the arms embargo and direct outside military intervention&mdash;is that it is very unclear&mdash;</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am answering Senator Hill's question now, if he will listen quietly and carefully. It is unclear, however, that the benefits of such further resolute action, which might include the arming of the Muslims and air strikes, outweigh the costs of that. There are obvious dangers to the existing international peacekeeping and humanitarian efforts that are involved with this; there are obvious dangers to the troops that are on the ground administering those peacekeeping and humanitarian efforts at the moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the case that more civilians would be put under threat and potentially subject to suffering if the flow of humanitarian assistance were cut off. As such, it is a very real dilemma for the international community as to whether, I repeat, the benefits will outweigh the costs of that further action. It is an issue on which judgments, including our own, are very carefully poised and balanced. We would obviously join any international consensus, as I have already said publicly, should a further decision have to be made in this respect, but we all hope that it will not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My final point is simply this: a durable peace is manifestly going to be achieved at the end of the day only through a political and diplomatic solution. We can only all hope that that political and diplomatic solution can be rapidly reached without the kind of further bloodshed that would be necessarily involved were more resolute military action to be taken by the United Nations and the European powers or, of course, if such bloodshed were to be perpetrated by the parties on the ground. There are no easy answers to this question. Any suggestion from Senator Hill or anyone else that there is an easy answer is as misconceived and as ignorant as I am afraid we have been led to expect from that source in the past.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the ethnic and racial composition of the Defence Force, the study made a number of observations, including the fact that people from predominantly non-English speaking countries are under represented but that the extent of this under representation is reduced amongst the more recent entrants to the Defence Force.

Is the Minister now prepared to take direct action to restrain imports of consumer goods and to boost exports to reverse the current disastrous trend?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I am not prepared to take the action that Senator Spindler encourages me to take. Under article 19 of GATT, when there are surges in particular product lines, action can be taken about those particular products on a temporary basis, but only after consultation with the other countries concerned and the producers affected. I do not think that that case can be identified in this set of balance of payments figures. If Senator Spindler wishes to make the identification, I would be delighted to hear from him about it. The current account deficit is not of sufficient magnitude to warrant, in my view, action under article 12.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Comments on the balance of payments figures fall more properly within the portfolio of the Minister representing the Treasurer in this place. I would, however, forewarn Senator Spindler and other senators who spring to make some immediate political points about the balance of payments that one should be very careful in looking at one set of balance of payments figures on their own and drawing conclusions across the whole spectrum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a logical inconsistency to say that one case makes a broad truth; it does not. Indeed, even someone who might be more closely aligned to the other side, the Chief Executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Mr Ian Spicer, in commenting on this most recent set of figures, has warned people not to make knee-jerk reactions as if these figures portend some wider issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These figures do include an LNG tanker worth $288 million, which has the effect of pushing out those figures, and they do come after a trend series which has been fairly flat since October and in which manufacturing exports have continued to rise, with elaborately transformed manufacturing exports growing by 17.7 per cent in the nine months to March, compared with the same period last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I welcome Senator Spindler into the trade debate. No doubt I will hear a lot more from him, but on this occasion I do not think his foray into nudging us into action in the GATT is particularly appropriate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is a very fortunate and timely question. Friday week ago I held talks with the Thai Minister for Industry and Commerce, Mr Uthai, on this very subject. Senator Beahan asks me what is the approximate value, in Australian dollar terms, I imagine, of the impact of video piracy, or the piracy of Australia's intellectual property, in the case of Thailand. The estimate I have is a wide-ranging one, somewhere between $5 million and $10 million; it is hard to pin it down. That is $5 million or $10 million that would be better off in the pockets of Australian industry and in the pockets of Australian performers so that the Johnny Farnhams, the Jim Barneses, the Dame Joans, the INXSs and the others who are constantly subjected to piracy can get the payments that they ought to get if people purchase their products in the proper way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The United States and the European Community have been very strong in applying pressure, and rightly, on the Thai Government and on other governments to prevent video piracy and the hijacking of intellectual property. We were concerned that, in forcing the commitments that Thailand had given to those countries, there would be some greater leniency with respect to, or less enforcement on, Australia and on Australian copyright. I have obtained an undertaking from the Thai Government that that will not be the case, that enforcement will be uniform and across-the-board. That undertaking was given by the Thai Minister himself, who asked me on behalf of any Australians who have their incomes or their rights affected by this sort of piracy to draw to his attention particular examples of that so that enforcement can indeed be as complete as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only with respect to this matter but with respect to a whole range of other matters the Government has been working, in previous terms and now in this term, on dealing with bilateral issues between countries. When I was in Thailand I took up the issue of industrial property. We were close at that time to concluding an agreement to protect patents, trademarks and industrial design. It is my understanding now that in general terms an agreement between Australia and Thailand has been concluded and needs final clearance and that we can shortly expect to have an agreement between Thailand and Australia which resembles that between Australia and Indonesia to protect trademarks, patents and industrial design. This, of course, complements the actions we are taking multilaterally in the Uruguay Round to try to protect all intellectual property.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I should say thank you to Senator Burns. This is a very serious question for this reason: my visit, the first visit in my capacity as Minister for Trade, was to ASEAN capitals, which are very important trading partners for Australia. They are areas in which we hope to develop even greater trade and they are in an area of the world in which we have been able to sell sophisticated manufactured goods as well as services.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason I went to ASEAN capitals was, of course, to add flesh to the Government's promise to engage more deeply with Asia.

I was certainly told he was one of the highest priced and, if price based tendering processes mean anything, that must mean he is one of the best.

I think Senator Bishop, as a lawyer, should have known this, and so should Senator Alston.

The tenderer got the licence after two years, 15 legal actions and a fortune of public money spent on assessing these things. Senator Alston knows conditions cannot be applied to just one company; they have to be applied to all applicants in advance before we know what their prices are. I do not know how many multimillions Kerry Stokes got for that, but he sold the licence and, of course, the benefit was picked up.

Apparently he was the Minister for Space in the Queensland Government when Mr Ahern was the Premier. Mr Ahern is now the leader of the STS project to try to build a space port in PNG.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of Minister Simon Crean, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, I will refer to some notes I have on this matter which go to an answer. On 28 April, Minister Crean announced that the Government allocated an additional $11 million to provide support under the exceptional circumstances provisions of the rural adjustment scheme&mdash;RAS, as it was referred to in Senator Boswell's question&mdash;to drought affected farmers in Queensland and New South Wales for the period 1 July to 31 December 1992.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This drought assistance has been integrated with the exceptional circumstances support to wool producers which means that $5 million of the $44.6 million of the wool support has been allocated to help drought affected wool producers. The remaining $6 million is to support the other drought affected producers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Including this latest allocation, the Commonwealth has now provided special drought assistance of $27.5 million since September 1992. Drought affected producers may be eligible for interest subsidies of up to 100 per cent on existing and new loans for carry-on, debt restructuring and productivity improvement purposes. For 100 per cent subsidies to be provided, Queensland and New South Wales will be required to match subsidies above 50 per cent on a dollar for dollar basis, which means they will need to contribute $2.6 million. The cap of $30,000 per applicant which applied to the special drought assistance from 1992-93 has been increased&mdash;that is, the cap has gone up&mdash;to $50,000 for 1993-94 assistance. To be eligible for an interest rate subsidy under the exceptional circumstances provisions, Queensland producers should apply to the Queensland Industry Development Corporation, which administers the RAS scheme in Queensland on behalf of the Commonwealth. Each application is assessed on a case by case basis, taking into account a full assessment of the producer's current and projected financial situation. I think that covers some of Senator Boswell's questions.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Science and Small Business (Senator Schacht) in response to a question without notice asked by Senator Coulter on 5 May 1993 relating to the Environmental Protection Authority in Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Coulter asked the Minister for Science and Small Business, Senator Schacht, what he was doing regarding the removal of Barry Carbon from the position of head of the EPA in Western Australia. In the short time I have I wish to put the record straight. The Government of Western Australia is not in any way ridding the EPA of Barry Carbon. His contract expires on 30 June this year and that is when he will be able to apply for a job, if he so wishes, in a new sphere. The WA Government is splitting his job into two. He holds the job of CEO and chairman of the authority. On 1 July the Government of WA is splitting that job into two, which is a very common practice in the authority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the WA Government did cancel, after receiving a legal opinion, was a contract entered into by the previous Minister seven days before an election and six months prior to the date that Barry Carbon's contract was to expire. So it is simply a situation of the new Government of WA splitting the job into two. It is not unloading Barry Carbon. He is free to apply for any of the two jobs if he so wishes. This matter should be left to the State of WA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not mind saying this.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Western Australian Minister, Mr Minson, made it quite clear during the Western Australian election campaign that he would not split the jobs. In relation to what Senator Panizza has just said about these jobs frequently being split, there are at least seven other departments in Western Australia in which the positions of head of a board and chief executive officer are occupied by the same person.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the lead-up to the election, the very conservative red-necked Western Australian government-in-waiting was using the advice of Dr Tim Meagher, a man well known for very considerable environmental damage in Western Australia. The new Western Australian Government now wants to get rid of Barry Carbon, somebody in whom the conservation movement in Western Australia was not particularly confident when first appointed, but over the years he has proved to be a man of considerable integrity and independence. While one would not agree with every decision which the EPA has made&mdash;the Democrats are on record as opposing the decision of the EPA to support the petrochemical plant, for example&mdash;nonetheless, in the main Barry Carbon has shown considerable independence and is an excellent person to fulfil that role. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a clear political move going on in Western Australia to interfere with the independence of the EPA and to appoint a person who is acceptable to the Western Australian Government but who is a known environmental destroyer. Clearly, the crux of the question was&mdash;I am not entirely satisfied with the reply of the Minister for Science and Small Business (Senator Schacht) on behalf of the Minister in the other place&mdash;that, under the intergovernmental agreement, we may well get to a situation where the Western Australian EPA is no longer independent and where the decisions which the EPA gives on things such as EISs and EIAs are very strongly coloured. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, the question still stands: will the Federal Government simply sit on its hands and allow very considerable environmental destruction to go on in Western Australia, instead of, as I believe it should do if that situation develops, stepping in and making sure that that very considerable portion of the Australian environment is protected? That is the proper function of a comprehensive Federal Government. The question specifically mentioned things such as air quality and water quality standards. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to address this issue. Firstly, my understanding is that at the last election the Australian Democrats ran on an open ticket. I do not think the Minister for Science and Small Business (Senator Schacht) was correct in what he said. As usual, Senator Coulter came in and used emotional terms such as `environmental destroyer', when he did not know what he was talking about. He claimed that things were done with regard to the position of Mr Barry Carbon. Incidentally, I have quite a high regard for Mr Barry Carbon.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was made quite clear prior to the last election that, as far as the running of the EPA in Western Australia was concerned, the position of chief executive officer and chairman would be split. There is no doubt about that. As I understand it, that proposal was also considered by the previous Labor Government. This situation is the result of the enormous amount of conflict in Western Australia between the EPA, conservation and land management, industry and a number of other organisations, including conservation groups in Western Australia. That is well and truly on the public record. So when Senator Coulter comes in here and makes these claims about Western Australia, I have to say that he is way off the beam. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make another point about this matter. Senator Coulter referred to environmental destruction. Firstly, the record of the EPA in some areas of Western Australia is very good. In other areas it is not so good. CALM is in the same category. However, it became patently obvious to anybody who was sitting back looking at what has been happening, particularly in the last 12 or 18 months, that it was necessary to reassess both the position that the EPA was adopting and EPA's administration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Barry Carbon was not precluded from applying for either of the jobs, be it chairman or chief executive officer. Similar steps could be taken in respect of a number of other organisations. I will mention one&mdash;the Rural Adjustment Authority, which was referred to in an answer to a question from Senator Boswell. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Coulter rose in this chamber and made claims about what is happening. There was a clear policy position prior to the election as far as the incumbent government of Western Australia was concerned. We should now allow the restructured Environment Protection Authority in Western Australia to get on with the job of achieving a balance between environmental requirements and sustainable development in Western Australia in order to help overcome some of the serious problems that exist as a result of unemployment, not only in Western Australia but in Australia as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Western Australia is capable of making a significant contribution to achieving a proper balance between development and the environment, and that is borne out by recent unemployment figures.

On the same day as the announcement of the sacking of Mr Carbon in Western Australia, the State Government announced that it was going to explore for oil on the Ningaloo Reef&mdash;an area that is very precious to the citizens of Western Australia, Australia and the world.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Science and Small Business (Senator Schacht), in response to a question without notice asked by Senator Jones this day, relating to a proposed space agency in Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Schacht raised the concern in some quarters that the Papua New Guinea Government is encouraging, very greatly, the proposal to establish a space base on an island in New Guinea. A week or so ago I was quoted in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cairns Post</EMPHASIS> in relation to that matter. My concern is that both the Queensland and the Australian governments are not giving sufficient encouragement to private groups who have shown an interest in the construction of the space base in the Cape York area. The benefits that could come from the construction of that space base for Queensland, in particular&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YW4">Senator IAN MACDONALD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am surprised that Senator Kernot always knocks anything that is likely to bring benefits and development to Queensland. The thing that is of concern is that people wishing to create sensitive developments in those areas are frightened away at the mere thought of having to get through the maze of bureaucracy and red tape that goes on in dealing with Aboriginal and environmental claims.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not suggesting that those two areas are not important. What I am saying is that it is very difficult for private companies to get involved and to understand what needs to be done. That is where I think both the State and Federal governments need to take a lead. They need to show some leadership in dealing with conservation and Aboriginal matters in Cape York and pave the way for private developers to get involved in the space base in those areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I would ask that Senator Schacht, in his new capacity as the relevant Minister, seriously give some thought to making some sort of announcement which would encourage people to develop in those areas sensitively and in compliance with environmental and Aboriginal concerns, to get the Government to say that it will lead the way on those issues and in that way encourage development in those areas. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In many ways it is disappointing that we come back to the first formal day of Parliament to find that not only is the Government on the ropes but that all its bad habits have gone from bad to worse. It seems to me that what we have already had in Question Time today from Senator Collins&mdash;I will come to some of Senator Evans's legal opinions later&mdash;is a redefinition of the principle of ministerial responsibility. Senator Collins would have us believe that there is a presumption of ministerial idiocy. In other words, we ought to treat a Minister as knowing nothing about anything. He ought to be entitled to be informed about any change in policy, administration or anything that might be of interest to him because we can presume that he is a complete idiot.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not dealing with a tyro; we are not dealing with someone who has just come into the job and done quite well in a short period of time. It is quite the opposite. Here is a bloke who has been on board for about three years, with all the perks of office and all the rewards that go with being a Minister, but a man who has an abject unwillingness to accept any of the responsibilities of high office. That is not just a personal tragedy; it is also a very serious matter of concern for the Parliament and the administration of government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to demolish at the outset the preposterous nonsense that Senator Collins keeps trotting out that if we do not have a merit based system, we must have a price based allocation system in which no Minister can have any part to play. In other words, `Don't dare ask me to intervene in any shape or form, because if I did that I would be accused of favouring my mates, and that is the last thing I want to do'. One does not have to be a complete idiot to understand that the terms and conditions of the administrative arrangements can be defined without in any shape or form favouring any of the participants. If the Jack Waterford principle has any relevance, it is simply that Ministers should not intervene in tenders and do so at their peril if they want to advantage one or more of the parties. That is completely different from the concept of ministerial responsibility for what goes on in Senator Collins's department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us start where we should start in all these matters, and that is at the beginning. The beginning is section 93 of the Broadcasting Services Act. It says that the Minister is to determine in writing a price based allocation system. It does not say that it is up to the junior bureaucrat to do it. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Collins" NAMEID="OF4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator Collins</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That means I do it myself, does it? What nonsense!</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is precisely what it does not mean. Senator Collins wants to see these things in black and white. He used to be a jockey; I suppose there were weighty reasons why he gave that game away. I assure him that he is a real lightweight when it comes to media law. He clearly does not understand the difference between being involved in every little detail and accepting responsibility for what others do in his department.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What that section states is a very hallowed principle. `The Minister is to determine' means that the Minister is fixed with ultimate responsibility. It does not go on and spell out, chapter and verse, how to do these things; it simply leaves it to the discretion of the Minister, taking advice from the department and any outside experts that he chooses to rely on. But if he adopts the approach of closing his eyes and saying, `Today is the 19th of January and I've got much better things to do in the Northern Territory. I'm the State President of the ALP; I've got a lot of mobile polling booths to run around. All I'll do is sign a document put in front of me. I'll do it on a wing and a prayer, hoping that if there is anything of any significance the department will bring it to my attention'. That is not the basis on which the Minister is paid a very good salary. He is paid to exercise some individual judgment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not put people into ministerial offices&mdash;normally, anyway; and we certainly would not on our side&mdash;unless we think they have some degree of competence. It follows from that that we expect them to exercise judgment and discretion. We expect them to read what is put in front of them, not to adopt the Jim Cairns defence and say, `I know it involved $4,000 million, but really I was in a bit of a hurry'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about all the stuff that was given us today? Senator Collins said, `I get 200 ministerial submissions a week. I'm a very busy boy. I should therefore be entitled to be told of anything of any significance so I can just claim all the credit. I'll sign everything in sight. Anything you put on my table, you can get my signature on it, as long as you haven't warned me not to. If it looks good, of course I'll be all over the front page claiming the credit'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have quite the opposite situation here. Not only do we have a bloke who says, `I don't bother reading the documents', but apparently he does not even read the newspapers. I could understand why he is not reading the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> when it has headlines like `Collins' job on line over pay television fiasco', but most people would say that in this job reading the newspapers is not an optional extra. One normally reads them to see what is going on. If the Minister chooses not to want to know what is going on, it is perfectly consistent with the approach he took in signing the determination&mdash;and sign it he did because he was required by law to sign it. In signing that document, he was spelling out the parameters of the administrative arrangements to be put in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Bishop pointed out to me a moment ago, Minister Collins signed under section 93. Section 92 of the Act actually applied to MDS licences and it has no more or less ambit than section 93&mdash;it says `may' instead of `must'. Section 92A(1) states, `The Minister may determine . . . a price-based allocation system'. That means that it is up to the Minister to work out how to do it, and that is what he did. He took advice&mdash;if one could call it advice&mdash;and he asked his department to provide him with a form of determination, to which he put his name. One should not have a glass of beer in one hand and a blindfold in the other and say, `Where do I sign?'. One should actually read the document. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Collins" NAMEID="OF4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator Collins</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I don't actually drink, Senator Alston.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Then Senator Collins obviously had the blindfold in both hands. His defence is, `I looked at this, but I did not appreciate the significance of it'. Again, that is an appallingly weak defence because the Minister's obligation is to read the document thoroughly, take advice if he does not understand it, but, most of all, not to do these things in a vacuum.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Collins is not the new boy; he has been around for a while. He ought to remember the FM radio licence fiasco when Bond Media bid $23 million, fell over, forfeited about $100 and the next in line had to pay only $10 million to get the licence. That was an absolute farce. In the 1980s we were a laughing-stock because of that sort of behaviour. We chose, quite rightly, not to go for beauty contests, for all the reasons Senator Collins mentioned. We went for price-based allocation systems, but we did it on particular terms. As the Minister well knows, and as he should have known because he was the presiding Minister, we did it in relation to the third mobile telephone licence and also we did it in MDS. If there is one thing Senator Collins should have learnt in his term as Minister for Communications, it is that a price-based allocation system on previous occasions has involved the payment of a substantial up-front deposit. So there can be no argument that it is within the power of the Minister, the department, or both, to prescribe just that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Do not let us have any nonsense that somehow, because this is a price-based system, the Minister is not entitled to attach any terms and conditions. There are eight pages here, all spelling out the way in which it is to be done. One of the obvious terms and conditions was precisely that it not favour any of the parties. Indeed, why does the Minister at this stage, half way through the game, want to change the rules  and to introduce an amendment which would now require the successive bidders, if the first lot fall over, to come up with 5 per cent? He is doing that because he concedes that it is perfectly proper to do it. In other words, it should have been done in the first instance. Why was it not done in the first instance? It was not done because someone else is to blame. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the past four or five days Senator Collins has vilified, castigated and kicked to death his own department, and now he says, `I will ask them to conduct an inquiry into themselves'. In other words, he is asking them to sign their own death warrant. That again, I would have thought, is so manifestly unfair that it is unconscionable. Again, the Minister is trying to deflect attention from his statutory obligations. He is the one required to spell out the ambit and the parameters. He is the one who manifestly has failed to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All I can say is that there could not be a clearer case of failure to exercise ministerial responsibility. It is worth just looking briefly at a couple of examples of how this has been defined. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come to him in a moment. If Senator Collins had read the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>, he would have seen one of the greatest backhanded compliments one could have in this game. It is the Bill Hayden line. Tom Burton goes through it and explains why poor old Senator Collins has to go. He says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Collins signed a determination outlining rules for the tender. It may well be his death warrant as a minister.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.  .  .  .</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Cabinet had four chances over a period of two years to reject the new system.</PARA>
<PARA>He continues:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now wriggling on the hook, he has told Opposition Senators he will have a high-level departmental inquiry into how the omission occurred.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . .</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That would be far too easy. It is standard political play for a Minister under siege to blame the bureaucrats but, if the concept of ministerial responsibility is to have any meaning, then the evidence leaves no other conclusion than that Collins has to go.</PARA>
<PARA>Then, of course, he makes the point that Senator Collins has prior convictions. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Collins cannot claim he is a first-time offender.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He clearly never understood the impact of microwave technology.</PARA>
<PARA>We know of that absolute fiasco where he got himself in court, having to commit pious perjury and pretend that somehow it was all his decision, when we know who threatened to rip whose arms off and to what extent the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) called the shots on that little issue. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;But, as Senator Hill quite rightly says, that is a debate for another day. Going to Senator Collins's second prior conviction&mdash;and Tom Burton says in passing, of course, that that was a massive overreaction&mdash;he says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Collins was also the minister who presided over the debacle surrounding the tender for the Civil Aviation Authority's new air traffic control system. He not only presided over it, but strongly endorsed a process&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>which was subsequently described as unsound and unfair.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tom Burton comes to the Bill Hayden line, which I always remember because I remember this cartoon of Bill Hayden. They are all outside the Caucus and this bloke comes up to Bill and he says, `Bill, you're in big trouble. They all reckon you're a good bloke'. And that is what Tom Burton says. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Collins is the sort of politician everyone likes.</PARA>
<PARA>I would not go that far. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An intelligent and genuinely nice bloke&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>Again, I suppose he is trying to let down Senator Collins gently. But we can understand the thrust. He is basically saying, `A good bloke out of his depth shouldn't be in the big league and really should get back to running that Opposition in the Northern Territory, where they want him to go quick smart'. He has not taken the offer as yet, as I understand it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, when we look at what the concept of ministerial responsibility really means, I can do no better than to go back to the dark days of 1982 when Senator Durack was under siege in relation to the activities of a junior clerk. We had the likes of Senator Evans trotting out the doctrine of ministerial responsibility, quoting Malcolm Fraser. He said about Ministers:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They ought to be aware of all the major matters and therefore can be clearly and directly responsible for them. But if a major blunder occurred in a department&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and I would have thought that is precisely what Senator Collins has been saying in recent days&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">of real importance to Australia&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and again we are talking, as I recall, in Senator Collins's terms, about 4,000 jobs and hundreds of millions of dollars; so it is of real importance if he wants to try to cure that Budget deficit, hoping to get his $389 million before the Budget&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . if the Minister were unaware of it, that minister should accept responsibility for the mistakes of his department and offer to resign.</PARA>
<PARA>That principle is not just one that Jack Waterford thinks is a good idea; all the writers on the subject say the same thing. We could not do better than go to a luminary of the stature of a chap called Robert James Lee Hawke. In deploring the reduction of the concept of ministerial accountability, he said that resignation was required of a Minister where a significant act or omission was theirs, or was taken at their personal discretion, or was a matter about which they obviously should have known and done something. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What lawyers talk about is actual or constructive knowledge. In other words, if Senator Collins did not know, he ought to have known. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is precisely what Senator Collins ought to have known. He presided over MDS, he presided over the third mobile licence, he knew that they both attracted a substantial up-front deposit, and yet he signed the very document that did not allow that to happen. He simply required the payment of a mickey mouse $500. Indeed, as someone said to me yesterday, `You wouldn't believe this, but they didn't even want a bank cheque. I asked them if they would take a personal cheque and they said yes, that would be all right.' So one could even bounce one's own cheque. One would not even be up for $500, if one did not want to be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have is probably the clearest possible case. Again, just looking at what some of the journalists have been writing, the question now gripping Canberra is who should be held responsible for the process. If Senator Collins had his way, it would be everyone but himself. He started off by saying it was the Opposition, then it was the Senate, and now it is the department. He is running out of scapegoats. I would have thought that, apart from being utterly irresponsible, it is a shameless performance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Senator Collins understands the very basic distinction, which he seems to show no interest in understanding today, between a merit-based and price-based system, I hope he will not have the temerity to stand up and say that a price-based allocation system would not have allowed him to attach any preconditions. The obvious precondition was to pay the 5 per cent. He could also have required the companies to be incorporated for at least three months, which would have taken one of these players out of the game immediately. He could have required that people did not have criminal convictions. He could have required that the people involved in those companies had at least filed an annual return. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Fischer talked about mysterious people coming to Canberra and fixing it up. All those statements were totally baseless. Today, in an interesting interview on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS>, Senator Alston said that I was negligent. That was the charge laid by him. Why did he say I was negligent? Because I had not intervened to put on five per cent or $5 million as a precondition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a very great regard for this Parliament, for any Parliament, and for ministerial responsibility. The Senate cannot possibly make a harder judgment on me than I continually make on myself in that regard. In my view it involves three elements: first, a Minister behaving with propriety and, second, a Minister behaving responsibly in every sense of that word. Those two issues cover matters such as deliberately misleading a House. In my view, when a Minister fails in those two elements it is a hanging offence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We then come to the third element, that of competence, which also is important. That is where one gets into the highly subjective area of ministerial responsibility. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The charge that has been laid against me today is based on competence. I have been accused by Senator Alston&mdash;he has laid it out today by going round and round on the same subject 50 times&mdash;that I was not exercising due diligence by sitting down like a corporate lawyer and second-guessing the department. Of course, I could not have done it unless I had had the intention of making some changes. I will put the question of propriety and responsibility on the charge because, while Senator Alston has only accused me of negligence, other people have accused me of plenty more, to the extent of formally doing so in the Federal Court. That charge is still sitting there awaiting a determination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were three avenues to that court case. The first two related to the narrow legal question of whether the determination that I issued in January was lawful. It will be an interesting test. I received advice from the department that it was lawful. Subsequently that advice was confirmed by the Attorney-General's Department, with the concurrence of the Commonwealth Solicitor-General, Mr Rose, that it was lawful. But, as Senator Alston knows better than I do, the Federal Court will finally determine that matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Alston should have a look at the third avenue which is in the applicant's submissions. I might add that the matter was a very public process in that the courtroom was full of press, and the transcripts of proceedings are publicly available. This third avenue went to the most serious charge that can be laid against a Minister in relation to any matter, and that is abuse of public office&mdash;misfeasance. All the horrendous allegations&mdash;that the Prime Minister did this and he ordered me to do that&mdash;were baseless. Senator Alston knows that this was the political context in which this process was going ahead. Those allegations are all garbage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite making all those allegations in writing to the Federal Court, I was not called to give evidence. I did not have to give evidence. Counsel acting for me said, `Look, if there is no requirement for you to appear in the court, it is a matter for you entirely. We're perfectly happy to go to the court, but on the written evidence there are no grounds for making these charges. It is a matter for your decision as to whether you go'. I have a very simple view of the Australian judicial system, and I still hope that I will die holding the view. My view is that if one knows that the charge is false and one goes to court and tells the truth, one will have nothing to fear from an Australian court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having spent 16 years in public office, I did not relish the prospect of going to court. I have never been to court and been cross-examined under oath. In court criminal sanctions apply to anybody who seeks to mislead. I went to the court and I was cross-examined for three hours on those first two tests of ministerial responsibility; that is, the propriety of how I behaved. It is all there in the transcript. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason I am making this point is that there is hardly anything left that can be turned up. We have been FOI' d to death. All the documents are in the Federal Court and, as a result of court orders, they are also in the hands of the press. I will make sure, and I have asked the secretary of the department to do so, that the two or three bits of paper that have happened since then will also be provided to Senator Alston or the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that this is the appropriate debate in which to canvass this matter. As Senator Alston knows, he cannot be cute and just say, `I've only accused you of incompetency'. He knows perfectly well what this debate is about. Just have a look at what has been said in the press in the last 48 hours. I picked up a story the other day that said that we changed the process. The latest one of putting in amendments as a result of industry pressure to fix the figure at five per cent is absolute nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the question of negligence, Senator Alston asks, `Why did I not just shove $5 million onto it; that would not have made any difference?'. That is not how it would have been judged in here or anywhere else. I immediately would have been asked, `Why, of your own volition, did you want to second-guess this department, which during your time as Minister has had an impeccable record'&mdash;and it has&mdash;`of letting major broadcasting tenders for radio, television and telecommunications?'. We have just banked the $70 million from the third mobile licence. Senator Alston is enough of a politician to know that that is true. I had absolutely no reason to believe in a real sense that the department would not carry out the mechanics of this process in the same competent way that it has carried out the mechanics of major tenders since I have been a Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Was there any systemic failure? In other words, was there something that a Minister could properly be responsible for? Had a Minister been alerted to a consistent flow of mistakes through the department? No. What is the procedure, Senator Alston? The honourable senator knows that it is not a procedure that operates just in my office; it operates in any Minister's office, and I have checked it. As one Minister said to me, unless it is specifically flagged that the department is going to vary previous procedure in terms of process, of course a Minister does not assume that it is. The procedure is quite simple and I am very familiar with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The department has a responsibility, even with minor variations, to seek approval specifically, not just to provide a piece of paper saying, `Here is an outline of the process'. I might add that there is no reason for me to make any assumption that that was the total process. That is not good enough, and it is not. It has to be specifically flagged that it is going to be changed. Well, it was not. Was there any systemic failure? No, but there was a failure in this case and I have taken the appropriate action. So that is the situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What did I know about the process? The determination arrived in my Darwin office. Although it was two months before the election, I actually was not running around mobile polls, Senator Alston. Almost all of my ministerial staff were on leave because&mdash;and I think most other Ministers would probably have this arrangement&mdash;January is the only time of the year that they can get a break. I am glad that Senator Alston at least agrees with that. Last year was a pretty hard year&mdash;not that that is an element of this at all. I am simply describing exactly what happened. I knew what had previously happened. I knew that the department's communication selection team had been working on this. I knew that internal advice had been flowing backwards and forwards between the Attorney-General's Department, checking out the validity of the process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I received the determination. I got a phone call from the department&mdash;I actually took the call myself because I had only one secretary in the Darwin office&mdash;asking, `Is the determination there?'. I said, `Yes.' I asked, `Has it been cleared by Attorney-General's?'. I was told, `Yes, it has been cleared by Attorney-General's; indeed, there is written advice to that effect'. I signed the determination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Alston asserts&mdash;and he knows this is unreal&mdash;that I should have sat down with that determination, like a corporate lawyer&mdash;which, of course, I am not; but I would not have done it anyway&mdash;and assumed that the process was flawed and that I should have second-guessed the department and said, `Hang on, is this condition in the industry bit at variance?'. Of course, that is absolute nonsense. I saw the $500, as Senator Alston knows perfectly well, because I briefed him on it. I assumed it was nothing else&mdash;and it is&mdash;but a lodgment fee. Can I just say this now: there was no deposit. That was the decision that was taken. There was no deposit asked for. And it is breathtaking. It was simply a paper shuffling charge. That is all that I assumed it was, and that is in fact what the secretary of the department has advised me it was. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me just say this&mdash;perhaps this is taking ministerial responsibility too far, but I do not think so: not only had I made an absolute decision, and I think in all the political circumstances reasonably, that I was not going to change a comma or a full stop in the process for this particular tender, but I told the senior private secretary in my office last year that I did not want any member of my office to interfere with the process that was going&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not the document, Senator Alston. As I said, I was not going to sit down with that document. I checked the document for completeness. I signed it, but I had no intention of sitting down like a corporate lawyer and second-guessing it with the intention of changing it. Of course, as Senator Alston knows, the department's original position on this would have been a matter of record and my changes would have been a matter of record. I might also add that to the best of my knowledge no other Minister, certainly in my time in the portfolio, has ever done such a thing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can just imagine the questions. If I had done that, if in Darwin I had said, off the top of my head, $5 million, as Senator Alston is suggesting, and if after I had done that&mdash;and let us get down to the bottom line&mdash;the Packer-Murdoch consortium had won it and, even worse, the Packer-Murdoch consortium had been one of the few bids even put in, I know what the questions would have been. `Senator Collins, has your department handled tenders in broadcasting worth hundreds of millions of dollars while you have been in the portfolio?'. Answer&mdash;`Yes'. `Have they done it competently and efficiently in accordance with good business practice?'. `Yes'. `Have you ever intervened or altered the process of any previous tender?'. `No'. `To your knowledge has any other Minister done so?'. `No'. `Why did you choose this particular tender for pay TV?'. I am being buried with accusations in the press&mdash;and do not think that that sort of thing does not get to you after a while; it does&mdash;on absolutely baseless grounds that I was setting up the process myself for the benefit of a certain few. Of course, this would have been said, and Senator Alston knows it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Was it reasonable of me, under all the circumstances, to have assumed that the department would capably carry out the process of a tender in the way in which it had on every previous occasion that I had been involved with the portfolio. Only a reasonable person&mdash;and I am not going to find any across the chamber today&mdash;would say `Yes'. Was it reasonable of me, in all of the political circumstances of the time, to treat this tender with particular care and, based on the assumption I have just talked about, take the decision that I was not going to be seen to be interfering in any way?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is easy for Senator Alston to say, `You could have put in $5 million; it would not have upset anybody'. Do not tell me it would not have. I would have been in here answering questions such as, `On the basis of what advice did you put $5 million in, Senator Collins, when your department did not want to exclude this company or that company? Why was it not $2 million? Why was it not $1 million?'. Of course that would have happened and Senator Alston knows it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I think it was reasonable of me. As I said earlier today in Question Time, this is not a very pleasant process for anybody, but I would rather be in here copping flack for not intervening in the department's processes&mdash;as far as I am concerned, I can do that with conviction&mdash;than trying to defend what I would have thought in terms of real ministerial responsibility was indefensible. Had I taken the decision to interfere in the administration, the mechanics, of a tender process, where I had not done so in respect of any other tender lodged in the department, do not tell me what would have been said in the press. I know perfectly well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Did I have any reason to believe that they changed the form of process? No. Was the routine that I was used to and to the best of my knowledge had been performed on every other occasion? Where there is substantial change&mdash;and how substantial could one get than this&mdash;is the department required to specifically seek approval for that variation in process? I have since discovered&mdash;and I did not know it until this happened&mdash;that there is a requirement in fact to do that within the department and to flag such advice to the secretary. I do not know whether that happened and, of course, the investigation will find that out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier today, this is, in a real sense, a trumped up charge.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins) for his kind words and apologise in advance because I am about to abuse him. The last phrase in this matter of public importance is one with which no-one could possibly disagree, that is, the one which reads, `the pay TV satellite licence fiasco'. The administration of pay TV in this country has been accident prone, to put it politely, right from the beginning. Let me quote from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of 13 October last year, when I said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are concerned that Australia's pay TV policy is becoming as chaotic as was Britain's when subscription television was introduced there in the mid-1980s. The Minister shakes his head&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>which he was doing at the time; now he is nodding&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I hope he is right. The way it looks at the moment is that decisions are made just before the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) goes before television. Decisions are made at meetings of the Centre Left. Decisions are made in the oddest possible places and are then broadcast</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.  .  .  .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . . and then the Labor Party has to wear it . . .  That is the way it looks to the general Australian public.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the way it still looks. The tender disaster is just the last in a very long line of disasters that we call pay TV in Australia. As far as we can see, there are three basic reasons for this. The first is that the Minister has taken far too much advice from an immensely deregulatory and `dry' department, his own Department of Transport and Communications. Secondly, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), as I said, has intervened in the most Machiavellian manner with what seems to be almost no background knowledge. I hope somebody can correct me on that, but I think I am right. The third&mdash;and the most important&mdash;reason for this is that pay TV in Australia is based on section 8 of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992, legislation which is appallingly flawed and which passed this Parliament only because it was voted for by the Government and the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us get back to basics on pay TV. What are the most basic and glaring flaws in the legislation, things that still have to be fixed up right now? Firstly, the role of the ABC has to be looked at. The ABC is mandated under satellite; it is not mandated anywhere else. If we want Australian content in news, current affairs, children's entertainment and light entertainment, we want the ABC in there right from the beginning, no matter what pay TV system starts up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, cross-media ownership needs to be looked at. We still believe&mdash;I know I have said it about a thousand times in here; I will continue to say it&mdash;there is far too much power in the hands of far too few people in Australia in terms of the Australian media. We do not want to see too much foreign ownership. At the moment, foreign ownership is not spelt out in the legislation. What is spelt out in the legislation is that the cross-media rules will apply only to the satellite. Even in the satellite legislation, the cross-media rules are appallingly inadequate. As far as all other terms of delivery of pay TV are concerned, there is nothing in the legislation and there should be. We would like to see foreign ownership rules in the legislation, with the level of foreign ownership being under 35 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Local content may be the most important part of the legislation. The legislation imposes a 10 per cent Australian program content level despite what all of the witnesses said to the Select Committee on Subscription Television Broadcasting Services. Every one of the witnesses, including potential bidders, said that they thought 15 per cent or more was appropriate. The Minister stated in his second reading speech that setting the level higher than 10 per cent would be an unnecessary financial burden on those people. We still do not believe that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I moved an amendment to the Bill to put the level of local content up to 20 per cent initially. I received no support. The level is still at 10 per cent and only for drama. I wanted it to go across the board&mdash;not just for drama but for news, current affairs, light entertainment and children's programs. We did not get support on that either. Another of the amendments which I moved would have allowed the ABA, after five years, to look at what whether the local program content should be increased by five per cent or more. Of course, I got no support on that either. All witnesses before the Senate inquiry suggested higher levels of independent Australian production were not only attainable but highly desirable. Not one of the potential bidders expressed the view that higher levels would amount to an unnecessary financial impost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about manufacturing content?  Manufacturing content should be high, it should be Australian and it should be mandated. There is something in the legislation about manufacturing content in satellite provisions of pay TV. There is nothing in the legislation for any other method of delivery, nothing at all. It should be in there. So far, both the Government and the Opposition have voted for regulatory models which do not adequately protect Australian culture and do not adequately protect Australian jobs. This should be our real concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Do we want to be swamped by American news and drama at the expense of our own? I can tell honourable senators now that CNN shows almost nothing of Australia. BBC world television shows almost nothing of Australia. Do we want our children to learn the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sesame Street</EMPHASIS> jingle but not be able to sing `There's a Bear in There'?  Of course not. We need Australian children's television, children's entertainment and children's drama. It should be Australian. We do it very, very well and we should be doing on it pay TV, and we should be encouraging that. We should not just be encouraging it but also mandating it in the legislation. Do we want the electronics and the communications work which is going to go with any delivery system for pay TV to go to Australian firms or do we want it to go overseas?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bungled tendering process really has no bearing on these questions, but it is a mammoth mistake. It has to be fixed and must never happen again. The question to be asked is: was this deliberate? If it was deliberate, whoever in the department was responsible should be sacked. They should go. There should be very strong action taken on that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this mistake was not deliberate, we have to find out how it happened and how on earth a tender document missed out one of the most important bits, one of the pieces which is absolutely basic to a tender document. It is so basic, it is like saying, `Did you brush your teeth this morning?'. One does not think about it; it just happens. It involved asking the question: is a deposit required for this tender? One does not think about it; it is just there. Well, it was not there. We have to find out why it was not there. How on earth did it get as far as the Minister's office, let alone his desk, without that being contained in it?  I agree that the Minister should have read it, or read it a lot more thoroughly. I can also appreciate that he has thousands of pieces of paper going across his desk every week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to find out who did this and whether it was deliberate. If it was not deliberate, how can we stop it happening again? How many people check these things? Is it one person or two people? How many people look through it to make sure it is accurate before it gets to the Minister? That is what we want to know. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I gather there is to be a departmental inquiry into this. I suggest that the department gets its findings to the Minister quick-smart. The Minister has promised me that he will table the results of this inquiry. If the results are not adequate or, as I suspect could have been the case a couple of days ago, if the department is trying to quieten down the Minister&mdash;and I am sure he has been yelling at the department and trying to quieten down the rest of us, who are certainly yelling at the department&mdash;and trying to get off the hook, such an exercise will be, and will look, totally inadequate. I can warn the department now that there are terms of reference for a parliamentary inquiry into this matter, and if it does not have an adequate investigation something will go ahead and it will have to answer to somebody. If it does not answer to its own people, it will answer to us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth remembering that the problems now confronting Senator Collins are due, in part, to the position taken by the Opposition. It argued hardest for a price-based only tendering system rather than a merit-based system. I wanted a pure merit-based system; it wanted a pure price-based system. I believe the Government was somewhere in the middle. Unfortunately, what resulted was a horrible mess. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition supported the Government's pay TV model wholeheartedly. The Democrats believed it was a sixth-rate system; I said so and I still believe so. Had our position been adopted, our national interests would have been better served, and the bad eggs would have been tossed out of the tender basket from the beginning. The Democrats believe that there are much bigger issues to contend with than this one. We still want a merit-based tender system which places some premium on Australian drama and industry content. We still want non-satellite pay TV systems to be subject to the same ground rules as is the satellite system. Most of all, we want a competitive system which protects and advances our cultural and economic interests. The Government is culpable in the great Australian pay TV disaster, and so is the Opposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This fiasco is one of such proportions that it truly would be worthy of a script for <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Yes, Minister</EMPHASIS>. But I am afraid that even Sir Humphrey would be unable to get the Minister out of this plight, even aided and abetted by Bernard. The Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins), in his response to Senator Alston, seemed to have a twofold defence. The first was that he was frightened to death, therefore did not want to know anything about it, and that if he did not think about it he felt it might all go away. Secondly, he had in his head some quaint notion of the ramifications of what is meant by a price-based allocation system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We heard a long diatribe from Senator Collins about the merits of a price-based system versus a merit-based system. All of that is entirely irrelevant. Nobody is arguing today that it should have been a merit-based system as opposed to a price-based system, except Senator Bourne, who gave us her personal view on why it is better. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The motion moved by the Opposition very simply says that the way this whole matter was conducted has brought into question the competency of the Minister and the department. The Minister cannot get off the hook by saying, `I was frightened to death, I didn't touch it and it was all the department's fault'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us get it right. Section 93(1) of the Broadcasting Services Act required that the Minister `shall' determine in writing a price-based allocation system. In the judgment of the case of Kerry Stokes concerning the MDS licences there is a section dealing with the history of this case which says that a determination was also required to be made by the Minister under section 92A of the Act, which Senator Alston referred to earlier. It also shows that prior to the power being confirmed on 5 October 1992, the Minister had in another document on 1 October 1992 determined that a tender-based allocation system would be applied for the granting of licences. Subsequently that was revoked and the system to be used for allocating those licences was to involve, in the words of the Government <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette</EMPHASIS>, `tenders for a price-based allocation of MDS system'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point that I am making is very straightforward and simple. The provisions of section 92A and section 93(1) are very similar and differ only in the use of the words `may' and `shall'. For the information of Senator Collins, I inform him that when an Act says `the Minister shall', that is precisely what it means&mdash;the Minister has no option. If it says `the Minister may', it means he has a discretion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having chosen to exercise the discretion under section 92A, I then look at the tender document itself and find that under the section that says `Tenders' it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A tender must</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) be in a sealed envelope with the name of the applicant and the words&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>then it deals with the description of the tender itself&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . state the licence or licences tendered for;</PARA>
<PARA>Provision (d) says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . contain</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) a non-refundable application fee of $500.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the determination made under section 93(1). The determination made under section 92A is also contained in the judgment. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It shall contain a deposit of five per cent of the amount bid.</PARA>
<PARA>Just so that we get that straight, in exercising the discretion given to him under section 92A, the Minister chose to have a provision that the tender shall be accompanied by a deposit of five per cent of the amount of the bid. In the tender document, which is pursuant to section 93(1)&mdash;which is not a discretion, and where it says the Minister `shall' make a determination&mdash;the requirement in the document is that there shall be a non-refundable application fee of $500. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The questions that come readily to mind and which the Minister needs to answer are as follows. On what date did the Minister first discuss the determination that he was to make pursuant to section 93(1) with his department? When did he establish what the precedents for licence tenders were? When did he ascertain what the fundamentals of the invitation to tender were? When did he become aware of the fact that the tender was to differ from precedent? Did he seek advice from his department as to why he was not following precedent&mdash;and if not, why not? If he did not acquaint himself with any of those facts, why not?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will turn to the determination and read the words which Senator Alston read:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I, Robert Lindsay Collins, Minister of State for Transport and Communications, under section 93(1) of the Broadcasting Services Act determine the following price-based allocation system for allocating subscription television broadcasting licences A and B.</PARA>
<PARA>The determination is one that the Minister has to make in an informed way. Therefore, if he made that determination without having ascertained from his department what were the precedents and, when he became aware of the fact that he was departing from precedent, what was the reason for doing so, he cannot run away from that responsibility by saying, `I was frightened to find out any information'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his defence today, the Minister said that one reason he wished to have a hands-off approach to this whole question was very simply that he knew how controversial the matter was&mdash;that he was aware of all the material that was being written and he was aware that it was a matter that would attract a lot of comment both in the press and in the chamber. He said that had it been shown by freedom of information action that he had made a telephone call or queries about the manner in which this tender was to be conducted, he would have been castigated in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth of the matter is that being frightened of being asked questions in this chamber is no reason to abrogate his responsibility. If the Minister is required by law to make a determination, he must do it in an informed way. The Minister's further defence that he has so many pieces of paper coming across his desk that he does not know what he is signing does not stand up, even if that is a defence in ordinary practice, because he has already said that he was aware of the fact that this was a highly contentious matter. Therefore, anything to do with this matter must have been something that he would have looked at with care and responsibility. If Senator Collins did not do that, I am afraid that he is culpable, and the penalty for that has to be paid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The history of the whole business of pay TV has been the subject of political whim by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). The Minister made comments&mdash;which Senator Bourne put on the record&mdash;which indicated that he was quite aware it was subject to the political whim of the Prime Minister; that he was required to act in this area in ways in which he would not otherwise have acted. But when it finally came to this matter of being required by law, by the Act, to make a determination, the only response he has given here is, firstly, that he was frightened of criticism and, secondly, that he either did not properly ask the advice of his department or he sought advice and did not pay regard to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On two occasions the Minister has stated that he has been `FOIed to death'. Presumably, he is saying to us that all the documentation is on the record. When he was busily talking at the back of the chamber, I said that there were fundamental questions for which we require answers in this chamber. They were: when did he first discuss the determination with his department; when did he establish what precedents existed; and when did he find out that there was to be a departure from the precedent that had previously been followed?</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I referred earlier today to the remarks of the Minister's predecessor, Senator Richardson, when he said that he had laid down a model which had been quite substantially changed. I have not been able to get a transcript of his answer because <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> has not been speedy enough in being able to make that available before we got to have this MPI. The relevant point in what Senator Richardson had to say is that he made it quite clear that he would have done things differently.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even if we go back as far as 1989 with regard to tenders for the FM licences, we see that there was a requirement for a bank cheque for $10,000 to accompany the tender documents. </PARA>

Where Senator Collins had no such discretion, he let through this fiasco, this farcical situation, of requiring a cheque for $500, which could even have been a personal cheque and did not even need to be a bank cheque.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak in opposition to the proposition and to speak in support of the Minister for Transport and Communications, Senator Collins. There is an Australian expression which perhaps best puts these matters in context: the more things change, the more they stay the same. Before the chamber was dissolved for the general election of 1993, the Opposition continued to move vague and meaningless propositions that really went nowhere, similar to the MPI that is before the Senate this afternoon.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thought one of the lessons of 13 March would have meant that we would see a change in strategy and tactics when the coalition resumed its appropriate place in opposition in this chamber and in the House of Representatives. But again we see a proposition that lacks an objective, specifics, detail, clarity or any sense of purpose and which can be read only as ambiguous. I believe that the former national secretary of the ALP, Bob Hogg, was right the other week when he said that there is no natural party of government in Australia. But what has become very clear is that there are natural parties of opposition, and they sit on the other side of the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Look at the politics of Australia over the last few years in respect of broadcasting and the media. The Opposition has continually been convinced that conspiracies exist between the Government, the Labor Party, the bureaucracy, the media and some sections of business. We have seen trotted out time and time again in the Parliament and in some sympathetic publications the line that a vast conspiracy exists, particularly in respect of television but to a lesser extent in respect of other forms of broadcast media and print; and that decisions are made at the whim of a select few&mdash;a handful of media barons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Collins made clear, if the decision on pay TV had been otherwise, if the syndicate that involved ACP and News Ltd had proved to be successful, the conspiracy theory would have immediately appeared again amongst those opposite. The decision was entirely different. So another argument had to be developed which was equally false and baseless but which served as the foundation of this MPI this afternoon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Bourne made her usual thoughtful contribution, although it was unfortunate that she was so negative in respect of the matter before the chamber. She made one point in particular with respect to the legislation which governs broadcast media in this area. Senator Bourne argued that the legislation is flawed. There is no doubt about that in my mind. There is no doubt about that in the minds of a number of people in the Government. But anyone who was present on the evening that this legislation was being debated, when these matters were canvassed by the Senate, could tell people with absolute authority why the legislation is so flawed in certain respects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember the evening, or the early morning, vividly. I remember Opposition frontbenchers, including the Leader of the Opposition, Dr Hewson, coming in and out of that door opposite, sitting in the advisers gallery. I recall that at one stage virtually the entire Opposition in the Senate was outside in the corridor being lectured by the Leader of the Opposition as to what its policy was or ought to be or was going to be on this occasion. I do not believe that has ever been reported. I remember seeing people trooping in and out continuously; utter confusion reigned opposite. This was policy making on the run in absolutely literal terms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember the phone calls that were made about the place as each and every clause was being discussed and as each and every matter was being debated. I remember that amendments were being drafted on the backs of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Papers</EMPHASIS> in the chamber. I remember that amendments were then being circulated at the last minute. On occasions&mdash;I am not being critical, in any respect, of the parliamentary staff&mdash;some amendments were circulated after the debate on them had commenced. Is it any wonder then that there are flaws in the legislation?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there are flaws in the legislation, it goes well beyond the responsibility and obligation of the Government alone. The chamber itself was responsible for a number of the flaws embedded in the current legislation. We all remember people on both sides literally being roused from sleep to come to the chamber and vote in the small hours of the morning. With the confusion that reigned and the constant divisions and so on, no wonder there are flaws in the legislation. It would be stunning if it were otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask, not only in respect of the Broadcasting Act but in respect of legislation generally, whether that is the way in which public policy ought to be made for Australia. Is it in the public interest to have legislation debated, amended and changed again in the midst of such fatigue, confusion and foolishness? There is no question in my mind that we can improve upon that. It is an absolute disgrace that the Opposition could not even put forward a coherent and consistent policy. Opposition members had to go out in the corridor and be given a lecture by the current and temporary Leader of the Opposition, Dr Hewson. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at matters at hand. We are really canvassing matters of ministerial responsibility, but what we see in the Senate this afternoon is another example of Opposition culture at play. The Liberal and National parties do not seriously expect to be back in government this century. No-one opposite argues that they will be or that they can achieve that. So we have these kinds of nonsensical MPIs trotted out in the absence of any sort of meaningful policy alternative or any coherent electoral or political strategy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look specifically at matters that are before us. Where is the ministerial failure? It is not in evidence anywhere. There is no ministerial failure involved in the matter. Where is the impropriety? There is no impropriety. It has not even been alleged or claimed by those opposite or by some of their allies elsewhere. There is no impropriety involved. Where is the omission? There is no omission involved&mdash;none. So where then is the failure in terms of ministerial responsibility? It is simply not there to be identified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, as you would be aware, better than most, the Westminster tradition has it that Ministers are responsible for breaches of faith or breaches of trust. This has simply not occurred on this occasion in any of the procedure. Senator Collins has been diligent, responsible in the discharge of his duties, honest and entirely consistent in maintaining a hands-off policy all the way through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look briefly at circumstances of intervention in the past. We can look at coalition governments from Menzies through to Fraser to see examples time and again of ministerial intervention in the processes of the Australian media; first with print and then culminating, in the early 1980s, in intervention in the electronic media. Time and again that occurred. During the Fraser years, there were changes that were deliberately and blatantly designed to favour one group of people over another group. From time to time the groups changed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the Opposition argues on this occasion that in respect of pay television ministerial intervention would have been appropriate; that ministerial intervention should have occurred; that meetings should have been organised by the Minister to ensure a particular outcome or a series of outcomes; and that the Minister's office should have involved itself in the departmental procedure. This, at base, is what the Opposition is arguing. But on the last occasion when a degree of ministerial discretion was exercised&mdash;not intervention in my view but ministerial discretion&mdash;on the issue of microwave multipoint delivery systems, MDS, when the Government took decisions, in my view, in the public interest, what was the response of the Opposition? It argued a position 180 degrees from what it is arguing today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier we heard some examples from Senator Collins of the position that the Opposition took then. The Opposition made claims of favouritism, wrongful intervention and interference in the process to ensure a particular result. On examination, those charges turned out to be utterly groundless. But the Opposition cannot have it both ways. It cannot argue for ministerial intervention on this occasion and remain critical of ministerial discretion that was exercised on the issue of MDS. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the overall context in which decisions were taken on the introduction of pay television. As Senator Collins made particularly clear during Question Time this afternoon, this was an open process, a transparent process. All the documents that are of any relevance are now public documents, either before the judiciary or having been made available through the procedures of freedom of information legislation. The process has been entirely open. There is no suggestion of anything untoward having occurred. There is no doubt in my mind, or in the minds of people on this side of the chamber, that had this process been subject to ministerial intervention, or even the very suspicion of a degree of ministerial intervention, this matter would have been subject to the most massive litigation in Australian history. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a veritable industry of Australian lawyers who act in orbit around the broadcasting industry. I have seen it first-hand. A number of other senators have seen it first-hand. This would have been an absolute gift in terms of legislation had there been a suggestion of ministerial intervention. There is no doubt that the objective of the pricebased decision that was taken was clear; the guidelines were clear; it was fair; and it could be tested as being beyond reproach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In simple terms, from the time that the Government decided on principles for reform of broadcasting regulation in 1991, it has been a consistent and a transparent feature of policy in this regard that a price based system would prevail. The industry knew that, the bidders knew that, the Parliament knew that. No-one can claim otherwise. That has simply been a matter of policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The alternatives, or series of alternatives, were fundamentally unsound, as the advice from the Attorney-General's Department put beyond doubt&mdash;to lay a series of hurdles or preconditions upon the system that was in play, according to the advice that Senator Collins tabled this afternoon, really changed a price based system beyond recognition. It would no longer have been a price based system. If we look at the five hurdles that were proposed in terms of ownership, capability, Australian content and industry development, and if we look at other conditions that may have been applied as well, we see the price based system would have been changed beyond recognition. It could not have been termed that in any way, shape or form. We would then have been having arguments about the method of evaluation, the means of assessment and how the decision came to be taken, at what level, in the department or within the ministerial responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that the Government has had an appropriate response to date. Procedures have been varied and an inquiry has been instituted to make certain that, where there were problems, the problems can be overcome for the future. I reiterate: had the decision been otherwise, given the conspiracy theorists who predominate opposite, we would have had allegations of political interference, allegations of bias, allegations of favouritism and even allegations of corruption. That would have been an absolute certainty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister in no way has let the Parliament down in terms of his ministerial responsibilities and obligations.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> What we have to do is look at the facts, which I notice Senator Loosley very carefully avoided or, when he did come near a fact, treated extremely loosely.

I must concede that seeing the way this Government has administered this nation for the last 10 years, it is more likely to have been a muck-up, because that is the traditional way so much legislation has been dealt with in this place; it has ended up as muck-ups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But for Senator Loosley to pretend that debating the legislation at 5 o'clock in the morning, because this Government wanted to force it through&mdash;to pretend that Opposition responses to this legislation had anything to do with the way this Minister mucked up this tender system&mdash;is absolute nonsense. This tender system was mucked up because this Minister changed by an act of commission the normal processes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am appalled to note that the Minister is not in the chamber to listen to this debate on his maladministration. What I want to know is whether the Minister was aware of the fact that his department was advised long before tenders closed that the tender system that the Minister had approved was going to attract a series of collapsing bids from phoney, shonky applicants. In other words, the department knew the chaotic result we have now got before tenders closed. I know that because I know who told it, and I know it was well before the closing of tenders. And this Government did nothing. </PARA>

If they did tell the Minister and if the Minister failed to act, he is culpable.

It is only after the tenders close that one ends up with real problems. I ask the Minister, in his absence from this debate about himself: did the department tell him of this advice, warning that the process was certain to turn into the farce that has now damaged Australia's status internationally and made us a laughing stock in this area?</PARA>

Had Senator Collins continued with the proper, normal procedure relating to price based tendering, requiring a reasonable amount of deposit, as had been the case on all previous occasions, then of course the only person Senator Collins really could blame is himself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Alston said, it is always someone else's fault when Senator Collins makes a mistake. So now we are having the buck-passing&mdash;but the buck is supposed to stop with the Minister. Why did the department proceed to an inevitable disaster, knowing one was on the way from the sort of collapsing bids from the shonky group which has won this tender, for example? If the Minister did know that this inevitable disaster would take place, one has to wonder what were the objectives. Why was it allowed to continue? Was it a deliberate attempt to destroy the price tender system, in favour of mates, to avoid the sort of protest that would have emerged had the thing gone forward immediately, to the benefit of particular mates? There would obviously have been an immense outcry and, no doubt, political flack. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the purpose of, before the tenders close, putting up a facade of absolute nonsense which is known to be nonsense and allowing that nonsense to persist? Is it to destroy the price tender system so that the mates can be looked after without there being the public response that would take place otherwise? People are now saying, `You've got to fix this up. For heaven's sake, fix it up. It's a ludicrous situation. If fixing it up means looking after the mates, so be it'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One has to wonder, if the thing was allowed to proceed in the knowledge that it was going to be a farce, was it to create a pay-off structure for some shonks, giving them the opportunity to stand over the genuine bidders? These shonks can delay this process for something like three years by having their collapsing bid system. I think it takes 30 days for them to provide the money and up to 45 days for their bona fides, in terms of multiple interests and so on, to be examined by the Trade Practices Commission. In any event, it is certainly a minimum of a month's delay for every application. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that the winners had something like 19 tenders up&mdash;all collapsible, and all, no doubt, buy-outable, if the main players were determined to proceed and to try to buy these people out; in other words, to get them to collapse their tenders because of the costs and inconvenience of the main players being delayed if the system that Senator Collins had approved and signed proceeded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I certainly want to know is: did Senator Collins query the $500 fee introduced by his department in that process in January? Did he ask whether there were any changes from the normal procedures? Surely that is the duty of a Minister, and it is not just the duty of the department to tell him whether there are any changes. Surely any Minister with any recognition of his obligations would ask: are there any changes from normal procedure involved in this vitally important multimillion dollar matter? Apparently the Minister made no such query or request. We did not hear of one today. Why not? Surely not asking is a sin of omission, whereas the sin of commission involves changing the system. That is what we have to underline: he changed it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I noticed that Senator Collins said, `I was not going to change a comma of the submission that came to me from the department, nor a full stop'. That is simply an abrogation of a Minister's responsibility, but I can understand why; after all, the real Minister at the time was Mr Keating. He was the one who was intervening and interfering. No wonder his terrorised Minister, having already been made a fool of by Mr Keating in this matter, was not prepared to stick his neck out again. Naturally he did not want to change a comma or a full stop, but that had nothing to do with the reason he presented today; it had an awful lot to do with the intervention of his Prime Minister in this area, terrorising this Minister who had been made to look foolish in that way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There may be many other reasons why this extraordinary situation took place. It may be that the department decided not to tell the Minister of its knowledge that the tender system was going to be a mess because maybe it wanted to destroy the satellite system concept. There are all sorts of allegations that the department has a level of hostility towards some of the major media players. There is no doubt that as a result of this delay a lot of the major players are looking at other systems of delivery because the satellite system, which requires digital technology, does present particular difficulties&mdash;there simply are not enough receivers for digital technology&mdash;whereas MDS can proceed straight away. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice in the media that some of the major players are saying, `Let's have a look at these other ones'. An article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Telegraph</EMPHASIS> stated that the consortium which was favoured to win a satellite pay TV licence says it will use alternative technologies for distribution. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The consortium believes that it is best equipped to provide a high quality national pay television service to Australians and remains committed to its objective of doing so.</PARA>
<PARA>If the Minister was not told by his department, maybe this is the reason. If that is the situation, action has to be taken by this Minister. A failure to take action, on the basis of being grievously misled, if that was so, immediately he became aware of that is also a dereliction of duty. Either the Minister knew or he did not know, or it is a conspiracy or a muck-up. Whichever it is, this Minister is responsible for it. To try to blame other people&mdash;to try to blame the Opposition; to try to blame the legislation itself&mdash;is arrant nonsense. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is discussing what is termed a matter of public importance submitted by the Opposition in these terms:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The appalling failure of the Minister for Transport and Communications to accept his ministerial responsibilities in relation to pay TV satellite licence fiasco.</PARA>
<PARA>If there is a fiasco&mdash;if there is some sort of sham, some sort of spurious theatre&mdash;it has been demonstrated this afternoon in even bringing this debate to this chamber in the timing which we have seen demonstrated today. Where lies the true responsibility of a Minister? Of course it is to the Parliament, and ultimately to the electorate. Basically, if this Minister is to be held responsible, it means that he has to answer to this Senate chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When was his first opportunity to demonstrate his responsibility to the chamber? Of course, it was after the convening of this Parliament, the drawing together of honourable senators after the general election. The first real opportunity was during Question Time this afternoon. But the Opposition lodged this matter of public importance, crying for the Minister to act responsibly&mdash;which can only mean to this Parliament&mdash;with your office, Mr President, at 8.30 this morning, 5 1/2 hours before Question Time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition was not really interested in what I thought was a very able implementation of the principle of ministerial responsibility, which we saw on the part of Senator Collins during Question Time when he responded to five or six questions, including supplementaries, and indicated to the Senate in a very open and frank way the reasons for  actions that had been taken in relation to this matter. That was where the ministerial responsibility of Senator Collins was well and amply demonstrated at the first real opportunity. But the Opposition had predetermined and decided&mdash;probably last night, but by lodging with your office at 8.30 this morning, Mr President&mdash;that it would claim that the Minister had not exercised or demonstrated ministerial responsibility, and it brought forward this matter of public importance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe all this is a sham. I do not believe there is any evidence whatsoever that this Minister of all ministers is unwilling to answer to this chamber. I have seen him here night after night, in the early hours of the morning at estimates committees and so on, answering questions and being responsible in this democratic process to this parliamentary chamber. That has been demonstrated again today. There is no need for this MPI. It was all predetermined. It is part of the chronology set down by the Opposition, probably late yesterday, and bears no relationship to reality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is all this hullabaloo about? Two unknown groups have been given an opportunity to take on the vested media interests in this country, provide pay satellite television and to provide that sort of service to Australians if they wish to take up the possibility of enjoying television. They have only been given an opportunity. This has to be emphasised. No licences have been given to these two groups&mdash;`shonky groups' as they were called by Senator Michael Baume, who immediately preceded me in this debate. Senator Baume has already made a judgment about the two groups when they have jumped only one hurdle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is still for the Trade Practices Commission and the Australian Broadcasting Authority to make their proper determinations in accordance with law, in accordance with the statutory framework set down by this Parliament. In the meantime, it is true that these two newcomers have been given their opportunity, but they are still just candidates for a licence. They have got their opportunity possibly because they have been able to make an application by lodging with it a small deposit, $500, rather than, say, 5 per cent of the tender amount&mdash;or $5 million, as Senator Alston suggested was appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no suggestion&mdash;I have not heard one indication from those opposite&mdash;of any corruption, any dishonesty, any perverting or any deliberate attempt to skew the choice away from certain candidates who might make an application for these licences in favour of others. There is no such suggestion at all. In fact, I believe it can be shown that at neither departmental nor ministerial level has there been a skerrick of evidence of any corruption in the way that this has been set up. This process has allowed two newcomers to come in, and the cries of anguish from the vested interests in the media have been perfectly predictable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having been given every assurance when he was dealing with this matter from Darwin that the Attorney-General's Department was of the view that this particular tender process and this documentation faxed to him was in accordance with the law, the Minister decided that in good conscience he could sign that determination about the way in which the tender process would go ahead. I believe he was doing so in a way which acknowledged not merely that this document was legally correct, but the matter was much broader than that. It was being said to him that this particular process and the documentation were in accordance with the policy set down by the Parliament. It is lawful because it is within the parameters set down by the Parliament. It is not merely legally technically correct, it is lawful because the Minister was being asked to sign a matter that was in total conformity with what the Parliament intended when it passed the Broadcasting Services Bill 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the Minister, quite properly, considered himself able to sign it with good conscience, acting as a Minister in this regard. Impropriety would have been alleged if the Minister had varied the documentation put before him to require a substantial, let us say, in Senator Alston's terms, $5 million non-refundable deposit to be put in by the candidates for these particular licences. That would have been a variation and would have been a disruption which would have undoubtedly attracted immediate attention, allegations and suggestions of impropriety. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is only my personal opinion, but I would go even further and say that I regard the requirement of a $5 million deposit as taking the tendering process beyond what Parliament intended. Parliament intended that players in the market could put in an application and we would then see what value the market attached to these licences. To narrow the field and say that the only players in the marketplace who could put in a tender were those who could afford $5 million non-refundable deposit would, I think, go against the policy intention of the Parliament, which was to allow as many applicants as possible the opportunity to put in a tender. Then processes relating to the Trade Practices Commission and Australian Broadcasting Authority matters, along with the actual finding of the money, would follow. But I believe that to have a non-refundable deposit as a precondition would raise very serious questions as to whether that document would be in accordance with the will of the Parliament, which clearly was looking for price-based applications at this first hurdle stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having assured himself that this particular document was lawful in the wide sense of being within the policy determination of the Parliament, the Minister quite properly signed the document. Therefore, this allegation by the Opposition is that somehow the department should have alerted the Minister to the fact that there was another possible way of implementing the will of the Parliament. That involved requiring a substantial deposit by way of some sort of fee&mdash;not simply a processing lodgment fee of $500. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe the failure of the Minister to be informed by his department as to that possibility can be regarded as his failure. I do not believe the Minister can be faulted for the fact that the department did not underline, accentuate or emphasise the fact that an alternative way of implementing the will of the Parliament was available and had not been pursued. Nor can he be faulted for not being aware that the department had considered that and had put it to one side or was pushing at a different alternative. I believe that he was quite entitled to sign the documents that were presented to him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What really lies behind the Opposition is a suggestion that, while all the language of price-based allocation of these licences is kept, it really wanted a vetting system to be implemented. The Leader of the Opposition, Dr Hewson, in an article by Anne Davies in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was no attempt to run a beauty contest, no attempt to put any preconditions, no attempt to narrow it at all. Nobody was concerned as to whether they were fit and proper people . . .</PARA>
<PARA>That is what the Opposition really thought ought to happen. But as has been made abundantly clear, that could not happen lawfully within the parameters and the terms set by this Parliament as to how this particular first hurdle was to be jumped by the applicants for the pay TV licences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that even to require a substantial deposit in terms of that $5 million would be to narrow the field and exclude those who could not have ready and immediate access to substantial sums of money which they would be prepared to regard as a non-refundable opportunity possibly to win this tender. That would narrow the field in a way which favours those who have vested interests or access to substantial funds. I believe it could well be seen as a device in favour of such vested interests and against the policy that was put down by this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that this Minister has acted, as I say, in a completely proper way. He has reacted to the concern that has been expressed by requiring of his department a full explanation as to the internal departmental processes which preceded his receiving the documents for his signature. I believe that in doing so, once again, so long as that report to be prepared by the department is made available to the Senate and publicly, he is discharging his responsibility as a Minister to the Parliament and hence to the electorate. I have no doubt that that will be done. In doing so, as I say, he will be discharging his responsibilities as a Minister. Of course, his responsibility is to allow the Senate, with the benefit of that full explanation, to make its own assessment of the propriety of what occurred. That will dispel, I am sure, many of the conspiracy theories that have been expounded, most lately by Senator Michael Baume. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that this matter of public importance has completely missed the mark. The Minister has demonstrated his willingness to act responsibly within the Westminster tradition by presenting himself for Question Time and being questioned rigorously and answering fully and frankly. But, of course, the Opposition had predetermined the course of today's events and has brought on this matter of public importance. Honourable senators opposite have not brought it on, by the way, in a way which allows it to be voted on because I believe they realise that they would not have had the support of the chamber for the passage of any resolution condemning this particular Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to have had the opportunity to speak in support of this Minister. I believe he has discharged his ministerial duties with full propriety and I believe, as I say, that the chamber should regard this matter as one not meriting the title `matter of public importance' because of the way in which it has been brought forward as a sham, as a bit of theatre, by the Opposition this afternoon. I believe, as I say, that the Minister ought to be commended for the frank and open way in which he has answered to the Senate for the matters under discussion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Our concern with this matter really relates to a discussion held earlier today. As I understand it, we limited the number of estimates committees in the Senate to six principally because that approximately reflected the number of Ministers that the Government had in this place; it was therefore sensible that that be the number of committees that would consider the estimates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, now we have the situation where the Government has increased its number of Ministers to 10; on the other hand, it has set only a very short period&mdash;in fact one day, as I understand it&mdash;for the estimates committees to meet to consider what is obviously going to be quite a considerable volume of work. It therefore seems to us to be sensible, in view of the fact that the Government now has many more Ministers, to further divide the departments so that they can be better dealt with in the very limited time that the Government is providing to us for that task. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue that I therefore raise and the question I guess I am really putting to the Minister who is now the Manager of Government Business (Senator Faulkner) is: why is the Government simply limiting itself to six estimate committees when, if its Ministers were going to do their jobs in relation to the estimates, there is no reason why we cannot have eight or even 10 committees meeting and, therefore, more thoroughly do the job that we are to do if we are to responsibly carry out our function in this place? It is really as simple as that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We want to thoroughly meet our responsibility&mdash;that is, to review the appropriations through this estimates procedure; we want the system to work as effectively as is possible; and it seems now that, as the Government has provided 10 Ministers in the Senate, it could be done more appropriately by an increased number of committees. We are therefore puzzled as to why the Government is simply seeking to limit the number of committees to six again. If the reason the Government gives is that that was the practice in the past, what I have attempted to demonstrate is that it was based on a premise that no longer applies because there are now more Ministers. </PARA>

If this is something that the Government has not thought about, could it now do so and perhaps recognise that such a reform would be beneficial to the effective functioning of this place. My colleague Senator Crichton-Browne might have some ideas as to how the departments could be further divided so that the estimates procedure in this place could function better.

This is shown in the public hearings and also, to some extent&mdash;although I do not consider this a major issue&mdash;in the private meetings associated with those hearings. I have taken out some figures for the 1992 Budget sittings which&mdash;and the Opposition should seriously consider them&mdash;strongly support the case for reform. The figures for the estimates committee hearings and meetings are as follows: Estimates Committee A sat for 20 hours 39 minutes. Estimates Committee B sat for 65 hours. This might have been due not so much to the allocation of departments as to the membership of the committee. The other figures are: Estimates Committee C sat for 29 hours 40 minutes; Estimates Committee D for 14 hours 49 minutes&mdash;</PARA>

The allocation of portfolios to estimates committees is, as Senator Faulkner has said, purely a matter of balancing the amount of time that ought to be needed for them all to be through at about the same time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition's need to have different shadow spokespersons attending and different interests reflected because of the mixture of portfolios that are looked after by different Ministers has been perfectly adequately catered for by the way in which it has had different membership for different portfolios within the same committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main point about the six committees is that only three can sit at any one time for those servicing reasons that I have mentioned, and also for the interests of senators who want to participate in them, especially Opposition senators. People have complained that it is difficult enough for people who want to deal with one particular matter at one committee and also attend another one when there are three sitting at the one time. If four were sitting at the one time those complaints about the difficulty of programming to satisfy a variety of interests would be even greater. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One can go to the other extreme and say, `Let's have 19 estimates committees and call them A to P', or whatever it turns out to be, `and have one per portfolio'. That would be perfectly okay as long as we ended up with an agreement that there would be some limited amount of time for each one. It is purely a mechanical means of ensuring that everyone knows when a particular committee is meeting and that excessive duplication of facilities is not required. Six has always been, and I am sure will continue to be, the appropriate number, because three is the appropriate number for committees to be meeting at once. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make a few brief comments about the motion moved by my colleague Senator Crichton-Browne. The debate touches on a wider issue which is particularly important to the Parliament, to this Senate and to the public at large. A range of proposals have been put forward by the coalition to make some substantial reforms in the procedures of this Parliament. Essentially, each of the reforms which we put forward, including the reforms that Senator Crichton-Browne has put forward, encourage more scrutiny of government actions and legislation. Each of those measures&mdash;there are probably four or five measures relating to Question Time, Chairs of committees, estimates committees and so forth&mdash;have as their essence the need to improve the performance of this Parliament and, among other things, to subject government actions to greater scrutiny.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have just come into the chamber and I am not sure how the Democrats will be voting on this issue. I rather hope that as we start the new session of Parliament, and as we have a new leader of the Australian Democrats, we will have this same commitment to seeing how we can improve the performance of the legislative arm of government and how we can improve the scrutiny of government actions. I would have thought that, much as it is part of our own philosophy, it should equally be part of the philosophy of the new leadership of the Australian Democrats. That is why I strongly support the motion moved by Senator Crichton-Browne to increase the number of estimates committees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Coates raised some cogent points. I do not say that increasing the number of Senate committees from six to 10 will not raise some of the issues raised by Senator Coates, such as resources and timing. I happen to like attending a number of the estimates committees. I am well aware of the problems of getting between the committees as issues are raised and as the sections that I am particularly concerned with come on for debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recognise that Senator Coates raised fair points, but they are points that reasonable people can sit down and deal with. I pick up Senator Coates's point that certainly on our side of the Parliament there may well be a trade-off between being able to go around between a number of committees and ensuring that a larger number of Senate estimates committees are in session. Perhaps we would have to put up with four rather than three sitting at once. Those issues can be dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now have 10 Ministers in this chamber. The Government now has the capacity to require Ministers to attend these estimates committees more so than they have done in the past. We therefore have an opportunity, I would have thought, to deal with the sorts of problems that Senator Coates has raised and to, above all, increase the scrutiny of government actions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What often seems happen at the start of a Parliament is that everyone talks about parliamentary reform. I see that even the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is starting to trumpet parliamentary reform. That is a good thing. We should be testing Mr Keating and his colleagues to see how far they are prepared to go. I believe Senator Crichton-Browne's proposal is part of the wider debate on whether we are prepared to listen to the Australian people and ensure that the executive arm of government is more closely scrutinised in its activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats should think very carefully about not supporting this type of measure. Logic shows&mdash;and we now have the numbers on this side of the Parliament&mdash;that a greater number of estimates committees will provide a greater amount of time and a greater ability for senators to be involved in scrutinising government actions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that when this measure comes to the vote we will see a commitment by the Australian Democrats to improving the functioning of this chamber and the accountability of government. If they do not wish to follow down that path, we are entitled to hear good, clear reasons why they do not believe greater scrutiny and accountability should be imposed on the Government. There is no possibility of such a thing happening in the other place where the Government has the numbers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A particular responsibility now rests with this Senate chamber. I believe that we have put forward some very major initiatives in relation to Question Time, estimates committees and the standing committees which would amount to a very significant reform of this chamber. Reform is one of the first tests we all have in this Parliament. We understand that the Government is anxious not to complicate its task any further.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Kemp for underscoring on a broadcast day the crucial and important role played by the Australian Democrats. This is typically one of those situations where the Government has put forward a motion for having six estimates committees. The Opposition has tabled an amendment suggesting that there be eight estimates committees. As Senator Kemp said, the determination of that amendment will depend very much on the way in which we, the Democrats, vote. I again thank Senator Kemp for underscoring the important role that we play in this place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree with the Opposition to the extent that we certainly underline the very great importance of scrutiny of government. We believe, perhaps even more vehemently than the Opposition, that too much power has come to reside with executive government and that decisions are made extremely narrowly. In the recent election, we saw the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) exclusively make decisions which even his own party did not know about until they were announced to the public. We have seen the Prime Minister make decisions on the run by way of press release. Again, members of his own Government&mdash;his own Ministers&mdash;did not know exactly what that decision was until they read about it in the paper or heard about it on the radio. That way of running the country is extremely objectionable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Crichton-Browne pointed out, the shenanigans in Western Australia with the Burke Government and succeeding Labor governments left a great deal to be desired in relation to accountability. The Executive, or a small group within the Executive, was able to run what we now know were extremely corrupt practices, as we know from the inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said all that, we observe that no section of the portfolios will be excluded. Irrespective of whether we have six or eight committees, all the portfolios will come up for scrutiny. Presumably the Opposition, in considering how it will deal with questions to Ministers and senior public servants in these estimates committees, will have the opportunity to examine each of these people and each of the issues. The number, variety and nature of the questions and so on that they will ask will not be in any way limited by the existence of six or eight committees. It seems to me that the question of scrutiny as such is really not an issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the very important issues&mdash;Senator Coates touched on this, but I would like to extend it&mdash;is that each time we suggest the establishment of a select committee, for instance, one question that always arises is whether that committee can be serviced and what the costs of servicing it will be. The same thing applies with respect to the estimates committees. The costs of creating two additional committees is not inconsiderable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Coates touched on the cost of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. If we have to expand the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> services and these committees only meet for a brief time several times each year, what will happen to those staff at other times? Will we expand the rest of the committee system to ensure, as the Opposition frequently claims, that the staff is effectively and efficiently used? Of course, other staff service these committees. As Senator Coates mentioned, video and audio staff will be required so that those senators who are moving between committees or who are otherwise engaged can at least know what is going on in the various committees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In times of significant economic stringency and when both the Government and the Opposition are talking about decreasing staff and making everybody's work more efficient and more effective, it seems passing strange that in this particular case the Opposition wants to increase the number of committees from six to eight. I do not think the question of proper scrutiny was raised, because all these matters, all these portfolios, all these Ministers and all these staff and so on will be brought before the committee and it is well within the capability of any senator to ask questions within the existing six estimates committees. For those reasons, the Democrats will be opposing the amendment and supporting the motion. </PARA>

There is a problem because the Government has to provide 10 Ministers and a Parliamentary Secretary. I am not going to be dishonest enough to stand up here and say that there is not a problem in terms of the resources that we provide, the personnel on our back bench, to staff the estimates committees.

That is a tradition that, because of our limited resources due to the increase in the number of frontbenchers, might be stretched. But not only is it an absolute impossibility for us to cover that number of committees; also I would ask: what would the cost be of establishing these two or four extra committees that are being proposed by the Opposition?

<PARA>I represent Christmas Island in the Senate and have had the opportunity in the last year to visit Christmas Island on two occasions. The community on Christmas Island is undergoing a number of very important changes that have arisen from various initiatives taken by the Government and from legislation that has been passed through this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure a number of honourable senators will recall that the Territories Law Reform Act was enacted in 1992 and consequent to that the administration of both the Cocos (Keeling) Islands and Christmas Island has undergone major and important changes. Many of those have been difficult changes for the residents of the two separate communities. Christmas Island, which this particular report addresses, has seen a number of changes to its municipal administration. The new shire council was, in effect, constituted by the territories law reform legislation. It is now operating and assumes responsibility for the Christmas Island Services Corporation which provides many of those municipal functions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to recognise that two significant events are taking place on Christmas Island. The first is the development by Indonesian investors of a casino on the island. A casino with a capital investment of approximately $60 million is currently under construction. In the latter part of this year I will be watching very carefully the Government's estimates of the income that it will derive from the various royalties and agreements resulting from the operation of that new casino. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am certainly aware that the shire council believes the funding arrangements made for municipal services on that island should be reviewed. In fact, it is asking for a percentage of the earnings that will be derived from the casino operations to fund many of its operations. That figure is of course very different from the figures set forth in this particular report of the Christmas Island Services Corporation for the year ended 30 June 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second issue that is impacting on the island community is the major rebuilding program of the Commonwealth Government. From memory, the figure committed by the Government in the first five-year phase of that rebuilding program is well in excess of $40 million. Naturally, the construction and commercial activity that is taking place is very important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The community of Christmas Island is, of course, very small. There are approximately 1,300 residents on the island, many of whom take up their residency as former citizens of Malaysia, principally, who were attracted to the island by employment with the phosphate mine on the island itself. Of course, there are now many other employers on the island&mdash;principally in the government arena of the National Parks and Wildlife Service which very properly carries out a national park function on the island. There is a very viable small business and commercial sector that is operating and has been stimulated by the development activities of both the casino and the Government's rebuilding program. Of course, a number of other people have also been attracted to the island. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an important report because it, in effect, flags out the old government era of administration in which the principal economic activity of the island was provided by government in one form or another and essentially underpinned the phosphate mining. So it is important that we note this report as the final one of the old regime and look carefully at subsequent developments on Christmas Island. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the coalition's spokesman on local government I was interested to read the final report of the Christmas Island Services Corporation and to note from it that, as from 1 July last year, the functions and responsibilities previously conducted by the corporation have been taken over by a local authority in the form of the Christmas Island Shire Council.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In speaking to this report, I simply want to acknowledge that, from all reports, the new shire council on Christmas Island is operating very effectively and responsibly. I understand that there is a sharp learning curve for members of the council, who for the first time are becoming involved in local government as a shire council under the auspices of the Western Australian local government legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very pleased to hear that the Christmas Island Shire Council has become a member of the Western Australian Municipal Association, which is the local government association in Western Australia, and is also part of the WAMA purchasing group organised by the Western Australian Municipal Association. The Western Australia Municipal Association has helped as much as it has been able, which I understand is quite considerably, with the new shire council organisation. WAMA has sent some of its officers to Christmas Island and is doing its bit to ensure that the Christmas Island Shire Council becomes part of the mainstream of local government in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish the Christmas Island Shire Council all the very best as it enters into this new jurisdiction. I look forward to following its progress in the years ahead and to actually making contact with the council in the not too distant future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the Christmas Island Services Corporation's last report. I have taken over responsibility for the shadow territories portfolio which includes Christmas Island, Norfolk Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. I have visited Christmas Island; it is a very beautiful spot, and I look forward as part of my responsibilities to revisiting the island when I can make those arrangements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The island has a population of around 1,200 to 1,300 Malays and is dependent on the phosphate mine which, I suppose, has provided almost all the employment on the island. Now, on 8 August, a casino will be opened which will create a great many jobs. I believe that almost full employment will be realised, taking into account the people who are employed on the mine and those who will be employed in the casino and its associated service industries. But I well remember about three years ago when that casino might never have reached the drawing board stage; when there was a very close debate in this chamber within the parties as to whether the casino should go ahead. I believe that now the casino has almost reached the point where it will be opened on 8 August&mdash;a lucky day for the Chinese, I understand, which is why that day has been selected for its opening&mdash;and I look forward to being there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is also spending a huge amount of money on revitalising, renewing and upgrading the houses that have been left vacant, as a number of people have removed themselves from the island and set up their homes in Western Australia. The report says that the island will be governed by a local government council. The laws of the island will be the same laws which are current in Western Australia and the islanders will have to adapt to those Western Australia laws. I wish the islanders all the best and look forward to seeing them in August. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>This report into the Aboriginals benefit trust account, which affects the mining royalty equivalents paid in the Northern Territory, is a very important report because it provides the basis not only for the administration of the four land councils operating in the Northern Territory but also for a series of benefits paid to Aborigines, again in the Northern Territory, under various provisions of the Aboriginal Land Rights Act. Of course, it allocates a considerable amount of money. In this particular case I note that in 1991-92, the year under review, the royalty equivalents in revenue were in excess of $34 million and interest earned on investments was in excess of $3 million, giving a revenue of $37 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The distribution of the funds is very important. As I mentioned, a significant proportion of that money is made available to the administration of the respective land councils. It is interesting to note the provision for additional payments. If the land councils find that the funds that they receive as a right under the legislation are insufficient to meet their operating costs, they make application to the Minister for top-up funds under the provision of the Aboriginals benefit trust account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am always critical of the fact that these funds are approved by the Minister and provided for the additional administrative costs of the land councils in addition to those automatically made available by the legislation. When I say I am critical, I mean that I am critical because that takes away from the funds that are then available for the community benefit of Aborigines in a more direct manner and, in effect, they are being applied for administrative purposes. So I always find it interesting to note where those particular changes are made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have not yet had the opportunity to assess and look in detail at all of this report which was tabled here only this morning. I was concerned in looking at the report of the previous year to note that very significant funds had been pre-committed for the purchase of Aboriginal owned pastoral properties which, in effect, compromised future benefits that could be paid and made available. So I will be very interested to do a detailed appraisal of this particular year's report to ascertain the extent to which funds have been able to be made available for the various applications that I know are always presented annually to the Aboriginals benefit trust account&mdash;which are always, of course, far in excess of those which can actually be recommended for approval by each of the regions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again I would emphasise that this is an important report. The income that flows through the trust account is, of course, that which is derived principally from mining activity in the Northern Territory and, as such, provides a very important stimulus to economic activity not only in the Aboriginal community but also in the Northern Territory community generally. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The review of the operation of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act is a very interesting document. It has a very strong connection with the amendments recently announced by the Government in relation to the operations of the ATSIC Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very interesting to note that, in very many important aspects, what the Labor Party Government has done is simply learnt yet again from the policy which the Liberal and National parties put out at the last election. What is said in this report and in the action that the Government has announced in recent times is simply an endorsement of what our then shadow Minister, Mr Michael Wooldridge, put up to the people of Australia at the last election as our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander policy. Specifically, the Government&mdash;and this report makes mention of it&mdash;has adopted our proposal to have an office of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs to give independent policy advice to the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is, of course, a difference between the way in which the Labor Party has introduced this proposal and the way in which we did it. We did it after nine months of consultation, after a discussion paper had been put out and after Dr Wooldridge had had very lengthy discussions with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander groups. The Labor Party has simply made the announcement and lumped it upon these Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The second proposal stolen by the Government from our election policy&mdash;already on the second day of the Parliament the Government is taking over the proposals that we put at the last election&mdash;is the reduction in the number of regional councils from 60 to 36. This is referred to on page 25, item 5 of the report. Another proposal that we put up and the Government has now adopted is to have commissioners working full-time and for a salary. We also proposed that regional chairmen should act full-time and on a salary; again, a proposal that has been adopted by the Government. In our policy we have also proposed that decisions should be made at regional council level rather than in the central government in Canberra. That has also been taken over by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government still has a couple of other things to do to legislate correctly in so far as the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission is concerned in accordance with our policies. Still left to be adopted is our proposal for enhanced accountability. I would certainly urge the Government to look at our proposals in that regard and adopt them in future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission has bipartisan support; certainly it has the support of the Liberal and National parties. However, I should sound a note of warning. It will only get that bipartisan support for so long as it acts responsibly. I was distressed to learn during the campaign that one of its commissioners was promoting some grossly inaccurate statements about our policies, suggesting that petrol and medicines would go up under our GST, when everybody knew that petrol would fall by 26c a litre in cost and that there was to be no GST on medicines. We were rather concerned to see a responsible commissioner going around promoting this sort of Labor Party propaganda. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although commissioners should have a view on matters of current debate, we hope that they will at least express their view in accordance with the facts and not in line with political propaganda that has been distributed around at the time. Having said that, we continue to offer our bipartisan support to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. We think that the amendments proposed and referred to this in report go a long way towards making the commission even more effective. We wish it continuing success. </PARA>

<PARA>In looking at the 1991-92 annual report of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commercial Development Corporation, I would commend the board of directors for the very prudent administration that it has undertaken of this corporation for the financial year under review. I am familiar with a number of the members of that board. I note that the chairperson is Mr Gatjil Djerrkura of Nhulunbuy in the Northern Territory and the Deputy Chairperson is Ms Lois O'Donoghue who, of course, is the chairperson of ATSIC itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In reviewing this particular report from the Northern Territory's perspective, I can comment with some familiarity and knowledge on the project investments that have been undertaken, such as a tourist resort at Kings Canyon in the MacDonnell Ranges, the purchasing of Toyota and Mitsubishi motor vehicle franchise interests in Central Australia, and the Barra Base tourist-fishing lodge as a joint venture with the Tiwi Land Council on Bathurst Island. These are important initiatives for Aboriginal people, not only for their participation in the employment aspects and projects associated with such large capital investments, but also in providing Aboriginal ownership in the Northern Territory for Aboriginal people in the commercial objectives of the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I appreciate that the administration of a commercial development corporation is in itself a very hard task. In particular, I would draw the Senate's attention to the very difficult decisions that the board of directors has obviously had to take with regard to Bonner House here in the ACT. This particular project, which the Corporation inherited, has been taken over and has been fraught with some financing difficulty over a long period. What is most concerning in these accounts that needs to be addressed was the revaluation that was so necessary of Bonner House itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One sees in the report that the Corporation has found it necessary to review the inherited valuation that it took over of $12.4 million at 5 March 1990 as to its correctness and the necessity to revise  that valuation to an amount of $8.55 million&mdash;that is, $3.85 million less than the valuation at which the property was taken up in the books of account of the corporation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many issues arise from the Labor Party's induced recession, and property values throughout Australia have taken a very major impact. I could imagine much of the debate that must have taken place in the board of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commercial Development Corporation in having to cope with this very hard and difficult situation. I note the Board's comments on page 33 of the report drawing attention to the fact that the financial statements:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . attribute the circumstance necessitating such a write down in value as occurring during the Corporation's ownership and control of the building.</PARA>
<PARA>It is my sincere wish that with the now extensive investment in this building and its refurbishment a viable and commercial development will in fact take place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is very important because Bonner House, as many honourable senators will be well aware, is part of the Woden commercial district of the ACT. It has no direct provision of services to Aborigines other than the small community of Aboriginal people in the ACT. I cannot see it providing any immediate employment benefit for Aboriginal people. In changing the commercial nature of this particular project, it is important that any investments of this magnitude&mdash;that is, an investment of $12 million having to be written down to $8 million&mdash;involving benefits that were to be provided for Aboriginal people are not repeated. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA>The 1991-92 annual report of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission is another significant portfolio report. It highlights the commission's third year of activity. The board, the commissioners, the various regional and zone councils and the staff of ATSIC are to be commended for the professional manner in which they have approached the difficult task that has been given to ATSIC in providing many programs&mdash;whether they be in the area of land development, social advancement or corporate services&mdash;for the provision of Aboriginal people throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many issues in this report on which I would like to spend much more time. However, I highlight in the time available to me that, in the report's outlook for the future, the commission acknowledges that the Mabo judgment is something which will now be very significant. Page 16 of the report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Mabo decision has created a new legal context for all of the Commission's land-related programs and policies, and has created considerable expectations among Australia's indigenous peoples&mdash;it has made land entitlements once again a pressing national issue.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Prior to the suspension of the sitting for lunch at 12.45 p.m. on this day, which seems a long time ago, I was developing a very important point in this debate, that is, although the Keating Government has been re-elected for a second term, a number of other senators and members of the Opposition were elected to this Parliament who have a very important job to do, even though we are not sitting, as we would like to be, on the other side of the chamber. That job is to scrutinise the performance of this Government and the expenditure of taxpayers' money, to ensure that taxpayers' money is being expended in a proper way and that the objectives of the Government, the objectives of the Parliament, are being met by the bureaucracy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I made the point earlier in the day that it has been widely reported, particularly by the press gallery, that the power of Mr Keating, in his position as Leader of the Government and Prime Minister of Australia, has been enhanced by the result of the election. It is, of course, more important for the Parliament to thoroughly use its powers of scrutiny, and the estimates committee process is crucial to this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are debating whether or not it is appropriate for the Senate to agree that a Parliamentary Secretary should perform the duties of a Minister before an estimates committee. The particular estimates committee that we are talking about deals with the primary industries portfolio. There are people across Australia who are involved in the wool industry, in particular, and a number of other rural industries in Queensland who will be very seriously affected by the decisions and the expenditure of the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would expect that the drought package, which was recently announced by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean), will come up for consideration in the Supplementary Estimates. I guess the way in which money is allocated through the rural assistance scheme and the Rural Adjustment and Finance Corporation will also be considered by that estimates committee. I think it is entirely appropriate and quite proper for our constituents to have their concerns raised by their senators from either side of this chamber, and answers given by a Minister and not merely by a Parliamentary Secretary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his contribution to the debate earlier this day, Senator Coulter said that he supported many of the arguments of the Opposition, particularly those put by Senator Bishop. He put a number of other arguments to the Senate which were in favour of the Opposition's view on this motion moved by the Manager of Government Business in the Senate (Senator Faulkner). Even Senator Coulter made the point that we would not want to see this becoming a precedent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the Australian Democrats would be doing by supporting this motion is reinforcing the precedent that was created in the last session when the Senate agreed to Senator McMullan taking on responsibilities before an estimates committee. As the Democrats are supporting this motion tonight, they will be adding to that precedent. I am slightly perplexed by Senator Coulter's logic in saying that he does not want to create a precedent but that he is going to go along with it because it is only a sessional order and it applies only to one Parliamentary Secretary. The motion states that any senator appointed as a Parliamentary Secretary under the Parliamentary Secretaries Act may exercise these powers. If the Prime Minister decides from time to time to appoint more Parliamentary Secretaries, Senator Coulter's line of argument is further diminished. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition needs to be even more diligent than it has been in the past in scrutinising the Government, particularly through the estimates committee process. In the intervening hours between my earlier contribution to the debate and now, we have had a detailed and often heated debate about the role of estimates committees and the number of hours that some estimates committees take to scrutinise government expenditure and the Forward Estimates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Page 124 of a recent publication from the United States entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Reinventing Government</EMPHASIS> by David Osborne and Ted Gaebler reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a truism in government that the amount of money in a line item is inversely related to the amount of time the legislature spends debating it.</PARA>
<PARA>I think many people who have spent many hours on estimates committees would very much agree with that quote by those two eminent American legislators and academics. It is very important that senators spend a lot of time and are very diligent in going about their work on estimates committees. I do not think one can judge the effectiveness of that time by the number of hours that an estimates committee sits. However, if the Minister and the bureaucrats who are advising the Minister do not perform their functions properly, that scrutiny cannot take place effectively either. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is incumbent upon honourable senators on both sides of the chamber to take that job very seriously. The Parliament has a crucial role to fulfil in this area. We know the Prime Minister's views about the role of the Senate. He would like to see us abolished; he has made that quite clear. The platform of the Labor Party has also, from time to time, made that quite clear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is incumbent upon all senators to take the job of legislative review, and particularly review of government expenditure through the Estimates process, extremely seriously because, in the end, we are one of the few real, powerful checks and balances upon the expenditures of government.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak briefly on this matter. I preface my remarks by expressing similar comments to those which some of my colleagues have made today: I wish no ill upon the person we are referring to, my Tasmanian colleague Senator Sherry. Any comments I make do not relate to him in particular but to the Opposition's position on this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Campbell and speakers before me have pointed out, the estimates committees play a very important part in the role of this Senate. Perhaps the Opposition takes this matter a lot more seriously because it is, by nature, the role of the Opposition to question and query not only the Ministers but also staff and departments. This year, for the first time in the six years I have been here, we on this side of the chamber had to have a ballot to decide which of us could be members on some of the estimates committees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senators on this side of the chamber are keen to be in a position where they can look at the expenditure and see where money is being wasted, to keep the Ministers on their toes but, more importantly, to keep the bureaucrats on their toes. Let us face it, it is an important part of the functions of this chamber to do just that. That being the case&mdash;the importance that is placed upon Estimates&mdash;it is also very important that the person responsible for a particular department be the person who appears before an estimates committee to be queried. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other honourable senators on this side of the chamber have made the point very strongly today that Ministers should be available to appear at estimates committee hearings, and there is no reason why they should not be. The Government now has 10 Ministers in the Senate. Surely some of those Ministers could make themselves available to give the estimates committees the appropriate status. With all due respect to my colleague Senator Sherry, the fact that he is a Parliamentary Secretary would make it seem that he would not have the clout, the experience or the rapport with heads of departments and agencies that a Minister would have. I also find it rather peculiar that the Parliamentary Secretaries have had bestowed upon them the title of `the Honourable'. I would have thought that, given the attitude of the Labor Party members towards this chamber and some of its traditions, they would not see fit to bestow upon themselves the title of `the Honourable'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also noted this morning the point made by Senator Bishop that Parliamentary Secretaries receive the lurks and perks of the office, which would include more staff and, therefore, more government expenditure. Senator O'Chee made a  point about Senator Cook being very uncomfortable last year when questioned about genetic material and related matters to do with his portfolio. It is the responsibility of the Minister in this chamber representing a department or representing a Minister in the other house to be present at the estimates committee hearings. I feel so strongly about it, having heard my colleagues talking this morning, that I now move the following amendment to Senator Faulkner's motion:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At end of paragraph (1), add "or represent a Minister before a Senate estimates committee".</PARA>
<PARA>That would make the first part of the motion read:</PARA>
