<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. Does the minister remember that on 9 September 1981, when opposing the coalition government's sales tax changes, he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there is a whole series of precedents in regard to revenue measures in recent Budgets which the Australian Labor Party has voted against in both Houses, without anyone raising cries of inconsistency, hypocrisy or constitutional impropriety. For example, to take just the 1978-79 Budget, the ALP opposed the income tax surcharge, the increased tax on long service leave, the abolition of the tax deduction for home loan interest, the removal of tax exemption from Commonwealth post-graduate awards and the increased excise on beer, spirits and cigarettes. As well as all those items in that Budget, we have voted against other items in other Budgets. . . </PARA>
<PARA>Is it legitimate for the ALP in opposition to oppose budget measures, even though, when done by us, the Prime Minister refers to it as `undermining the basic principles of the democratic process'?</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;All that proves is that when I was in opposition I did a lot of research before ever opening my mouth. It is a course that I commend to members of the opposition today. They might be a bit more credible if they did so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course it is the case that from time to time in the past we have opposed particular revenue measures when in opposition. The record is there. It speaks for itself. That is no news to anybody. If those opposite have just discovered that, they are even weaker at doing their research than I thought they were. The point is that when in opposition we never at any stage mounted this kind of headlong assault on the basic strategy and integrity of the budget. The truth of the matter is that any given package of revenue measures has to be passed in order to pay for the budget as a whole. That has always been the case in the past and that is the way in which we have approached this budget structure on this occasion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem is that tax cuts have to be paid for. And they can be paid for only by either revenue measures of the kind that are at issue here or draconian expenditure cuts of the kind that we saw proposed by the opposition in its Fightback package. The budget strategy that we have put to the parliament is one that depends for its whole integrity on those particular taxation cuts being matched by similar scale revenue measures taking effect over the life of the budgetary measures in question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are talking about the whole package of measures, including the second tranche of the wholesale sales tax increases, all of which are necessary to bring about the situation of revenue neutrality over the longer haul and to achieve what we are committing ourselves to achieve, which is a responsible overall budgetary situation by 1996-97 of one per cent of GDP.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Minor marginal tinkering of the kind that occurred with particular measures in the past may or may not have produced the results that we are talking about. In practice, on any kind of analysis of what happened in the past, it did not produce the result of mounting any kind of systematic assault on the fundamental integrity of the budget. That is the difference between what happened in the past and what is involved here. That is why it is absolutely crucial that this package of measures be passed in its entirety&mdash;not just on the taxation cuts side, but also on the revenue side. Unless the opposition comes up with some alternative strategy that is equally economically responsible, it simply does not deserve to be listened to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, it is not a matter for the opposition to come up with any package of measures at all. The responsibility of the opposition and the responsibility of the Senate is to accept the budgetary package that has been put to it by the elected government of the day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fundamental weakness, quite apart from any particular response on any particular measure, is that what the opposition here is engaged in is an attack of a fundamentally vandalistic kind on the constitutional processes that have always prevailed in this country. Do not take my word for it. Do not take Malcolm Fraser's word for it. Take the word of one of the real icons that does exist in the Liberal pantheon&mdash;that is, of course, Sir Robert Menzies himself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth recalling&mdash;I will finish on this note&mdash;that back in 1968 when Sir Robert Menzies turned his mind to this particular question of what was and was not appropriate for the Senate to do when it came to financial measures, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It would be a falsification of democracy if on any matter of government policy approved by the House of Representatives, possibly by a large majority, the Senate representing the States and not the people could reverse that decision.</PARA>
<PARA>He makes a particular point in the context of financial legislation that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The house which represents in the most recent form the public opinion in the country, the house which has the greater financial powers, is the house which ought to have the ultimate responsibility for carrying and passing this legislation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. After listening to that astonishing answer I ask the minister: does he remember that when he attacked the coalition's sales tax legislation in 1981 he did so arguing that the government had no mandate and, furthermore, that it was regressive? How is that different from what we are seeking to do on this occasion? Does he remember also that he said:</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What matters on this occasion is that the government has a mandate to produce a fiscally responsible budget, and without the passage of these measures in the form in which they have been proposed it simply is not possible to produce that outcome. It is not matter of slicing a little bit off here or there. It is not a matter of changing one or more particular individual measures of no great consequence in terms of its total financial impact. What matters here is carving a fundamental frontal assault out of this particular budget strategy, reducing our capability as a nation to produce a fiscally responsible result, not only this year but over the whole period to 1996-97.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what makes this situation fundamentally different. That is why it is that people like Malcolm Fraser and Sir Robert Menzies have been so cautious and so careful over the years to make absolutely plain the proper role and responsibility of the two houses vis-a-vis each other. It is a fundamental abrogation of that constitutional responsibility for the Senate and the opposition to behave in the way they are on this occasion.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BS4">Senator LOOSLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I refer to the upheaval in the Russian Federation over the past few days. What is the government's perspective on the violence which erupted over the weekend in Moscow, including an apparent attempted coup by anti-democratic forces, which culminated in the storming of the White House by troops loyal to the government of President Boris Yeltsin? What does the Australian government believe is an appropriate policy response to these developments?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1626" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the events of recent days have to be seen against the background of President Yeltsin's trying, now, for more than a year, to reach a compromise with his opponents on a way to break the deadlock between the executive and the legislature which has manifestly paralysed the government's attempts at economic and political reform in Russia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did have occasion last week to say to my friend and colleague Andrey Kosyrev, the Russian foreign minister, that his country seemed on occasion to adopt a somewhat unorthodox approach to democratic process. But, of course, President Yeltsin's decision on 21 September to hold elections for a new parliament in December this year, followed by early presidential elections next year, was entirely consistent with the development of Russia's democratic institutions and I made that point to my colleague. What will happen as a result of that decision is that a new legislature will be enabled to consider a redrafted constitution, eliminating the manifest inadequacies and inconsistencies of the current Soviet era constitutional model which is not, on any view, a foundation for a democratic system and has not, on any view, produced in the past a democratic legislature.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What happened then was that on 3 October the leaders of the opposition to President Yeltsin's reforms, apparently emboldened by his continued willingness to negotiate, called on their supporters to storm the Moscow mayor's office, Moscow's television tower and other media outlets. Honourable senators have seen the consequences that followed from that. Having exhausted all avenues for peaceful resolution and faced with these attempts to seize strategic facilities, President Yeltsin had, in our judgment, no alternative but to act to disarm those elements which were threatening the stability of Russian society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday, as honourable senators all now know, after an assault on the parliament building lasting some 10 hours, Rutskoi, Khasbulatov and their supporters surrendered after having received assurances of their safety. We have not, as yet, had any confirmed reports of the number of casualties resulting from that assault, although they can certainly be expected to be heavy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In August two years ago the White House became the symbol of the Russian people's commitment to a new order and a rejection of the old. The fact that it became a bastion of opposition to democracy and a workable economic system does underline the extraordinary difficulties the Russians are now facing in managing the transition. I guess setbacks in that quest are only to be expected. We certainly regret, as the Australian government, that it did become necessary for the Russian government to take the measures that it did to disarm its opponents, but we certainly understand, as I have indicated, the government's reasons for doing so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, we hope very much that there will be no further violence or need for forceful measures and the Russian people will be able to continue their progress toward political and economic reform, starting, of course, with the elections that President Yeltsin has promised to hold. The way forward now can only be through the ballot box, not through the barricades.</PARA>

Is the minister aware that between 1949 and 1970 the ALP amended or sought to amend in this chamber budget taxation measures on no less than 169 occasions?  How can the ALP describe its deliberate and calculated decision in 1981 to block sales tax measures, which amounted to 1.45 per cent of total government collections, as minor, marginal tinkering&mdash;in the words of the minister today&mdash;yet, when we seek to move amendments that amount to precisely the same percentage of total government collections, that is described as constitutional vandalism.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Without further checking, I would not buy a used figure from Senator Alston on this or any other occasion. I simply make the point that what is involved here is a package of taxation revenue measures which do not involve specific marginal items but are part of a total package going to the heart, the soul and the fundamental integrity of the budget, in particular, our capacity to fund major tax cuts and our capacity to achieve that target of 1.2 per cent&mdash;no more than that&mdash;by 1996-97.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the wholesale sales tax second tranche amendments alone are rubbed out, we are facing a prospect of something like a $600 million shortfall to begin with on that particular target, quite apart from the other measures that have been proposed.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The situation that we face now is as I have described it&mdash;the opposition, with its 36 members, and its influence on this budget, quite apart from the support of two Greens, seven Democrats and one Independent. The opposition is mounting a headlong assault on the basic parameters, structure and substance of a budget which this government has prepared with a total sense of economic responsibility, with individual measures that are balanced and equitable in their impact, which are designed to win confidence, both here and abroad, in the state of the economy and which have been put to the parliament in a responsible way by a responsible, popularly elected government as a total package.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any assault on that total package is something that goes to the heart and the soul of the constitutional relationship between the two houses, between the legislature and the executive, in this Westminster system. It is the responsibility of the government of the day to take measures, however hard, however unpopular they may be, and to bear the electoral responsibility for them when it comes around to election three years hence. Once one starts tinkering and tearing up fundamental framework arrangements of that kind, then one is in real trouble indeed.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report is based on extensive consultations throughout Australia. It is a substantial document, thorough, very highly professional and will certainly provide an excellent foundation for public debate on this particular subject. I certainly thank now, as the Prime Minister has done in the other place, Malcolm Turnbull and his colleagues on the committee for the great dedication, great energy and great persistence under fire that they have brought to this particular task. The report canvasses a range of practical options for an Australian republic and has the unanimous endorsement of the whole committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While recognising that the issue is a complex one, the report clearly demonstrates that Australia can become a republic without in any fundamental way changing the current system of government. The government does not have a timetable for a republic, but it does hope to see, of course, a republican structure in place by the turn of the century. It is essential that people have time to consider the issues. The report is now being made available to the public to provide a factual basis for community debate which must precede any change&mdash;for, of course, in the end it will be the people who decide whether Australia does become a republic.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There has been a great deal of publicity about the announcement made a couple of days ago by the AMA of a number of fees that will be increased. It is worth noting that Medicare will increase its fees by just over one per cent from 1 November this year. It is also worth noting that, irrespective of what the AMA may list as its recommended fees, around 79 per cent of all services are billed at or below the Medicare scheduled fee. In fact, over the last year, usage by general practice has gone up by two per cent, taking it well over 70 per cent. The truth is that the great majority of doctors simply ignore the AMA fees, in any event.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem does arise because, with a number of specialists, there is a very large gap between what is being sought in the medical benefits schedule and what is being sought in the AMA fees. Some specialists, of course, charge even more than the AMA fees. Australia will have to look at this problem and work out just what we think we can afford. It is worth noting that, by the time of the last election, when Dr John Hewson was defending doctors in a debate with Paul Keating on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">60 Minutes,</EMPHASIS> that was when the worm turned its highest for Paul Keating. Sadly, I think, in recent years there has been a tendency for the AMA to look like the greediest of all trade unions and to give Norm Gallagher a good run for his money. Unfortunately, that is what is happening again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No-one disputes&mdash;least of all me&mdash;that specialists in particular are highly trained, highly skilled people who take many years to get to the top of their profession. For that reason, they have a shortened working life. I have no doubt that they should be remunerated accordingly. But it is worth noting that the top quartile of ophthalmologists, obstetricians and ENT surgeons, earn respectively $536,000, $439,000 and $529,000. They earn that every year from Medicare alone&mdash;just from Medicare. That does not take into account what they earn as VMOs in the hospital system. It does not take into account what they earn in compensation cases which, for many of them, is a very extensive amount indeed. Nor does it take into account any work they may do for insurance purpose.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is a very good question. I think one has to ask oneself what it costs to run doctors. The AMA has been claiming that the latest increases can be defended on the basis that the MBS fee has not kept pace with doctors' costs.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I refer to the minister's address last week to the General Assembly of the United Nations and to continuing world pressure to reform the United Nations Security Council into a more democratic representative body. What was the general feeling at the general assembly on democratic change to the security council and does the government believe reform is achievable?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1631" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The case for reforming the United Nations Security Council is not based in any way on the ineffectiveness of the security council's current operation. In fact, it has been more effective, more cohesive and has acted with more cooperation than at any previous time in its history. The case is based on a fear that unless there is some change made within a relatively short period to the composition of the council, and in particular to its permanent membership, its credibility may well erode.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legitimacy of the security council really does depend on its perceived representativeness so far as the other nations in the United Nations are concerned. Back when the UN was founded, the creation of a security council with five permanent members was at a time when there were just over 50 members of the UN as a whole. We still have a UN Security Council not very much larger than it was back in 1946, and with still only five permanent members, but with now over 180 members of the United Nations. It is obviously the case that the balance of the security council does not reflect in its membership&mdash;in particular its permanent membership&mdash;the character of the world as a whole or the UN as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an emerging consensus that there needs to be change. My own judgment of where that consensus is presently poised is that it is very much in the kind of direction that Australia has indicated support for; namely, an increase not of a large number&mdash;maybe from 15 up to 20 members&mdash;of the security council, with an additional five permanent members of the council added to the existing five but without there being any additional veto power conferred on those new five members.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I was away there was some speculation in the press suggesting that Australia was embarked  upon some new adventure in this respect and that we are espousing a somewhat unique, innovative, and perhaps a little peculiar policy. It is a view that is shared by a great many other members of the UN that it would be inappropriate to extend the veto power any further. Historically, Australia, through Dr Evatt, opposed the allocation of the veto power to any member of the UN. I think that considering the way the organisation was so deadlocked for so long, the wisdom of that initial judgment is well made out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The evolution of the security council's collective security role has over the years been somewhat diminished because of the operation of the veto power. Misuse of it now or in the future could further hinder the effective decision making process. We would regard the extension of the veto power as inconsistent with the kind of diminishing use we have seen of it in the much more cooperative atmosphere that now exists for collective security decision making. We would not want to see the power extended in that way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, a lot of the argument about reform of the UN has focused on the question of the security council. In my own judgment that is really almost a second order issue, as compared with some of the reform priorities which are necessary elsewhere, including restructuring the secretariat, resolving the funding problems of the organisation, and in particular, on the security side, in improving the management of the peace operations and giving a much greater priority to preventive diplomacy and peace building, rather than after the event clean-up action of one kind or another. These are themes that I was at pains to spell out last week, and I think it is fair to say that they have had a very positive response.</PARA>

Whilst a few of the activities were to cease, the majority of them moved to other naval establishments, principally HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cerberus</EMPHASIS> in Victoria. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Nirimba</EMPHASIS> site, together with the adjoining Schofields airport, are to be sold. The government recognised that the closure might have an impact on the local community so it established a consultative committee to look at alternative uses for <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Nirimba</EMPHASIS>. That committee reported back to us some months later and it came up with a couple of options. One option proposed the establishment of an education precinct on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Nirimba </EMPHASIS>site, with a mix of residential and open space areas and employment uses on the Schofields portion of the site. The other option involved a mix of employment, residential and open space areas across the whole site. The consultative committee did consider a third option, which was the use of Schofields as a day-by-day airport. But, because of the adverse impact on the RAAF at Richmond and on the local community, it did not pursue that option.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of the three options, the most appealing one to this government is the one that involves an educational precinct. It is proposed that a university take up some of the facilities, that a TAFE college be established, and that a senior Catholic college and a senior state high school make use of the enormous facilities on the site. I am not only referring to buildings but also to the many sporting facilities that exist. This would set up a marvellous educational precinct in the western suburbs of Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This proposal offers considerable opportunities to the western suburbs of Sydney. It indicates that defence is willing to dispose of property which will have great social utility in highly urbanised areas. We have begun discussions with the New South Wales government, the education minister, Mrs Chadwick, and her officials, to clarify some of the issues that relate to the operation of the educational precinct. There is strong interest by the New South Wales government, and substantive discussions between defence and New South Wales officials are planned to commence almost immediately. If we can get this project up, it will be of great benefit to the people of western Sydney, who would be using facilities that taxpayers have previously invested in for other purposes.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 30 September 1993, Senator Patterson asked me a question about the effect on age pension of the managed investment changes. It was a question for the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin), who has provided me with the following answer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the simplified rules for assessing managed investments introduced in March 1993, income is assessed at the rate of return on the investment based on its performance over the previous 12 months. Income losses arising from negative rates of return can be offset against income assessed on managed investments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before March 1993 some managed investments were assessed at a minimum rate of return of nought per cent and a maximum rate of 11 per cent. This meant managed investments were not always assessed in line with their actual performance and that no allowance could be made for losses. The new rules are fairer because they more accurately reflect what is happening in the marketplace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case mentioned by Senator Patterson, the minister has had the rate of return on the two investments checked and they are basically correct. They reflect the strong performance of these investments over the previous 12 months and, therefore, improved pensioner circumstances. Should this performance not continue, clients can, at any time, request that their assessments be updated using the most recent rate of return. Additionally, the department automatically updates these assessments every three months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the managed investment rules, the same rate of return is applied to all clients holding a particular investment. This ensures that clients with the same investments are assessed in the same way. If the income assessment were to be based on the price at which the investment was purchased, clients with the same investments and the same ability to provide for themselves would receive different amounts of pension. The 12-month period used to calculate a rate of return allows for some smoothing of the rate of return to remove short-term fluctuations, while not stretching this smoothing effect to the point where it bears little resemblance to the current situation. It is the period most used in the financial industry for assessing and marketing rates of return.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I indicated in my response, the Government is aware that recent statistics show an alarming imbalance in the ratio between infant girls and boys in China. I am now in a position to provide the following additional information.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The statistics vary significantly from one province to another, and even within provinces, and some demographers have questioned their reliability; but even so, the implications are chilling.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I and other members of the Government share Senator Harradine's concern, indeed, revulsion that in some parts of the world, a preference for sons results in the abandonment of infant girls, or their deaths because of inadequate care or in some cases, infanticide.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But I do not agree that this is brought about because of what Senator Harradine has described as China's target driven one-child per family policy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The situation is no less serious in some other parts of the world where population policies are less clearly stated, and in some cases, even greater imbalances are apparent, particularly among third and fourth births.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The problem occurs because of a preference for male children that has its roots in long-standing cultural and other traditions which deny women their proper position in society. Unfortunately these attitudes are unlikely to change overnight.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">China's efforts to encourage smaller families is obviously a contributing factor and the impact of government policy is clearly greater among Han Chinese in urban areas (approximately 40% of the population) who are under pressure to accept a one-child per family norm.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, preference for male children is also seen in some rural areas where, despite official acceptance of two  or, among minority groups, three children per family, male children are more highly valued.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia has invested considerable effort in developing a constructive dialogue with China on a range of human rights issues, with discussions at ministerial and officials level and visits by two delegations of the Australian Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In my answer to Senator Harradine's question on 30 September, I indicated that it was my understanding that my colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Evans, had taken this issue up in recent discussions with the Chinese Foreign Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am now advised that this is not in fact the case; however it was raised by AIDAB officials during the visit by China's Vice-Minister for Public Health, Madame He Jiesheng on 20 September.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Earlier this year, AIDAB officials conveyed the Government's concern on this matter in discussions with senior State Family Planning Commission, and family planning workers at state, provincial and local levels in China. The question was also raised  in discussions with the All China Women's Federation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On each occasion, officials, academics and family planning and health workers acknowledged that the preference for male children was a problem.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They confirmed that infanticide and provision of information on the sex of an unborn child are illegal, but explained that the preference for boy children is deeply rooted in socio-economic and cultural traditions which will take time to change.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In a number of areas, pension schemes are being developed to guarantee the parents of girl children, who traditionally leave home to join their husband's families, care in their old age.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Furthermore, as social controls are loosened and privatisation of services, including medical services accelerates, it is more and more difficult for the Chinese Government either to enforce its family planning policies or to prevent illegal practices.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Harradine has often criticised the Government for its support for family planning activities in developing countries on the basis that our involvement condones human rights abuse.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I and the Government take a contrary view. The fact that abuses continue to occur provides compelling argument for our continued involvement in order to protect fundamental human rights not only through population programs but also in promoting targeted health and education or literacy programs to protect girl children and enhance the status of women.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The increasing availability of more advanced technology is also a contributing factor&mdash;but this is true throughout the world, not only in China.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ultrasound technology is used in a wide range of medical services. It is widely used in China as elsewhere in obstetric and gynaecological examinations, to ensure the correct placement of intra-uterine devices, to monitor the growth of the unborn child and assist in providing early warning of problem pregnancies.</PARA>

<PARA>There is something dangerous about this Prime Minister, Mr Keating. A Prime Minister who is prepared to undermine the confidence in the democratic system to seek to gain some short-term political advantage is somebody who I think is inherently dangerous in that office, and that is exactly what this Prime Minister has sought to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one goes back in history, one will find that, year after year, the Labor Party, when it was in opposition, did exactly what we are seeking to do on this occasion&mdash;that is, vote against certain taxation bills. Did we ever suggest that, in doing so, it was undermining the democratic system? Did we ever suggest that it was trampling on the basic principles of the democratic system of government in this country? Of course, we did not. There is room for a political debate, but the Prime Minister has a responsibility that goes beyond the political debate&mdash;a responsibility to stand up in support of the democratic system and the accountability of the executive to the parliament. That is what he is not prepared to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the Prime Minister who not only walked out of question time today after 25 minutes, having brought it to a premature close because he was not prepared to answer to his hypocrisy or to the shambles of a government that he now leads, but also closed down the capacity to bring on MPIs, ended the capacity of the House of Representatives to censure the government and who is not prepared to answer in accordance with the normal processes for the behaviour of his government. He is the Prime Minister who, when he gets questioned by this Senate, when he feels frustrated by this Senate, refers to us as `unrepresentative swill'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Prime Minister has a responsibility to play politics in a way that builds confidence in the system, not undermines it. That is exactly what he sought to do the other day when he attacked Dr Hewson and accused him of threatening to undermine the democratic process simply because we were seeking to vote against certain government taxation bills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The parallel with 1981 is really incredible. In 1981 Senator Evans came into this chamber and said, `We're going to vote against the government's sales tax bills, firstly because they have no mandate'. At the very least, as I put in my question to him, Senator Evans said, `The government should have gone to the people and indicated that it was going to increase indirect tax; because it had no mandate, we are going to vote against them'. It was exactly the same situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, Senator Evans said, `We're going to vote against these bills because they are regressive'&mdash;exactly the same situation here. They are regressive; they hurt particularly the less well off in our society. That is the way those opposite structured the bills and it is legitimate for us to vote against them in those circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, Senator Evans said, `They are not in the current circumstances in the national interest'. We of course say the same thing. To impose a new wine tax and increase the cost of fuel, transport, carrying through to small business, when there are nearly one million people out of work in this country, is not a taxation decision that is in the national interest. We, therefore, have the right to vote against it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fourthly, Senator Evans said, `They are not vital to the budget because they are only a relatively small proportion of budget revenue'. That is again exactly the situation that we find ourselves in today, because the tax bills that we have said we will vote against amount to only 1.4 per cent of government revenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, back in 1981, it was legitimate for the then opposition to do it and it was regarded as part of the normal political process. But when we do it, those opposite say that Dr Hewson is undermining the democratic principle of government in this country. For that Mr Keating should be condemned; he should be embarrassed and should apologise. Furthermore, he should have the guts to stand up in the House of Representatives and be prepared to answer for it.

If the Prime Minister closed down question time today because he and his ministers could not be heard, then he was absolutely fully entitled to do so. If a parliamentary leader anywhere in the world closes down question time because he is confronted with the kind of childish cacophony or the bordello behaviour we see sometimes in this place but on an even greater scale over there, then any parliamentary leader in the world is entitled to do just that.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The difference goes to the scale and the nature of the assault that is here being made on the whole of the government's medium-term budget strategy and on its capacity to respond with economic responsibility to the very difficult situations in which it now finds itself. The problem back in 1981 was one where the government did lack any kind of mandate at all to introduce new taxes, because that was what was primarily in issue. That is what was voted down in 1981&mdash;the extension of the sales tax to new items which had not been the subject of any discussion at all and which amounted, in toto, to a relatively small proportion, as has been said, of the total budget.

We said we would not pay for them through massive expenditure cuts of the kind that were involved in Fightback. We did make it clear that we did not rule out an overall tax result being achieved which was no different, in broad terms, from the proportion of tax that was presently being paid by the Australian public, all of which is totally consistent with this particular budgetary package.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The scale of the assault that is now proposed on this budget ought to be fully understood because it is really very dramatic. The sales tax that the opposition proposes to vote against as to its first tranche is $600 million. Its second tranche, when that comes into operation, is another $600 million; it is not just one-off, it is $600 million per year. If we add to that what the opposition is proposing to do with the petrol tax, what it is proposing to do with the annual leave taxation proposal, and what it is proposing to do with the wine tax proposal, we are dealing with a massive hacking at the core of this particular budgetary strategy&mdash;not only the balance this year, but the balance every year to 1996-97. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No government in the past has come to the parliament laying out the kind of medium-term fiscal strategy that this government has on this occasion. No government has made it clearer in the past how crucially dependent upon a particular revenue raising package a budgetary strategy is for that longer term. It is not just for one year&mdash;not just to get through a particular situation in one year&mdash;but to craft a medium-term budget strategy which will win the confidence of the world's financial markets and the world's investors, on whom we so crucially depend to haul ourselves out of this particular economic difficulty in the post-recession cycle that we have been in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a carefully crafted strategy. It is macro-economically extremely responsible. It was put to the parliament and put to the people on that basis. It raises fundamental questions, under those circumstances, about the capacity of democratically elected governments to govern. We are not talking here about an American-style budgetary negotiation process between the executive and the legislature&mdash;totally separate&mdash;which has continued for so long and has produced so many manifestly irresponsible budgets so far as that particular process is concerned. We are talking about a system which has worked well for this country for many decades and which has not been subjected to the kind of frontal, systematic assault involved in this situation. It is the kind of situation which, accordingly, needs a very fundamental rethink so far as the opposition is concerned and as far as those who might be minded to follow it down this particular path are concerned. We urge that upon the opposition today. We will continue to urge it every day until this debate concludes. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nonetheless, the concern I have is that if ever a government did not have a mandate it is this government. Senator Gareth Evans seemed to be saying, `Because we did not say we would not do something before the last election, we therefore have a mandate'. No-one in the community for a moment would believe that in any shape or form the government was out there promising to increase the cost of fuel and cigarettes, put up the fringe benefits tax, punish credit unions, whack on a de facto GST and in all sorts of ways increase the burden. It then gave a derisory little rebate back to a few low income earners and found itself forced to increase it because of pressure from this chamber. Now all of that seems to be somehow unacceptable to the government because it is the result of compromise. But not for one moment in 1981 did it ever suggest that this chamber did not have the power, or indeed the duty, to negotiate on bills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we have shown many times&mdash;and we have not had any response&mdash;the precise level of objection is exactly the same now as it was then. That is why it is so utterly hypocritical for Senator Gareth Evans to try to draw his phoney distinction, describing what the Labor Party did as some sort of marginal tinkering and in the same breath pretending that we are the wreckers and vandals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality of the matter is that this chamber has the power given to it by the founding fathers. The numbers in the Senate are as they are because of the government's total inability to persuade the Australian people that it could be trusted with the numbers in this place. As a result, all those people elected to this chamber have an obligation to carry out their duties. If Senator Gareth Evans does not accept that, he is in pretty much the same league as his cowardly leader who was not even prepared to allow full debate to take place in the House of Representatives.

That is the aspect that I want to focus on in my contribution to this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is certainly something particularly dangerous about this Prime Minister (Mr Keating). It follows that the people who support the course of action he chooses to take have something equally dangerous about them. It is a matter of great amusement to me that this Prime Minister markets himself in the community as being pro-republican because, under the real meaning of the term `republican', republicans want to take absolute power away from the executive and spread it to parliament through the representatives of the people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Keating confuses the term `republican' and seems to think one is a republican simply by wanting to enter into a debate about changing our head of state. But the real meaning of the term `republican' implies someone who wants to give more power to parliament over the executive. We saw in Mr Keating's actions in the other place today that he does not want to give more power to parliament over the executive. He wants to say&mdash;and in this he is supported by Senator Gareth Evans&mdash;that parliament's capacity to question the executive is a privilege granted by the executive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What will we see next week if the Prime Minister, supported by his executive, decides that this privilege need no longer be extended? Will government ministers simply not show up for question time? One wonders whether they will even bother coming to parliament and simply do everything by executive fiat. Of course, you, Mr Acting Deputy President McKiernan, know the answer to that. A committee of which you are now a member has recently reported that the strength of parliament, in its funding to both itself and its committees, needs to be restored and improved to give parliament that power over the executive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the Prime Minister today to go into the other place and cut short question time after 25 minutes because its continuance did not suit him is a classic indication to the whole community that this man is not a republican who is about giving more power to parliament over the executive; he is after absolute power. In a sense, that puts him in the category of the sorts of people who would like to revert to the days of absolute monarchies. What a disaster they were. Most people agreed that life under absolute monarchies was a disaster. We have constitutional monarchies because we needed to develop a parliamentary system to keep some sort of check on the executive. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in the Federal Parliament assembled:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) One of the most critical issues to the Vietnamese people today is the persecution of their freedom of religion and expression, which has been carried out by the Government of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam (GOSRV) since 1945. World media reports have shown consistently that this persecution has increased greatly since 1992, when Buddhists, despite violent repression by the GOSRV's armed forces, started asking for `real' freedom of religion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The continuation of the GOSRV's centralised and corrupt structure, as well its failed and disorderly `economic renovation' and its declared loyalty to the atheistic socialism, has seriously degraded the moral, cultural, family, economic and spiritual life of most Vietnamese people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The GOSRV's policy of oppressing religions has, since 1945, applied equally to Catholics, Protestants, Caodaists, Hoa Hao Buddhist members and, most seriously, to the Unified Vietnamese Buddhist Church (UBCV) which represents the faith and spiritual life of 80% of 72 million Vietnamese.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4)  As the rightful heir of the 2000-year old Buddhist tradition in Vietnam, the UBCV was formally formed in 1951 by all Buddhist sects, lineages and regional congregations. It is the sole legitimate umbrella Buddhist body in Vietnam despite the GOSRV's unsuccessful attempt, in 1981, to disband and forcibly replace it with the State-run Vietnam Buddhist Church (VBC), and instrument for the GOSRV's propaganda purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) Despite being held under strict house arrest since February 1982 simply because of his opposition to the GOSRV's attempted disbandment to the UBCV and its formation of the State-controlled VBC, the Patriarch Thich Huyen Quang, a nominee for 1979 Nobel Peace Prize, has been repeatedly and patiently appealing to leaders of the Communist Party and the GOSRV to ask for:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">a) the urgent restoration and legal recognition of the UBCV's independent status,</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">b) the separation of Church and State and the withdrawal of the GOSRV's control over, and politicisation of, the Buddhist church.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">c) the release of all arrested clergy, including the Patriarch, along with thousands of other prisoners of conscience,</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">d) the return of, and compensation for, all confiscated and misused Church properties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">e) open negotiations, free of pre-conditions, between the leaders of the UBCV and the GOSRV to establish mutually agreed solutions to the current conflicts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) In replying to these reasonable requests, the GOSRV has, in the last few months, ordered stricter surveillance of the Patriarch's place of confinement and placed bans on all of his external communications. Whoever tries to contact, visit, help or offer gifts to him are stopped, threatened, interrogated, bodily searched (and in some cases strip searched), etc. The Patriarch's straightforward appeals have not only been ignored by the Hanoi leaders, but have also been vilified as `anti-state', `reactionary', `creating division amongst Buddhist community', etc. by the GOSRV's mass media and its nation-wide agencies, including its own VBC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) All of the UBCV's brave clergy and lay members, who openly declare their support for the UBCV's appeals and who have worked sincerely for the reconciliation between the State and the UBCV, also between the VBC and the UBCV, have been inhumanely and violently attacked by the GOSRV. In the last 12 months, hundreds of monks, nuns and lay persons have been arrested and/or tortured, harshly interrogated, searched, investigated and threatened. Amongst them are the Venerables Thich Nhat Lien, Thich Tri Luc and Thich Khong Tanh (Oct&mdash;Nov 1992), Thich Thien An (Oct. 1992, tortured to death few days after arrested), Thich Hai Tang, Thich Tri Tuu, Thich Hai Thinh and about 50 lay members (5/6/93), Thich Hanh Duc, 17 other monks and about one hundred of lay followers (9/7/93), etc.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(8) The GOSRV's violent attack and mass media campaign against Buddhists' appeal for Church independent have caused suffering to many thousands of people, resulting in increased instability for the whole country. Despite the GOSRV's current campaign to illogically calumniate them and to deceive the world, these monks and lay Buddhists are arrested solely because of their aspiration to be involved and support their chosen church, the UBCV.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(9) To politicise the traditional Buddhist community in Vietnam, the GOSRV has publicly been, and is:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">a) recruiting members for the VBC by forcibly converting the UBCV's moderate clergy to join it, and arresting or exiling other leaders who refuse to do so. (The GOSRV's view of `religious freedom' is not in accord with natural human dignity and heritage, but a rare favour given reluctantly on the terms of the State),</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">b) forcing the VBC to include, in its Charter, `Socialism' as its third aim of service&mdash;the other two, which originated from UBCV Charter, are People and Buddhism,</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">c) creating mutual distrust and conflicts between the lay Buddhist community and their clergy or amongst the clergy themselves by appointing VBC senior leaders to artificial political positions, and by closely controlling and intervening in the limited activities it is permitted to perform training programs such as ordination procedures, seniority promotions, etc.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">d) requiring the VBC to make frequent political statements supporting the GOSRV's inconsistent policies, with the consequence of eroding the VBC's religious identity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">e) directing the VBC to start a nation-wide campaign to accusing the UBCV of having political ambitions, and forcing it to declare the VBC as the `only legitimate Buddhist authority' and its `everlasting loyalty' to the GOSRV. This is whilst the GOSRV is facing huge pressure and condemnation from the international community about its oppressive attitude to the Buddhists and its systematic violation to all human rights of all non-party-cadre citizens in the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(10) The GOSRV's exclusively economic renovation has not, and can not, lead to democratisation or potentials which will allow long-overdue human rights to its citizens, such as freedom to select their own political aspirations, ways of expressions, religions, education, employment, place of resident, etc. The greater its economic strength, the more determined and confident the GOSRV is in its opposition to such a democratisation process and the worse its treatment of its citizens becomes. This causes ever greater social instability and a sense of total hopelessness for Vietnam's future, and more broadly, prevents the development of stability in the SE Asia region as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(11). As its history has proved, if the UBCV is completely free and independent of political intervention, it would be a most beneficial part of, and the best spiritual force to contribute to, a humanitarian and ethically orientated redevelopment process for Vietnam.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Senate requests the Australian Government to:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">1. make conditional the release of currently approved financial assistance, and any future aid, to the GOSRV, on its granting of all internationally accepted human and civil rights to its people, without discrimination. This must be demonstrated by the GOSRV through its complete cessation of persecution, in any form, of all religious organisations, particularly the UBCV.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">2. urge the GOSRV to cease all ill-treatment of the UBCV, and to achieve a mutually acceptable resolution, by means of fair negotiation, of all appeals made by the UBCV's Patriarch;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) not to conduct in any further suppression of those who non-violently demonstrate their beliefs and involvement with their chosen religious organisations;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) immediately release all who are under arrest, with or without trials, because of their religious beliefs, including the Patriarch Thich Huyen Quang and other clergy; the GOSRV should also cease their unreasonable political accusations directed towards the UBCV leaders concerning their appeals and commitment to religious freedom and the Church's independent status;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(c) completely withdraw its politicisation of religion obstinate and its gross intervention in the internal affairs of religious bodies such as supporting the VBC whilst inhumanely oppressing the UBCV or by using the official mass media to create staged scenes dishonouring and defaming holders of religious authorities.</PARA>

<PARA>This report deals with the operations of the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills during the 36th parliament from May 1990 to February 1993. It contains statistical data and analytical discussion of the scrutiny that has been carried out during that period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report should prove particularly useful to senators, ministers and their advisers as it contains an analysis of how the committee has applied the principles of scrutiny set out in its terms of reference. These are reproduced towards the beginning of the report. The report welcomes an increase in the level of ministerial response to committee comments that has taken place during the 36th parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee appreciates the setting out in the explanatory memorandum of reasons for a bill containing provisions that may be considered to infringe the principles. This practice greatly assists the committee and the Senate. Of equal assistance have been the ministerial responses which treat the comments of the committee as constructive, positive efforts to improve the quality of information available to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has paid close attention to the use of ministerial guidelines and directions which result in an abrogation of the legislative power of parliament and of on-going parliamentary scrutiny of the delegated exercise of that power. In this regard, the report notes the committee's interest in the Administrative Review Council's report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Rule making by Commonwealth agencies</EMPHASIS>. A legislative instruments act along the lines suggested by the council would do much to minimise the exercise of legislative power in ways which are insufficiently subject to parliamentary scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report notes developments in other jurisdictions which have introduced scrutiny of legislation, notably a committee established by the House of Lords. In the setting up of that committee, the influence of the Senate scrutiny of bills committee was expressly acknowledged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I place on record acknowledgment of the high level of service that the members of the committee have given to the work of scrutiny over the life of the 36th parliament. A legislative scrutiny committee depends to a large extent on the input of its legal adviser and its secretariat. The committee has been fortunate to have the services of Professor J.L.R. Davis of the Law Faculty of the Australian National University as its legal adviser, and of Stephen Argument and Jacquie Hawkins as secretary and administrative officer, respectively. On behalf of the committee, I wish to record our thanks to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The scrutiny of bills committee is effective only when it receives support from both ministers and senators.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill was originally introduced by my predecessor, Senator Jo Vallentine on 12 December 1991. Following my appointment to fill the vacancy left by the resignation of Senator Vallentine in January 1992, I undertook a major rewrite of the original bill to take account of the criticisms that had been received. I then tabled this bill in the form of a discussion document in May this year. I now present this Whistleblowers Protection bill 1993 to the Senate for its consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The object of the bill is to allow public sector employees and others to disclose, in the public interest, illegal, improper or corrupt conduct or acts that may be of danger to public health, safety or national security.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It seeks to establish a fully independent statutory authority called the Whistleblower Protection Agency, headed by a Commissioner, which will have powers to investigate claims of corruption within Commonwealth government or government agencies made by employees, applicants for employment in a government Agency or by any member of the public. Protection is also extended to consultants engaged by the Government or its agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The major functions of the Agency will be: to investigate allegations of wrongdoing within government and its agencies; to protect the interests of employees, former employees and applicants for appointment to the federal public service; to promote the ethic of openness and public accountability and to support the community perception of whistleblowers as responsible citizens.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Agency will have the power to receive and investigate allegations about serious wrongdoing involving federal government employees up to, and including, the Prime Minister. Allegations to be investigated would include violations of law, gross mismanagement, gross waste of public funds, abuse of authority, substantial and specific danger to public liability or safety, or suppression of an expert opinion, finding or document.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whistleblowers will be able to obtain protection from harassment or discriminatory actions over appointment, promotion, disciplinary action, transfer, pay or other benefits that arise. Possible remedies will include re-instatement, re-location and compensation payment. These remedies will be available if the Agency is satisfied that the person had reasonable grounds for believing that the allegations were true on the condition that the allegations were found to be substantially true.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Agency may approach the Federal Court for an order or injunction restraining a person from taking actions that are prejudicial to a whistleblower.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Whistleblowers Protection Agency will have the power to recommend disciplinary action or, for severe cases, criminal action against government employees responsible for the harassment or discrimination against whistleblowers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Agency may bring evidence that a person has been guilty of an offence to the notice of the Attorney-General.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Agency may also make reports to the Prime Minister who shall cause a copy of the report to be laid before each House of this Parliament within 5 sitting days of each House. These may be separate reports or included in the next annual report of the Agency.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also seeks to protect whistleblowers from any legal action as a result of the allegations they make to the Agency. This protection would be extended whether or not the allegations were disproved, but not if they were deliberately false or misleading. A complaint to the Agency will only be made public if it is found to be true. The Agency will publish a list of all complaints in its annual report that will be tabled in Parliament, however, only the full details of substantiated and true claims will be revealed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commissioner and persons acting under the direction or authority of the Agency will also not be liable to an action or proceedings taken against them for exercising the powers conferred by this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Whistleblowers Protection Agency will inquire into and report on the activities of the Agency and other matters that the Commissioner has drawn to the attention of the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill sets out the process for appointment and powers of the Commissioner as well as the administration of the Agency.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In that regard, I wish to specifically point to several clauses of note in the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, the process of appointment of the Commissioner is unusual in that, while the Governor-General will appoint a person to the position on the advice of the Prime Minister, either House of Parliament may disallow the appointment within 10 sitting days after the instrument of appointment has been laid before the House. A similar process of suspension and removal of the Commissioner will be in force to protect the office of Commissioner from political interference.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commissioner will be employed on similar terms and conditions as are applicable to an officer performing the duties of an equivalent classification in the public service, however the Commissioner's remuneration will be determined by the Remunerations Tribunal and the Commonwealth Employees (Redeployment and Retirement) Act 1979 does not apply to the office of Commissioner.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill is being introduced into the Senate, so I have been unable to include a particular clause because of constitution constraints. I would hope that section 43 of the finalised Act would read:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"All costs and expenses incurred by or in connection with the performance of the powers and functions of the agency are a charge on the Consolidated Revenue and are payable out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund without further appropriation than this section.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This would ensure that the agency would not be starved of funds by a hostile government of the day. I would like to point out that the operations of the agency would still be open to review by the Australian National Audit Office and would remain responsible to parliament for its expenditure through the Parliamentary Joint Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Royal Commission Act 1902, the Ombudsman Act 1976 and the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Act 1986 all contain some provision for individuals to make complaints about government breaches of ethical standards. However, none of these pieces of legislation were specifically intended to offer protection to whistleblowers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration report on the Management and Operations of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade of December 1992 noted on page 56:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">". . . the present system in the Australian Public Service, so far as there is one, allows for complaints to external agencies such as the Ombudsman, the Auditor-General, the MPRA or the AFP. Each review body has limited jurisdiction and complaints to any of them can fall through jurisdictional cracks or be reviewed in too narrow a context.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These comments affirm the need for an agency specifically designed to deal with whistleblowing. As can be seen from other comments made by the Committee on the same page there are further compelling reasons for the establishment of such an agency:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"As the system currently operates, genuine whistleblowers are inadequately protected and their complaints may not be properly investigated but genuine, misguided and malicious whistleblowers alike are still able to secure repeated, often expensive, reviews by different bodies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The absence of a comprehensive system for dealing with whistleblowing incidents probably increases the risk of improper behaviour by whistleblowers while reducing the likelihood that real malpractice will be reported. Unless there is a general perception that reports of malpractice will be competently and honestly investigated, some persons with concerns about administration will see publicity as the only way of having their concerns redressed and others will be deterred from raising them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill has provisions to guard against claims that are made for personal gain, or which are frivolous or deliberately malicious. These provisions will include criminal liability for any person making a false claim to the Agency.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In an article in The Australian Law Journal, Mr J.G. Starke pointed out: "the whistleblower must have reasonable grounds for believing that a crime or civil wrong has taken place or will take place; and there must be evidence of good faith on the part of the whistleblower".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill will complement the existing defences for whistleblowers under common law and will provide some protection for them legally. Our Government and public sector processes have been governed by official secrecy for over a century. Breaches of this secrecy have at times attracted criminal liability and, historically, no defence of public interest has been entertained. In Commonwealth legislation alone there are as many as 150 secrecy provisions which penalise the unauthorised disclosure of information. Possibly the most ubiquitous of these is section 70 of the Crimes Act 1914, which imposes a two year prison sentence for any unauthorised disclosure of information by a current or former Commonwealth employee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There have been moves to introduce some form of whistleblower protection through state based anti-corruption authorities in New South Wales, Queensland, the Australian Capital Territory and Western Australia. Legislation is urgently needed at the Federal level because the community demands that government and bureaucracy should not be above the law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The considerable cost and damage and subsequent scandals relating to State government corruption in New South Wales, Queensland and Western Australia may never occurred had individuals been empowered to blow the whistle on corrupt practices. In all cases, some Government employees knew what was going on, but kept quiet. Had they felt protected by law, some of them may have been encouraged to tell the truth, saving taxpayers millions of dollars and preventing political and private sector practices from becoming so debased that the public, to a large degree, lost confidence in the political process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In Queensland, the Criminal Justice Commission and the Electoral and Administrative Review Commission have just finalised a report recommending state legislation allowing for whistleblowers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The former Corruption Commissioner, Tony Fitzgerald Q.C., drew attention to what he called an "urgent need" for whistleblower legislation. In his Report released on 3rd July 1989, on public administration and criminal justice in Queensland, he said:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"It is enormously frustrating and demoralising for conscientious and honest public servants who work in a department or instrumentality in which maladministration or misconduct is present or even tolerated or encouraged. It is extremely difficult for such officers to report their knowledge to those in authority. Even if they do report their knowledge to a senior officer that officer might be in a difficult position.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the quote implies there may be no-one who can be trusted with the information. If either senior officers and/or politicians are involved in misconduct of corruption, the task of exposure becomes impossible for all but the exceptionally courageous or reckless, particularly after indications that such disclosures are not only unwelcome but attract retribution. Strong honest leadership is one step which is essential to a build-up of confidence. There is an urgent need, however, for legislation which prohibits any person from penalising any other person for making accurate public statements about misconduct, inefficiency or other problems within public instrumentalities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Fitzgerald went on to argue, "It is necessary to establish a convenient means by which public officers can disclose matters of concern. What is required is an accessible, independent body to which disclosures can be made, confidentially at least in the first instance&mdash;and in any event free from fear of reprisals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Protection for whistleblowers should be an important element of modern government because this encourages employees to be a part of maintaining honest, effective and accountable government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Employees who blow the whistle on either a private corporation or government, although this legislation deals only with government, are often persecuted and eventually sacked, yet they have usually blown the whistle as an act of conscience with the greater good of society in mind. They are in fact, ethical resisters. By protecting whistleblowers we enable individuals to make an ethical choice between their responsibility to society generally and their obligations to their employers. To refuse such protection may be to require a person's complicity in activities which they abhor.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are double standards operating at present which condone whistleblowing in some circumstances yet, in other circumstances, see whistleblowers vilified and persecuted. For example, reporting a neighbour for defrauding the Social Security Department is regarded as laudable. If I inform the police of some criminal activity that I witnessed, I may even be paid money from public funds in return for demonstrating loyalty to the state. However, other whistleblowers may be variously ridiculed, referred for psychiatric assessment, sacked and possibly prosecuted because of their actions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At present, the courts can do little to provide effective protection from harassment and intimidation to an employee who blows the whistle. What eventually breaks whistleblowers down, and deters others from supporting them, is the aversion and subtle abuse which they suffer on a daily basis at work.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This legislation will offer extensive protection to the whistleblower, including protection for their physical safety and recompense for any harassment. Our system of liberal democracy should at least offer protection to an ethical resister who blows the whistle in the public interest.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the 2nd September 1993 Senator Newman moved a motion to set up a committee, to be known as the Select Committee on Public Interest Whistleblowing. The committee, which is to report on or before the first sitting day in March 1994, has been set up to inquire into whether the practice of whistleblowing should be the subject of Commonwealth legislation to enable the making of such disclosures in the public interest and, if so, what form the legislation should take.</PARA>

<PARA>As I indicated earlier, there was a debate about this matter on Thursday, 30 September 1993 when I gave the notice of motion in association with the tabling of the committee's second report. Already Mr Greiner, a former premier of New South Wales, has given evidence to our committee. Mr Greiner indicated the way in which the Loan Council formerly operated and the procedures under which not only Victoria but also a number of other states clearly went outside the terms of the Loan Council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Exactly why they had gone outside the terms of the Loan Council is not at all clear. We know that Victoria most recently did so but we certainly know that other states have done so. I, personally&mdash;and, I am sure, other members of the committee&mdash;would like to know whether, for instance, it was the pressure being put on by the Commonwealth government in relation to restrictions in grants which made it feel it was necessary to move outside those limits. We need to get some sense of the overall financial management of this country with respect to the actual grants and with respect to the borrowings of the Commonwealth and the states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have not yet heard from the Reserve Bank. We will shortly be hearing from the Reserve Bank. We do not know exactly what part it plays, but we do know that in the case of several of the states the Reserve Bank has given advice in relation to the borrowings of the states and the operations of state banks&mdash;particularly in relation to the operation of the State Bank of South Australia, the demise of which is all too recent in everybody's minds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Contrary to what we have heard already from the government in this matter, I think it is necessary for the committee to round out the evidence it has heard so that we can be quite sure that the sorts of changes which have already been made to the operation of the Loan Council, and the sorts of changes which I am quite sure my committee will recommend be made as further changes to the operation of the Loan Council, will be adequate to meet the criterion that certainly I have been pursuing through this committee; that is, to make the operation of the Loan Council transparent and to make it accountable so that not only will the various members of the Loan Council, the states and the Commonwealth, know what is going on but also the public at large will have a clear perception of what is going on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For that to occur, it is highly desirable that the relevant members of the various state houses of parliament named in the motion come before this committee and give some explanation of the way in which, in their view, the Loan Council was operating and, in their view, the way in which the Loan Council could be made to operate better. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not in any way agree with the government's charge that this is a political witch-hunt. I assure the Senate that it is not a political witch-hunt on my part at all. I think it is highly desirable that these people come before the committee, be answerable to the Senate, and allow the committee to make a much more rounded and much more comprehensive report to the Senate on which, one hopes, the government and the states will operate so that the Loan Council will become a much more accountable, much more responsible organisation and one in which the Australian public and, dare I say it, the financial sector will have some confidence, because I do not think they have had hitherto. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government rigorously opposes Senator Coulter's motion. I should explain that even though we occasionally allow such motions to go through formally, recognising the numbers in this chamber, we regard the precedent set in this particular motion to be so drastic that we would not let it pass without a proper debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that from 1970 onwards the Senate, in seeking a role for itself, has sought to use the committee system to enhance the deliberations of this chamber and, for the most part, with some startling success in the last 22 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have set up various committees, the estimates committees being the most effective committees in the parliament. They are most effective when they stick to their role of being inquisitorial rather than adversarial. Sometimes they go over that line, sometimes they do not, but for the most part a degree of balance is kept. We also have an effective standing committee system which, in spite of probably too many references and too many inquiries, operates adequately. Those standing general purpose committees also have a legislative role which works, depending on the legislation and partisanship in this chamber, fairly adequately, meeting on Fridays. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also have available to us select committees. These are meant to focus on specific items that none of the other committees can particularly deal with. It does give the opportunity for the Senate chamber to gang up and get a non-government majority on them. Then we have the fifth sort of committee never envisaged in 1971 and that is the kangaroo court. That is the committee, the Star Chamber committee, that Senator Coulter now represents here with such honeyed words. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Coulter can say as much as he likes about getting a fair hearing and we may even believe him, but we do not believe that the three opposition members on the committee entered this with an objective stance. They entered with a closed political mind based on their prejudicial political position. Forget the terms of reference. Do those opposite really care about what the Loan Council is doing? They got into this for one reason and one reason alone, and that is to try to stitch up the federal Treasurer, John Dawkins. There is no other reason, and I will go through the details of that later. That is why we have this select committee. All the rest is dross. All the rest is window dressing to make it look respectable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just look at who the opposition put on the committee: the so-called Liberal Party headkickers in Senator Short&mdash;well, maybe&mdash;Senator Alston and Senator Bishop. Ankle tappers would be a better description than headkickers. Nevertheless, they are put on there to do a political task. Not to be the independent senators assessing the evidence and coming back into this chamber and sharing their wisdom and knowledge with us; they were put in there to get a political result. That is why they voted for the committee to be set up in the first place. That is why they threatened a government majority on it. That is why Senator Coulter emerged as chairman&mdash;to be their patsy on that particular committee. That is the role Senator Coulter plays. He plays the role there as place seeker to serve their interests and nothing more, and nothing less. Whether he intended it that way, that is the way it has evolved and that is why this committee is an absolute disgrace to this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that everyone in politics is tempted by ambition at times. No-one can tell me that Senator Coulter was not tempted at the start of this year when he took the chairmanship of this committee. Here was a wonderful way for him, as the leader of the Democrats, to lift his profile. Here was a way that he could get publicity that otherwise he could not get. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was saying that this was an ideal opportunity for Senator Coulter to lift his national profile. This committee, in terms of the political interest, was a sexy committee. It was looking into the behaviour of a Treasurer. That will always attract publicity. The fact that it did not work out is neither Senator Coulter's fault nor anyone else's. Senator Coulter and his party got run over in the last federal election, not through a lack of effort or endeavour by Senator Coulter, as some Democrats would have us believe, but because they got rolled over in a polarised election. It would not matter who lead the Democrats; they were going to have difficulty finding a place in the sun, given that all the media attention was centred on two alternatives, and all minority parties suffered in the last federal election as a result of that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major issue we are confronting here is a matter of principle. That is not to say that the committee does not have a position of principle. Getting the widest body of evidence possible is a good principle to support. But if the committee does what Senator Coulter seeks to do, it will be trampling on other more important principles and setting greater precedents for the future that could lead to legislative warfare in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What he is seeking to do, first of all, is to request other parliaments to compel their members to attend all important Senate inquiries. I have talked before about the incestuous nature of this chamber, about how we pride ourselves on our rights, how we are more important than everyone else. That is a great ego boost to people sitting around here who have nothing else to do with their time. The enhancement of this chamber is an enhancement of their status in society. The more powerful the Senate is, the more powerful they are. Therefore, they seek constantly to push the envelope of Senate power out as far as it can go. But there should be, and are, constraints on how far that power should go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wonder what the reaction in this chamber would be if one of the legislative council committees of the Victorian or Western Australian parliaments said they wanted to compel certain senators in this place to give evidence. Would there not be massive outrage? How dare the state chambers try to compel senators to give evidence to the legislative council committee on sewerage in Western Australia! How dare they do it! That would have been the attitude because, as I said, that impinges on our power and status and, in the incestuous nature of the Senate, that could not be tolerated. But it is all right for us to try to do it to others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How would the National Party members here have reacted if last year we had set up a committee in the House of Representatives to look into the Joh jury case?  How would they have reacted if we had compelled members of the Queensland parliament to come before the House of Representatives before some kangaroo court or some star chamber? How would they have felt if we had voted for that?</PARA>

Every state parliament in this country would object to us doing this sort of thing, as we would object to them doing it. But for politically opportunistic reasons&mdash;because it suits the opposition at the time&mdash;it is willing to set a precedent for the future that, whenever one partisan political party gets control of a chamber, it can feel free to compel members of the other chamber or state parliaments to come along and give compulsory evidence. What a great democracy that would be!</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us talk about the impartiality of this committee. I watched Senator Bishop's performance the other night. Senator Coulter saw it. She had already reached a verdict about this. Go back and read <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. Why did the committee need to call witnesses? This is like the Queen of Hearts in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</EMPHASIS>: she gives the sentence, then the verdict, then listens to the evidence. That is what Senator Bishop has done. Honourable senators should go back and read what she had to say here on 30 September. She had absolutely made up her mind that Dawkins was guilty; all the committee had to do then was to throw the line over the side to try to find some evidence to support that conviction. So much for objective Senate committees!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On occasions Senate committees, even with political partialities, can come to a reasonable result because people recognise that the truth is sometimes more important than anything else. But not in this case. In this case three conservative members went on to this committee with their minds made up in advance and nothing, no amount of evidence was going to alter them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe&mdash;I do not want to upset my colleague Senator O'Chee opposite&mdash;that the behaviour of this committee has been reprehensible.

Suddenly, to get in the limelight, because it was not getting enough publicity, it called a meeting in the middle of the election campaign. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I see. The committee had a reporting date. Let us go to what happened, Senator Short. Did the committee meet in committee meeting room No. 1, committee room 1S3 or some other committee room and come to a deliberation on this matter? No, it did not. The committee held its meeting, according to a document that was tabled here the other day, in an airport lounge. The committee picked Ansett. Maybe that reflected the three views of those opposite; I do not know. The meeting started at 12.25 p.m. to consider a final report of this committee. It was held in an Ansett lounge&mdash;first class, no doubt&mdash;in Melbourne.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then the record notes that the chairman departed at 12.38 p.m. The chairman was able to stay for 13 minutes. I thank Senator Coulter for being able to spend 13 minutes of his time on what he argues is a critical inquiry. He was willing to give 13 minutes of his time so that this enormous report could come down&mdash;coincidentally, two weeks before the election. So he disappeared. Obviously, he had not done his sums, because a couple of people were missing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not surprised that one of them was missing. She is virtually never there for any of these hearings; she is only there for the final kill. She had already made up her mind. Another person had a legitimate reason, I understand, for not being there. I do not dwell on that. I do not make fun of it. We have all been in that position. And Senator Short was there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, Senator Short found himself in a minority. The majority report became a minority report because the chairman left after 13 minutes. Suddenly, all the best laid plans of mice and men went astray! The finding of the kangaroo court was suddenly reversed because the other jury&mdash;which was probably equally politically biased, but at least it did not make a pretence about that&mdash;brought in a `not guilty' verdict, a different result. That could not be allowed to stand, could it?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the committee said: `Why don't we move off in a week's time and head up to the Ansett first class lounge in Sydney? Why don't we convene a meeting there? Oops, not enough people have turned up. We don't have a quorum. Goodbye. We will have to call another meeting in a few weeks time, in Darwin or Port Kembla or somewhere else more conveniently placed'. But suddenly another member turned up, so a quorum was present. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the third meeting within a week was convened in an airport lounge in Sydney and, finally, it resolved to pass on the kangaroo court findings. But, again, the numbers were not there, so what did those opposite do? They got on the phone and rang a member to have a telephone vote for a Senate committee, just so they could stitch up the numbers. What a farce; what a joke. Those opposite say that this is a serious inquiry and they were so impelled to get their decision in because of a Senate order. We have already had three motions today extending the lives of committees. It happens all the time; dates coinciding with elections are always extended. But, no, due diligence had to occur and they had to rush off to another airport lounge to put this raft and rort through, and so it goes through and, if anything, it belittles the Senate committee system this day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite who get up and say that they believe in the Senate and that we do not, those who support the Senate committee system and think it is wonderful, do anything they can to undermine it by stupid actions like airport lounge meetings and telephone votes. I can just imagine, in the dark days of 1995, a Liberal leadership ballot with 40 votes all and two telephone calls come in voting for Senator Bishop or someone else&mdash;I can imagine how we would all react to that if it ever occurred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This committee should really cut and run. It should concentrate on its recommended reforms of the Loan Council and give up the witch hunting. The witch hunting was a political stunt that did not help those opposite during the election campaign. The sort of Star Chamber tactics that they now want to employ by compelling other state members of parliament to give evidence, even if they succeed, will backfire. People can be forced to a committee, but they cannot be forced to answer questions. They can be as rude and abusive to those opposite as they like under privilege, and there is nought those opposite could ever do about it. The whole idea of these hearings is to ask witnesses to come; in my view, they have a right not to come; and for them to be compelled to come could only be exercised in the most extreme circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the committee risks with this motion today is starting a war between legislative chambers around Australia in which tit for tat retaliation will just debase the parliamentary system. This chamber today carries motions compelling the Victorian, the Tasmanian, the New South Wales and the South Australian governments. Those opposite do not know when the next majority can be cobbled together in the House of Representatives, here or somewhere else, for the shadiest and sleaziest of political purposes, to start whole committee hearings into everything. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some checks and balances in the system. The people who set up the Senate committee gave it enormous powers, they immediately balanced it by assuming a government majority on all the committees so those powers could not continue too far. What this chamber seeks to do is have its cake and eat it. It seeks to have all the powers placed on it in the committee system from 1971 onwards, but none of the checks and balances. To me, that is a very shameful thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This particular inquiry will only be able to redeem itself if it concentrates on the key aspects of the Loan Council and the positive things that Senator Coulter wished to talk to today. But if it goes back with honourable senators who have already made up their minds, who are already taking partisan political prejudices into the committee with the view of political advantage through all sorts of opportunistic reasons, then this committee will help destroy the committee system as it currently stands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Could we have written last year a bigger farce than having committee meetings in airport lounges; quorums at one moment but not the other; swinging majorities at one moment but not the other; one member leaving the chair of the committee and buzzing off after 13 minutes; another meeting in a Sydney airport lounge with no quorum present; suddenly someone turns up, someone who has always been late for committees; another quorum is suddenly found; another result et cetera? Who can say this is objective decision making? Who can say this is fair judgment? No-one can. None of the decisions of this committee have been free of absolute political bias from start to finish. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I noticed Senator Coulter was reported in yesterday's press. He was not quoted, so he may intervene if this does not reflect his view. He is reported to have said that it would be up to the Victorian Premier, Mr Kennett, to decide these matters. Oh, gee whiz, I thank Senator Coulter for finding a political neuter, a moderate in politics who can use judgment and wisdom, such as Mr Kennett; I thank Senator Coulter for leaving it to him. I would hate Senator Coulter to find someone who was more fair, more generous, less of a political head kicker than Mr Kennett to make these decisions. I congratulate Senator Coulter for identifying probably the worst person in this country to allow these judgments to be operated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Does Senator Coulter think the guillotine does not operate in the Victorian parliament? Does Senator Coulter think that when Premier Kennett has 50 per cent plus one he would ever concede or conceive of any parliamentary reform Senator Coulter would want? This is the person Senator Coulter wants to leave it to who, when we sought a mandate for proportional representation in the Victorian Legislative Council and won the election, used his numbers in the upper house to knock it off to our detriment and to Senator Coulter's. There are hundreds of cases where we could go to the political judgment of Jeffrey Gibb Kennett, but this is not one that I would handball across him and say, `Well, the Victorian Premier will approach this with all fairness'. Leaving it to his judgment, as is suggested in this article by Martin Daly, seems to me just a little bemusing.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That article states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Coulter reiterated his view that the Victorian state ALP caucus could be cited for contempt of the Senate for instructing Mrs Kirner and her former ministers not to give evidence.</PARA>
<PARA>I think, first of all, to quote Mae West, they were not showing contempt for the Senate; they were trying to hide it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that those opposite apparently do not think it is the right of a Labor Party meeting to determine a general policy that is binding on all; we do. That is not a contempt of the Senate; that is the attitude of the members of that meeting. Why did they take that attitude? Those opposite say they are trying to cover up. Has it ever occurred to Senator Coulter that it might just be that they are standing on a principle too&mdash;the principle that it is not right for a chamber of another parliament to be able to compel members to attend committee hearings set up in the most dubious of circumstances, and it may be not in the best interests of the country to thereby comply. I would be very surprised if some of the other witnesses that those opposite have identified comply, because they would also believe it is a matter of principle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This motion, of course, is about Mrs Kirner, Mr Sheehan and Mr White. Mr Fahey, Mr Gray and Mr Bannon are all dross; they are just window-dressing. This has nothing really to do with them but, to make it look fair, those opposite have put a few more names on the list so that they are not being politically biased. That is what it is about. That caucus had every right to give advice&mdash;and those opposite simply have to accept that advice or ignore it if they wish. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite say they want to take 44 people and cite them for contempt. What does that mean? Are they going to call 44 people before the bar of this house? Is that really what they mean by `cited for contempt'? What do they mean, I wonder? Are we going to have the 44 of them ranged up here while we sit as impartial judges again and then divide on party lines according to what we want? What a stupid and ridiculous suggestion. I can imagine&mdash;and I can tell the Senate now&mdash;that any time a labour majority in Victoria decides to cite the Democrats for contempt for having `caucussed' in this parliament, we will throw it out because it is a stupid political tactic for a start; it just does not wash water. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What this motion comes down to is an intrusion by the states house on other state parliaments, and it should not be allowed to run through unopposed; it should be opposed. I know it suits the immediate short-term political opportunism of the Senate reflected in the opposition. So what? We have seen plenty of examples of that in recent weeks. I am disappointed that the Democrats and Senator Coulter, in particular, have not seen through the fact that Senator Coulter has been used and abused in this most severely. This will result in a precedent being set&mdash;if it goes through and any state parliament should be silly enough to comply with it, and I have seen none yet which have give any indication they will&mdash;which could start a war in which various chambers around the country set up Star Chamber inquiries just to embarrass their political enemies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> If those opposite want these matters dealt with in that particular way, they will degrade this chamber and destroy the committee system of this chamber. We all have our grudges and our gripes about committees in this chamber, but generally we do not fundamentally attack the nature of the committee system in this chamber. This committee has managed to do it, in the same way that the Murphy committee did five or seven years ago. All those opposite, especially the conservatives in this chamber, are supposed to stand for convention, for continuity. My advice to Senator Coulter, in conclusion, is: never stand before a conservative and power if convention is in the way. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not want to take too much time of the Senate because we had much of this same debate last Thursday, and it seems pointless to go over the same ground again. I do not think that certain remarks made by Senator Ray today can, in all reasonableness, be allowed to pass without comment. Senator Ray is quite correct that the coalition will be supporting Senator Coulter's motion. We will be doing so for one very good reason; that is, the Senate Select Committee on the Functions, Powers and Operation of the Australian Loan Council has not concluded its activities and it cannot conclude its activities satisfactorily and adequately until the persons that this report recommends appear before the committee do so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice that Senator Ray is leaving the chamber. I say as he leaves that I find the crocodile tears that he shed today for the proprieties and whatnot of this House are absolutely amazing, coming from a member of a party that has done more to tear up parliamentary conventions and to rape this parliament and its processes than any other party in the history of this country. We have a Prime Minister who today is hell-bent on doing just that. He is hell-bent on a whole range of activities which include the total abolition of this house of the parliament, this Senate, so that we will not have a bicameral system which enables proper scrutiny of the work and policies of the executive of the day. The day that that happens, we cease to have a parliamentary democracy; we just have executive government. The events that have occurred under this present government, particularly under this Prime Minister (Mr Keating), should be of enough concern to each and every Australian&mdash;and I am sure that they are&mdash;to ensure that that does not ever, ever happen. That is, to a significant extent, what this motion is about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would accept some of the points which Senator Ray made and which others have made about the actual operations of the Senate Select Committee on the Functions, Powers and Operation of the Australian Loan Council. In many respects, the Loan Council committee has not worked and functioned as well and as smoothly as we would have liked. For example, Senator Ray made reference to the meetings that were held in a rushed nature in airport lounges before the last election. The way he presented it, it sounded like a terribly clandestine, cloak and dagger operation. It was in fact nothing of the sort. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that members of the committee, of whom I am one, were so involved&mdash;it was during the early stage of the election campaign&mdash;with their own programs over a period of weeks that the only time and place that they could come together to meet was in conference rooms&mdash;not airport lounges&mdash;at airports. No-one has suggested that that is fully satisfactory. I certainly would not. I presume that Senator Coulter, the chairman of the committee, would not either. But to imply that, because the meeting was held there, there was something terribly wrong about the process is an absolute nonsense. If we talk about the coalition members of the committee usurping the proper role of the committee and its activities, one has to go back to last Thursday's debate on this matter when I had to respond to Senator Sherry who had been waxing vitriolically eloquent beforehand. I said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Sherry came in here and talked about people usurping states rights, usurping this and usurping that. I hope that I am not breaching confidentialities, but I think it is generally known . . . that Senator Sherry used quite improper processes to usurp the chair of the committee in the two or three weeks prior to the last election. He tried to manipulate a result from that committee in the most outrageous way.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Sherry intervened:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Someone else did that. They actually did a better job than I did.</PARA>
<PARA>The `somebody else' that Senator Sherry was referring to in that interjection was one of his colleagues on the committee, Senator Faulkner. The usurping of the proper role and the proper functions of the committee lies fairly and squarely with Senator Sherry, Senator Faulkner and the Labor members of the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that this committee has not concluded its work. It was set up for a very important purpose, as laid out in its terms of reference; that is, to look into matters including:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the functions, powers and operation of the Australian Loan Council in coordinating all financial transactions by all Commonwealth and State bodies, including Government business enterprises, instrumentalities and other authorities, which involve a call on the private sector;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the role of all Governments in the Loan Council process, including the provision of information to the Council and the advising of other Council members on the activities of members;</PARA>
<PARA>The terms of reference also included looking into:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the powers (and limits of power) of State Premiers and Treasurers to administer borrowing agreements approved by the Council and the responsibilities of State Premiers and Treasurers to notify the Council about the borrowing activities of their Governments.</PARA>
<PARA>It was because of the breaching of those guidelines in 1992 and 1993 by the Victorian government&mdash;a government which at that stage was led by Premier Kirner with Mr Tony Sheehan as Treasurer&mdash;that the majority of this committee believes that it cannot carry out its functions and examine adequately its terms of reference unless some of the main players, whose actions and whose government led to the formation of the committee in the first instance, are given the opportunity&mdash;and in fact accept that opportunity&mdash;to give their version of events so far as the breaching of the guidelines is concerned and, as a result of their experience, to offer comments to this parliament on the very important terms of reference of the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would name Mr Sheehan as the most important person whom we should have appear before the committee, along with former Premier Kirner. There is also the former Premier of South Australia, John Bannon, and former premiers and current premiers of other states which, in fact, are Liberal government states. Unless we get that contribution, we will not be able to pursue fully and appropriately the mandate that we were given by this very chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For Senator Ray to launch a totally unwarranted, unsubstantiated attack on the current Victorian Premier, Jeff Kennett, in the way that he did, I find not only unconscionable but also, frankly, quite stupid. In fact, Senator Ray got it wrong because the determinant of whether Mrs Kirner and Mr Sheehan and anyone else from the Victorian parliament are expected to or do meet the request to appear as witnesses before the committee is in fact the Victorian parliament; it is not the premier or the government of the day. The recommendation in the committee report states that `the Senate request the relevant houses to require the attendance of the following persons before the Senate select committee'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are a number of very good reasons why the motion before the Senate should be opposed very strongly. I want to respond to the comments made by Senator Short because he in fact highlighted one of the compelling reasons why the motion before the Senate should not be supported. He highlighted the behaviour of the Senate Select Committee on the Functions, Powers and Operation of the Australian Loan Council that occurred prior to the election. I will deal with that in a moment. Senator Short highlighted the fact that the committee approved an interim report two weeks prior to the last election. That interim report, which contained some comments which were fairly critical of the then Treasurer and current Treasurer, Mr Dawkins, stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Evidence so far has not revealed that the Treasurer acted to protect the Labor Government in Victoria against the advice of Treasury. However, it remains an open question as to whether Treasury's advice was tailored to the understanding that the Treasurer, Mr Dawkins, would not have compromised the Kirner Government in an election year, if at all.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whatever the case, the Committee believes that the Treasurer's actions had the effect of concealing a major breach of financial discipline from the public, which had a right to know the truth.</PARA>
<PARA>I was one of the members of the committee&mdash;I was deputy chair at the time&mdash;who dissented from that report. This highlights the fact that the committee put out an interim report two weeks prior to the last election when we had heard from only one-third of the witnesses. Why did we put out a report two weeks before the last election, having heard so little of the evidence? I suggest to this chamber that it was for political reasons. It served two political purposes: it served Senator Coulter's purpose as then Leader of the Australian Democrats&mdash;I will return to that later&mdash;to get some publicity in the election campaign by attempting to embarrass this government and the Treasurer, Mr Dawkins; and it served the purpose of the opposition by attempting to create yet another issue in the election campaign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a gross misuse of the Senate's committee structure to bring down a report and to bring down conclusions, having heard so little of the evidence, two weeks prior to an election. It would be stretching the credibility of everyone in this place to suggest that that report was brought down two weeks before the election for any reason other than for political purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here we are about six months later, having not heard all the evidence that Senator Coulter and the opposition want, and they are saying, `We need to hear more; we can't hand down a final report until we hear more'. Yet six months ago we were handing down a quite damning interim report having heard only one-third of the evidence. That discloses the duplicity of both the opposition and Senator Coulter on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a motion before us which, yet again, proposes to increase the power of the Senate. Those opposite may think that is a good thing. We have had a major increase in the Senate's power through the approach of the opposition, the Democrats and the Greens to the budget process, and through the use of the committee system. We are now having, I would suggest, the greatest grab of all time for an increase in the Senate's power. We now have the rather ironic situation where the Senate&mdash;which was set up by the states, supposedly to protect the states; that body that was created for and on behalf of the states&mdash;is attempting to impose its will on the state houses themselves. That is quite an ironic situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We often talk about principles of the creation of the constitution and the so-called founding fathers. We are often given lectures about that by the opposition. I do not think that in their wildest dreams those so-called founding fathers could see the day when the Senate would attempt to impose its will on the states' houses. Where will it end? I would suggest that those opposite should have a good think about the principle that they are establishing and building on all the time&mdash;a continual increase in the Senate's powers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But there are other reasons of a more practical nature for opposing this motion. If officials, premiers and ministers who represent state governments are to have confidential dealings with the federal government, in future what is to stop a Senate committee from calling them before it because it suits the political majority of the time? What is to stop such committees demanding the attendance of state ministers or premiers? How can we have any confidential dealings between government ministers or premiers and the federal government of the day if there is a risk that they can then be called before a Senate committee, because the political majority is of a different complexion, and have to disclose all that occurred in those confidential negotiations? That is a very serious problem that could emerge from this process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We could also have the ridiculous situation where the Victorian state parliament, on the whim of the Premier, Mr Kennett, could attempt to require the attendance of Labor members. But I suspect that the Tasmanian parliament, where there is a Liberal majority, will be not requiring the attendance of Robin Gray, the former premier and treasurer, or Tony Rundle, MHA, the current treasurer. I do not believe that the Tasmanian parliament, which is of the same complexion as that of Victoria, will attempt to instruct or coerce the previous premier-treasurer or the current treasurer. Why not? First, it would regard it as outrageous that the Tasmanian government and the Tasmanian parliament should be pressured by the Senate in this way. Secondly, I would love to have Robin Gray and Tony Rundle here because we could attempt to expose the near bankruptcy that Tasmania was sent to by Robin Gray when he was Treasurer and Premier, a situation which Mr Tony Rundle, who was not Treasurer then, is attempting to rectify in some ways. I would love to have those two before us because I would grill them. That is what we should be doing but it is not the correct process or the correct form to do it in this way through the powers of the Senate. I think that is a very important principle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had accusations from Senator Short that we are the ones who tear up convention in this place. Who tore up convention in 1974 and 1975? How could we be accused of tearing up conventions?</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to issue this word of warning: should the coalition ever be in government&mdash;and it seems that it will be a long time to come&mdash;it is not likely to have a majority in this place. Frankly, I am all for sticking to these conventions in principle and ensuring that the Senate is a house of review, but if we continue to have this grab for power by the Senate, I will live by principle but politically I will not die by it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we ever have to sit on the opposition benches in this Senate and we can combine with other parties or have a majority in our own right and those opposite have a majority in the House of Representatives, I will be thinking twice about the principles we have lived by up to date. We will not be continually dished up with this nonsense about the Senate being a house of review when it clearly is not a house of review. We have seen the usurpation of the legitimate role and function of government in its budget process. We are seeing it now through a committee which has acted in a purely political way since it was set up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to highlight some other behaviour of this committee during the election period. I have never sat on a committee like this, and I am sure Senator Short has never sat on such a committee, but the behaviour was not all one way. I, as deputy chair, Senator Faulkner and another of our senators set out in a positive way to address the issues before this committee. But as soon as the election was called, it was on. Senator Coulter and members of the opposition were trying to score political points during the campaign. Why were we having meetings and handing down reports during the election campaign when we had not heard the evidence? The behaviour was quite appalling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the first meeting that took place on Saturday, 27 February, during the election campaign, we had present Senator Short, Senator Crowley, Senator Coulter, Senator Faulkner and I and&mdash;surprise, surprise&mdash;we had the numbers; we had a majority. There were three government members, Senator Coulter and members of the opposition. The opposition had a report which it claimed was a majority report. The trouble was that three outnumbered two. On very short notice, this interim report was given to me. We turned up on the Saturday and the final draft of the interim report was presented to me on the Thursday prior&mdash;two days before. That was the first major indication that we were in for a political game from those opposite. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we got to the Golden Wing lounge in Melbourne&mdash;which was the first of three airport meetings; I will refer to this simply as the Golden Wing committee meeting&mdash;we were informed by the chairman that the meeting was starting at 12 o'clock and that he had to catch a plane at 12.38. We were expected to go through a 60-page report in half an hour, which was an outrage. As it was, we sat around waiting for the chairman, who was running late because of the election campaign, and we finally got under way at 12.25. The chairman said, `Ratify this report now because I am off to catch a plane at 12.38'. That is the sort of behaviour we had to put up with from this committee. The chairman left. I will give Senator Short his due: he did stick it out; he turned up to the meetings; he put the arguments; he certainly made a solid contribution, if not disruptive, to attempt to drag another election issue up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition did not have the numbers. Senator Alston was in hospital, and a little later on I will refer to a later meeting, which I call the pyjama party meeting. Senator Bishop did not turn up. What was Senator Bishop doing? She was roaming the country attempting to impress everyone so that she could be a minister in what the opposition believed would be the incoming Liberal government. What is she doing now? She is not roaming the country attempting to be a minister in what was believed to be an incoming Hewson government; she is attempting to grab the opposition leader's job and become the opposition leader. That is what she is doing now, and I wish her well in her endeavours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We did not have present the necessary number of members of the opposition. The opposition suddenly discovered that what it hoped would be the majority report was the minority report, because the government members were in a majority. The government members were diligently addressing their tasks as members of this committee and were prepared to sit there all night, if necessary, to go through the 60-page report that we had received only two days earlier. Senator Coulter was off electioneering, and I do not blame him for that. I do blame or criticise him for attempting to use this committee as part of his election platform, and that blew up in his face&mdash;and I will come to that a little later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now had a majority report, but it did not suit the purposes of the opposition or Senator Coulter. For the first time in my three years in this place another committee meeting was called by Senator Coulter in an attempt to reverse the result of the first meeting, which I referred to as the so-called Golden Wing committee meeting. The chairman decided that we would have another meeting, but this time it would be in Sydney in the Flight Deck lounge. This meeting was set for 1 March in an attempt to overturn the earlier decision. It was quite democratically arrived at. I have never been part of a process in this place where a meeting is held at which there is a majority, and then two weeks later the minority, who are upset about the report, attempt to reverse it by holding another meeting. Again it was quite outrageous behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were told to front up at 4 o'clock for the second meeting. Again, quite diligently, Senator Faulkner, Senator Crowley and I fronted up. The chairman was there. Senator Short was there on time as usual. Again, I pay him the credit of being very diligent. Senator Bishop was not there. We decided that this was a totally undemocratic process, so the committee was left without a quorum. A little later Senator Bishop did turn up but after the second meeting had lapsed. Senator Coulter informed us&mdash;and I believe quite incorrectly and quite illegally&mdash;that there would be another meeting in about 15 minutes. I believe that it was incorrect because he may not have informed Senator Alston, who was in his pyjamas in his hospital bed, and I will get to this little episode shortly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all turned up for the third meeting. Senator Bishop finally arrived. Of course, the events were quite interesting. The chairman wanted to reverse the previous decision of the so-called Golden Wing meeting so he decided that he would accept a motion moved by Senator Bishop. Senator Faulkner moved dissent from the chairman's ruling to accept the motion from Senator Bishop to reverse the previous committee meeting's decision. Senator Faulkner moved dissent and I took the chair. There was nothing wrong with that. It is quite customary and appropriate that, when a motion of dissent is moved, the deputy chairman, which is the position I occupy on the committee, takes the chair and presides over the meeting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were then subjected to one of the most abusive tirades from Senator Bishop that I have ever heard at a Senate committee. For about half an hour she made streams of interjections and raised a number of points of order, despite my ruling her out of order.

I think it was even testing for the chairman of the committee. </PARA>

This highlights the way this committee was used during the election campaign to quite blatantly score political points, rather than get on with its job, which was to scrutinise in a proper and thorough way the functions of the Loan Council. Certainly, until the election campaign it appeared to be doing its job quite properly. Unfortunately, two or three weeks prior to the election campaign the whole committee degenerated into an absolute farce. I suppose that we will argue for years about who was responsible, what right and wrong was done, and who was doing wrong to whom. But the fact is that we all accept that the committee degenerated into an absolute farce. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are now attempting to repeat that farce. For the last four or five months the committee has been gathering evidence in a very reasonable manner, like other committees in this place. We now have this usurpation of power by the opposition in the Senate in its attempt to try to coerce state parliaments to send their members before this committee. It is quite an outrageous proposition and one that is fraught with difficulty. What good has it all done? All it has done is highlight the various problems with the Senate committee process. It certainly has not done the Senate's integrity any good. </PARA>

She is now roaming the country again in her attempt to become opposition leader. I will give her credit for improving her target. But, of course, those opposite are in opposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I came to the chamber because I heard the mischievous meanderings of Senator Sherry. He has a very lively imagination and he never lets the truth get in the way of a good yarn. We heard a dissertation which does the Select Committee on the Functions, Powers and Operation of the Australian Loan Council a sad disservice. I want to correct the record so that anyone who reads <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> will see very simply that that sort of nonsense should be put aside.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Sherry was not present when we dealt with this matter the other day. However, we paid him the courtesy of waiting for him to arrive because we knew that he wanted to put in a dissenting report. We afforded him that courtesy. We are now debating this motion, which will be carried. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Very simply, to reiterate, this committee was established for two reasons. Firstly, it was established to look into the circumstances and reasons behind the failure of the Treasurer to disclose in the budget papers the fact that Victoria had breached the Loan Council guidelines. The Treasurer knew of it; that was disclosed in the evidence. We wanted to know why and how this happened, and how that sort of thing could be prevented in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To do that we believed there were several key people from whom we needed to hear. Firstly, we obviously wanted to hear what reasons Mr Dawkins wanted to put forward, but the Prime Minister said that he had to hide behind his skirts&mdash;he could not be a man and front up himself, he had to hide behind the skirts of the Prime Minister. So much for Mr Dawkins saying the other day that he and Mr Keating were a wonderful team working together. One wears the pants and one wears the skirts. We have seen Mr Dawkins being told that he may not appear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, we had the Labor Party caucus in Victoria telling Mrs Kirner and some of her former ministers that they may not appear, not because it was a question for the parliament to determine or them as individuals, but because the caucus&mdash;the people who really wield the power&mdash;said they could not appear. Thirdly, we needed to hear from other people who could give good evidence as to how the system of the Loan Council and the whole concept of keeping control on the total borrowings of public authorities in Australia could be monitored and kept in check so that the Australian economy as a whole would benefit. We needed to hear the opinions of people who were affected by those guidelines. So we heard from Mr Stockdale. We heard from Mr Greiner, who gave evidence which was useful in drawing those conclusions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That bears on the second important part of the committee, and that is to determine how in the future the mystique that has surrounded the Loan Council can be broken and how we can see quite plainly the way in which the system works so that we get that concept, as Nick Greiner called it, of a federal budget. The two objectives of the committee will be well served by this motion being passed today and by requests being made of other parliaments and other houses for those people to come forward and give evidence which can then be usefully assessed, not only by those people who sit on the committee but also by those people who read the evidence as well, so that Australia as a whole can benefit from this investigation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I simply say that this is a sensible way to move. The angst of the Labor Party and those who speak for the Labor Party is simply part and parcel of the frustration they feel because they have been diminished by the Australian people's vote to have only 30 senators in this chamber of 76. The opposition has 36 senators, the Democrats seven, the Greens two and Senator Harradine his own vote. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the paucity of the representation that the Labor Party has been able to gain in this chamber which adds to its angst, to its anger and, indeed, if I might add, to the loss of control and outburst by the Prime Minister in the other place today where he shut down question time saying it was a privilege to be bestowed. With that sort of attitude, I am afraid it is well to ensure that this Senate acts in a responsible way which it will be doing by passing this motion today. </PARA>

I will try to demonstrate to those opposite that they are making a terrible mistake. While I do not expect to convince those opposite of that argument sufficiently to change their votes, I think it ought to be pointed out at this stage that this is a proposition that will come back to haunt them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has been a difficult situation to enter. As a new member of this chamber, I had heard about this committee. Frankly, I thought that most of what was being said was exaggerated. I was quite amazed by the reports I read in the papers during the election campaign and by the subsequent discussions I had with members of the committee about the meetings that were held during the election campaign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I actually got onto the committee&mdash;it is one of those great jobs one gets on this side of chamber from time to time&mdash;I began to discover just what was going on. As far as I was concerned, the claim being made about the politically partisan witch hunt which had been embarked upon by the conservatives in this place is true. This was aided and abetted by the Australian Democrats and the chairman of the committee, who is unfortunately and disappointingly happy to use this as a vehicle to politically grandstand, in an attempt to regain their flagging electoral prospects in the election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I indicated to the chamber the other night that the first thing I looked at was the terms of reference of this committee. I saw that there were some noble objectives that people were claiming. But then I looked at the report that was presented just before the election; that did not show me that the noble objectives were being pursued. What was clearly being pursued, as demonstrated in point 2.72 of the report that was presented two weeks before the federal election, was that the conservative members of this committee, aided and abetted by the Democrats, had clearly made up their minds. They had approached this matter with a clear set of opinions. This is demonstrated at point 2.72 of the report, which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Evidence so far has not revealed that the Treasurer acted to protect the Labor Government in Victoria against the advice of Treasury. However, it remains an open question as to whether Treasury's advice was tailored to the understanding that the Treasurer, Mr Dawkins, would not have compromised the Kirner Government in an election year . . .</PARA>
<PARA>By saying `the evidence so far' and `it remains an open question' makes it abundantly clear to me that the majority members of this committee had a political agenda in an attempt to trap the Treasurer of this country. They were attempting to use the Victorian branch of the Labor Party and the former Labor government of Victoria to deliver the little coup that they planned. They put their gill nets across the Yarra, they dragged them up and down Port Phillip Bay and they failed miserably to produce the evidence that they said was just waiting to be found. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What those opposite have done now is go one step further. After hearing 46 witnesses those opposite were unable to produce the evidence that showed that Mr Dawkins was guilty of a crime that existed in their minds and they wanted to embark upon an inquisition. They were not happy with the evidence that was produced from the 46 witnesses. If one looks at the range of witnesses, one finds that it is quite considerable. The witnesses come from local government through to state government, national government; they are true bureaucrats and experts of various descriptions. Some 46 witnesses were called; a mountain of material is available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite were prepared to make up their minds in March when they had not heard the evidence. One then asks why they need to go on. We all know that the report is all but complete. We all know that this is a farce. Why then are those opposite seeking to pursue it?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am afraid that I am very disappointed that Senator Coulter has proceeded in this manner. He said previously in this debate that the people he called&mdash;John Fahey, Robin Gray, Tony Rundle, Joan Kirner, Tony Sheehan, David White, John Bannon and John Dawkins&mdash;should be answerable to the Senate. How pompous, and how ridiculous it is to suggest in this country that those people should be answerable to the Senate. The Senate has an important part to play in the constitution of this country, but it is not the supreme organ of state power, as some would like to see it. The Senate is not to be used for the interrogation of our political opponents. That is clearly what this motion seeks to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Speakers in the debate today, including Senator Coulter, have talked about transparency. The transparency that exists here today is that there is a political agenda in which the political opponents of the Liberals, the National Party and the Democrats are going to be prosecuted through this star chamber that they are attempting to establish. I put it to the Senate that that will fail miserably to produce the results that they believe are there, because they are not there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They have concocted a notion that John Dawkins has done certain things. As far as they are concerned that is clear and they do not really need to hear any more, but they are going on with this farce. They will attempt to use force, if necessary. Presumably, if they follow this course of action, when people refuse to appear, they will have to cite them for contempt and, presumably, they will seek to impose some penalty. Are they saying that they will go down that line and impose six months in gaol or a $5,000 fine? How seriously have they thought about this?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Coulter is on the public record, in newspapers, as saying that he thought the whole matter was now up to the Victorian Premier, Mr Kennett. Senator Coulter has also said that he thought the entire Labor caucus in Victoria should be cited for contempt. That demonstrates a couple of things. In a sense, it demonstrates that Senator Coulter understands how the Victorian parliament really works&mdash;that with 60 votes Mr Kennett can pass whatever motion he wants in that chamber. It also demonstrates, in my view, a clear attitude about the Labor Party and the Victorian state caucus. That attitude does not fit very well with the image that Senator Coulter wants to present to us of him being an intellectual man, and a man concerned about rationality because, clearly, the course of action that he is pursuing is not a rational one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposition before us today seems to ignore that we have had 11 months of inquiry, we have had 46 witnesses, and we have had a massive amount of material put before this committee. There is clear, unmistakable evidence which the committee should pursue for its final report. We may come to some disagreements about what that evidence finally means, but it is very clear that there is sufficient evidence to go on at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since this committee was established, the circumstances have changed dramatically. There have been changes to the way in which the Loan Council itself operates. We have had considerable evidence that those changes are working effectively and that a completely different regime now operates at the Loan Council compared with what existed a few years ago. We all know that all state governments have breached the Loan Council guidelines. We all know that the way the Loan Council actually works is that its members sit down in a bit of a club and work out some scheme. Each state has a special unit whose job it is to devise means of getting around those guidelines. We all understand that already and I trust it will come out in the final report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Victoria there has been a change in government and so the changed circumstances go much further. We have already seen that the economic situation in Victoria has deteriorated quite dramatically since that change of government. </PARA>

Clearly, that is what is intended to be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view, there is no point in pursuing the question of various state members appearing because we all understand that the evidence is there. We have a clear view as to what has happened. It is quite clear from statements that have been made in evidence to the committee that opposition members have a clear understanding of what they believe has happened. They have a closed mind on the issue. We could just say, `Why don't they just appear?  What have they got to hide?' What has happened is that again and again this committee has behaved in a totally partisan, political manner. It has operated on the basis of a witch-hunt and, as a result, people should have no confidence whatsoever that they would be treated properly or fairly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The normal rules of evidence do not apply before a Senate committee. It is not a court. Despite the presumptions and the arrogance of certain senators in this place, this is not a court of law. The powers and functions of the Senate cannot be assumed to be those of a judge, as some would like them to be. We cannot assume that there is an inquisitional role for this Senate because in the Australian context that does not exist for our courts themselves. The whole question in my mind is fraught with legal difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before this committee we have seen claims of illegality being made; we have seen the abuse of witnesses; we have seen the challenging of the professional qualifications of witnesses; and we have seen the challenging of the integrity of public servants.

In my view, it is totally inappropriate for people to presume that they would get a fair go before such a kangaroo court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to draw the Senate's attention to other matters that need to be examined as to the way in which this country actually functions as a federation. I do not think that those opposite have given proper consideration to this either. I am not a states rights person but I do acknowledge that a constitution does exist at the moment. I do acknowledge that there are parliaments across this country and that the normal internationally recognised conventions of comity mean that the powers of the various parliaments have to be treated with some equality. I do not believe that has been understood by those opposite. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It strikes me that those opposite do not seem to appreciate that, if they do set this precedent, it is only a matter of time before a Labor government somewhere in this country calls them before an inquiry, calling for their assistance in some investigation into the running of that particular state. The implication of the way in which our constitution works is that, if the Senate has the power to do this, we can expect there to be the same power in the Legislative Assembly in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I ask: does the Senate have the power to do it? The evidence presented through the Clerk of this place in the committee's interim report indicated that all of these matters have been untested. There is presumed to exist a power to call certain witnesses. Harry Evans indicated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . although the question has not been adjudicated, it could be held by the courts as a matter of law that the powers of the federal Houses under section 49 of the Constitution and legislation under that section do not extend to state members of parliament or state government officers.</PARA>
<PARA>This motion requests the houses to lift the privileges of members of parliament in the other place and in houses of parliament in the states. I draw the Senate's attention to page 871 of Odgers <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Senate Practice</EMPHASIS> which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Standing order 360 of the House of Representatives provides that, if the Senate requests the attendance of a Member before the Senate or any committee thereof, the House may authorise such Member to attend, if he thinks fit.</PARA>
<PARA>There are two tests which Senator Coulter failed to recognise in his motion and in his report. Members of the House of Representatives have to have leave of the house, and the individual member has to agree to attend. That is clearly indicated in Odgers <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Senate Practice</EMPHASIS>&mdash;and I understand that some of those opposite think that it is a pretty good sort of book. I draw that to the Senate's  attention because the same principles will apply in the various houses of parliament of any bicameral system in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another example is when the Victorian Legislative Assembly had to face this sort of stunt back in 1971. In that case a Legislative Council minister was called upon to give evidence before a Legislative Assembly committee. The same proposition was demonstrated to be correct. Those opposite have misjudged the situation; and there exists a fundamental flaw in their thinking. It is quite clear that this motion is wrong both politically and legally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I noticed in the press this morning that Jeffrey Kennett said, `Oh, well, it's not up to me. I can't coerce anybody'. That is a strange attitude for Jeffrey Kennett to take because he seems to spend most of his time following that course of action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take the point that Senator Ray made earlier: if one ever wants to talk to someone who is objective and fair, if one wants to talk about someone who gives other people in the political system a fair go, one would not go to Jeffrey Kennett. But even Jeffrey Kennett says that he does not have the capacity to coerce members to attend before this chamber. And for very good reason: I think those opposite will find that he, too, has had the legal advice that they seem to have missed out on. It is a very simple proposition. It strikes me as extraordinary that those opposite want to pursue this course of action without thinking through what the implications really are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If those opposite were serious about protecting what they claim to be the great conventions of this federation, if those opposite were serious about defending the great principles of constitutional government, they would have taken into account some basic principles of comity.

This might be only an attempt to keep the mobile phone, but it is not the sort of thing that we want to pursue and it is not the sort of stunt that we want to be involved in. Quite clearly, this proposition is doomed. It is doomed politically because it will not produce the result that those opposite are seeking. They have clearly made up their minds.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I listened to Senator Carr, I became somewhat concerned about what he was raising. As I understand it, we are going to vote today on whether we will put certain investigative tools into the hands of a Senate committee. A Senate committee has even more powers than a royal commission or a judicial inquiry. Yet those bodies have all sorts of safeguards applied to them. First of all, they usually have judges sitting on them. And judges, no matter what the present climate is in regard to them, do have a greater capacity than most to act fairly and to administer the rule of law.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In making that comment, I am in no sense saying that members of the Senate are not, or cannot be, fair. But I am saying that the judges who sit on royal commissions and on judicial inquiries have greater constraints placed on them than members of Senate committees. A royal commission or a judicial inquiry is usually directed to some specific topic. People are called not, as it were, to answer fishing questions but to answer something that can be of assistance to the inquiry and which those conducting the inquiry know about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that one of the problems here is that there are no proposed restraints on what the Australian Loan Council committee may ask people coming before it who may be of a different political hue and whom it would be in the interests of members of a different political party to damage politically. That becomes quite clear when one reads the debate on 30 September. In that debate, Senator Bishop said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have to get a few things straight on the record. The first thing is this: Mr Dawkins, the Treasurer of the nation, misled the Australian people by failing to include in the budget prospectus, the single most important set of finance statements published in any given year.</PARA>
<PARA>She went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To be honest, I thought that the evidence given by former Premier Nick Greiner was the most useful evidence we have heard to date.</PARA>
<PARA>So it would seem that her mind is well and truly determined already, which would not be the situation with a royal commission or with a judicial inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take this as being a very serious inquiry. I have spoken to Senate Carr about this and he takes it as being a very serious inquiry. I know that Senator Sherry takes it as being a very serious inquiry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If it is a very serious inquiry, should it not be conducted seriously? If it is being conducted seriously, I ask Senator Coulter to tell me what rules he has available to him to guide him in allowing or disallowing questions that might be unfair. It seems to me that the approach&mdash;and I hope I am wrong&mdash;is simply this: honourable senators have decided, as a committee, to call some people along, hoping in some way that they may be able to help them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When speaking last Thursday, Senator Short, a man whom I respect, had great confidence in the reaction that Senator Coulter might have. He said this on page 1554 of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was Senator Sherry and his colleagues&mdash;the whole bunch.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have never&mdash;and am sure Senator Coulter will nod acquiescence&mdash;seen such an act of political thuggery in my whole life. If one did not know that it was par for the course for some government members and senators, one would have thought it unbelievable for Senator Sherry to come in here today and postulate on matters in the way that he did.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not know whether Senator Coulter nodded acquiescence, but I do know that, when he rose again to give a notice of motion on page 1557, he did not disassociate himself from those remarks in any way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the conclusion that one is driven to, looking at the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> from last Thursday, is that Senator Bishop&mdash;and she has never disguised this, to be fair to her&mdash;regards this as a political exercise. She says, `Well, look, the Treasurer has misled parliament. There is no doubt about that. When we go about this task, if these people are called, that is what I have established and that is what I am going to go forward with'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Short, doing a job that he has to do for his party, takes a similar approach to that of Senator Bishop. As far as I can see from the transcript, Senator Coulter, the chair of this committee, acquiesces in the position taken up by one side. It is of considerable concern that a committee that should be going ahead with an open mind should be seeking to  get  its  political opponents  before  it  defenceless, as I gather they will be because there is no restraint on the sorts of questions that can be asked, to pursue a course which has been predetermined. That is how the situation stands at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is obvious from a reading of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> that there is great tension within the committee. It would seem to me that, for whatever reason, the committee has taken up a political stance on both sides. Given that stance, how can it possibly go about a calm and assured consideration of this very important issue, particularly when the chairman, a man I have great respect for and who I think has been a credit to the Senate, is in a position where a representative from the coalition side of the committee is able to put&mdash;and I am sure that Senator Coulter will nod acquiescence&mdash;some quite partisan political propositions?  Senator Coulter in no way tried to dissociate himself from that process. I am very concerned that that should be the position, particularly since, if I heard Senator Carr correctly, there is no precedent for this. In effect, this is making a request of the parliament of another country, because we must remember that for these purposes the states are separate countries and are not under this parliament. </PARA>

That parliament, dominated by a particular party, as it is in Victoria by the coalition in both houses, returned in overwhelming numbers at the last election, will be asked to offer up as a sacrificial lamb three of its political opponents to a house and to a committee which are political.</PARA></TALK.START>

I think Senator Bishop once said that the only two committees that are not political are the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills and the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are a lot of things that are said in this chamber from time to time that one lets pass simply because there are more important things to get on with. I think it is true that, given the sensitive nature of the investigation of this committee, the committee has become partisan&mdash;but that is as true of the government members as it is of the opposition members.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite clearly in this case, where we are seeking to bring some members of the former Victorian government before the committee, it is the government members who find it objectionable and who are speaking out loudest against it. But that is not to say that those people who were members of the former Victorian government do not have very important evidence to put before this committee. For Senator Carr to say, `We have already had X number of people come before the committee and give evidence, therefore we do not need other people to come before the committee' is illogical. If we have key people who have evidence that is relevant to the committee and those people have not yet come before the committee, it is important for them to come before the committee. It does not matter how many other witnesses we have had. It is a non sequitur for him to argue that way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that since the first report of the committee, which was presented to the President in the lead-up to the election, we have had very significant evidence from the former head of the Victorian Treasury which bears very much on the need to bring the former Victorian Treasurer and the former Premier of Victoria before this committee if we can possibly get them. From my point of view, that is not to pursue them in a party political way; it is to find out precisely why they felt it necessary to behave in the way that they did, according to the evidence that we now have. Looking prospectively, it is to attempt, firstly, to ensure that it is not necessary for members of state parliaments to behave in that way in future; and secondly, to ensure that the operation of the Loan Council is so ordered that those people do not operate in that way in future. I am certainly approaching these matters from a very prospective viewpoint. However, it is necessary to get the evidence to find out exactly what happened and to make sure that it does not happen again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Senate that the Loan Council is dealing with borrowings which run to tens and hundreds of billions of dollars. It is a very significant matter that we are considering; that is, that the operation of that Loan Council be transparent to the other members of the Loan Council and also to the Australian public, and that the procedures be accountable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I briefly turn to the matter of the circumstances of the reporting during the election. I think that has been touched on by Senator Short. It is important to reiterate that the reporting date of this committee was set long before the election was called. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From my point of view as, hopefully, an impartial chair of that committee, I point out to the Senate that I was in a situation where we had evidence in relation to the behaviour of the Victorian government and in relation to the behaviour of the federal Treasurer and the federal Treasury. What does one do? In that situation I had two choices. I could either report on the evidence that we had up to that stage&mdash;clearly, that would bring forth the sort of ire that we have heard this afternoon from the members of the government&mdash;or I could say, `Well, we don't have enough evidence yet. Let's roll over until after the election is over'. Quite clearly. one would have then copped the ire of the opposition, saying that to not report on the evidence the committee had before it at that stage was a partisan thing to do. On balance I thought, again on the grounds of openness and transparency, that we should put before the President of the Senate the evidence that we had at that stage and seek to go on after the election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In answering Senator Cooney, raising points made by other senators, that is precisely the reason why I chose to agree with the report as it came before the President in the lead-up to the election. As to the date, that was set before the election. As to the actual meetings, it is not at all unusual for Senate committees to meet in strange places. I have been on several other committees that have met in private meeting rooms in airports, if that was the only place where all the committee members could come together because it just happened that several committee members were passing through a particular airport at a time when they could meet in that place. There is nothing at all unusual about that. They were properly constituted meetings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the shenanigans&mdash;I think that was the word used&mdash;where the chair changed and I was briefly at a meeting, as Senator Robert Ray was pointing out, that occurred because, quite frankly, we had a draft report, I had spoken with the various members of the committee, those members were busy, we knew the meeting should be short and I thought we had an agreement that the committee report would be the committee report and that an understandably dissenting report would come from the Labor Party members which would be included, and that would be the end of the meeting. But the Labor members chose that that was not the way that meeting was to be conducted. Knowing that I had a very short time to be at the committee, they waited until I had to go on to the next flight and then attempted to hijack that committee and to put a different report down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is nothing which is not entirely explainable, picking up Senator Cooney's point again, in terms of the highly political nature of what it is we are investigating. I assure the Senate again that I am attempting as best I can to be an impartial chair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Carr has pointed out, we are in uncharted waters, but I believe the report of this committee will be improved. The evidence will be more comprehensive if these people do come before the committee. Whether they will or not is unknown at this stage, but for Senator Carr to go on and anticipate what the committee might do if they choose not to appear is to move even further into uncharted waters. To hypothesise that we might take certain action is, of course, at this stage totally irrelevant. I commend the motion to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When this matter was last before the chamber I was touching on the interrelationship between the rights of the child, as contained in this convention, and the rights of parents. A fundamental problem with this convention is that it has been challenged on the basis that the relationship between the rights of the child and those of the parent concerned has not been adequately defined, especially where they come into conflict with each other.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I last spoke on this matter in this chamber, I mentioned the report by the National Children's Bureau of Australia, dated March 1993, entitled, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Where Rights are Wronged</EMPHASIS>. I also mentioned that the cover of that report depicted a child standing on the United Nations convention confronting both of his parents as if he were relying on the convention itself in order to have a confrontation with them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the article entitled, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Parental Authority and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child: Are the Fears Justified?</EMPHASIS>, published in the Australian Journal of Family Law in August of last year, its authors, Otlowski and Tsamenyi, stated that, contrary to the assertions of opponents of the convention, it does not seek to define the rights of children vis-a-vis their parents, but rather to protect the rights of children and the rights of parents, exercising their responsibilities in respect of children, from state interference. Of course, that does not really accord with the cover of the report by the National Children's Bureau of Australia, which I have just mentioned, where we have a child confronting his parents over the convention itself. I think that there has been a matter of fundamental concern, certainly from the people who have communicated with my office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is timely to remember the comments by Senator Bolkus to the effect that the convention would not affect domestic legislation, although there was a need to ensure that Commonwealth practices were in accordance with the convention. That means our domestic legislation will have to accord with the convention. If there is some problem in distinguishing the rights of the child as opposed to the rights of the parent, we in Australia could suffer a good deal of confusion in relation to our domestic legislation as a natural follow on from that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I stated previously, Australia has indeed a very fine record in relation to legislation protecting children. I mentioned the Australian Family Law Act which states, among other things, that access is a right of the child and not of the parent; it also provides for separate representation for children and places heavy accent on the wishes of children in relation to custody and guardianship cases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the matter is looked at in a practical sense, Australia today is well ahead of other countries in the world in relation to the rights of the child. I see no need for there to be such a declaration. We have signed the convention; that is sufficient. I do not believe that, as Senator Spindler said, not to allow this declaration would be to slow down the process of enhancing the rights of the child, because I believe that we are well in front of the rest of the world in any event. The old maxim that if change is not necessary why is it necessary to change is applicable here in this case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have signed the convention; we have shown this country's concern for the matters raised in that convention; but I do not think we need take it any further in relation to a declaration by the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch). I say that especially in view of the fact that so much community concern has been raised on this issue. One recalls that there were only some three years of deliberation in the ratification and declaration of this convention as opposed to some 11 years on the convention respecting religious freedom. I believe that such an important matter as this should have wide debate over a good period of time so that all sectors of the Australian community can have an input&mdash;an input which I believe may have been lacking in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe that disallowing this declaration will be a retrograde step in any way. I believe that the points I have made in relation to the current status of legislation dealing with children in this country demonstrate that adequately, and I believe that that could put to rest the fears expressed by Senators Bolkus and Spindler. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly the convention raises some very good points and the coalition does not oppose it as such. But the problem is that the convention does not define sufficiently those areas of conflict which might arise between the rights of parents and their children. To that extent there is no need to take that further step in the declaration that was made by the Attorney-General and I would urge the Senate to support a disallowance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have heard all the legal arguments, we have heard the arguments from the government&mdash;all dispassionate, all analytical, all promoting that an external power should influence the welfare of the children of Australia. But I want to speak from the heart. I am not going to have the United Nations tell me or my wife how we will bring up our children&mdash;and I do not believe that the parents of Australia believe the United Nations should tell them how to do so. Why should the United Nations dictate to us how we should bring up our children?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This convention is about the rights of the child. What about the rights of the parent? It seems ironic that the United Nations, one of the most dysfunctional institutions in the world, will tell me and all Australians how to look after the welfare of our children. The United Nations is $3,000 million in debt as of September this year; it cannot even run its own organisation. Some 146 nations of the world are behind in their payments to the United Nations and that body seeks to tell us how to look after our children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Allowing this United Nations convention to become part of Australia's law will result in Australia's stand in this field being finally decided by an appeal to a United Nations committee of which people of other countries are the members. It could well include representatives from countries such as China with its one child policy and its infanticide of handicapped children, particularly female children; and countries such as Iran, with its muslim fundamentalist policy; countries such as India which, as we saw on television the other night, uses ultrasound to determine the sex of children so that female children can be aborted. These are the countries which are to determine how we will look after Australia's children. The words of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child are so vague as to allow such a committee to decide that they mean entirely different things from what we in Australia consider them to mean. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is well served with its existing laws in this field and we wish this to continue without allowing these matters to be determined by such United Nations committees. That will occur if the rights convention is allowed to become part of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Act. It appears that by adopting such a convention the role of the parent in forming a strong family bond is secondary to the rights of the child. The family is the most fundamental unit in our society&mdash;in every society. By focusing on one part of the family unit, we will ultimately see the family's continued breakdown and its importance marginalised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So while accepting the need to look after the rights of the child, I believe the greater need is to protect the family. Even the United Nations states that the family is the neutral and fundamental group unit of society and is entitled to protection by society in the state. But what about protection from society and protection from the state? That is what is occurring in relation to this convention. Society is crumbling and at present immorality is a growth industry. Public expenditure is spiralling; `commitment' has slipped out of the national vocabulary; and children are running amuck. Most of the reasons for the breakdown of the family stem from intervention from government and from society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask honourable senators to look at what has happened in the past 10 years of this government. We will recall the marital breakdown that occurred as a result of the introduction of Senator Lionel Murphy's laws in that area. If ever there were an example of Murphy's law, that was it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The family is society's best social unit in which values, heritage and culture are transmitted from generation to generation. The family provides care, love and understanding. How any international convention can provide love and warmth to children is beyond me. With marriage breakdown at alarming levels&mdash;an increase of seven per cent last year, in fact&mdash;Australia needs protection for the family, the unit that forms the basis for the nurturing and educating of us all. If we myopically focus on just one member of this institution, we ignore the importance of the whole, because never has the whole been more important than the sum of all parts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Next year, 1994, will be the International Year of the Family. I believe that every year should be the International Year of the Family. Setting aside 12 months to focus on something so central to our society and all those around the world is to ignore and lower the inherent importance and significance that the family plays. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In 1993, let us not just look at the rights of the child; let us look at the rights of the parent, the grandparent, the brother, the sister; let us look at the family unit and ensure that we will not need conventions to protect us; let us foster and strengthen the family ties that bind us all. Without the family we will not have children; without the family we will not have a society; without the family we have no hope. Passing this motion unamended will not protect a single child&mdash;not one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support the motion for disallowance and, in doing so, I wish to refer to a letter that I received today from the Network for Christian Values which, it states, was misrepresented. It was claimed during a speech in relation to discrimination based on religion or religious belief that it was part of a network that was formed in the United States. I have a letter from Mr John McNicol, member of the executive of the Network for Christian Values, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">NCV was set up following a series of meetings held in Canberra, by a group of ministers of religion, a former Professor of Sociology at A.N.U., Mr Derek Brown and myself. Its purpose being to encourage and promote Christian values and ethics.</PARA>
<PARA>In his letter Mr McNicol included a copy of the first issue of the magazine of the Network for Christian Values which outlined its goals and objectives. Listed among the values the NCV supports are equity, justice, equality before the law, freedom, integrity in public life, reconciliation, compassion and tolerance. It believes these are the values which represent a balanced Christian response to the challenges that face our society. Mr McNicol thought that this clarified its position and that, in the days ahead, we will be able to see, through the spoken and printed word, that what they stand for is exemplified in the words of St Augustine: `Unity in essentials, liberty in non-essentials and charity in all things'. I understand that the Network for Christian Values also supports the disallowance of this motion. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have not had a chance to study them but they seem to me to be quite unnecessary and a little provocative in an exercise which, as I understand it, is merely an attempt to establish that this procedure is without prejudice to subsequent debates in the Senate about how we might handle these things. I am not, on the face of it, fussed about that, but we cannot just have sprung on us a motion that has in it some statements of opinion about whether the government's legislation was originally valid or not. I realise that that is of no constitutional effect but it is some statement of view of the Senate which we could not comfortably agree with. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am advised by the Clerk that this occurred in 1981, but this process is new to all of us here. Perhaps I can get some indication of whether there is some reason why this has to be carried now rather than in an hour's time, when we have had a chance to talk about the terms of the motion and get something we can agree with. As I said, on the face of it, the essence of the motion&mdash;in that we are not expressing an opinion ultimately about the powers of the Senate with regard to this matter&mdash;seems to be something about which we would be relaxed. But we cannot tag on to it a couple of exhortations about whether or not things were valid previously. That seems to me to be unnecessary. </PARA>

I think we can carry both of those. That would mean that he would have the right under standing orders to move it at some stage but would not exercise it at this minute.

If Senator Short goes through the first two stages but does not proceed to the third at this point, we will give him an undertaking that at some reasonably early stage during the course of the second reading debate we will enable him to move the motion.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 3) is the first of the eight bills that the Senate will be debating, consequent upon the government's decision following the advice received by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs that the original omnibus bill that the government had proposed&mdash;namely, the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993&mdash;was or could be unconstitutional because it sought to impose a range of different taxation measures and increases all wrapped up in the one bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That bill was an outrageous attempt to circumvent proper parliamentary consideration of the major budget related legislation so far as the taxation aspects of the budget package were concerned. What the government was aiming to do with that catch-all bill was somehow or other to play tricky games with the parliament, particularly with the Senate, to try to make it more difficult for the Senate to exercise its judgment and its responsibility for taking proper and duly considered views and, subsequently, to make decisions on the various elements of the taxation proposals that the government is making in this budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fortunately, the Senate, in its wisdom, rejected that proposition and, as a result of the pressure generated by the coalition, the government in the end took the decision to split that one bill into eight bills. This is one of the eight bills. Those bills cover a very wide range, indeed. Some of them impose very unfair, harsh and regressive tax increases which are in blatant disregard of the government's pre-election commitment not to increase taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those bills impose a huge 55 per cent increase on one of Australia's major industries with great export potential&mdash;the wine industry. They impose new taxes that threaten the jobs of up to 20,000 employees in the tourism industry. They are part of a package of bills that impose very savage increases in the price of fuel for motorists, especially lower income motorists who are forced by this government to own older cars which use leaded petrol. The fuel tax increases are dealt with in a related package of bills; they are not part of these eight bills. Those increases will impose enormous costs on our transport industry and many of our major mining companies. They will be subject to debate in the context of other bills and I will not pursue them further here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 3) effectively abandons two-thirds of the personal income tax cuts that the government promised before the election and, indeed, legislated last year into l-a-w, law&mdash;to use the Treasurer's infamous words of a few months ago. This bill which is now before us seeks to change that set in concrete, unequivocal promise which had been passed into l-a-w, law. We are amending that promise with this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also provides a measly, lousy $2.88 per week compensation to low income earners; that is, those earning less than $20,700 a year. That is something like 40 per cent of all wage earners and 60 per cent of all female employees in the work force. The bill provides a lousy $2.88 per week to offset the savage tax increases placed on practically everything that they buy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of this bill is twofold. One of the basic propositions of the bill is to bring forward the 1994-95 tax cuts. The first of the government's proposals for the two-stage tax cuts that were promised in the budget was that the first one would occur on 1 July 1994 and that the second one would occur on 1 January 1996. The latter promise has gone out the window. This bill legislates for the second tax cuts to be announced at the start of a financial year, whenever that may be, but not before 1997 or 1998. The Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) has said that it will probably be 1998, but it will not be any earlier. The first stage, on the other hand, is being brought forward by a period of about 7 1/2 months to 15 November this year. But that is much the smaller part of the tax cut proposals of the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also contains an amazing and absolutely unacceptable proposition: that the date of effect of the first set of the tax cuts&mdash;which will now be the only tax cut&mdash;is when royal assent has been received for the accompanying package of sales tax bills and also the budget bills that impose very steep increases in the application of fringe benefits tax to various industries, particularly the hospitality and tourism industry. The bill also imposes a disadvantageous change in the tax regime for credit unions as well as a range of other tax increases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the government is saying in this bill before us tonight is that it will not allow the tax cuts that are now planned for 15 November to come into effect unless and until the Senate or the parliament has agreed to all the other bills that make up the government's revenue package. That is an absolutely unacceptable proposal. For that reason I will be moving an amendment to the motion before the Senate to add the following words:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">", but the Senate deplores the Government's attempt to link the bill's commencement with the passage of the Sales Tax bills and the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 1) 1993".</PARA>
<PARA>That provision in the bill is nothing more than a blatant attempt to blackmail the Senate into passing all the accompanying harsh, regressive and unfair bills for which the government has no mandate at all. I refer to the staggering increase in the tax on wine, the increase in sales tax on all goods that are already subject to sales tax and the increases in a range of other taxes as well. This budget increases sales tax for most items to which sales tax applies by no less than 10 per cent in stage one. That is to apply from budget night, which was 17 August this year. The second stage, which will result in a further 10 per cent increase in the rate of sales tax on most items, will apply a couple of years later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">None of those taxes was foreshadowed in the run-up to the election. Indeed, the government went out of its way to stress in the period leading up to the election that it would not, and would not need to, increase taxation in order to pay for the income tax cuts that it promised in an outrageous bribe to the electorate before the election. It has now welshed on those promises to the tune of at least two-thirds of the value of those personal income tax cuts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 19 November last year, in an infamous interview on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS>, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What I am promising is not to put up tax.</PARA>
<PARA>Treasurer Dawkins, when introducing some of the budget bills&mdash;the tax cut legislation&mdash;on 16 September last year said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I emphasise that this&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the income tax cuts&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">will be achieved without resort to any new taxes.</PARA>
<PARA>Two days before the election this year, the Prime Minister said that there would not be any further tax increases. In his election policy speech, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With Labor there will be . . . no new big taxes.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, since the election and in what is contained in the bills now before the Senate, the government has gone back on virtually every promise in the area of taxation that it made in the months leading up to, and throughout, the election campaign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is abolishing the major part of its personal income tax promise; increasing sales tax across the board; putting a huge additional impost on one of Australia's major export opportunity industries&mdash;namely, the wine industry; and slugging motorists and the transport industry, through very savage increases on fuel taxes, with all the increases in costs that we know that will cause. Everything it has done in that context is absolutely contrary to the expectations that the electorate had at election time. Indeed, it is absolutely contrary to the government's mandate at the election, if it had one at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amazing thing we find is that in an interview yesterday the Prime Minister, when asked about this infamous linkage between the giving of the tax cuts contained in this bill and the parliament passing the other tax bills&mdash;the indirect tax increases&mdash;said that this linkage `means nothing'. He told ABC radio yesterday, `Let's forget about all the technical, tricky, rinky-dinky things'. Again, that is a major reversal of the government's view as expressed in this tax legislation. If the Prime Minister says this bill is to mean nothing, why is the government introducing an unprecedented linkage clause into it&mdash;a clause which links this bill with bills that are not related to it in any way, shape or form? It is simply another example of a government in absolute chaos in terms of its economic and budgetary policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget strategy is in absolute tatters, but not because of any delay imposed by the coalition or this chamber. Indeed, if anything, at this stage we in the Senate are ahead in the consideration of the budget and related bills compared with the average of previous years. On average, in the 10 years that this government has been in office, the appropriation bills&mdash;the expenditure bills&mdash;have normally been passed in the latter part of October or the early part of November, similarly with the revenue bills. We are not up to that stage yet and there is not necessarily any indication that there will be any delay beyond the average in the passage of these bills. The only reason why there will be a delay in the passage of these bills is if the government insists on pursuing tactics which deliberately frustrate the parliament's consideration of the budget bills in due and proper form. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other aspect that needs to be stressed, given the whole shibboleth of lies, innuendo and misleading statements being made by the government about the opposition's handling of the budget bills, is that the coalition has never said that it will not pass the appropriation bills in the normal way. Indeed, we have said the contrary: that we will not block supply. There has never been the vaguest suggestion that we would do that. The government is assured of the passage of its appropriation bills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have also told the government that it can have passage of all its revenue bills with the exception of the four that we specifically named the day after the budget, which constitute no more than 1.4 per cent or 1.5 per cent of the government's total budget revenue this year. For the Prime Minister and his Treasurer to run around saying that the opposition is frustrating the proper budget process is, firstly, factually wrong. Secondly, there is no basis at all for saying that the government's budget is being wrecked, because we are guaranteeing the government 100 per cent of its expenditure side of the budget and 98 1/2 per cent of its revenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the government cannot make the necessary adjustments within its totality of budget measures to accommodate the coalition in its opposition to four quite harsh, regressive, iniquitous and, in one particular case at least, monstrously retrospective tax legislation, there is something wrong with the government and its whole economic policy making process. Before the election and since, we have seen clear evidence that the government's economic policy making framework is a shambles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is divided and it does not know where to go. The whole budget is a directionless morass of unrelated issues that bask under the name of a budget. Indeed, the government cannot even get the titles accurate. We are debating a series of what are called taxation deficit reduction bills. In fact, the budget this year is not a deficit reduction budget, it is a deficit blow-out. The deficit last year was $14 1/2 billion. This year, even if the government got all its budget through, the deficit, on the government's own figures, would be $16 billion and that is probably an underestimation because it is based on a very highly suspect forecast of economic growth. </PARA>

But should we put at risk the good of the country and the economic soundness of the economy simply because we have a perception that the party that is now the government said something during an election campaign which we now think it has not adhered to? I would have thought the proper way of dealing with that is to point that out to the people and to make sure that they do not vote for that party at the next election. I would have thought it a very bad ploy and a very bad strategy to vote down taxation bills or appropriation bills simply as a way of punishing the government.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> This bill deals in a responsible way with the tax cuts that were promised. It provides that the first stage of the tax cuts will commence on 15 November this year, which is seven or eight months earlier than originally scheduled. That provision is on the basis that those tax cuts will be accommodated by other provisions in other bills. That is the reason why the provisions in Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 3) are to commence on the day that the other bills mentioned come into operation. The second reading speech of the Assistant Treasurer, the Hon. George Gear, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill provides that the second stage of tax cuts will commence at the beginning of a financial year to be fixed by regulation.</PARA>

All I am saying is that a sum of $3 a week, $150 a year, should not be brushed aside as though it is of no significance. It does provide money in the pockets of people and to that extent they are able to spend it.

In my view, the argument against the wine tax is not an argument that is apposite only to the wine industry but to any industry. It is really a manifestation of the argument that nobody likes to pay tax but somebody has to pay.

Who can forget the Prime Minister boasting at the National Press Club, and to anyone else who listened, that he could deliver the same tax cuts that the coalition was offering but without the GST&mdash;that is, without an increase in the indirect tax base.

During the election campaign it was never stated that there would be a corresponding increase in sales tax to fund the tax reductions, nor was the possibility of such a necessity even remotely recognised. In fact, the opposite occurred. The Labor government disavowed the need for a greater indirect tax revenue and argued that the income tax reductions had been given the status of law that was somewhat irreversible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now, six months later after the election, having successfully put to the Australian people the proposition that income tax reductions were fully funded and could proceed in their own right without recourse to other taxes, we find this disingenuous government seeking, firstly, to renege on half of the promised tax decreases and, secondly, to fund the contingent reductions by simply increasing the tax burden elsewhere, adding costs, unfortunately, to our export industry and effectively driving some firms out of business. </PARA>

If these income tax reductions can be made only with tax increases elsewhere in the revenue, the government should be honest enough to admit that the reductions were irresponsible and unfunded in the first place, amounting to nothing more than desperate and mendacious bribes. Having admitted this, the government should either find expenditure reductions to fund the decrease in the income tax revenue or cease to pursue the income tax reductions altogether. Unfortunately, we cannot expect this government to act with such honour or integrity, so the opposition must force the government to face the results of its own duplicity.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill before us today is a symbol of the betrayal of this government's traditional calling of representing the lower income workers and families throughout Australia. The bill may have lower income tax rates and a rebate of $150 a year to those families whose incomes are $24,450 or less, but these cuts in the rebates will go nowhere near compensating the taxpayers of this country for the increases in all the other taxes that the government has introduced in this budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us think of the unemployment consequences. We were told on Friday by the National Farmers Federation that the excises will add $50 million to the burden on the agricultural sector and will mean a loss of 30,000 jobs. We have seen the impact of a $25 million increase in Nabalco, the unemployment consequences that will arise as a result of the impact of the excise decision in terms of increased shipping costs and, in my own state, the tragedy of bringing forward the closure of the Savage River Mine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer this chamber to a report issued by Dr Neil Warren from the University of New South Wales which reveals that the lowest earning 50 per cent of households will be worse off by up to $1.54 a week as a consequence. I see that the government members are saying, `This report was published when the rebate was only $100 and the petrol price increase for leaded petrol was to be 10c. The rebate is now $150 and the leaded petrol increase will be only 7c'. That is not an unfair response, but I remind the government that the report noticed that the lowest earning 50 per cent of households will be $1.54 a week worse off. On my calculations, $1.54 a week means something like $80.08 a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The petrol rebate has been increased by $50, not $80, and I am sure that a possible $30 less spent on petrol would not go far over one year. It is of importance to note also that the rebate will be received at the end of the financial year, after the lower income families have already incurred the extra cost, and not simultaneously or throughout the year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us examine a little more carefully some of the results of the report. The lowest earning 50 per cent of households are worse off. The next 10 per cent will break even. The next 30 per cent will be a little better off. The highest earning 10 per cent of households will be better off to the tune of $13.46 a week. These calculations allow for the differing needs of households arising from the differing number of people in them. They confirm the widespread belief that the tax changes are highly regressive. They advantage higher income earners and disadvantage low income earners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The excise bills also have a regressive nature. They impact more on the poor. Those who are going to be thrown onto the scrap heap of unemployment will essentially be those who are least able to fend for themselves. The regressive nature of the indirect tax increases can be seen in Dr Warren's findings. They will raise the cost of living of the poorest 10 per cent of households by 1.3 per cent, whereas they will raise the living standards of the richest 10 per cent by one per cent. The regressive nature is further shown by the fact that Dr Warren's findings show that on average the poorest 10 per cent of households will save 54c a week, whereas the richest 10 per cent, which included many two-income couples, will actually save $28.67 per week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not really need Dr Warren's report to emphasise how badly off various sections of the Australian community will be once the budget is instituted. A report by Treasury published by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> gives figures very similar to those contained in Dr Warren's report. This report, released by the Treasurer to this newspaper, reveals that the budget will make the well-off better off and the poor worse off. That supports the findings of the Warren report. By contrast, a similar breadwinner with a dependent spouse and two children who earns $50,000 a year would be 1.2 per cent better off thanks to the budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasury estimates show that a single person on $25,000 a year will be 1.1 per cent worse off after most of the budget tax rises. Figures for single people show that as their income increases they become better off. The report shows that, on average, pensioners and the unemployed will be worse off. It is not surprising that the Treasury figures show that the biggest benefits will go to the working parents receiving the new child-care rebates of up to $3,182 a year. Since low and middle income families already receive fee relief for child care, by definition the main beneficiaries of the rebate will be the two-income families on high incomes who so far have paid for their own child care. Mr Dawkins did not release the estimates for this group. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have before us today a bill which has the promised tax cuts in an amended form&mdash;a form that I believe could be subsequently amended because of deals that this government will be forced to do with other sectors as a result of other unsatisfactory features of other parts of its budget strategy. They represent a symbol of Labor's broken promises and a symbol of a government which has little vision for Australia. What we have is an attempt at the implementation of irresponsible promises made by a party which did not expect to retain government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating this evening the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 3) 1993 which brings forward the first stage of the tax cuts which were legislated before the last election. As honourable senators remember, they were already law, l-a-w. This bill also links passage of these tax cuts to royal assent being given to a raft of tax increases which were not mentioned in any shape or form prior to the last election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These bills are the remnants of a budget already thrashed by caucus and, even at the stage of budget mark 3, they still do not have the support, I understand, of a lot of Labor members. The Keating-Dawkins duo, masters of bluff and threats, have found it difficult to swallow humble pie and admit they got it wrong. Even now, they continue to challenge the constitutional requirements. Their very arrogance is dangerous for Australia as they are prepared to risk a High Court challenge that could throw our financial markets into chaos rather than accept the inevitable and present separate bills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To state that Labor is in total disarray is to put it kindly. One does not have to look at the polls to know that this government has lost the confidence of the people. Calls to my office, to the offices of members of the government, I am sure, and to every coalition office here and in the electorates make it plain that the people want only one thing. They want another vote so they can kick these shysters out. Those are the comments I get on the phone and when meeting people in the street on a daily basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government threatens occasionally a double dissolution. That is a threat? That is something the people of Australia want. It would be the greatest Christmas present that the country ever had and I do not think even this government is that stupid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is worth looking at the record of this government since its re-election on 13 March. As usual, within days the pensioners were the first to get kicked and they are still being belted around. But the key to this now discredited budget is tax cuts and tax increases. The Labor Party and all its members&mdash;every one of them&mdash;should hang their heads in shame for they ran a campaign in every form of the media emphasising that the tax cuts were there, that they were totally funded and that there would be no tax increases to fund them&mdash;none whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberal and National parties were rubbished when they warned that it could not be done. However, I recall the remarks made by the current Treasurer (Mr Dawkins), who said that the budget would correct itself, or words to that effect. In stark contrast, the coalition parties presented a fully funded Fightback plan pitched at restoring strength to an economy that had been vandalised by Labor, an economy that would create permanent jobs in contrast to Labor's training schemes to hide real unemployment. There is no doubt today that a vast majority of Australians now accept that that plan which was put before the people by the coalition was necessary for recovery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor greets every new statistical disaster as another step towards recovery and nothing has changed. Nothing has changed in the approximately eight years I have been here. Just by way of example, in April 1991 Mr Keating, the then Treasurer, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are starting to see the economy recover but this time it will be a sustainable recovery.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The worst is now behind us.</PARA>
<PARA>Since that time we have seen unemployment grow to over one million people, something like 11 per cent unemployed across the country. Worse still, the numbers of long-term unemployed have risen and risen. One could go on because Mr Keating, in particular, never changes his tune and the recovery has never come. What he has done and what the government has done is to destroy confidence&mdash;the confidence of our investors, the confidence of our business and the confidence of our industry. The corporations succeeding today are doing so not because of the government but in spite of the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the first chance the Senate has had to debate these budget bills, notwithstanding the hype that somehow the Senate is holding them back. Tonight is our first opportunity. There have been three rewrites, two of which could be said to have been ordered by Labor members. What a budget of confidence when not even the government's own members stand behind it and when the Prime Minister himself goes into caucus threatening those who have made statements to desist from doing so because they are doing damage to the credibility of the government. The government has already damaged itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have before us tonight is not the original, non-negotiable Treasurer Dawkins's effort which sank under a constitutional bombardment, but now eight bills. Again we have the arrogance of Treasurer Dawkins&mdash;one must presume encouraged by Mr Keating&mdash;who challenges the constitution yet again by linking the bills. There is something fundamentally wrong and frightening about a government that is prepared to put through a budget that, if challenged in the High Court, is most likely to be found at fault. They apparently believe that saving face is far more important than taking this country into economic chaos. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the major things we on this side of the chamber have required is that the bills be constitutionally clean. We believe that is not too much to ask. Every Treasurer wants to be remembered for his budget. Well, Treasurer Dawkins is carving his own very special niche in history as he is on the way to being recorded as the Treasurer who brought down the greatest number of budgets in the shortest time in Australia's political history. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister and the Treasurer made wild and increasingly strident claims that we in the Senate can or will stop the budget. I think we should clarify this from the word go. It is our elected responsibility in the Senate to scrutinise every piece of legislation that comes before us&mdash;all legislation. We can accept it, we can reject it, we can send it back with a request to the other place, we can amend it or we can send it off to a committee for a review. It is the same for any legislation which comes into this place. That is what we are doing and that is what we will continue to do while this Senate exists, although I would not be surprised if part of the hidden agenda of the other side was to make sure that it does not exist or in some way to reduce its powers. </PARA>

The media consistently run it. In February the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> ran an article entitled `Australia tax levels OECD's lowest: study'. The statement was repeated by Mr Swan from the other place at a recent meeting in Brisbane. That is fine but it is always stated, quite correctly&mdash;I do not dispute this&mdash;that the future growth and development of this country is tied hand in glove with the great growth patterns of Asia and South-East Asia.

When it comes to individuals I am particularly interested in the marginal tax rates and the progressive nature of them&mdash;in other words, starting with average weekly earnings, which would be known in those countries, to see the marginal tax rates which occur at that, above and below it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Answer:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Corporate and personal tax rates for the relevant countries are set out below. For those countries with readily available average earnings data (Australia, Japan and Singapore) the levels of income at which personal marginal tax rates cut in are expressed as a percentage of average earnings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The information below shows that Australia's 33 per cent corporate tax rate is lower than that applying in Japan, the Republic of Korea, Indonesia and Malaysia, but higher than that applying in Thailand, Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong. It also shows that Australia's 47 per cent top marginal personal income tax rate (excluding Medicare levy) is lower than that applying in Japan and the Republic of Korea, but higher than that applying in the other Asian countries covered.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, simply comparing income tax rates in Asian economies with those in Australia tells us little about the relative net burden of taxation in Australia. Other factors need to be taken into account. For example, on average, a greater proportion of total tax revenue is raised from taxes on income in Australia than in the East Asian countries. And even though Australia collects, on average, roughly twice as much tax revenue as a percentage of GDP as the East Asian countries, it is relevant that taxes are raised to also fund the provision of government services. A lower level of government services implied by lower tax levels can impose additional costs on business and provides less scope for assistance to those individuals in need. Many Asian countries cannot match the level or quality of infrastructure provided in Australia, nor do they provide the same level or quality of social welfare services. Moreover, a comparison of statutory corporate tax rates does not by itself shed any light on the effective tax rates that apply (that is, taking into account factors such as eligible deductions, capital allowances, adjustment for inflation etc). Effective tax rate calculations are relatively complex and often depend on knowing circumstances applying to specific projects.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise also in support of the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 3). However, firstly I would like to take Senator Parer to task on a couple of specious comments he made about Australia's low tax rating and some nonsense that he introduced about Asia. We are, as he correctly states, the lowest taxed country with the OECD. We do traditionally compare ourselves with the OECD because those countries are roughly at the same level of development as we are. We have similar sorts of values; we have similar approaches to the essentials of a modern, sophisticated society. I refer to health care, high levels of education, a social security safety net, training and so forth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Comparisons with Asia are utter nonsense. It is easy to draw figures out of the hat without doing any sorts of comparisons with the provision of social security, health care and other services. Is the opposition really suggesting that we compare ourselves with Sri Lanka or the Philippines? The countries that are going places in Asia are moving in our direction; we are not moving backwards in their direction. They are moving to increase their social security safety nets and to improve their health care. They are moving for a couple of good reasons: one is that their families are breaking up as industry grows and they are finding that they are having to do that in order to provide services previously provided by the family. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second reason flows from that. If one is going to have a stable society that presents itself to the world as a producer and an exporter that is reliable, one does have to have social stability. That social stability depends on such things as high levels of education and health care and a decent social security safety net that does not depend totally on the family. If Senator Parer is suggesting that we should go backwards to the current levels which obtain in some Asian countries, I simply reject out of hand what he is saying. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The deficit reduction package comprises eight bills and gives effect to changes in the tax law that were contained in the budget. The one that we are speaking to now, Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 3), contains the amendments necessary, firstly, to bring forward the first round of personal tax cuts and, secondly, to introduce the $150 low income rebate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because the government is fiscally responsible and believes in covering promised outlays with appropriate revenue measures, the bill will not take effect until all the other bills in this package, except for the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 2), receive royal assent. The bill will facilitate a bringing forward of promised tax cuts to 15 November of this year. It will provide in this financial year a $1.5 billion stimulus to the economy at a time when the recovery is proving more difficult than anticipated. I have no concerns about admitting that our estimates were not correct. Our estimates were on the best advice of Treasury, Finance and other experts, but they were not correct. We are finding it more difficult than we anticipated to come out of this recession into recovery. So, if we are to be a responsible government, we have to tailor our budget to fit those circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The world economy is not picking up and, while Australia is doing remarkably well with growth rates that are not only among the highest but are the highest in the OECD, there is a need for added stimulus, and I do not shirk from that. As part of this stimulus, the government proposes to inject $1.5 billion into the hands of middle income Australian workers. It is not just money in hand; it is part of an economic strategy, a very necessary economic strategy, to get us out of the sluggish recession that we have been in and into the next phase, the recovery phase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At least $300 million worth of these tax cuts are due before Christmas. Many people, for example, will receive January holiday pay before Christmas. That boosts that amount of money that goes immediately into the community and circulates, multiplying as it goes&mdash;and that is part of the whole recovery strategy. So, if the opposition is successful in blocking the legislation, it will be responsible for preventing middle income Australian workers from getting tax cuts before Christmas. If the opposition has its way, $300 million less will go into people's pockets before Christmas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This will be a significant test for the opposition. If it opposes this bill, not only is it preventing Australian workers from receiving that $1.2 billion over 1993-94 that I have spoken of, but it will also be preventing people from receiving tax cuts at a very personal level. For example, with these advance tax cuts, an accounting clerk on $520 will receive a tax cut of $159; a bus driver on $610 will receive $275; and a firefighter on $730 will receive $529. So, even at that personal level, these tax cuts are not to be sneezed at. But, more importantly, they are part of a government strategy to stimulate the economy at a time when it needs stimulating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is economically irresponsible in the extreme for the opposition to be thinking of stymieing a policy which means so much to our recovery at this very tenuous stage when we are trying to get out of what I have admitted is a very difficult recession. The early delivery of tax cuts is part of a deliberate strategy to stimulate the economy&mdash;a strategy to help us out of the recession we are in. The opposition, if it is successful in opposing this legislation, will prove once and for all that it has abrogated its role as a responsible opposition and as a potential alternative government; it simply is not taking its role seriously any longer. It will have surrendered its role to the Greens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not just me saying this. Some of the opposition's own members and best friends are saying this. If we look at today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>, Gerard Henderson, who has never been known for his radical views, but who is known for his longstanding association with the Liberal Party, says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the unintended consequence of Downer's attack-the-Budget-at-all-costs strategy has been to project the Greens into the very centre of political debate in Australia and to make the erstwhile erratic Democrats appear part of the mainstream. This is the most radical change to occur in Australian politics for nigh on two decades.</PARA>
<PARA>Later in that same article he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Now reflect for a minute. Does Dr Hewson really see a long-term political benefit in giving political centre-stage to Greens who oppose foreign investment? And does Mr Fischer really want to focus attention on two senators who see no benefit in the free trade on world markets of agricultural products? It's about time those who traditionally support the Coalition looked critically at the current political tactics of their friends in Canberra.</PARA>
<PARA>As I said, the opposition will have surrendered its role to the Greens. One can only assume that the opposition sees itself as that: a permanent opposition, never likely to be in government, so never likely to face the Senate situation in reverse when the numbers are stacked against it&mdash;because it really does not see itself as being in government. I happen to believe that is a very realistic proposition to put to those opposite, because I think they are a long time out of government given the internal problems they have. Far from, as Senator Parer says, the government being in disarray; it is the opposition that is in disarray. Those opposite might like to bluster about that, but it is the opposition which is in disarray, and its own commentators are saying so. It has given up on anything responsible. It has handed over power holus-bolus to two Green senators who oppose almost everything those on the opposition benches stand for. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Personally, I think the change that Senator Beahan has just referred to is a change for the better&mdash;but then I am biased. The budget of the Labor government was basically an attempt to make good on promises that, in our opinion, it should not have made. That Australia collects less revenue for government and public services than Turkey and the United States of America is not something we should pride ourselves on. It inevitably puts immense pressure on our ability to deliver social services.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor's major problem was its commitment to reduce income tax on the top half of taxpayers. This was, in turn, pushed by the earlier reductions to the upper levels of tax. Clearly, this whole process has been counter equity and has resulted in increasing divisions between rich and poor. It has also resulted in a reduced ability to deliver any services. The income tax cuts that were passed before the election were opposed by the Greens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Dawkins budget is supposed to be an economically responsible plan to address unemployment within the constraint of improving the deficit. It is instead a mild version of the New Right fantasy, with all the holes overlooked or embedded within program expenditure. It delivers tax cuts of up to $1,152 a year for the upper income half of taxpayers. It increases various indirect taxes to make up for the cuts. Its vaunted equity measures are mainly funded by cuts to other services, often designed in a way that reduces overall expenditure in services. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DX5">Senator MARGETTS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They have been figured in and they are still not equitable. One more sensible and equitable measure could have been to defer the cuts for people in the $36,000 to $50,000 range until the last tranche in 1996-97 year. The tax cut for the $20,700 to $36,000 bracket would give a tax reduction of $612 per annum to all taxpayers in the higher brackets, since they all pay tax on $15,300 of their income at the $20,700 to $36,000 marginal rate. Delaying the tax cuts for those in the upper bracket would not disadvantage the top wage earners; it would just delay additional advantages. Over 81 per cent would get a cut or rebate. If the cuts go through as proposed, the upper 19 per cent would get benefits of up to $520 on top of the $620 flow-on. But this is not the kind of thing that the government has looked at. It has continued to look at cutting from the bottom, with perhaps some efforts in the longer run, or after the huge community outrage, to try to plug some of the worst equity considerations. We are hoping that the government will see the necessity of continuing to work to plug those gaps where people are worst hit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The part of the bill relating to the income tax rebate for low income earners is, of course, something that we would strongly support. This offsets the disadvantage of the first one per cent of wholesale sales tax. We could try to increase the rebate but I doubt whether anyone else in this house, at this stage, has the conscience or social guts to increase that kind of equity consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A one per cent increase in wholesale sales tax alone is negated by expenditure of $15,000 a year on taxable items. But since most people in the under the $21,000 area would spend less than $10,000 annually on taxable goods, it is fairly equitable but only in terms of the wholesale sales tax alone. Taxes will not be limited to wholesale sales tax; of course, there is also the petroleum products excise, and petroleum increases will flow on to add again to the price of most commodities. Other changes in services and tax may impact on this group. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A portion of this group will not receive any benefit from this rebate. These are employed taxpayers who may earn around $10,500, or less than $200 a week. Most in this category will face all the increases but will already have enough deductions to be ineligible for tax. Those earning below that level may be on a benefit of some sort, in which case they get a $3 per week increase, or $156 annually. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is because we believe that the government so far has not done enough to address these considerations in this particular proposed budget that the Greens will be flagging an amendment or change to the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 3). This change has come about because, over time, it has been considered that we&mdash;and all of those people who suggest that there must be more equitable ways in expenditure and revenue raising&mdash;must also make suggestions on different ways in which revenue can be collected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a suggestion, because honourable senators know we like to be helpful, we flag an amendment to propose a new table on income tax for incomes which exceed $100,000 a year. This increase would be in the order of five per cent. There has been some talk of a wealth tax or perhaps an employment levy, but it has only been talk from the government at this stage. We would like to see the government give a commitment&mdash;especially in relation to the currently unfunded holes in its deficit reduction strategy&mdash;to look seriously at more equitable ways of funding these holes in its budget which it has not addressed to date, and to also look at more equitable ways of gathering tax rather than targeting the people on the bottom. This is perhaps just one of a number of options for more equitable revenue raising. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens have stated to the government that we are not wedded to one or another of these revenue measures, but there are a number of measures available which any government with some imagination would be able to find. The government ignores at its peril the message which the community is clearly sending. Fiscal responsibility does not demand cutting from the bottom and forcing the community to subsidise the rich. Also, employment requires market for local industry, not just exports&mdash;and we have never said that we are against exports; we have said that we are against the community being forced to subsidise multinational companies which are already receiving vast amounts of subsidies from the community in a number of different ways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A healthy national economy requires viable regional economies. Small and medium sized businesses provide the majority of employment in this country and make the major contribution to government business revenue. The government is embarking on what we believe is a highly flawed strategy in order, it says, to reduce its budgets deficit in the medium term. It did not need to sacrifice equity. Thus, the Greens WA hope that, should we receive majority support for our proposed changes or for other sensible changes that may come through this process in the Senate, the government will accept the opportunity to improve its very flawed budget package. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This has been an interesting debate to listen to and to have been a part of. It is a debate that is setting the scene for matters more substantial than those with which it practically deals itself. As I understand it, the view of the Senate is that the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill should be passed. There is a second reading amendment floating around&mdash;I do not have a copy in front of me, but I know the essence of it&mdash;which goes to this question of linkage. I will make some comments about that in a moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summing up this debate, I also want to use the opportunity to talk about some of the issues that come up with the declaratory motion that Senator Short mentioned and which will come up, I imagine, at the end of this debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tax cuts that are proposed to be brought forward here, as Senator Beahan so accurately said, not only deliver on an election promise but bring its delivery forward to provide an economic stimulus to the Australian economy at an appropriate time. This measure is a very important part of the macro-economic package that will stimulate activity in the economy through providing tax cuts to individual Australian men and women and through providing the opportunity for those people to also have the benefit of this tax cut earlier than would be the case based on the legislation as currently passed. I think that is important as an equity measure for the men and women of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a lot of concern that, somehow or other, this benefit will flow disproportionately to upper income Australians. There is no way that we can provide tax cuts for lower income Australians without them flowing to upper income people because a person on $100,000 a year has income in every income tax scale so, whatever cuts are made, that person is inevitably the beneficiary. But the focus, the emphasis, the whole thrust of these tax cuts is to centre them on low to middle income earners. Over the last 10 years of this government we have had a strategy that has overwhelmingly focused the balance of the benefit in tax and welfare areas on the lower income earners, particularly people earning below $20,000 a year&mdash;and that is very appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have lifted the threshold, we have cut the bottom tax rate, we have introduced family allowance supplements and other such focused measures, targeting the benefits at the bottom end of the income scale. I think most Australians thought that was appropriate, but it has meant that after 10 years we have got to the point where people on average weekly earnings need a go. We cannot give every year, year after year, the emphasis of every measure to the same group, even a very deserving group such as the lower income group. We are therefore delivering tax cuts to middle Australia. People on average weekly earnings are not rich people; we are talking about people on $35,000 a year or $600 or $700 a week. The clerks in offices around Australia, bus drivers and fitters in the workshop, the sorts of people who are getting around average weekly earnings and battling to make ends meet, are the people who are going to get a substantial benefit out of this measure. It is therefore appropriate that it be brought forward. It is a very equitable way of providing an economic stimulus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Within this package of measures is the lower income rebate, which is very important. Senator Margetts accurately described it as a key compensation element to provide a means by which low income earners can meet the costs that flow to them from the indirect tax measures in other parts of the package. We are very keen to provide those benefits. It is a socially responsible thing to do and an economic stimulus that we would like to provide. We know that providing tax cuts is always popular and that putting up taxes is always unpopular. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is that balance and the incapacity to address that difference that has led to the United States situation of political gridlock. It has created the situation over recent years in which it has been impossible for the executive government in the United States to deliver on the tough decisions that are necessary to get the deficit down and to create the prerequisites that make room in the good years to provide economic stimulus in the periods of slow down. We have had that in Australia in the past decade. We have been able to make those tough decisions. Therefore, we were able to have a surplus in the good years and, almost uniquely in the Western world, had a significant capacity to provide stimulus in the economy as the recession started to bite in the early 1990s. But this year we are in danger of getting to a circumstance where we will lose that capacity forever. We are drifting towards a situation where the Senate gives to itself the capacity to vote for all the soft options and all the things that cost revenue but cop out of a hard decision to vote for the things that will generate the necessary revenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not just talking about this bill; we are talking about the measures in the deficit reduction bill package that originally came before the parliament, because that is essentially what the linkage is about. In this package we are talking about the circumstance in which we are not only seeking to deliver a stimulus and tax cuts this year but a deficit reduction strategy over the four-year period. This is not because of some Chicago school deficit fetish because we have been quite prepared to increase the deficit when economic stimulus was appropriate, as we are doing this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is unarguable that the lower level of debt at which we can discharge whatever social programs we wish to undertake is preferable. Every dollar of debt we take on is a dollar of debt that has to be paid back and a dollar of debt on which interest has to be paid. In such circumstances future generations have less flexibility to initiate programs than those at the moment. It is unarguable that it is desirable over the medium term to have a deficit reduction strategy for that reason and to generate a proper role for the public sector in increasing national savings so that we can fund the necessary investment to create the jobs that we need in the next century. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right, and without Senator Ian Macdonald's help we will stay there for very much longer. We will create the savings that will enable us to fund the investment that will create jobs without having to borrow from overseas. That is why it is necessary to have a deficit reduction strategy. Here we are with a very coherent deficit reduction strategy which has had the endorsement, much to the chagrin of the opposition, of the financial markets and bodies such as Standard and Poors, and of people who have said that this is a very responsible package. They have supported the deficit reduction strategy as economically responsible and as a balanced package&mdash;and it is. That is why it is so sad that there is a capacity on the part of those opposite to derail that important deficit reduction strategy and in the process lose the economic stimulus that is necessary this year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate tries to delude itself that it can, by some amendment to this bill, do away with the linkage between the revenue increases necessary and the revenue reductions generated by this bill. It does not matter what this bill says and it does not matter what resolution this Senate carries&mdash;there is inevitably and inexorably a linkage. It is a linkage of macro-economic fact established by the government and will be implemented through the House of Representatives. It has already made it clear. It has carried the bill with that linkage clause in it and there is no question but that it will again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a situation where whatever the Senate does about linkage, we have a clear unequivocal link that if the Senate does not carry the revenue measures in the budget to fund the deficit reduction strategy by 21 October, the government will not be in a position, responsibly, to pay the tax cuts which we wish to pay by 15 November. We wish to pay for equity reasons, we wish to pay for economic stimulus reasons and we would seek to do so. But we cannot responsibly do so if the revenue increases are not forthcoming and we will not be forced into doing that which we think is wrong and irresponsible, even though we accept that it might be temporarily popular. It would not be responsible government and we will not do it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For that reason, although I welcome the support that these bills have received, I oppose Senator Short's second reading amendment. Second reading amendments come and go; they really do not matter. The essence of the situation is that the Senate cannot delude itself that by some form of amendment to this measure and by the rhetoric in which it wishes to cloak its amendment and its debate around these matters, in some way it can get away from its responsibility in two ways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First, if the Australian taxpayers do not get their tax cuts and the economic stimulus that flows from it before Christmas, the responsibility will lie here and nowhere else and it cannot be avoided with all the bluff and bluster. Secondly, the Senate must seriously consider the long term consequences of the road down which it is going today to interfere with the capacity that Australian governments have always had as executive governments to deliver on their budgets. Governments must have the capacity to make the hard and unpopular decisions that have allowed Australia to have the sustained fiscal credibility in the international markets that is necessary and the fiscal capacity in the difficult times to have the resources to be able to deliver the necessary fiscal stimulus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why this measure and the broader debate around the package of bills which it presages is important. It is important to the individual men and women who will get the benefit from it; it is important to Australia in the short term because of its stimulus; it is important in the long term because of its consequences for the nature of government and economic management in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to say some other things about the procedures for dealing with this bill. I assume that, at the conclusion of this debate, Senator Short will move his motion. It has been said that that has to be done before the conclusion of the second reading stage. So I will make my comments about that motion when it is moved, as I indicated to Senator Short. In case there is any misunderstanding by people other than Senator Short, who knows our position, I indicate that the government will not be opposing that motion, but I will be seeking to make some comments about it. I welcome the support that has been given to the legislation. I commend it to the parliament. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to the history of the tax cuts, which, after all, is what we are talking about tonight. I remind Senator Macdonald, amongst others, that when the tax cut legislation came before the Senate late last year, the Australian Democrats convened a public hearing on these bills. The verdict of a cross-section of witnesses was that the tax cuts were unaffordable, irresponsible and unfairly targeted. We all know now that those who earn less than $20,700 a year will receive nothing from the tax cuts. We all know that that constitutes about 46 per cent of the work force and a majority of working women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think people understood that what we saw late last year in the lead-up to an election campaign was a tax cuts auction. The Liberal's tax cuts were funded. I do not like the way they were funded, with massive asset sales and cuts to the public sector. Nevertheless, it is true that those tax cuts were funded. That is not true of the government's tax cuts, and that is why we are in this situation this evening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a government that insisted on matching unfunded tax cuts with an opposition's proposed tax cuts. That government won the election and now has to find the money to deliver those tax cuts. The point to make, though, is that when those tax cuts became l-a-w, law, the opposition voted for them, unlike the position it has adopted in respect of some of the other tax measures in the budget package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The debate has moved on from there. Before the budget about 47 per cent of Australians said that they would forgo tax cuts in the national interest because they thought that doing something constructive for employment generation and the reduction of the deficit was in the national interest. I am the first to concede that the debate has moved a long way from that point where those 47 per cent of Australians who were polled made those connections. What we find now is that Australians expect to receive tax cuts and need to receive tax cuts in order to absorb some of the increases that the budget is imposing on them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to some of the comments made by Senator McMullan. In formulating a budget, the government of the day has to set some priorities; it has to make some tough decisions. But some of the decisions it had to make were of its own making. The straitjacket it found itself in, in relation to how to raise the money, was of its own making. Once the government has made those decisions, as a consequence it has to wear the ramifications. It has to take the fiscal responsibility for the way the numbers add up. This is where we disagree. The Democrats believe that the government can take that responsibility at the ballot box. It will face the people at the next election. People will remember what has happened in this budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government has been caught out with one of the most unpopular budgets in living memory. But the Democrats, having negotiated about half a billion dollars worth of equitable change, do not see our role as blocking the passage of this budget. That is not to say that we are wildly happy with everything that is in it, but we accept that there is a limit to the change that can be achieved responsibly. By all means we have all been here trying to negotiate to remove the roughest edges and the most unfair elements of the package. We have each offered constructive alternatives which the government has chosen not to take up&mdash;it is the government. If the Democrats were the government of the day, then our budget surely would not look like this. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Macdonald can laugh all he likes, but nobody is particularly impressed with the way the opposition is approaching this budget debate. Without endorsing a lot of measures in the budget package&mdash;and similar to the views of Malcolm Fraser and many other commentators&mdash;we respect the government's right to make those choices and face the consequences. We want to add value to the decisions that are made here. We accept the right to negotiate; we accept the right to seek further evidence. We have done that by sending various measures off to the committee processes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think there comes a time when one has to ask: what is the responsible role of the opposition? Is it really interested in the equity of the measures or is it determined to pursue a strategy which it hopes somehow or other, day after day, through a process of attrition, will see us at an early election and see itself better placed than it was before the last election? I do not care to speculate on who will win the next election, but I know that the people of Australia want honest and constructive government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite can argue all they like about who told the biggest lies prior to the last election. They are not immune from the lie telling that they are accusing others of. We all know that. It is testimony to the way we behave here that the people of Australia not believe anything any of us says. But I think we have reached the point where we have to ask: what is the constructive role of the opposition? Why has it changed its position about the government's right to put forward its own economic management plan? Why is the opposition now repudiating the deficit reduction strategy? Who knows where all this toing-and-froing on the budget will end?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tax cut legislation that we are addressing this evening is the government's response to the changed circumstances. Faced with the prospect of having to find this money, what does it do?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tax cuts which were originally announced in the One Nation statement provide for reductions in the personal marginal tax scales from 15 November this year. Every dollar earned over $20,700 up to $36,000 will be taxed at the lower rate of 34c, which replaces the 38c scale now used. Every dollar earned over $36,000 up to $38,000 will be taxed at the new, lower rate of 34c, replacing the 46c scale now used. Every dollar earned over $38,000 up to $50,000 will be taxed at the new, lower rate of 43c, which replaces the 46c scale now used. Every dollar earned over $50,000 will continue to be taxed at the rate of 47c. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has made a big deal about how these middle income earners have missed out under this Labor government. They have borne the burden of the changes to the income tax rates and they have not been the recipients of the many targeted social welfare measures that the Prime Minister points to as some sort of measure of his government's credibility on assistance to low income earners. One would really have to say that, sure, perhaps there are a lot of people around who are on $34,000 to $38,000, who may be in single income families, who really will benefit from the tax cuts, but I think the rest is a huge question mark. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this legislation, the compensation we have been able to negotiate so far for low income earners is the rebate&mdash;a maximum of $150 for taxpayers with incomes up to $20,700, reducing at a rate of 4c for each extra dollar of income earned and being completely phased out at the income of $24,450. The interaction of this rebate with the new income tax scales will result in a tax reduction of about $3 per week for taxpayers on incomes below $24,450. Those below $6,100 will not now pay tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rebate is half as much again as it was originally set at, but the government could consider, at another time, additional compensatory measures to alleviate the burden on low income earners. It could consider measures such as increasing the additional family payment by an additional $2 per week per child and making the income tax rebate $200&mdash;that proposal was in the package of measures that the Democrats took to the government. Our initiatives were funded by capping the income tax cuts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By partially delivering the income tax cuts, the benefits to those on incomes over $36,000 is limited to $612. The Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) opened his budget speech with this statement:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the greatest issue facing our nation is how to provide jobs for our fellow Australians.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Until last Thursday, that was the last utterance that we had heard from the government on jobs and unemployment. Last week, we heard the admission from the Prime Minister that economic growth alone was not enough to prevent the creation of a jobless underclass. At long last, I guess that is an admission from the government that unemployment will not just go away and that the government has to enlist an active strategy to address it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats hope that the government's green paper and, eventually, its white paper on jobs and unemployment will offer substantially more to the unemployed than this budget does. But it comes down to the crunch point of one's view of the role of the elected government of the day, the role of opposition and the role of minority parties in the process. I have to emphasise again that, had others had their way, the priorities in our budget would be totally different. </PARA>

<PARA>I do not want to take up the time of the Senate unduly, but I want to explain the reason for this declaratory motion, which I guess in plain English is more a disclaimer. The way in which this bill and, indeed, the eight bills which will be the subject of debate in the Senate over the next day or so, have come into being is quite extraordinary.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we know, after considerable pressure from the coalition and others, that outrageous proposition was changed by the government.

Therefore, the motion that I have moved states that the way the bills have been handled does not indicate that the Senate has arrived at any definitive or conclusive view about the constitutionality of the bills and, therefore, the right of the Senate to amend as distinct from request, or conversely. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think I misheard what Senator Short said when moving his motion. Certainly, in our discussions he has assured me that that is not the case, that the opposition will not be seeking to deal with this package of bills in that way. Can I say in regard to this bill that I do not think there is anything controversial. I think nobody has challenged the right of the Senate to amend the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No.3)&mdash;the one we are talking about now. We can argue about whether it should be amended&mdash;that is another question. But I do not believe the capacity to do so is in contention. If it is, that is a problem that someone will have to point out to me. But there is certainly contention with regard to the sales tax package and with regard to the deficit reduction bills Nos 1 and 2. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I understand it, and certainly as was put to me in discussions we had prior to agreeing that this motion should go ahead, the opposition will be treating these as bills about which the Senate should make a request. I think that remains the situation. Is that consist with what Senator Short said?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to direct my remarks to the issue of republicanism, especially in view of the fact that today the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has received the recommendations of the Republican Advisory Committee, presided over by the merchant banker Malcolm Turnbull.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me say at the outset on the issue of national identity that I am not a republican but an unflinching patriot whose credentials would match a republican's any old day. If we accepted the political rantings of the Prime Minister, his merchant bank adviser and their intellectual camp of followers, I should be represented as a senile, monarchical faction clinging to the ruins of an imperial dream. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The republican debate has been so tangled and so misused by the Prime Minister, and by the media presentations of the issue so treated in cartoon pop-up character terms, that the real, defined issues about the nature of Australia's national identity have been overlooked. Consequently I also believe that the simple view of mainstream Australia&mdash;the feeling of the vast majority of Australians&mdash;has been sadly misrepresented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I read in last week's newspaper poll that Australians were turning from the republican push, it did not strike me at all that the Australians were necessarily choosing to remain loyal monarchists, but that they were simply sick of the stupidity, rancour and political opportunism which had seeped into the debate. Most Australians, like myself, cannot relate to the Prime Minister's mad push to alter the nation's constitutional structure on the ground that it expresses a defiant national character or cultural servility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But equally so, I identify hardly at all with those who see Australia through the eyes of the old empire and celebrate the symbols of monarchy. Neither position makes sense to most Australians. This is the very point: the bulk of Australians already are at home in their own country; they already enjoy a simple and ready association with their community and its core values. They have long been low-key cultural republicans, uninterested in the outward, jingoistic forms of nationalism the Prime Minister and his political colleagues are trying to foist upon them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem with the Prime Minister and the Republican Advisory Committee is that they have misunderstood the nature of the Australian identity. They have no feel for how it expresses itself. They have next to no familiarity with how it evolved, beyond flicking through the pages of the bitter, conspiratorial portrayal of the national experience by the likes of Professor Manning Clark. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Essentially, the Prime Minister and the Republican Advisory Committee are looking for the wrong Australia. They are strangers in their own country. They are seeking a European style or American form of nationalism which is way out of kilter with the Australian experience. It is principally for the reason that they are so out of touch with the reality of the Australian experience that they are doomed to fail. Ironically, it is they who are the slavish imitators of traits and attributes from other countries, not mainstream Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister and his entourage, who claim that they speak for Australians, want to turn Australians into race patriots. I am talking about 19th century-style patriotism&mdash;a blind and irrational celebration of race and country. Because they want to turn us into race patriots, bedecked with symbols, new flags and freshly written constitutional documents, they share more with the old monarchical tradition than they do with the straightforward Australian tradition. Australians have national feelings but they are not nationalistic. As the polls have clearly shown, they rightly turn their backs on those such as the Prime Minister who try to profit from getting them to change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The republican debate is a confused one that has burnt itself out as a proper issue for debate. The reasons are simple enough: not only has the Prime Minister politicised and thereby cheapened the issue of national identity; he is unclear in his own mind as to exactly what he is trying to achieve. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WH4">Senator McGAURAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Murphy should consider this: the republican push is divided within its own camp. At any one time, depending on its audience, it can be any one of a number of things. Firstly, it can be a technical exercise to adjust the formal constitutional arrangements so that they come into line with existing Westminster conventions. That is the minimalist approach. Secondly, it can be a political effort to use the issue of national identity to rewrite the constitution to achieve the Labor dream of a centralised popular national government freed from the restraints of federation and the states.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, it can be a means by which to remove the symbols of slavish colonialism which dog our national development and our self-pride. Fourthly, it can be an avenue by which Australia can adopt a newly identified base on multiculturalism or a bridge into the regional economies and cultures to the north. There are probably more but, like most Australians, I switch off when the Prime Minister switches on in relation to these issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to say a few words about each one of those apparent national objectives which the Prime Minister and Malcolm Turnbull say we should be addressing. Firstly, the Australian constitution is not a colonial relic; its intellectual framework was varied, owing much to the variety of Western precedents, especially those in the United States, as well as the Westminster convention. Rewriting the constitution to formalise the practice of Australian constitutional law will only create a legalised government system and a system which will create instability and conflict on a scale only the QCs will recognise and celebrate. If we try to codify the constitution, we will end up singing hymns to the Australian Bar Association and not the republic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the federal system of government is typical of geographically dispersed countries with defined regional interests. It is quite a natural phenomenon. More importantly, we know that the Prime Minister's linkage between republicanism and centralism has more to do with the old Labor mythology that the forces of dark conservatism in the form of the states, the Governor-General and the Westminster traditions, along with the CIA, the capitalists and anyone else we want to throw in, are all out to get them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Thomas Keneally says, the Prime Minister's push to talk in such imperial terms about these matters fits badly with other trends in government policy. How is it that this rampant and rabid Australian Prime Minister with a love of European finery and overseas teak table designs, and hell bent on passing the Australian legal system over into the Geneva based United Nation's treaty system, is able to be a nationalist at the same time? The reason is simple. He is first and foremost a political opportunist&mdash;and nothing else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, the republican push allies itself for political support with multiculturalism and claims that the republic will generate a new identity based on our changing ethnic make-up. This, so the logic goes, will signal our regional positioning and bring us into a deeper commune with the nations of South-East Asia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The republicans, if nothing else, are not immodest. Like most Australians, I have no idea whatsoever what multiculturalism means in regard to the complex historical forces which forge national identity. I do know that multiculturalism is a bureaucratic concept bearing on immigration policy. I know that most countries have largely multicultural communities. I know that multiculturalism is often said in the same breath as freedom, democracy and tolerance, but I do not think multicultural immigration policies gave birth to these values in Australia. Hopefully, immigrants came to Australia to enjoy those pre-existing values, not to establish them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Beyond the vast reservoir of platitudes which drip from the mouths of the politicians and the community groups, I have never heard anyone explain just how the recognition that Australia is becoming increasingly ethnically diverse translates into a defined identification with a body of collective national experience, which is the stuff of national identity. For better or worse, every time a politician talks of multiculturalism, most Australians look for the sign which reads `paid political advertisement'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am at a loss to understand how the republican push also translates into the much-touted push into the South-East Asia region. It beats me how we ever signed the Nara treaty with Japan without the republicans or how we have entered into any economic, political or cultural dialogue with the region to the north. It baffles me how we opened our doors to wider Asian immigration when we labour under such a colonial yoke. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most Asian nations care nothing about the outward forms of the constitutional structures of their trading nations. In Asia those who act sensibly, market intelligently and thoughtfully, and can compete on costs, quality and delivery times, are home. I am yet to hear of trade missions returning from Asia having failed to win markets because of the flag or because in some strictly technical sense the Queen is the head of our state. In the Northern Territory, especially Darwin, we can see how without the republicans the door to Asia has opened already. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most serious failing of the republicans, and also the Prime Minister, is that they and he both presuppose that Australians have no national feeling and that they are deficient in character and tradition. It is at this point that the republicans reveal their lack of understanding of their own country. They are strangers in their own country. Like the worst form of intellectual expatriates, their secret wish is that they were somewhere else. The republicans are intent on rewriting the Australian history. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mainstream Australia, which has had its voice stolen from it over the course of the so-called republican debate, is already comfortable with the independent traditions it has inherited and with its quiet understanding of their significance. The nation is proving too independent for the Prime Minister in his push to re-educate it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has a distinctive identity which is the sum total of its historical experience. That identity will shift over time as the effects of cultural change seep into the national bloodstream, but it is the treatment of the past which is the most dangerous and cynical act the republican movement has perpetrated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the Prime Minister and the Republic Advisory Committee, Australian history is little more than a tributary of colonialism. Australia, its leaders, institutions and community aspirations have been derivative and dependent and nothing more, according to the republicans. This is rotten history and a poor reflection on the truthfulness and honesty of the republicans. Australia grew up and out of the colonial period just as other now independent nations have. But this happened for Australia, thankfully, without the climactic revolutionary moments of other nation states. Ours was a slower, different path to nationhood. If the likes of the Prime Minister and the members of the Republic Advisory Committee do not like this, they are stuck with it. No-one is holding their passports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we have sought to align ourselves with other nations for our security ties, we have done so not because of our sheepish culture but because of the hard reality of survival as a small nation in a geographically exposed environment. Most of our military and strategic efforts from the mid-19th century onwards have been driven by this very fact&mdash;a hard-nosed appreciation of self-interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At some point the Republic Advisory Committee might like to do some serious reading and stay clear of the comic book histories its members seem to read. Does the committee or the Prime Minister know of the great efforts made by the political leadership of this country over the century to secure Australia's strategic interests&mdash;people such as Billy Hughes, Alfred Deakin, Stanley Bruce, Joe Lyons, George Pearce and even Sir Robert Menzies? Does the Prime Minister or Malcolm Turnbull know how Australia perceived the strategic environment in the Pacific in the light of such profound events in our history as the rise of the Japanese regional expansionism from 1903 onwards?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we were so dependent on another culture, why did Deakin try so hard to win the American commitment to the Pacific early in the century, a dream which was only nominally achieved in the 1950s with the signing of the ANZUS treaty? Why did Australia develop its own military intelligence and diplomatic arms such as the Pacific branch in the first decade of this century? Why did Menzies and others painstakingly cultivate British support for the Australian strategic planning and constantly watch the interplay between Australian interest and the deployment of imperial naval strength? Maybe there is a hint in Menzies first speech as Prime Minister when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the Pacific we have primary responsibilities and primary risks. What Great Britain calls the far east we call the Near North (and) little given as I am to encouraging exaggerated ideas of Dominion independence and separation, I have become convinced that, in the Pacific, Australia must regard herself as principally providing herself with her own information and maintaining herself with her own information and maintaining her own diplomatic contact with foreign powers.</PARA>
<PARA>We were later than other dominions in establishing our diplomatic independence, at least officially, but Malcolm Turnbull and the Prime Minister might like to ponder the fact that it was Menzies who, between 1939 and 1941, built up Australia's independent foreign service with an eye to protecting Australia first. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 11 November, some 76 years on, the remains of the unknown Australian soldier will be brought home from the Western Front and laid to rest in the memorial in Canberra. This ceremony will no doubt touch the national soul and remind us that we have a shared national experience which must be remembered and revered. No less were the events on the shores of Gallipoli and in the trenches of Villers-Bretonneux part of Australia's foundation experience than was any civil war or revolution in any other country's history. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australians do not glorify war and they know well that the battlefield is a place of suffering, brutality and pain. This is why they stand in silence at the Australian War Memorial and why their voices soften at the new Vietnam War Memorial. The French may have seen in war <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">La Gloire</EMPHASIS>&mdash;the glory&mdash;and the standard of the Tricolore waving, but Australians only see a struggle and they remember Simpson and his donkey and the horrible march back over the Kokoda Trail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We understand that Australia's past military efforts have involved mighty national commitments and self-sacrifice of a type we hope current and future generations will never need to repeat. Australians have their national collective memories and in this they are not unlike other nations. Most countries are in the same large way born of a moment of what now seems like needless brutality. In the memory of this and the teaching of the past, communities come to a better understanding of the price and the purpose of their nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the United States the Lincoln Memorial stands as the conscience of a nation and a reminder that the savagery of the civil war can only have meaning if current generations take up the challenge of the principles of national unity which ignited it. Though in a slightly different way, so it will be for us. The return of the unknown soldier and the memory of the thousands of white crosses which mark his fallen friends will finally put in place the last missing historical piece of the Australian identity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For all of this, we will never reflect the same obsession with the national symbols as other nations. We are not race patriots and we are a lot different from the Americans, the French and the British in how we express our national feeling. As I said earlier, we like our national feeling but without the nationalism, the hoopla and the contrivances of other nations. I have always thought that this is a measure of the seriousness with which we take our feelings of unity and national endeavour&mdash;stoic and unspoken, but genuine and heartfelt nevertheless. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of this sits oddly at a time when Australians are being told they have no national identity and that they need to have one manufactured for them. I do not know of any national flag which sprang from a national design contest and I do not know of any national song which was selected almost through official tender. No wonder Australians do not want to know the words of that song. Australians see the flag as the flag and not as a cultural cop-out. The whimsy and off-beat <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Waltzing Matilda</EMPHASIS> says something about us we all know that some politicians, merchant bankers and bureaucrats cannot fathom. The Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull and their republican fellow travellers have got it all wrong. We were becoming republicans all along.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now that we are getting into the US-style ticker tape parades and are told we have to embrace some new form of nationalism, I wonder who is going to do the talking for Australians. For all of this, when the remains of the unknown Australian soldier return to rest once and for all in the soil of Australia in November, those of us who are the quiet nationalists&mdash;that stands for the mainstream of Australia&mdash;will celebrate his coming home and our simple good fortune to be born the Australians we know we are. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A few weeks ago it was national autism week, a week which aimed to raise much needed awareness of this mystery disorder. Tonight I want very briefly to draw the Senate's attention to this little understood condition because it affects one person in every thousand in Australia, an estimated 17,569 Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tonight I particularly want to talk about the plight of autistic children in my home state of Tasmania. But before speaking about Tasmania's autism tragedy, I should point out that the incidence and types of autism are not well known&mdash;so much so that many cases miss diagnosis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Autism is a pervasive disorder affecting the whole range of areas of development in a child&mdash;language development, social interaction and the ability to learn. While often there is no outward sign that a disability is present, the various types of autistic children all display unusual behaviour, from the most seriously affected child who is scared of interaction with others to the child who tries to interact but without the ability to express or understand feelings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">`Classic' autistic children have extreme difficulties in relating to people. They avoid eye contact, are mute or have major speech abnormalities and take on seemingly pointless and repetitive activities. These characteristics are less marked in the `passive group' but they also will not initiate spontaneous approaches. They will interact with others but take a passive role. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The `active but odd' group will make spontaneous approaches but, as with the other groups, not for pleasure or to get to know someone. Their IQ may be normal but they often pursue a particular interest to the exclusion of everything else. Thus they are sometimes called the `nutty professor' at school. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the incidence of the severely autistic child is rare&mdash;nearly equalling the incidence of blindness and more common than deafness&mdash;many children throughout Australia fall within a continuum of social impairment from very high to very low functioning. There are autistic associations and centres in most mainland states of Australia. The tragedy is that services for the estimated 11 Tasmanian children born each year with autism are not appropriate. According to Queensland clinical psychologist and autism specialist Dr Tony Attwood, even the minimal services available in Tasmania are about 30 years behind those in the US and Britain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The laws of probability say that there would be about 470 people with autism in Tasmania, including 70 children, but it appears that more than half of these children have missed diagnosis. Work is being done to increase awareness of autism with both professionals and the wider community. However, once diagnosed, these children must have access to the latest developments. Early diagnosis and effective intervention is not only essential but, when considered in terms of long term savings in care, is also cost effective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In dollar terms, the cost to the nation of properly caring for autistic people is estimated to be a massive $585.6 million a year. Even this estimate is conservative. It is based on the proportion of autistic people with high support requirements being one-third of the total number of autism victims. Each autism sufferer in this group is estimated to cost around $60,000 per person a year. The cost of caring for the approximately two-thirds of autistic people with less intensive requirements is valued at about $20,000 per person a year. Importantly, several directors of state autism associations have stressed that the cost of care figure for autism can be reduced significantly with early intervention programs which minimise the need for intensive care later in life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tonight I want to commend to the Senate a proposal to establish a world class therapy and education centre for children with autism and other neurological dysfunctions in Tasmania near Launceston. The centre will function as a satellite of the internationally acclaimed and award winning Giant Steps Centre currently operating in Montreal in Canada. Giant Steps Montreal has a success rate of 95 per cent of children integrated into the mainstream education system within two to three years of their attendance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To date, Giant Steps satellites have been set up in British Columbia, Canada and Connecticut in the United States. The primary aim of Giant Steps is to integrate children with autism and other neurological dysfunctions into mainstream schooling as quickly as possible with as much specialised support as needed. The secondary aim is integration into the wider community so these children can achieve self-reliance, participation and choice as independent adults. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The newly formed Autism Association in Tasmania has applied to the state government for recurrent and capital funding for Giant Steps. The state department's evaluation is yet to be presented to the minister. However, it is much more difficult for a small state with a smaller tax base to provide funding to such small groups of people. Yet those who live in poorer, decentralised and less populated centres such as Tasmania deserve full support. This is where the role of the federal government should be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Giant Steps has applied to the Department of Employment, Education and Training for recurrent funding commencing in 1995 and has put in a late notification for funding for 1994. The application to DEET has been evaluated by the new schools committee, but it appears that a technical difficulty and other concerns have precluded Giant Steps from DEET funding to date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Giant Steps does not currently satisfy the state registration requirements. I am told that the new education bill, scheduled to be finalised next autumn sitting, will amend the legislation to allow Giant Steps to be considered in a special schools category. Unfortunately, until such time as DEET has notification from the state registration board that the legislation is amended, Giant Steps does not meet funding requirements. There are also concerns about the viability of Giant Steps and the basis on which the Giant Steps committee calculated its enrolments. Giant Steps will need to put its proposal up again once the state legislation has been amended. It will need to address those concerns expressed to date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also understand that the Tasmanian Teachers Federation has objected on the grounds that there are already special schools and services in the state. However, the assistance that is provided in those schools is within the existing system, where teachers have particular education skills but they do not have specific training to apply those skills to autistic children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the technicalities and concerns preventing funding at the moment, I feel that Giant Steps should be supported. In most cases, specialist speech therapy, occupational therapy and music therapy are not available to those children with autism currently in the existing education system. There is no specific integrated therapy and education program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A cost effectiveness study has been developed which indicates that the lifetime cost for the person who does not have the benefit of Giant Steps, in purely financial terms, may be as high as three times the expenditure on a person who benefits from the program and thus obtains a higher level of self-sufficiency. In social terms, the effects on family life where a member of the family has autism is significant. The Giant Steps program involves the whole family so that siblings better understand and the family's quality of life is greatly improved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The program has great support from the local community. I am told that the local service clubs have agreed to help establish the centre, with provisions for a building and land, once there is government funding. The opportunity to establish this centre should not be ignored. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A world leader in autism, Giant Steps is involved in research programs with Harvard and UCLA universities, the George Washington University Medical School and the Children's Brain Research Clinic in Washington. Giant Steps Tasmania would expect also to be the focus of such research. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the economic climate, mainland autism centres are attracting continued funding and are a valued service. All children have the right to an appropriate education. Surely Tasmanian children with neuro-integrative dysfunction should not be penalised, but should be helped to achieve their maximum potential within the community, even though that community is a very small community with a small tax base to afford to support the school. In many cases, with appropriate support, autistic children can go on to lead normal independent lives. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator Robert Ray</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Employment, Education and Training has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) It is intended that once construction has commenced, payments will be claim based. At this stage therefore it is estimated that funds will be provided as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">1993/94&mdash;$1.50m</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">1994/95&mdash;$4.75m</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">1995/96&mdash;$6.00m</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">1996/97&mdash;$2.75m</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The Government's promise to provide $3m in 1994 and $6.5m in 1995 from the Capital Development Pool will be honoured. Estimated payments by financial years is outlined above.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Allocations from the Capital Development Pool represent a Commonwealth contribution towards the development of major new campuses. Institutions and States are expected to contribute significantly to new campus developments, with the States to meet the cost of land and, where appropriate, the provision of infrastructure up to the site boundary. The Queensland Government will still be required to honour its funding promise. It will also be required to contribute towards any future new campus developments in the State. All new campus proposals are initiated in the context of long term strategic planning by both the State and the institution. These proposals are then considered through the joint Commonwealth/State higher education planning committee process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) It is not clear on what basis it has been calculated that approximately $50m is required to bring JCU up to a competitive level with other universities in Queensland. In 1990, a relative funding model was applied to higher education institutions to provide a mechanism for recurrent funding to institutions within the unified national system to be funded equitably for an agreed profile covering their teaching and research activities. The model was used to establish relativities among institutions and as a mechanism to move institutions within an acceptable band of funding variation. In the application of the model, JCU was found to be within the tolerance band, and hence no adjustments were deemed necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As regards the provision of capital funding, JCU will have received $28.1m between 1989 and 1995 from the Commonwealth for the provision of capital facilities. This includes $4.8m in 1994 and 1995 as a result of the Government's decision to incorporate capital funds into institutional operating grant funds from 1994. The university will continue to receive its share of the $239 million which will be available to the higher education system on a weighted EFTSU basis for capital purposes through the roll-in arrangements from 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the period 1989-95, JCU has received around $775 per funded EFTSU for capital purposes. This figure is approximately 13% higher than the $684 dollars per funded EFTSU for Queensland over the same period. These figures exclude the $15m which is to be provided for the Cairns campus development.</PARA>
