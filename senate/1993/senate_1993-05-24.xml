</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1061" SPEAKER="McMullan Sen The Hon R.F." NAMEID="5I4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="ACT" MINISTERIAL="ARTS AND ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Burns for this question because it raises some important issues that are under current examination. The Auditor-General expressed some concern about the way in which government purchasing is being undertaken within some departments. Given that the overall responsibility for purchasing guidelines, et cetera, lies within my department, it is a matter about which I and the department have had some concern. The department and I, together with my Parliamentary Secretary who is principally responsible in this area, Janice Crosio, are working to develop a response.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government accepts the need to continually improve and enhance the professionalism and effectiveness of government purchasing, as outlined in the Auditor-General's report, and has taken a number of measures in this area. I should say&mdash;and I will come back to this area&mdash;that, while the Auditor-General is correct in that we do need to improve our performance, we do not need to apologise for the quality of our performance; it is recognised fairly widely as being of high quality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A major program of training for staff involved in purchasing and the development of a national competency based procurement curriculum has been announced by the Government. We will be launching this program here at Parliament House this week. The secretaries to Commonwealth departments and agency heads, together with a wide range of senior departmental managers, have been invited. At that time, I will be having some more to say about the importance of purchasing and the need to ensure the professionalism of government buyers. The Government has also announced increased Commonwealth funding for the Industrial Supplies Office and a requirement for agencies to develop agreements with the ISO about how they will use its services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While emphasising the importance of responding to those valid criticisms by the Auditor-General, purchasing guidelines developed by Purchasing Australia have been recognised internationally as a significant step forward in improving the effectiveness of government purchasing. The general manager of the purchasing branch within the Department of Administrative Services has had correspondence with the Office of Management and Budget of the President of the United States, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your purchasing guidelines are universally seen here as a real improvement in communicating basic principles effectively.</PARA>
<PARA>It requests further sets of that documentation and continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This opportunity for us to change is welcome by many but a challenge to develop realistic alternatives. Your work is a model for what can be done with the right commitment.</PARA>
<PARA>This letter is signed by the Deputy Associate Administrator of the Office of Management and Budget. While there is more to do and while the Auditor-General's review is welcome and the response to it is appropriate, Australia does not have any cause to be apologetic about the skill and the appropriateness with which we conduct the purchasing function.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Transport and Communications. According to the Pearce report, by mid-November the department had clearly decided that no deposit was required for satellite tenders and a document specifically saying so was already in intradepartmental circulation. As this was clearly contrary to the policy approach spelt out in the 10 October determination for MDS tenders which imposed a five per cent deposit requirement, how could this possibly have occurred?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1062" SPEAKER="Collins Sen The Hon R.L." NAMEID="OF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="NT" MINISTERIAL="TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That matter has been addressed by the Pearce report as Senator Alston correctly stated. As Senator Alston will find when he reads the papers that will be tabled in Parliament as soon as possible this afternoon&mdash;he has already been provided with an advance copy of those papers, as has Senator Bourne&mdash;the single document referred to by Professor Pearce in his report is included, as one would expect it to be, in those documents that are relevant to the satellite process. I read it with great interest. As Professor Pearce has said, it is the only document in that mass of documentation with corrected notations and margin notes and so on that Senator Alston received, I think earlier today, that specifically mentions the fact that no deposit will be required.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the Pearce report does cover the deliberations that were held by those officers in relation to that issue where, as has already been revealed to the Senate, a deliberate decision was taken. The Pearce report&mdash;I think from memory it was paragraph 26 or 27&mdash;canvassed the principal reason for that, which was that the officers, when they had been told by the Attorney-General's Department that they could not apply those prequalification tests which they wanted to put on, referred to in that earlier advice tabled in the Senate as being `the department's preferred position', because in the view of the Attorney-General's Department that would conflict with what would be a price based system, they then sent the amended proposal off to the Attorney-General's Department, and had done so on the assumption that this would be given commercial scrutiny by the commercial law section of the Attorney-General's Department.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I described this in the debate on Thursday as being in my view the most serious omission highlighted by the Pearce report. As Professor Pearce said&mdash;in the paragraph I have just mentioned&mdash;that assumption was not well founded, and that indeed is the explanation. They did take a deliberate decision to place prequalification conditions on, which would have picked up these problems. The Attorney-General's Department advised them that they could not do it. They then removed those prequalification conditions and sent the matter to the Attorney-General's Department, assuming that it would be given commercial scrutiny&mdash;and that assumption was not based on good grounds. That has been laid out quite comprehensively in the Pearce report, and it is a matter that will be redressed in advice which I will provide to the Senate later this week on how these problems are going to be addressed in a way that will ensure they do not recur.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. The Pearce report says that the origins of that critical document and its status are not entirely clear. Has the Minister been able to get to the bottom of that document and the context in which it originated and, in particular, are there any records of the meeting that was held in mid-November at which, presumably, all these matters were discussed? Were they brought to the Minister's attention or was he once again given the mushroom treatment?</PARA></TALK.START>

We did make some attempt yesterday to provide the documents to Senator Alston, but they certainly would have been provided to him no later than this morning. All those documents make clear what Professor Pearce has said&mdash;and there is not a satisfactory explanation for it; it is an error which will now have to be addressed. The only document which specifically addresses in a positive, assertive way that no deposit would be required is the document that Professor Pearce has referred to in his report. It is contained in that bundle of documents which Senator Alston has and which I will table later today. Professor Pearce has also made adverse critical comment on what he believes to be the less than satisfactory record of keeping notes on the actual meetings that took place. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister for Family Services and the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women. Further to the Minister's report recently on the treatment of women by financial institutions, what further steps can she propose to improve services to women in banks?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1063" SPEAKER="Crowley Sen The Hon R.A." NAMEID="ZF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="SA" MINISTERIAL="FAMILY SERVICES" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZF4">Senator CROWLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The question reminds the Senate of the report to which I drew attention a week and a half ago. That report found that about 82 per cent of women were dissatisfied with the service they were receiving from Australian financial institutions. The report made a number of suggestions to banks about how they should treat women customers. The advice boiled down to one simple rule: if you treat women with the equal seriousness and the responsibility that you treat other customers, women will be much more pleased and, indeed, will not take their business away from that institution or bank to somewhere else.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have another suggestion for banks. Following up that report, I discovered that of the 13 largest banks in Australia only four have a woman on the board of directors. The Government has appointed women to the boards of the Commonwealth Bank and the Reserve Bank of Australia. There are literally hundreds of women with great riches of experience, with great talent, with economic skills and with more skills besides, particularly the capacity to know how women might prefer to be treated when they go into banks. I can certainly make many nominations, though I will not do that here. But if any banks should seek my advice or the advice of the Office of the Status of Women there are certainly extensive lists of women who are more than competent and more than capable to assist in this way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I challenge the banks of Australia to take the opportunity when there is next a vacancy on the board to consider filling it with a woman. I assure them that, in meeting this challenge, not only will they be promoting equality but they will also be, according to the report and the evidence of that report, practising good commercial sense.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XG4">Senator GILES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. What is the Government's response to the verdict in the trial of Fretilin leader Xanana Gusmao? Was the trial conducted fairly and was Xanana given adequate opportunities to mount a defence?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1064" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Xanana Gusmao was found guilty last Friday, 21 May, under article 106 of the Indonesian criminal code, of sedition and rebellion and, under the emergency law, of possession of firearms. He has been sentenced to life imprisonment. He was not charged under the anti-subversion law, which carried the death penalty and, although the firearms offence did carry that penalty, it was not sought by the prosecution. The length of the life sentence has not been specified, but it should not be assumed that it means for term of one's natural life. In other cases in Indonesia life imprisonment has meant around 15 to 20 years, although with crimes against the State there have been cases&mdash;it must be acknowledged&mdash;in which this has been exceeded.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given Xanana's self-acknowledged role as the leader of the armed resistance in East Timor and the uncontested nature of the key elements of the evidence, it has to be said that that verdict was not surprising. In fact, when compared with the charges laid and the sentences handed down in trials of other so-called rebels in Indonesia, Xanana's sentence is in fact less severe. His defence lawyer, Sudjono, has now said that Xanana is not appealing the sentence but will be seeking presidential clemency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have already made clear on a number of occasions, and I do so again, my hope and the Australian Government's hope that the Indonesian authorities will see the handling of Xanana's case as an occasion for achieving longer term reconciliation in East Timor, including through such strategies as a major reduction in the military presence, a major economic development strategy, further recognition of East Timor's distinctive cultural identity and possibly some greater degree of autonomy. It would obviously be of great help in achieving that reconciliation if Xanana's sentence were to be substantially reduced by presidential clemency and we will be making that point in our further discussions with the Indonesian Government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the conduct of the trial, while in terms of the standards that we and others would ideally like to see applied, there were a number of specific problems with the overall fairness of the trial. However, they should not be overstated. None of them was unique to the management of this case nor were they, in our judgment, so severe or so deep in nature as to have fundamentally impaired the process that is provided for under the Indonesian Criminal Procedures Code. Overall, court proceedings were open to diplomatic observers, to local and foreign media and to domestic and international human rights organisations, including Asia Watch, the ICJ and a UN observer. That was a welcome development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it was regrettable that certain individual observers, including Australia's Rodney Lewis, were prevented from attending, effectively at all, and that no observers at all were admitted to the trial sessions on 12 and 17 May. It is also a matter for concern that Xanana was barred by court authorities from reading out in full his own prepared defence statement. The criminal code of Indonesia does provide for the accused to exercise the right of a full and final say and defence lawyer Sujono argued strongly that he should be allowed to read the full statement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the question of legal representation, it is not clear again that Xanana was given the lawyer of his choice, but it does seem at the same time generally accepted that defence lawyer Sudjono did make diligent and comprehensive efforts in mounting the defence case. He met Xanana five times before the trial began and had no difficulty of access to him during the trial.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, on the question of his treatment during detention and trial, we have no information to suggest that he was ill-treated, and we have been closely following the case through our mission in Jakarta from the start, including through contact with a number of independent non-government organisations. I remain confident of the assurances given to me at the highest levels of the Indonesian Government that Xanana would not be ill-treated in detention. I have, however, instructed our embassy in Jakarta to raise with the Indonesian authorities the need for continuing regular access by the International Committee of the Red Cross to Xanana and to other detainees.</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed, ad nauseam, in the Senate. That matter has been specifically addressed again and again. The clue, as I said some weeks ago, is contained in the AG's advice that was tabled earlier in Parliament. Professor Pearce's report has now indicated that in terms of what I said was a clue was correct&mdash;that is, the line in the AG's report which says, `The department's preferred position is. . . ' and then goes on to list the very prequalification conditions that Senator Alston has just referred to. The department went ahead precisely in accordance with the Cabinet determination and drafted a set of five hurdles, one of which was that prequalification of company viability. The AG's advice was sent back to the department rejecting all of those five hurdles&mdash;not, as I took pains to say in here, rejecting the next possibility of putting a deposit on, but rejecting the very hurdles that Senator Alston has just referred to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What then happened&mdash;I was correct, I have just looked it up; it is canvassed in paragraph 27 of Professor Pearce's report&mdash;is that, having had AG's advice, which has already been tabled in here, a fortnight ago, that this could not be done, the department then sent it off to AG's and assumed that commercial scrutiny would be given to the document by the commercial law section of what is now, I am told, called the Attorney-General's legal practice. That was not done. As I said in the Senate last week, and I am again going over this issue, I identified that as what I thought was probably the most serious single omission, as Senator Kernot and Senator Bourne will recall. In paragraph 27 Professor Pearce found that there were not sufficient grounds on which that assumption could be made. That was an error. I am now determined that procedures will be put in place that will ensure that the error will not occur again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the general question of ministerial responsibility that Senator Alston is canvassing once again, in one of the more thoughtful newspaper articles I have read about this last week, there was a reference to a research paper on this subject by Barbara Page of the University of Sydney. It is a fascinating article which canvasses all of the 11 occasions since the beginning of the Fraser Government when Ministers have been called upon to resign over departmental maladministration. One of the most fascinating involved Senator Durack who, of course, is still with us. Senator Durack's case was unique in that it was not just the Opposition which called for his resignation and the media which, as this paper points out, always call for Ministers to resign. That call for resignation in Senator Durack's case, as I am sure he will recall, was joined publicly by two very prominent colleagues of his who were former Ministers, one of whom is still in the House of Representatives, Mr Andrew Peacock. The interesting thing about this paper in terms of the wall-to-wall humbug which has been written on the subject is that none of those 11 Ministers resigned&mdash;not one of them&mdash;up to and including Senator Durack. For the edification of honourable senators who have got some interest in this matter, and it is an interesting paper to read, I table the paper.</PARA>

An assessment will be made of this coverage for the Tasmanian north coast. The Pilbara system will cover the approaches to three major ports in the region&mdash;Dampier, Port Hedland and Port Walcott. Transmissions are planned to begin in Victoria in December this year and in the Pilbara in March 1994. The system will transmit data in the medium frequency marine radio navigation band.

I refer the Minister to an incident that occurred at the Brisbane airport in July 1992 when an Ansett 727 blew an engine and was forced to return. During the emergency procedures, events took place that were reminiscent of the Keystone Cops. The senior operator control officer position had been abolished and no response was obtained at his phone. The metropolitan fire brigade dispatched two units to a locked gate and were denied access. Three airport fire brigades were dispatched from their holding point; one drove into a ditch and was rendered inoperative. The metropolitan police learned about the incident over the commercial radio and arrived 1 1/2 hours later. In view of the very serious nature of the lack of emergency procedures, can the Minister advise why there has been no surveillance by the CAA of the airport emergency plans?

I emphasise that it does not cover items which happen to be in Australia that somebody at an art auction might consider commercially valuable and which are measured&mdash;as in the very recent instance that provoked this article&mdash;by the preparedness of people to pay a lot of money for them, but that they are assessed to be of cultural significance to Australia.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Owners of objects that are covered by part II of the Act must apply to the department for a permit if they wish to export them. The assessment is made on the cultural heritage significance of these items, not necessarily on their commercial value. The recent matter of controversy that provoked the article involved an historic calculator that was valued at a very low price but which was eventually sold at a very high price through Christie's. That might be a matter of concern to people who bid off the Christie's catalogue, but it is not necessarily a cause of significance to us, even though it is a matter for contemplation because the calculator was in the possession of an Australian. But that of itself does not make it of cultural significance in Australia.</PARA>

Indeed, I think the process of actually getting that building established is some 29 years. But, in fact, the design of the building started in 1987&mdash;the final commitment to proceed&mdash;and the construction in 1989. It matches very well the passage of the Therapeutic Goods Act, which was introduced and passed in this place in 1989, and that provides the legislative basis for a new uniform national system. The States are in the process of passing complementary legislation to ensure that therapeutic good products are all subject to proper regulation.

We know that that is a fine balance, and I believe the recommendations contained in Peter Baume's report produce a very good outcome in terms of bringing those two factors together.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5K4">Senator FAULKNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This may not be of interest to Senator Newman. I suppose that it would not be of interest to people like Senator Newman who live in luxurious and palatial homes, but for many other ordinary Australians it is of a great deal of interest. The recent dramatic improvement in the quality of houses occupied by service personnel and their families is a very significant achievement of this Government. The Government has recognised that the need to have a mobile, responsive Defence Force places significant pressures on service families and that they do not need the added problem of inadequate housing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> So much has been achieved that it is easy to forget the magnitude of the defence housing problem of just a few years ago. At that time families were required to live in houses that were too small and that were in inconvenient locations. Provision for repairs and maintenance was inadequate and often long delays were suffered. Poor quality housing was impacting adversely on morale and wastage rates of skilled personnel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1986 the Government decided to fix this problem and made a 10-year commitment to invest $750 million&mdash;in 1986 dollars&mdash;to improve the quality of defence housing. The Defence Housing Authority was established as a government business enterprise to manage housing on a commercial basis. Over its first five years of operation, the Defence Housing Authority has acquired more than 9,200 good quality houses. It has disposed of more than 8,000 of the worst of the houses considered below community standards. It has also increased the value of its housing assets from $520 million to $1,650 million. It has spent $217 million on repairs and maintenance and a further $103 million on improvements to existing houses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The authority's policy has been to maximise the involvement of the private sector. An example is the housing estate at Wattle Grove in Sydney, which is a joint venture with Delfin Property Group Ltd. The Wattle Grove estate is an outstanding example of a development which integrates service personnel and their families into the community in good quality, well landscaped housing. Similar estates are being developed at Fairview Rise in Ipswich, Queensland, which I know is of interest to Senator Colston, and Streeton Views at McLeod near Melbourne under joint venture arrangements. Independent surveys of service families confirm high levels of satisfaction with the new houses acquired and the quality of repairs and maintenance service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's commitment to decent housing for our defence personnel and their families is showing dramatic results. These improvements in defence housing show that the defence organisation is a responsible employer. They are also a sign of the Government's progressive public sector housing policies.</PARA>

Only one thing has been devalued more in this country than the value of our currency and that is the word of our Prime Minister (Mr Keating). As my colleague Senator Tierney said in his notice of motion, it is very clear that the Prime Minister went to an election making promises that he and his Ministers knew simply could not be kept. That is why we have raised this matter of public importance, which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's obvious intention to abandon its election promises in order to reduce the massive Budget deficit.</PARA>
<PARA>In just over two months Australian voters have seen the Government back away from, modify or substantially delay promises in a whole range of areas including the funding of its dental health program, providing a home child-care allowance, purchasing private hospital beds for public patients on hospital waiting lists, and funding a survey of the Darwin to Alice Springs railway&mdash;an issue of particular importance to my colleagues from South Australia, to which Senator Ferguson recently referred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the last election I debated retirement policy in the Ivanhoe Town Hall with the ALP member for Burke, Mr Neil O'Keefe, before some 500 pensioners and self-funded retirees. During this debate&mdash;I think this is important because it was witnessed by more than 500 people in the audience&mdash;Mr O'Keefe was asked whether the Keating Labor Government intended to keep its promise to exempt all age pensioners from tax by 1995. It was a very clear question and I was asked the same thing. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Patterson" NAMEID="LI4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WW4">Senator KEMP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Patterson will be appalled to learn that in answer to this question and in front of all these pensioners Mr O'Keefe promised that by 1995 all pensioners and part-pensioners, whether in receipt of some age pension or service pension, would be exempt from tax. That promise to pensioners was repeated all over the country. I believe Senator Patterson can quote a similar case in the electorate of Holt where the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Crean, made precisely the same promise, and all of my colleagues can refer to similar examples. This promise was made deliberately to fool pensioners and part-pensioners&mdash;and it is just one of many. This was a major promise with significant implications for many older Australians which, along with the other promises I have listed, has been dumped by the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Madam Acting Deputy President, you may recall the fanfare when the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, announced at the start of the election campaign on 19 February the basis of his new accord with the ACTU&mdash;accord mark 7. You may recall that the headlines on that day were all about a new pay deal with the union movement. A central part of the agreement was that after 1 July&mdash;in just over a month's time&mdash;there would be a $8 a week pay rise for all workers to provide a safety net for those who did not achieve pay rises through workplace bargaining. This was a clear election promise; it was made in the context of an election campaign. It was intended to show that this Government believed, through its economic policy, it could make this kind of guarantee to all workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what happened? Just a few weeks ago&mdash;some two months after the election campaign&mdash;this commitment to all Australian workers was scrapped and its scrapping was announced by none other than Mr Martin Ferguson of the ACTU. So those lower paid workers, that core constituency of the Labor Party, have lost their pay rise. It is interesting to note that on 1 July, the date on which lower paid workers were to be entitled to their $8 a week pay rise, members of the Senior Executive Service, the highest paid members of the Public Service, including those on $100,000 plus per year&mdash;the Mr Costello's of Senator Evans's department&mdash;will become entitled to performance based pay rises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 1 July, ordinary workers will have to forgo their $8 per week pay rise. On 1 July, the Senior Executive Service will be entitled to performance based cash bonuses, ranging from $8,000 to $15,000, which will be payable after 1 July. I suggest to the Senate that Mr Keating made an interesting comment about the Government's priorities. Mr Keating had no problem in keeping his promises to higher paid workers&mdash;a promise which was endorsed by Mr Kelty and Mr Ferguson of the ACTU&mdash;but his commitment to lower paid workers was not kept. In fact, it was scrapped. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is only the start. What we are seeing is a Budget deficit out of control; a Budget deficit of Whitlamesque proportions. Those of us who lived through the appalling mismanagement of the Whitlam period from 1972-75, and Senator Sherry will recall this period, are now seeing the same thing emerging with Mr Keating. This is a result of the irresponsible nature of the commitments he has made and because he will do and say anything in an attempt to win an election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This year's Budget was originally forecast to have a deficit of $13 billion&mdash;this is a figure that Senator Sherry will certainly confirm. This Budget has already blown out by some $3 billion and will probably show a deficit in the order of $16 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we examine next year's Budget we find that the deficit will continue to spiral. The so-called starting point for next year's Budget&mdash;I think as Senator Evans or certainly his colleagues have confirmed&mdash;will be in the order of $18 billion. Mr Keating is the highest taxing, highest spending Prime Minister in Australian history. He is far worse than the notorious Mr Gough Whitlam. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of the spiralling Budget deficit, a Budget out of control, it is clear that Mr Keating will have to dump another series of promises, including the major election promise not to raise taxes. We can recall, and I am sure Labor senators will recall, that this Government has a magnificent record of breaking its central election promises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What was the central election promise of this Government in 1987? I am sure honourable senators will remember. It was that by 1990 no child would live in poverty. That was a promise made by Mr Hawke and endorsed by Mr Keating, even though he knew it could not be kept and even though the finance Ministers and senior Ministers of this Government knew it could not be kept. That promise was of course broken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What was the central promise of the 1990 election? I remind Senator Sherry that the central promise was that there would be no recession. Day after day during the election campaign, Mr Keating went around informing the electorate that there would be no recession. What happened? We had the worst recession in 60 years and a million people unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What was the central promise made by Mr Keating during the 1993 election? I suggest to the Senate that the central election promise was that there would be significant income tax cuts and no consumption taxes of any sort. Those were the promises that Mr Keating made when he went into the last election. It has become clear from the figures that I have quoted that taxes are going to have to rise, and will probably have to rise very substantially indeed. Mr Keating made these promises knowing full well that if he was elected the day of reckoning would come, but that when he was safely ensconced in the Lodge, with perhaps two to three years to govern the country, all the commitments that he made to Australian voters could be dropped. In my view, those promises will be dropped. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In just two months the Government has moved from its position of promising `no new taxes' and substantial income tax cuts to the position of floating a whole series of new ideas on future tax increases. One example has been the foreshadowing of a rise in the excise on fuel taxes. Perhaps Senator Sherry could confirm whether the Government will proceed with its proposal for an excise tax on energy&mdash;presumably on coal and natural gas. Ideas have been floated&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When Senator Sherry gets up to speak in this debate he will have the opportunity to tell us the answer to that question and to make an ironclad commitment that the Prime Minister's promises will be kept. I remind Senator Sherry that we will want to hear from him that the income tax cuts that were promised will remain in place and that there will be no new consumption taxes. Every word that he says will be listened to by honourable senators in this chamber and by people listening to the radio to hear whether he is prepared to make that commitment. I suggest that if he makes that commitment then his life as a Parliamentary Secretary might be somewhat attenuated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Left has floated the idea of a new wealth tax. Even the inimitable President of the ACTU, Mr Martin Ferguson, who wiped out wage increases for ordinary workers, has urged the raising of income taxes on the higher income-earning groups. Of course, it did not worry Mr Ferguson that the higher paid levels of the Public Service were provided with cash bonuses. Articles in today's edition of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> and other newspapers announce that a range of new taxes and charges to be imposed on government services has been floated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Almost every day the Leader of the Australian Democrats (Senator Kernot) stands up in this Parliament and, through her questioning, urges the Government to break its promise to cut the level of income tax. Honourable senators will recall that the Democrats used to be the party whose role, as it was often expressed in this chamber, was to `keep the bastards honest'. Surely one aspect of keeping them honest would be to ensure that they kept their promises. I would have thought that was one element of keeping people honest. If a party goes into an election campaign promising to significantly cut the level of income tax, surely the Australian Democrats would see their role as ensuring that such a promise was kept. We have seen nothing of the sort. In fact, Senator Kernot has marked her accession to the leadership of the Australian Democrats by demanding that the Government break its central election promise to cut income taxes&mdash;a funny start for the leader of any political party, particularly one that markets itself as the party that will keep the major political parties honest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Make no mistake about it, the Government will renege on its tax promises. Of course, the Government has a way out of its dilemma: to start pruning government spending. Honourable senators will recall that in Fightback the coalition identified areas where significant reductions in spending could be achieved. The Commonwealth Budget now totals almost $110 billion and is growing at a very rapid rate. Since 1989-90 Commonwealth Government spending has increased in the order of 16 per cent in real terms&mdash;a very substantial increase&mdash;while Public Service employment has increased by almost eight per cent, which is also a very sharp rise. Those two areas must be financed by either taxation or borrowings, and in most cases both. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said before, we have found out that not all people will suffer from broken promises; the higher paid public servants will get their promise of substantial cash bonuses. I suggest that all those who are in the welfare area&mdash;on a number of occasions Senator Patterson has referred to the problems that voluntary groups in the welfare area have in providing emergency relief&mdash;might recall that the cash bonuses that the Government has promised to those senior public servants who receive an income which sometimes stretches over $100,000 will cost the Budget at least $40 million. Those welfare agencies may well reflect on the priorities of Mr Keating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, Mr Keating has promised new benefits for pensioners, substantial income tax cuts for all but the very lowest income earners, wage increases for all workers, new child-care provisions for young parents and further help for welfare agencies. All these promises are now in the process of being thrown out the window. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One area of particular interest to me is the Government's promise that corporate taxes would be cut to 33 per cent. It has to be admitted that this is a significant cut. This cut is to be funded by bringing forward tax payments from companies. In 1996-97 the cost to revenue of the company tax cuts equals about $1.7 billion. Senator Sherry will confirm that the additions to revenue from bringing forward corporate tax payments will also be about $1.7 billion. The problem is that after 1996-97, the bringing forward of the corporate tax payments washes out of the system and the Government will be left, in a comparatively short period, with yet another black hole in the Budget stretching towards $2 billion. This is why I say that the irresponsibility of this Government in the last election campaign will be demonstrated in the coming months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to people who are listening that, if they received a promise from any Labor government member or Minister, now is the time for them to write to the Prime Minister and remind him of that promise. Now is the time for them to write to all Labor senators and members and remind them of the promises that they made, not only the specific promises they made to their group but also that they promised major income tax cuts and no new consumption taxes. I suggest to those who are listening that time is running short and now is the time to tell their Labor members of parliament what they think about governments that lie to the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rules of this Parliament prevent me from calling Mr Keating a liar and a cheat, yet outside this Parliament these are the very words that the Australian electors are using when they refer to the man who would say anything in order to cheat his way into high office. </PARA>

As Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, I have been directly involved with this matter. A couple of weeks ago the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) announced a package of some $55 million to address the problems of the wool industry. We do not hear the Opposition condemning us for being irresponsible with government expenditure and increasing the Budget deficit, for addressing those sorts of issues. The occurance of these issues is often beyond our power and expectation. For example, we were not to predict the collapse of the Soviet Union and the effect that that would have on the wool market.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So much of this is just wild speculation. It is pointless and, quite frankly, counterproductive. Again, I can understand why the Opposition has not got much more to do because it is still trying to work out what its position is on the republic, what its position is in terms of policies, which policies cost it the election and who should be its leader. So I can understand why the Opposition has to try to deflect a bit of flak and analysis away from its own performance. It has been pretty poor over the last decade, at least. But in relation to tax cuts&mdash;and Senator Kemp has challenged me on behalf of the Government&mdash;the income tax cuts have been legislated for. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Kernot pointed out, he voted for them; that is right. Senator Kemp voted for those tax cuts. What better commitment can a government give than to actually implement its tax cuts before the election and legislate for them? The Australian Democrats, as I am sure Senator Kernot will argue, are willing to reverse them at some stage in the future, by the sound of it. But this Government has given a commitment; it has passed the legislation, and one could not hope for any more commitment from any government. The income tax cuts are legislated for and they are in place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us turn to some of these other alleged commitments and breaking of promises. I intend to run through about eight or nine matters that Senator Kemp referred to in his speech, and that I am sure other speakers opposite will also refer to. The Government has reduced company tax down to 33c in the dollar. That was announced in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Investing in the nation</EMPHASIS> during the election campaign. That will be introduced as soon as possible. I am very confident we will see legislation on that. Actually, I am not so sure we will see legislation on that, given the slow pace of the Senate in the last couple of weeks due to the procrastination of the Opposition. If we could get over those sorts of problems we might be able to get the legislation passed a little more quickly. We have had nothing more than filibustering by the Opposition over the last three weeks. But legislation will be introduced to reduce the company tax to 33c in the dollar. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have already mentioned the package of initiatives for the wool industry. In fact, that package was announced two weeks ago and I dealt with that matter in the Senate here last Thursday evening. It was quite late in the evening, I recall, too&mdash;yet again due to the filibustering of those opposite. Therefore, a package that was announced after the election was brought through the Senate and the House of Representatives in two weeks&mdash;quick smart time. That must stand as almost a record for the time taken for a government initiative to be implemented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Office of Regional Development has been established within the portfolio of the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development (Mr Griffiths). He has also announced that a task force on regional development will be established very shortly. We have also referred to the income tax cuts. Legislation has already been passed to bring into effect from September of this year changes to the income test and the waiting period arrangements to help the unemployed and changes to ease the pension assets test. That has been passed, so that is well on the way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Work on the details of the implementation of the home child-care allowance and the new dental health care program is proceeding. I do not know what the Opposition expects. Perhaps it believed that as soon as the election was over&mdash;and of course it lost&mdash;these initiatives announced by the Government were going to be in from day one. They could not be introduced from day one. They have to be finalised in the Budget context, they have to be properly costed and there have to be ongoing discussions with the States about their implementation. They are not things that we can, with the wave of a magic wand, implement the day after the election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Work on the implementation of the provisional age pension for the long-term unemployed aged 60 and over and work on the seniors health card are also well advanced. But, again, these are not things that can be introduced from day one. The legislative amendments to introduce the working parents child-care cash rebate has been introduced in this sitting, so it is waiting to come through the Parliament. The Australian Law Reform Commission is proceeding with its review of equality before the law. Again, we have heard a great deal about that over the last couple of months. In terms of the review of labour market programs, Dr Bruce Chapman of the Australian National University has already been appointed to develop ways to improve assistance to the long-term unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was some comment about the tax treatment of pensioners, and I will quote from a letter from the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) to the Secretary of the Australian Pensioners and Superannuants Federation detailing the way in which the Government intends to deal with that issue. The Treasurer said:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just hang on, Senator Kemp. I can understand why the honourable senator is excited. He is back in opposition, anxious to prove himself and anxious to get to the front bench and dislodge a couple of his colleagues who did not perform well enough to get the Opposition into government. I can understand why he is flush with wanting to get to the front bench. I ask him to hang on and be a bit patient. The letter continues:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Labor Government has been concerned to help those Australians who rely on the pension as their sole or major source of income. Since 1983, pensions have been increased by $78 a week&mdash;a real increase of 15%.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not want Senator Kemp to forget that. That is one promise we definitely kept: real increases for pensioners exceeding 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. It is a great record compared with what those opposite did when they were in government. I will quote further:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For pensioners renting privately, the real value of payments has increased by nearly 23%.</PARA>
<PARA>So not only has our commitment to the pensioners of this country been kept, but also we have pension levels exceeding 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. The letter goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has also provided other forms of additional assistance to retired Australians. For example, Commonwealth fringe benefits will be extended to all pensioners from April 1993. I understand that the Pensioner Health Benefit Cards are being distributed at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Let me also reaffirm that the Government will:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">introduce from September 1993 a more generous pension assets test, which will help over 40,000 non-pensioner and part-pensioner retirees. For example, a single part-pensioner with assets of $150,000, excluding the family home, now receiving $81 a week pension will benefit from a pension increase of $19 a week;</PARA>
<PARA>And so it continues through the correspondence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then in a press release headed `Dawkins sees the light', Norah McGuire of the Australian Pensioners and Superannuants Federation welcomed what the Treasurer had to announce. The press release states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The AP&amp;SF has led the debate about the most effective and equitable means of achieving this and the Treasurer has acknowledged this in his letter," stated Mrs McGuire. "Indeed, it was the AP&amp;SF which first raised questions about the fairness of spending more than $1 billion on a commitment which would only benefit the top 30% of the pensioner population.</PARA>
<PARA>So the pensioner organisation and the representatives themselves have welcomed what has occurred in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to turn to one other matter: this hullabaloo over the Christmas appeals matching grants which Senator Crowley responded to in Question Time. I do not know what those opposite are doing. They really must be struggling to find issues and, frankly, the media have been falling into this trap.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am well aware that, due to the filibustering of the Opposition, we have had our speaking time cut from half an hour to 20 minutes. The Prime Minister announced the Christmas appeals matching grants in December of last year in order to assist major welfare organisations to help those in hardship in our community with the added expenses of the Christmas period. Originally, both donations and matching grants were required to be expended fully on cash and material aid by 31 January this year. The Prime Minister determined that this would be extended to 31 March this year. We did not cut it back; we extended it in recognition that the hardship experienced by people in financial crisis extends beyond the period immediately following Christmas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What was the result in terms of cost to the Government? We do not complain about it. It resulted in the estimated $8 million cost to the Government being increased to $12.5 million.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If it was a breach of the promise, then I hope these organisations cop this breach every day because it actually led to an increase of 50 per cent in the amount of money allocated to these Christmas appeals; the amount went from $8 million to $12.5 million. So the Opposition has a strange interpretation of the meaning of breach of promise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to conclude my remarks today&mdash;and my colleague Senator Cooney will be following shortly&mdash;with the apparent contradictions of the Opposition. The Opposition has said that we should not be reversing the income tax cuts, and I agree with that. The Opposition has actually denounced its own tax package which included a consumption tax, and since the election&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Kernot" NAMEID="XW4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XW4">Senator Kernot</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Do you agree with that?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZW4">Senator SHERRY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We agree with that. But since the election, the Opposition has been at it as well. It has been announcing a new range of initiatives but, of course, no costings accompany these initiatives. The new shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), is going to have to learn fast. The Opposition opposes any increases in taxes whatsoever. It is on record as doing that. It just says that the Government should cut back on expenditure. It does not detail where these cutbacks should occur, but it does detail some interesting increases in government expenditure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, the Opposition advocates tax exemptions for capital gain rollovers for small business up to a value of $5 million. It proposes limited tax rebates for bank savings. It does not say how much that is going to cost but, according to the last costings that I looked at on this issue in the superannuation promise that the Opposition made, it was some hundreds of millions of dollars. It also proposes investment allowances to allow businesses to depreciate equipment, and maintenance of the $3 billion infrastructure based rebuild Australia program announced in Fightback mark 2. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the Opposition is at it again. It is advocating big new expenditure items but, at the same time, it is saying that we should cut back on government expenditure; it does not say where. It is saying that there should be reductions in income tax, which we have legislated for. At the same time, quite critically&mdash;because this is the missing piece in the Opposition's formula&mdash;it cannot fund these proposed reductions because it has abandoned its consumption tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it is a pretty sore and sorry Opposition since the election. I actually feel sympathy for Senator Kemp and the Opposition. These allegations that the Government is breaking its promises since the election are really just part of a campaign to cover up the Opposition's own internal problems: what to do with the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and how to deal with the republican issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government will be making judgments on these matters over the next couple of months and those judgments will be revealed in the Budget. Every year at Budget time there is, as I said earlier, wild speculation which is pointless and counterproductive. We could add up the hundreds of wild assertions that the Opposition makes. At the end of the day, most of them&mdash;occasionally some of them are okay&mdash;are wildly incorrect. I reiterate: that is the sad truth of the matter as to why those opposite are in opposition today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter of public importance being discussed here this afternoon is the Government's obvious intention to abandon its election promises in order to reduce the massive Budget deficit. With the Opposition, the Australian Democrats agree that the Government has already started to renege on some of its promises, but we actually think it should on one of them&mdash;and I will get to that in a moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The commitment to take all pensioners out of the tax system by 1995 and the proposal to establish a national investment council proposal have already been abandoned by the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins). The rescheduling of the start-up date for the extension of Medicare into dentistry has been delayed and the introduction of the home child-care allowance has been indefinitely delayed. These are but a few of the promises which honourable senators have already outlined this afternoon. We do not yet know how the child-care rebate is to be adjusted, although I think there would be no doubt that the legislation covering this benefit will not be as generous as the rhetoric which accompanied its introduction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Unfortunately, this reneging on promises appears not to be applicable to the one initiative which we think should be axed, and that is the planned personal income tax cuts. They are irresponsible and unaffordable and so many people in Australia know that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These tax cuts will deliver about nothing to almost half of the population; that is the rub. People earning $20,700 or less will get nothing from those cuts. But they will provide a tax cut of almost $50 a week for people like us earning $50,000 a year or more. That is a disgrace. It is absolutely the wrong targeting. It is an extravagant and totally political measure. It was introduced by the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, perhaps to win the election, although I am not convinced that Australians are so easily bribed. I think Mr Keating thought he was going to bind a future conservative government to $8 billion worth of expenditure which it may or may not have wanted. Whatever the reason, these tax cuts should now be axed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am proud to say that when we look at the consistency stakes in this matter the only people with the real form are the Democrats.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Suddenly we have the shadow finance Minister, Mr Peter Costello, and the shadow Treasurer, Mr Alexander Downer, saying, `We will adopt this new strategy of no new taxes'.

Perhaps this puts the spotlight on the Democrats in holding the balance of power. Perhaps there is a substrategy to blame the Democrats for any new taxes which may be passed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is the Opposition not a sophisticated lot! At a time of acknowledged crisis in this country, all we get from the Opposition is a new round of game playing. I wonder whether Senator Kemp knows that the Labor Party still has an operative resolution passed at the last national conference? As I understand it, it is for no new taxes.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do. Shadow Treasurer Mr Alexander Downer was questioned on that topic on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday </EMPHASIS>program yesterday. His response was that the Government does not have a mandate to broaden the existing sales tax, nor to increase the existing rate of sales tax. However, he said that the Government was under an obligation to meet its election promises, including its legislated income tax cuts. When specifically asked whether the Opposition would support the repealing of the income tax cuts, Mr Downer rejected this option, which means that the only option the Opposition supports to control the deficit is the cutting of government spending. I think one could argue that the Australian public voted against this aspect of Opposition policy because it was a major part of the Fightback package as well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ironically, this Government has actually announced a `no new spending' policy. It is apparently looking to cut about $2 billion off expenditure this year to reduce the bottom line of the Budget from $18 billion to $16 billion. In the absence of massive economic growth&mdash;say, growth rates above five per cent&mdash;additional revenue measures will be needed to meet the deficit target of about $5 billion by 1996-97. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As is always the case, the Democrats will await the detail of any alleged changes to sales tax before we decide whether to support or oppose them. However, there is no validity whatsoever in the shadow Treasurer's contention that the income tax cuts should be honoured. As Mr Laurie Oakes pointed out yesterday, the Opposition now appears hell-bent on trying to force the Government to honour promises which the Opposition has quite rightly criticised as unaffordable and irresponsible in the past. If a measure is against the national interest, then it should not be proceeded with, irrespective of whether it was an election promise or not. Indeed, as we all know, that promise should never have been made in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we reject the approach of the Opposition on the tax cuts, and I call on the Government again to remove what in fact amounts to a ridiculous and self-imposed straitjacket on itself. Abandoning the tax cuts would make the deficit targets more easily achievable without having to impose regressive increases in indirect taxes. I do agree that the Government, after having argued so strenuously against a change in the tax mix from direct to indirect taxation in the election campaign, has achieved nothing but a mandate not to embark upon such a switch. In addition, it certainly does not have a mandate to radically slash spending. Something has to give in this equation and the something is the tax cuts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have already predicted&mdash;Senator Gareth Evans has attempted to deny it but we will wait and see&mdash;that the first round of tax cuts, with a little bit of swift footwork, could be deferred by the Government until 1 January 1996, thereby giving Mr Keating the opportunity to offer to the electorate the ultimate bribe just before the 1996 poll. However, the problem with that is that while it might meet some electoral objective it does not solve the problem of the long-term budgetary cost. Given that the tax cuts will be adding about $8 billion a year extra to the deficit by 1996-97 and the cut in the company tax rate will add an extra $1.8 billion to the deficit in 1997-98 and beyond, the goal which the Government says it is pursuing of meaningful deficit reduction is impossible to achieve without large increases in taxation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government won the election by a clever, but largely false, scare campaign against the GST. Although the GST would have been regressive, there would have been compensation by way of both personal income tax cuts and increases in pensions and benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ironically, the Government's proposals are much more regressive. There is no income tax cut for those Australians earning under $20,700. There will be no pension and benefit compensation for price increases occasioned by an increase in sales tax, although the normal mechanisms for increasing pensions and benefits will apply. Those earning under $20,700 will be adversely hit without compensation&mdash;and this from a Labor government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's obvious revenue options have already been canvassed in the public debate. These are: increasing the categories of goods which are subject to sales tax; increasing the rate of sales tax on goods which are currently being taxed; imposing a tax on some services; imposing a new tax or increasing existing taxes on energy; and increasing dividends from government business enterprises. All of these will be regressive in their impact, although their precise nature cannot be estimated until the detail is known. But we cannot say, as the Opposition does, `In ever raising the idea of a new tax, you could not possibly be addressing any other public policy goal'. For goodness sake, that is out of the question for the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other options could be included: abandoning the income tax cuts, as I said; reversing the company tax rate; increasing the income tax paid by higher income earners; repealing the imputation credit system, which will reintroduce the classical company tax model and would raise many billions of dollars; imposing some withholding tax on franked dividends; and a domestic withholding tax on interest, as floated last year, to stop people not declaring interest earned. I make no comment on these options but merely point them out for discussion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Kemp will undoubtedly jump up and say, `This is what the Democrats propose. This is what the Democrats raise for public discussion'. I have already told Senator Kemp that we wait to see the colour, the detail, of the legislation.

The Opposition is now shifting philosophy midstream and asking Australians to swallow it. Our commitment has not wavered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about reducing revenue? One area where this is a distinct possibility is savings. We have an unprecedented situation where the Government, I think, has lost control of the savings issue.

We know what they are. Some of us have been talking about them for years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know what recommendations Mr Fitzgerald will make, but it would probably be safe to guess that they will not include an increase in the taxation on savings.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The more pressing area in this whole debate is effectively dealing with high levels of unemployment.

<PARA>I commend Senator Kernot for the great bulk of her speech, particularly the point that the Government's policies are much more regressive than the coalition's policies were at the last election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What a shame we did not hear Senator Kernot during that election campaign saying, with that same vigour, that Fightback and the Opposition's policies were a lot better than the Government's, particularly because of the lack of Government compensation for all the tax increases which would have been massively overwhelmed by tax cuts. That is exactly the opposite to the sort of thing that the Government is pursuing. It is intriguing to note that after the last election, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), having made a whole range of very expensive promises said, `The people of Australia have taken us on trust and we will return that trust'. Would anyone buy a used funeral from this man, let alone a recovery?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is incredible that the Prime Minister is now saying that the Australian people have taken him on trust and, even worse, that he is now returning that trust when he has already set out on the pattern of breaking promises that is so inevitable with him. Just look at his past record of broken promises, such as `There will be no recession'&mdash;you name it. Any major economic promise of that man has been broken&mdash;`a lovely set of numbers'. The problem is that the champagne is just spilling over the top of the glass, and it is pretty flat champagne these days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was fascinating to hear Senator Sherry basically say, `They are not really broken promises'. When is a broken promise not a broken promise? Obviously, when it is delivered by Mr Paul Keating. He obviously has such a reputation for not keeping his promises that when they are broken it is no more than normal behaviour and is acknowledged as such by the Government. It is not at all excited or disturbed about the pattern of the breaches of promise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of what Senator Sherry said was so nonsensical that it does not bear repeating. But Senator Sherry fooled even himself when he said that Senator Kemp had been wrong on the matter of the abandonment of the $8 minimum wage rise for lower paid income earners.

He then suddenly corrected himself&mdash;he can check this in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>&mdash;and said, `You cannot take any notice of press headlines'. Is Senator Sherry saying that we cannot take any notice of press releases issued by the Prime Minister? I would agree with him. The press release put out on 19 February 1993 by the Prime Minister&mdash;that is, Mr Keating, the man who breaks all his major promises&mdash;said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Such increases will be restricted to a maximum of $8 available after 1 July 1993.</PARA>
<PARA>He then gave a clear indication that that was the first date and that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Subject to progress towards the employment increase there will be scope for two further adjustments of between $5 and $10 from 1 July 1994 and from 1 July 1995.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, there is a clear time constraint imposed on three payments, yet we have no commitment or undertaking&mdash;and none given by Senator Sherry&mdash;that any one of them would be met. If a member of the Government frontbench is prepared to get up here and say, `They will all be paid; we give a solemn commitment', we will regard it with the same sort of appreciation that we would regard any promise from this Government. But at least it will be interesting to see whether people are prepared to make that commitment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is fascinating&mdash;Senator Kernot touched on this&mdash;is that there will have to be either a $2 billion cut in spending in the coming Budget, which means cutting existing programs before the spending on additional promises is added, or tax rises to pay for the tax cuts. The Government has given a background story to Christine Wallace of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> that it will do this by holding down the Budget deficit to an incredibly large $16 billion&mdash;that is the same as last year&mdash;by concentrating or, as Christine Wallace says, putting an emphasis on spending cuts rather than a higher tax take. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously it would be a disgrace if this Government were to solve its problem by introducing the sorts of taxes that it attacked the Opposition for intending to introduce when the Opposition's taxes were to be compensated totally by other tax cuts. The Government is now saying in this background information that it will happen by way of cutting existing spending programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The good old question is: where is the money coming from? What will be cut? Who will be hit? Who are the people who will suffer from the Government's spending cuts? Are they the people who had promises made to them before the election? After all, we have already seen a series of broken promises within a couple of months of the election. Where will the money come from?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Christine Wallace explains in her article as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Treasury, Department of Finance and Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet are concurrently drawing up a list of other areas for review&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All ministers are part of the strategy&mdash;they've all undertaken to review their own programmes, their priorities on expenditure, to give ERC an opportunity to apply most scrutiny on their lower-ranked expenditure programmes.</PARA>
<PARA>I wonder how low down the rank in terms of integrity this Government places its election promises, because those promises are in the pot to be cut, just as existing programs on which many people may have been relying will be cut. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These spending cuts put at risk even more of the election promises made by this Government. It is starting to look more and more like the Whitlam years&mdash;big spending, big promises and massive deficits which are not being cut, and I will come to that in a moment. There was a clear promise that both the external and Budget deficits would be cut over time and there would be a trend towards getting the deficits well and truly down. Yet there is no possible move whatsoever in that direction in this present Budget unless there is to be either a massive rise in taxes to pay for tax cuts or a big $2 billion cut in services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How will the Government do it? On 21 March a journalist asked Mr Keating, `So you are not going to have to back down on election promises?' and Mr Keating replied, `No'. We have had a solemn undertaking that there will be no backing down on election promises. That was in March and five promises have already been broken. What other election promises will he break? A little while ago I heard an interjection that had something to do with arts policies. I would like someone here&mdash;someone in the Government with authority&mdash;to give an absolute and utter commitment in respect of all those promises given to the arts community, which total $75 million over four years, and to say, `Yes, we stand totally by that commitment'. The Government's integrity is at risk if it does not. Quite frankly, we know now that the Government will cut $2 billion of its expenditure, if the briefing to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> was accurate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Can we have a commitment that none of those arts policy promises or commitments will be broken? Can we have a commitment that the existing arts funding will not be cut? What we see here on one side of the chamber is a party which was prepared to tell the truth and go to the electorate and suffer the consequences of telling the truth. On the other side of the chamber we see a party which did not tell the truth; it did not go to the people of Australia saying, `We are going to cut $2 billion out of government spending'. That party was so busy telling lies about the Opposition's policy it did not have the time to tell the truth about its own, which was to cut $2 billion out of expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When an opposition makes promises that it cannot keep&mdash;because, when it eventually gets into office, it finds that the cupboard is a lot barer than it thought and a lot barer than the government of the time had realised&mdash;I guess there is some kind of excuse for that opposition to say, `Well, look, these were our policies; we cannot implement them because not only is there no money but there is a massive overdraft, a massive Bankcard bill we cannot meet'. That sort of thing, by the way, is happening in Victoria right now, and is in striking contrast to a government that goes to the people and says, `Look, the recession is over'&mdash;I quote Mr Keating&mdash;`everything is fine; we can afford to promise you all these things; just vote for us and wonderful things are going to happen. I might have brought you into this crisis but I know the way out; I can remember the road in'. I do not know what road it was; it must have been the Argentinean one. But just a couple of months after saying that he could afford all these promises and a couple of months after saying, `No, we are not going to withdraw any of our promises', this man, Mr Keating, is now saying, `Well, there is a $2 billion difference; we are going to have to find it somewhere and that means we are going to have to cut a lot of spending'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To try to justify that by saying, `Oh things have changed; things are not quite as good as they were', is absolute nonsense. Higher than previously expected expenditure, which is due largely to continuing high unemployment and revenue not rising as quickly as he thought, is Mr Dawkins's excuse for finding that his own cupboard&mdash;which he along with Mr Keating has been in charge of&mdash;is bare. That is the basic lie. That was the basic promise which has been found to be false. It was an overwhelming overall promise: a lie to the people of Australia which got the Government re-elected. </PARA>

This is a very interesting debate about promises that were made in the last election and whether or not the Government has kept them. Promises can be made with a rush of blood to the head, with too much emotion and too little thought, and with huff and with puff.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much of the evidence that has been used to bolster the debate today has been taken from the media.

In a debate such as this, it is best to base one's argument on the document containing the safest evidence. The document entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Putting jobs first: accord agreement 1993-1996</EMPHASIS>, put out by the ACTU in March 1993 and which can be obtained for the fairly reasonable price of $2, sets out what the Government has promised. </PARA>

The next speech will be from Senator Reid and&mdash;I say this advisedly&mdash;I anticipate will be a very distinguished contribution from a very distinguished senator. The speeches so far have picked out as the issues that we have to face today the promise of an $8 a week rise from 1 July 1993 and the tax cuts. People listening to this debate may gain the impression from what has been said by those opposite that the Government has promised an $8 increase on 1 July. That is not accurate. It may be worth my while going to the document to which I have referred to see exactly what has been promised. Paragraph 5.8 says:</PARA>

<PARA>Mr Acting Deputy President, with your renowned legal and economic knowledge, the following paragraph, paragraph 5.9, will make a great deal of sense. It very much throws a rider on what was said. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any arbitrated safety net adjustments shall be consistent with the central objective of this Accord objective ie to promote sustainable employment growth and substantially reduce unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA>It was not an $8 a week promise that we could pick up willy-nilly. Paragraph 5.10 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are three essential steps involved in accessing the arbitrated safety net . . . </PARA>
<PARA>And it goes on. Paragraph 5.11 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There will be no double counting. Arbitrated safety net increases will not apply to employees receiving wage increases through workplace bargaining.</PARA>

<PARA>The overriding conditions of the accord are set out in the introduction. I do not want to keep reading; I will just read the introduction, paragraph 1.1:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This three year Accord agreement has been formulated to address the key social concern facing Australia today&mdash;unemployment.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Union commitments have been an essential underpinning to the wage system and will continue to be so. The union movement will honour the undertakings outlined in this Accord agreement, including the following specific commitments:</PARA>

<PARA>So there is an understanding between the union movement and the Government that whatever has been promised will be carried out in the context of promoting sustainable employment and of adding to Australia's future prosperity. I simply point that out to show that there is a danger in getting things half right, in saying `Look, an $8 agreement was to operate after 1 July', without looking at how that $8 was to flow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly parties should be kept to the promises they make during an election campaign if they become government. But, on the other hand, those promises that they should be obliged to fulfil should be fulfilled in terms of the conditions that were set out.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to come to the tax cuts, which are also set out in this document. Senator Kernot, in a powerful speech, said that these tax cuts are not for people who earn $20,700 or less. That is true, but it is wrong to leave that statement in the air without putting it in the context of this accord agreement&mdash;to say that the tax cuts are not for the lower earners and that therefore there is a gross dereliction of duty on behalf of this Government. These tax cuts were put into an agreement with the ACTU and the union movement, which so ably represents the workers of this country. Senator Kemp is a secret admirer of the movement, in spite of what he sometimes says. Let us look at these tax cuts which are set out in paragraph 8. It is worth while reading paragraph 8.1, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is committed to further reductions in tax rates. Reflecting this, the substantial personal tax cuts announced in the Government's One Nation Statement were legislated in December 1992. These tax scales provide substantial reductions in marginal tax rates faced by the great majority of working men and women in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the point about these tax cuts: they do apply to the great majority of working men and women in Australia. Anybody who earns over $50,000 a year will receive no tax cuts at all. Out of a sense of fairness, one would have hoped that those opposite would have acknowledged that and the fact that those tax cuts, which are criticised by Senator Kernot as well as the Opposition, will apply to the vast majority of working men and women in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tax scales set out in this document show that people who earn $20,700 or less a year will receive no tax cuts. People who earn up to $5,400 a year are not taxed at all. People who earn between $5,400 and $20,700 a year are taxed at 20 per cent per week. There has been no change to those figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This document must be looked at as a whole. Although no tax deductions apply to those people who earn $20,700 a year or less, there are provisions for education and training, health care, child care, workplace reform, provisional age pensioners and situations that arise when employers become insolvent. The agreement between the union movement and the Government produces very solid and very substantial gains for the community as a whole, which will lead to the reduction of unemployment and which will enhance the international competitiveness of this country, as promised in this document. The document then talks about maintaining low inflation, but we do not have time to look at that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point is that this document stands as solid evidence of what the Government will do. It is unsafe to base an argument on comments from the press, as has been done here today. This is the document that should have been argued about; this is the document that puts the Government's position fairly and squarely. I am the only senator so far to base my case on this document. Everybody else has based his or her argument on the sometimes florid outpourings of the press&mdash;great institution that it is.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Sherry then went on to talk about wool, and the fact that the price of wool had dropped. I knew that before 13 March.

He referred to the drought. Well, I knew before 13 March that there was serious drought, as you must know, Mr Acting Deputy President, in Queensland and other places. That was presented as an economic circumstance that the Government could not have foreseen or predicted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Sherry also talked about the collapse of the Soviet Union. We found out more and more about how bad it was, but I think most of us knew that the Soviet Union had collapsed before 13 March. He really could not give any good reason for the Labor Party, having in March of this year made significant promises to this electorate, now walking away from them. If there are good reasons for its having done what it has done, we did not hear about them today from those who are here seeking to justify the Government's behaviour towards the electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I asked a question in Question Time today as to whether or not the relevant Minister would produce the document, prepared by the Department of Finance, listing 138 Labor Party promises, and telling us which of them we could or could not expect to be kept. The Minister gave a convoluted answer and indicated he did not know of the existence of the document. Then he went on to talk about the preparation of a budget, and the fact that things are reviewed in a budget context. Of course, they are reviewed in a budget context in most years, but what I am talking about is not the review of things in a budget context in 1993. I am talking about the promises that were actually made to the electorate in February and March of this year. He brushed that off as though we were asking something that was unreasonable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Sherry referred to our daring to ask questions about promises at a time when the Government is preparing the Budget. He again brushed it off and said something about our wallowing around in rumour mongering. I am talking about promises that were made to the electorate, some of which have already been abandoned. We would like to know how many more of the promises in the document Senator Cooney has just referred to will be abandoned. This is not idle speculation in the Budget context. Senator Cooney referred to the accord. I refer briefly to the statement of May this year:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ACTU executive today deferred delivery of the $8 pay rise from the latest wages accord, which was due to flow to workers from 1 July.</PARA>
<PARA>Perhaps Senator Cooney ought to check up. I am sure he gets lots of paper in his office; perhaps there are a few bits he has not yet had a chance to study.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Cooney went on to suggest that the Opposition was setting up straw men or straw women or straw people. I am not talking about straw people. I am talking about real people who have been affected already by the broken promises of the Labor Party. I am talking about pensioners, people on low incomes and families where there is one income only in the household. I am talking about different issues from the tax cuts. I do not know if I am worthy of the accolade that Senator Cooney sought to bestow on me, but I am talking about real people and the things that affect them, not just tax cuts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Sherry also seemed to think we could not expect some of these things to come into effect from day one as they have to be costed. Is he seriously suggesting to us that the Labor Party goes to an election rattling off every promises it can think of that will attract an interest group to vote for it in a few days time, and then subsequently says, `Well we can't actually do it. We have to cost it. We have to plan it. We have to talk to the States'? I think most reasonable people would think that these things would be done before a promise is made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another thing occurred to me. On Budget night we hear about increases of taxes that `will take place from tonight', but it might be six months before they are legislated for. If taxes can be implemented in that fashion&mdash;that is, from when the announcement is made&mdash;why can promises not operate from the day that they are made?  We are entitled to know the answers to some of these things as double standards definitely apply here. I am talking about real people.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Labor's commitment to removing all age pensioners from the tax-free system by 1995 will benefit pensioners paid at the part rate as well as providing some assistance to retirees with incomes beyond the pension cut out point.</PARA>
<PARA>That is one of the things we are talking about today that has been abandoned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Dawkins seems to have been trying to avoid the issue. He initially suggested that it was an old promise, nothing really new and nothing that needed to be taken into account in 1993. He is right to an extent because the promise was first made by the former Treasurer, Mr Keating, in 1989 and in four years it has not happened. It was reaffirmed by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in the policy statement at the Bankstown Town Hall during the 1993 election campaign. However, Mr Dawkins seems to have missed that bit. When asked about it, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Well, we will do what we have done, you know, all the way through. We will look at the Budget situation and we will calmly, sensibly address the situation.</PARA>
<PARA>He was talking in that vein five days after the election. When asked about the commitment, Mr Dawkins went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Look, that's something which, of course, the Government would want to review. We haven't given any definite undertakings about that and, basically, I think it was a promise which was . . .&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and he paused&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">or it was an undertaking given at a much earlier stage&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>yes, five days before&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"It is certainly not an undertaking we have renewed&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that was not true&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and I certainly don't feel under any obligation to follow through with it," he said.</PARA>
<PARA>So much for the pensioners. I am talking about the real people: the pensioners and in particular those&mdash;of whom there are a number in my electorate&mdash;who are part pension, part Commonwealth superannuants. If the Government does not understand that these pensioners are not getting adjustments due to the CPI figure, with inflation low but with costs still rising, perhaps it can abandon a promise like this. We only have to ask how they are managing at the present time and they will tell us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not just making this up from newspapers; Senator Cooney seems to think this is all we are referring to. I read from a document, printed and authorised by Simon Crean of 6 Atherton Road, Oakleigh 3166, which states:</PARA>

But our view was presented in the electorate by the Labor candidates as a massive attack on jobs in the ACT. It was said from an early stage that this project would provide 1,500 ACT jobs and that those jobs would be in jeopardy unless Labor was returned to office. At one stage one of the candidates even suggested that it was 1,700 jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Less than two weeks after the election it was 750 jobs on the York Park site. Responsibility for a number of the projects on the site had gone to firms in Sydney and Adelaide. It was said that Australian Construction Services did not have the resources to handle the project. It was suggested subsequently that in fact there would be about 300 jobs on the site. During the campaign one of the Labor candidates said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">People must be made aware that the Liberal's snow job on job creation in the ACT is just that&mdash;it is the cruel and empty rhetoric of a party that would choose to fabricate figures rather than tell people the truth.</PARA>
<PARA>I say to that person: what about a bit of truth about the York Park site and the number of jobs there? What was he doing talking about 1,500 jobs or 1,700 jobs on the York Park site?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The $187 million that will be spent to develop that site could have been a private sector investment.

But there is $187 million to go ahead with a building that need not be built right now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My attack on that development is because of the Budget deficit. I think also of the farmers of this country.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are dealing with a matter of public importance introduced by the Opposition, namely:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's obvious intention to abandon its election promises in order to reduce the massive Budget deficit.</PARA>
<PARA>I want to strongly oppose that proposition because, once again, the Opposition is wrong. The Government's medium term objective is to reduce the Budget deficit to one per cent of GDP by 1996-97. It has done it before and it will do it again. I am sorry that Senator Reid, in attacking Senator Sherry just a few moments ago, has misunderstood that he, very clearly, in leading for the Government made it clear he sees it as a difficult task. Nobody with any sense would see that it is anything other than that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Senator Reid criticises the action the Government has taken in respect of the wool industry, it is worth while reminding her that it is just part of a process that the Government has continuously been engaged in. In April, the Government announced a $44.6 million package of measures for the wool industry, as well as the establishment of an independent review, headed by Ross Garnaut, to inquire into longer term industry structures and operational arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government knows that we live in a difficult world and that world recovery&mdash;in the United States, Japan and Europe&mdash;is slow and patchy, but it will approach these difficulties in a cooperative and systematic way in the context of a three-year program. That is the key thing the Government is doing, and it will deal with the Budget as the first step in that program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will illustrate some of the things the Government is doing with industry policy which, I think, is the key to furthering development and further reducing unemployment, which is so necessary. In the Prime Minister's statement entitled `Investing in the Nation', business tax reforms were announced which will stimulate industry. Those reforms, including investment allowances, form a package of changes which will be introduced as soon as possible. Senator Sherry has already referred to the 33c in the dollar company tax rate which is, in itself, a qualitative change in the way that business has operated. This is a further significant incremental measure in this Government's process of encouraging industry. That process has been going on for 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now have the advantage of having changed society over those 10 years. Australian producers are increasingly meeting foreign competition on overseas and domestic markets. Nevertheless, in manufacturing the proportion of exports in relation to GDP has grown from about 14 per cent to 25 per cent during the last decade. In part, this is because the Government has pursued a policy of reducing cost structures for our industry through a wide-ranging reform program targeting such areas as transport, communications, labour and power. This process of micro-economic reform, which will continue the transformation of the Australia economy to one integrated with the Asia-Pacific high growth zone, necessarily involves change in the economic, sectoral and geographic structure of our domestic production system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of the election campaign and the election program, the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development, Mr Griffiths, has set up within his department an office of regional development. The office is charged with the task of assessing all Commonwealth, State and local government programs designed to assist regional development. In his first major address on the Government's strategy for regional development, Mr Griffiths told a meeting in Canberra of the Committee for the Economic Development of Australia that he was writing this week to State and Territory Ministers to begin consultations on regional development policy. This illustrates that if a government is to have real change, if it is to increase productivity and in the long term reduce the deficit, it needs the cooperation of State and local governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> We have the Opposition coming into the chamber a couple of months after the election saying, `Why has the Government not done this and why has it not done something else?'. The Government will take its time, realising that it must do things very carefully and very efficiently. That is what the Labor Party has been doing for 10 years, and that is why we are in government and the coalition is on the other side of the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All the policies I have referred to are designed to tackle unemployment, to follow through a strategy of consolidating recovery and to stimulate growth. What we have today is an hysterical matter of public importance where the Opposition is trying to feed on the inevitable leaks and the other things that occur at this time of the year when the Budget process starts to take place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That sort of thing has happened every year, but we will not be stampeded into reacting to every rumour and every inspired leak. Our election program must be bedded down carefully and efficiently. We will not succumb to any big bang theories. They are completely the province of Dr Hewson and the Opposition. By way of contrast, we should for a moment look at the Opposition&mdash;the alternative government&mdash;which obviously intends to continue abandoning its election promises, as it did with the GST most recently. However, while the GST has gone, its author remains. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition obviously intends to hang on and to linger on. Unlike Senator Baume, I want Dr Hewson to hang on and to linger on. I want him to remain as Leader of the Opposition, because while ever he is the leader we will be on this side of the chamber. Had the Opposition been successful at the last election, the Australian people would now be contemplating a crushing consumption tax, stifling the economy. The longer we persist with those ideas, the longer we will have an ineffective Opposition. The Opposition has no right to come before us and criticise the Government, as it does in raising this matter of public importance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While we prepare for the Budget session, the Opposition is unravelling. In talking about the alternative government, it is worth while noting that some members of the Liberal Party, the major opposition party&mdash;the foot soldiers who worked in the election campaign&mdash;have joined the Australian people in criticising the parliamentary Liberal Party. I will mention just a few. Firstly, in an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 20 May, it was reported:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Liberal Party president in Queensland, Mr Paul Everingham, yesterday accused the Leader of the Opposition, Dr Hewson, and senior frontbencher Mr John Howard of being "ideologues" who should be refused any opportunity to dictate policy.</PARA>
<PARA>The article went on to quote Mr Everingham as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"(Dr Hewson and Mr Howard) have got to stop focusing on policy and who in the hell is going to make it, and I'm certainly not standing aside to let them make policy anymore because they've got proven track records already. It hasn't won us any elections.</PARA>
<PARA>Another paragraph, illustrating the confidence that the Queensland president of the Liberal Party has in the parliamentary leadership, reported:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The organisation was "not really impressed" by the policy-making credentials of Dr Hewson and Mr Howard and was therefore "not prepared to give them carte blanche any longer", he said.</PARA>
<PARA>Is it any wonder that he said that? He was reacting to remarks made by the president of the Liberal Party, Professor Ashley Goldsworthy, who was pursuing his proposal&mdash;</PARA>

The next thing to happen will be the press being invited to the Liberal Party national council. Anything is possible. The Opposition cannot be trusted by the parliamentary party and cannot be trusted by the Australian people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to refer to another important issue. Senator Cooney has answered Senator Kemp's other outrageous claim which was made when he presented this material. Senator Kemp referred to sloppy journalism and showed a vulgar understanding of the industrial relations system. He referred to the amount of $8 that will eventually be paid after a process of enterprise bargaining&mdash;in other words, workplace bargaining. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That policy is occurring in industry after industry. This Government, in its attempts to reduce the Budget deficit, is streamlining Australian industry by means of the accord process to which Senator Cooney referred. It is making sure that at the end of that process there will have been a reasonable opportunity for a business and its employees&mdash;fully free between trade unions and employer organisations&mdash;to negotiate and reach a registered agreement. Those people who do not have the ability to negotiate and who might be in enterprises where they could be intimidated will have the opportunity to go to the Industrial Relations Commission and make a general application. Those who have not succeeded and who do not have the wherewithal will be able to approach the commission. That process has been delayed so that more organisations and more people can attempt cooperatively to get workplace change and adequate remuneration which will cover those people in a new situation in industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, Senator Kemp made a spurious comparison with those in senior management positions in the public sector who have been rewarded for excellence or performance. He well knows that those senior managers&mdash;SES officers&mdash;have received performance pay. Not all of them have received it; only the cream of the Public Service are able to aspire to performance pay. That in itself is part of the public sector being flexible enough and the Government acknowledging that the public sector has to compete with the top managers in the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Kemp was silent about the fact that there has been a great increase&mdash;an explosion&mdash;of executive salaries in the business sector, which unfortunately is one of the factors destabilising the wage and salary situation in Australia. Many people are unhappy with the unfair way in which big business has been increasing its share of the cake. Of course, all we have done is make sure that reasonable managers can be recompensed in the Public Service so that they are flexible and productive. </PARA>

There is, of course, a wider debate in the context of the current recession, and that is whether this sort of rise is appropriate. Nonetheless, the promise was made prior to the election by Mr Keating and Mr Ferguson. The issue of what has happened to this promise after the election has arisen. To clear the record for Senator Cooney and Senator Childs, I would like to quote from an AAP press report dated 13 May. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ACTU executive today deferred delivery of the $8 pay rise from the latest wages accord, which was due to flow to workers from July 1.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ACTU president Martin Ferguson said the executive had decided not to pursue the wage rise&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, he declined to nominate a jobs target after which the ACTU would seek the wage rise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But he said he expected the ACTU would approach the Australian Industrial Relations Commission (AIRC) about the increase before the end of the year.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, it is not going to become available to lower paid workers from 1 July as promised. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the meantime, unions would stick to the wages process set out in accord mark VII&mdash;trying to achieve wage increases through workplace agreements and approaching the AIRC for a wage rise only if all other avenues were exhausted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"I would expect that one way or another those issues will come to a head before the end of the calendar year 1993," Mr Ferguson told reporters.</PARA>
<PARA>We have heard an explanation of what has occurred, but whether it should or should not have occurred is another debate. It is a matter on which economists will differ.

The other element under standing order 191 that has been misunderstood by Senator Childs concerned the performance based pay rises to the Senior Executive Service. I was delighted that Senator Childs stood up in the chamber and acknowledged that this had occurred, because there has been a certain reticence on the part of Labor senators to address the deferral of the $8 a week pay rise for lower paid workers and the payment of very substantial cash bonuses to higher paid public servants.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 5) 1992-1993</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Appropriation Bill (No. 5) 1992-93, together with Appropriation Bill (No. 6) and the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2), which I shall introduce shortly, comprise the Additional Estimates for 1992-93.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In these Bills, Parliament is asked to appropriate moneys to meet essential and unavoidable expenditures additional to the appropriations made for 1992-93 under Appropriation Acts (Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4) and the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The additional appropriations in these three Additional Estimates Bills total $1,681.3 million;  $1,257.7 million is sought in Appropriation Bill (No. 5), $418.4 million in Appropriation Bill (No. 6) and  $5.2 million in the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These amounts are offset, in part, by savings in the Appropriations made by Appropriation Acts (Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4) 1992-93, reflecting the Government's determination to improve the efficiency of continuing programs, as well as changed funding arrangements for the Australian National University, the Australian Maritime College and the University of Canberra. These institutions have been funded from a special appropriation from 1 January 1993, as agreed by Parliament in the last session.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The savings in the appropriations, amounting to $595.4 million in gross terms, are detailed under the relevant appropriation headings in the document "Statement of Savings Expected in Annual Appropriations", which has been distributed to Honourable Members. After discounting those savings by the amount of $119.6 million attributable to the changed funding arrangements I have just mentioned, the net prospective savings identified by departments against the annual appropriations are $475.8 million.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After allowing for net prospective savings, the appropriations sought represent a net increase of $1,205.5 million in appropriations for 1992-93, an increase of 3.2 per cent on the amounts made available at the time of the 1992-93 Budget.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I turn now to the main areas for which the Government has found it necessary to seek additional provisions in the Appropriation Bill (No. 5) 1992-93 to meet payments for the ordinary annual services of the Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although the Budget figuring made allowance for prospective wage and salary increases, that amount was not then appropriated. Funds are now required to meet increases resulting from award decisions. $288.9 million is included in Appropriation Bill (No. 5) for increased running costs for all departments and agencies including Defence; an increase of 2.7 per cent on the funding for running costs included in Appropriation Act (No. 1). This amount includes the costs associated with agreed wage and salary increases, transfers between financial years and some additional funding for departments associated with various government initiatives which have been previously announced.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Gross additional estimates of $836.3 million are sought for the Defence Portfolio in Appropriation Bill (No. 5). This figure includes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">$390.3 million for Australian Defence Industries (ADI), principally associated with a $390 million purchase of equity in ADI as part of a debt for equity swap. That payment will be offset by a payment from ADI to the Commonwealth;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">$257.1 million for Defence Housing which includes provision for a $191.3 million payment to the Defence Housing Authority (DHA) as part of a debt for equity swap. The payment to the DHA will be offset by an equivalent payment from the DHA to the Commonwealth;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">$115.0 million for Running Costs principally due to the effects of the award increases and provision for redundancies included in the amount of $288.9 million I have already mentioned; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">$50.3 million for stores and equipment which largely reflects adjustments for price movements and exchange rate variations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, Appropriation Bill (No. 5) includes provision for:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">$34.0 million for the Department of Employment, Education and Training for Running Costs associated with the CES network workload formula, as well as Government initiatives in respect of the implementation of the Mayer Report and the employer incentive scheme;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">$14.6 million for emergency relief reflecting the dollar for dollar matching of funds raised by charities in their Christmas appeals;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">$30.3 million for child care fee relief which reflects growth in average fee relief and in the number of private sector places;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">$17.2 million for matching of rates for Medical Officers and nurses in Repatriation Hospitals with relevant State rates; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">$20.4 million for payments to the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation, largely reflecting the effective writeoff of Russian wheat debt and losses associated with the writeoff of the rescheduled Egypt wheat debt resulting from a factoring transaction.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The balance of $131.0 million in the amount included in Appropriation Bill (No. 5) is made up of minor variations across a range of programs across most departments and agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These additional appropriations are required to meet the 1992-93 commitments that have been made by the Government since the Budget as well as unavoidable cost and price increases and other parameter changes since the Budget was prepared.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also includes a clause for the creation of a provision for Running Costs borrowings. This provision will be limited to $20.0 million and will be used to provide flexibility for Departments and agencies to fully utilise the Running Costs Arrangements. Reports will be provided to the Parliament on the use of the provision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the Bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">SUPPLY BILL (No. 1) 1993-94</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill, together with its companion Bills, Supply Bill (No. 2) 1993-94 and Supply (Parliamentary Departments) Bill 1993-94, is a routine machinery measure. It seeks interim appropriations for the ongoing services of the Government during the period to 30 November 1993, by which date it is expected that the Appropriation Bills, which form part of the Budget for 1993-94, will have been enacted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Supply Bill (No. 1) seeks appropriations totalling some $13,347.5 million for the ordinary annual services of the government. This is $965.0 million, or about 7.8 per cent, greater than the equivalent amounts provided in the Supply Act (No. 1) 1992-93.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This increase reflects a combination of factors, including:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Price and cost increases and the impact of exchange rate variations;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the inclusion in the ordinary annual services of government, of items which appeared in Supply Bill (No. 2) in 1992-93 because they had not previously been included in annual appropriation Bills; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the full year effect of new and enhanced programs which have commenced since the introduction of the previous Supply Bill (No. 1).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">these increases include:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Defence</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">$326.7 million for the employer component of superannuation introduced into the department's running costs for the first time in 1993-94, and for salary increases;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Employment, Education and Training</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">$332.1 million associated with Labour Market Programs and Skills Formation;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Health, Housing, Local Government and Community Services</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">$59.2 million for implementation of the national child care strategy;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Prime Minister and Cabinet&mdash;ATSIC</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">$57.1 million for increased community development employment projects and the aboriginal deaths in custody funding initiatives;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Social Security</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">$64.2 million for increased running costs for administering departmental programs;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Transport and Communications</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">$65.8 million for funding for transport infrastructure;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">$32.8 million for the Australian National Railways Commission;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also includes a clause for the creation of a provision for Running Costs borrowings. This provision, which was first introduced in the Additional Estimates Appropriation Bills for 1992-93, will be limited to $20.0 million. It will be used to provide flexibility for Departments and agencies to fully utilise the Running Costs Arrangements. Reports will be provided to the Parliament on the use of the provision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I wish to emphasise that this bill seeks interim provision only for approved ongoing policies of the government. It does not anticipate decisions to be taken in the 1993-94 Budget context, for which provision will be sought in the Appropriation Bills.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to these appropriation and supply Bills, my colleagues and I will be highlighting some of the many excesses of this Government that have shown that it is completely incapable of financially managing the affairs of our country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Appropriation Bill (No. 5), together with Appropriation Bill (No. 6) and the other Bills mentioned in the motion moved by the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley), comprise the Additional Estimates for 1992-93. In these Bills, Parliament is asked to appropriate moneys to meet essential and unavoidable expenditures additional to the appropriations made for 1992-93 under the original appropriation Acts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The additional appropriations total $1.6 billion and they are sought across the range of Bills we are discussing. The Government has found it necessary to seek additional provision in Appropriation Bill (No. 5) to meet payments for the ordinary annual services of government. Funds are required to meet wage increases resulting from award decisions, increased running costs for all departments, transfers between financial years and some additional funding for the departments associated with the various government initiatives which have been announced previously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some additional estimates for the Defence portfolio; some for the Department of Employment, Education and Training; and some for a wide range of programs across most departments and agencies. Details of these have previously been given. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The object of supply is to ensure that finance is available for the ongoing services of government until the next appropriation should be made as part of the 1993 Budget. However, it appears from the Commonwealth financial accounts that the position of the Commonwealth Budget at the moment is, to say the least, alarming. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Budget last year it was estimated that the deficit&mdash;that is, the shortfall in this financial year&mdash;would be around $13.4 billion. In February of this year that was revised downwards and the current estimate is that in this financial year the Commonwealth will come in with a deficit of almost $16 billion&mdash;up more than almost $3 billion from that estimated in last year's Budget. This means that every day of this financial year, 1992-93, the Commonwealth Government will be overspending by about $43 million more than it raises in its revenue. I ask honourable senators to consider that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it does not stop there. In absolute terms, the projected Budget deficit of $15.9 billion is the highest ever in the Commonwealth account and there are now suggestions that the deficit will blow out to some $18 billion. That is almost $5 billion more than what was estimated this time last year. I think that, in a very few words, that clearly shows the incompetence of this Government and the Labor Party when it comes to dealing with money. We have seen Labor Party governments in Western Australia, South Australia, Victoria and Tasmania simply unable to handle money and, each day that goes by, the evidence shows that this Labor Party Federal Government is incapable of handling the hard-earned money of the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the current Minister for Finance, Mr Willis, became Minister for Finance back in March of 1990, he had a surplus of $8 billion. Not only has he now cut back that surplus, but he has also gone into a deficit of about $16 billion and possibly higher. So in a three-year period, this Minister has turned that surplus into a deficit of historic proportions: an overall turnaround of some $33 billion. That is a record for any finance Minister in our Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy President, you and the public know that, if a company director oversaw such a turnaround in company profits, then that company director would be sacked or otherwise would somehow find his way to Majorca. But this Minister for Finance, who presided over that enormous turnaround in the Commonwealth Budget, gets rewarded: he is reappointed as Minister for Finance, holds his position and carries on with business as normal. How can this Government possibly do that? How can it allow this sort of thing to happen? How can any decent Minister continue to remain in office without doing the right thing: accepting responsibility and resigning? As I say, in the private sector, that sort of person would end up disgraced and even worse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bear in mind that, when we talk about the financial activities of the Government, we are factoring in the terrible state of the current Commonwealth Budget and we have to take into account the fact that the Government is already committed to cutting back its revenue with legislated tax cuts in July 1994 and January 1996 which are projected to take a further $8 billion out of the revenue. On top of that, we then have the frenzied promises made by the Labor Party in its <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Investing in the nation</EMPHASIS> statement; $700 million went into those promises. Then we had the election bribes&mdash;or promises&mdash;of another $400 million, which all have to be factored into this situation we are talking about and the effects of which have not yet been seen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is starting to run away from these problems as quickly as it can, and it is talking about ways of doing away as quickly as it can with its promises and raising other revenue that it did not highlight at the time of the election. But if the Labor Party has one obligation to the Australian electorate, if we can find one thing coming through from the Labor Party at the time of the election campaign, it is that it was not going to have any new taxes. The Labor Party fought the whole campaign opposing our GST and the proposals we had very validly and sensibly put as a way of getting Australia on track again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So that is the only mandate it has. And here is the man who set his face against the broadening of the income tax system, who has a mandate not to increase taxes. I can assure you, Mr Deputy President, that he will be chased and hounded by the Liberal and National parties to make sure that he makes good on those particular commitments. We in the Liberal and National parties will not acquiesce in any of the breaking of the promises by this Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and his Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) and finance Minister. Whatever the rationale, whatever the justification, whatever the argument, whatever the changed circumstances, whatever the mirage, mirror or cloud, whatever argument is put forward, this Liberal-National Party Opposition will not acquiesce in any new taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am saddened but not surprised to find that the Australian Democrats, whose origins supposedly included keeping the government of the day honest, are now deliberately going out and calling for the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, and the Labor Party to break the promises they made at election time. I find it absolutely incredible that a group which was formed to keep the government honest is going out and encouraging it to break its promises. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What sort of a society do we expect, Senator Spindler, when you set the lead? Senator Spindler does not need to set up much of a lead because the Labor Party will pick it up. Senator Spindler and the Democrats set the lead for the Labor Party to go out and make solemn promises to the people of Australia, but then the Democrats got up and urged the Government to break those promises. We expect this from the Labor Party, but how can the rest of the country see any semblance of honesty or decency when the party which set out to keep the government honest calls upon it to break its solemn promises to the Australian nation at the last election?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find it absolutely incredible&mdash;breathtaking, I might say&mdash;to hear the new Leader of the Australian Democrats, Senator Kernot, use the arguments she used not long ago in this particular chamber. It is absolutely incredible. Her credibility is about to be shot, as was the credibility of her former leaders, Senator Janet Powell and Senator John Coulter. Their credibility has gone. It suggests that the new leader, just like the previous two leaders, will be another lap-dog for the Labor Party, doing whatever the Labor Party wants. In fact, it is doing more than aiding and abetting; it is actually encouraging it. As I say, the Labor Party does not need much encouragement to break promises; it has a 10-year history of that. But I find it absolutely breathtaking that the Democrats will encourage it and lead the way. I find beyond belief the convoluted argument that Senator Kernot used earlier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to Senator Spindler that we had a proposal for tax cuts which were properly and fully funded. We proposed to cut personal income taxes to get Australia going. The Labor Party realised that our program was right because, after all, it promoted the same program itself only a few years ago. It knew we were right, but it did not want us to win the election. So what did it do? It made up a story. It said, `It is a good idea to cut taxes. People will find that popular. The Liberal and National parties can pay for it; we have to match it. Because it is popular we will say that we will cut some taxes too, so the promises will be the same'. But the Labor Party never had any proposal to pay for those cuts. It went right through the campaign telling lies. I might say that it did so with the support of the Australian Democrats. We are now where we are because of the combination of the Democrats and the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find it rather cute to hear Senator Kernot now say, `Oh, we knew they were telling lies at the time; we knew they were wrong'. But did Senator Kernot do one thing about it? Did Senator Spindler do anything about it? They just let them go, and now we have the sort of government that will again wreak ruin and havoc upon the Australian public. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I repeat that the Opposition will not acquiesce to the energy tax being floated by the Labor Party; we will not acquiesce to the long held Labor Party belief that there should be a reintroduction of death duties; we will not acquiesce to any potential funding taxes that the Government has its departments working on night and day in an attempt to rescue itself from the dreadful situation in which it finds itself. This Government has no mandate for new taxes and the Liberal and National Party Opposition will make sure that the Government does not introduce new taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is facing a deficit of almost $16 billion. It is facing a diminution of the income tax revenue with the legislated tax cuts, and it has no mandate whatsoever from the public for broadening the indirect tax base. It is facing the problem of burgeoning costs, the problem of paying for the `Investing in the Nation' bribe, and the problem of election promises and the investments that were supposed to really take off with the Government's development allowances. It is no wonder that, facing all of these problems, the Government is looking at every way possible to raise money&mdash;through funny schemes or any sort of scheme&mdash;to try to get the books to balance a little better than they do now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The latest funny money scheme the Government is talking about is having pay TV licences for the ordinary public; it hopes to get some money from that. It reminds one of the days of Whitlam, Khemlani and Rex Connor. More and more, Mr Keating is looking like a Gough Whitlam&mdash;head in the clouds, full of hot air and surrounded by incompetent Ministers&mdash;as the economic rug is slowly pulled from beneath him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have run this terrible Budget deficit in the context of the highest unemployment rate in Australian history. There are officially one million unemployed. Madam Acting Deputy President, you know, as do Senator Sherry and I, that the figure is more like two million. There are 700,000 children growing up in families where no-one works. No redeeming benefits whatsoever can be pointed to to justify this terrible situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am appointing a new member to my staff. I had the sad task&mdash;it was one of the most difficult things I have done for a long time&mdash;of trying to respond to the 80 or 90 applications made for the job, which is fairly low paying by Public Service standards. Those kids were desperate for the job. Many of them had one or two honours degrees covering a wide range of subjects. They are very skilled kids yet they are currently employed as shop assistants at Venture, caretakers and gardeners. Most of them are unemployed. It is an absolute tragedy and it is brought about by the mismanagement of the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Beazley today said that the number of long-term unemployed will rise to half a million and that it will fall at the end of the century to `notionally acceptable levels'. I just wonder what he means by notionally acceptable levels. I am sure the long-term unemployed who fit into that category will be comforted by the fact that their number has been cut by 10 or perhaps 20 per cent! It is an absolute disgrace that this Government should accept a long-term unemployed figure of 500,000 that it can do nothing about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What distresses me also about this matter is that this Government makes such a great deal of publicity about these things that it has desensitised the Australian public into believing that unemployment will be there and always should be there. It should not be there. If Australia could get going, as it would have done had the policies that we proposed at the last election been adopted, we would not have had to accept as normal&mdash;would not have had to become desensitised to&mdash;those huge numbers of unemployed and the huge foreign debt which this Government has no inkling at all how to deal with. The Government's dishonesty in dealing with the economy is matched only by its dishonesty in its election campaigns and before. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Time does not permit me to go through these at any length but I know that many of my colleagues will highlight them during the debate. It seems fairly clear that the Government will embark upon its own GST through the expanded sales tax program. Most of the sensible newspaper columnists are now writing about that. An energy tax has been floated and even a water tax. When she was well away from the spotlights during the election campaign, Mrs Kelly said that she thought water was too cheap. Can honourable senators believe that! We can be assured there will be some tax on water shortly, and we will get back to death duties before very long, or we will have the Langmore solution of trying to rob the rich to give money to the growing army of unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We find ourselves in a disgraceful situation. The lies and deceptions which this Government uses to win elections just go on and on.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support my colleague Senator Macdonald on Appropriation Bill (No. 5) 1992-93, Supply Bill (No. 1) 1993-94, Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2), Appropriation Bill (No. 6), Supply (Parliamentary Departments) Bill 1993-94 and Supply Bill (No. 2) 1993-94. As it generally does at this time of the year when it has a Budget blow-out, the Government is seeking an additional appropriation because of supposedly unforseen circumstances. May I say, before Senator Spindler leaves the chamber, that it is peculiar that there is no Democrat listed on the speakers list on such important Bills. I do believe that the sole purpose of the Australian Democrats in this place is to let the Government carry on doing exactly what it likes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is seeking an additional allocation of $1.3 billion due to an approximate Budget blow-out of $2 billion. Whereas we had an expected Budget deficit of about $14 billion, this additional allocation will take that deficit to about $16 billion. In the last couple of days, Senator Evans has admitted that the Budget deficit will be $18 billion, which is a national record and a national disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government could have foreseen this situation in last year's Budget and could have done a lot of things to have reined in that deficit. Now, as stated of late in the press, all the Government has done is defer any assault on the deficit to try to keep some faith with the Australian population&mdash;a population which the Government fooled during the election with promises that it has either put on hold or has totally gone back upon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will list some of the broken promises of this Government. The promise of tax relief for pensioners was excluded even before the election was over. Labor's commitment of removing all age pensioners from the tax system by 1995 was to benefit pensioners paid at the part rate as well as to provide some assistance to retirees with incomes beyond the pension cut-off point. That promise, which was in the Government's 1993 policy document for older Australians, has been forgotten altogether. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Richardson put the dental health program on hold for six months the other day when he said in a radio interview on 19 May:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . From my predecessor's office there came a release some time later which did include a reference to emergency procedures starting on the first of July.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Keating had this to say on 24 February 1993 about the promise to introduce a child care allowance:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I recognise and appreciate the important role played by women who choose to stay at home.</PARA>
<PARA>I totally agree that it is an important role. He then said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We propose to introduce a new cash payment of $60 each fortnight to be called the Home Child Care Allowance.</PARA>
<PARA>After reading the fine print, I can remember immediately raising the point with the media, in an attempt to get it to run with this, that the dependent spouse rebate would go out the window. I made this point by way of interjection in the first Question Time following the policy announcement, and one Minister said that it was irrelevant and had nothing to do with the situation. However, those two decisions just happened to be implemented at the same time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I heard on the radio this morning evidence to suggest that the media has finally recognised that the spouse rebate will go out the window. The home child-care allowance simply changes that rebate into extra income for the husband. If the husband is working and the wife stays at home, the allowance would come out of his pocket and go to the wife. I suppose that is fair and rational thinking, but why did the Government not tell us that at the time?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From my knowledge&mdash;forgive me if I am an odd dollar or a few cents out&mdash;the spouse rebate for an employee with a dependent wife and two children is in the vicinity of $47 a week. In other words, according to my calculations, $47.11 is deducted from a PAYE employee's tax contributions every week. The Government has said that the rebate for the child allowance will be $30. Where has the other $17 gone? My suggestion is that that $17 would go towards the cost of extra administration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The $47, or whatever the figure turns out to be&mdash;it varies slightly for people living in remote areas, but it is between $40 and $47&mdash;is simply deducted from the husband's PAYE tax and he takes it home. No doubt he hands it over to the wife just as, in most cases, he hands over all his income, because virtually the whole pay packet is needed to keep the home going if there is a wife and two dependent children. That would be a very efficient way of doing it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No doubt the Government wants to play social engineering. It wants to take money off the husband and pay it to the wife. In the event that this measure ever comes into being, the wife would only get $30; $17 would be missing. I wonder whether someone can tell me, if and when this measure ever comes to pass, where that $17 will go. I am very annoyed that, during the election campaign, members of the press did not pick up this issue, because it was pointed out to them and they did not do anything about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another promise was the improvement of Medicare through the use of private beds. What has happened to that proposal? I will not say what the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) had to say about that proposal. Various other promises have been made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another promise involved providing $3 million in funding to survey the 300-kilometre Darwin to Alice Springs railway link. That is a good one. Mr Keating said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The next Labor Government is happy to fund the remaining surveying so the commercial viability of future proposals can be more accurately ascertained.</PARA>
<PARA>Where has that promise gone? It has been postponed or forgotten already. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will tell the Senate the coalition's position in the federal election campaign regarding the Alice Springs to Darwin railway line. The Darwin to Alice Springs railway line will only be built under a coalition government through its joining with private enterprise in utilising many of the resources that are still untapped between Darwin and Alice Springs. Private enterprise would be asked to come aboard once the railway was up and running. A coalition government would then step out and leave it to be run totally by private enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Question Time today Senator Ferguson said that it was a very necessary project in order to link the south with the north and use Darwin as an access port to Asia. Rail would then be used to freight goods to Darwin, which would lessen the impact on the roads. I will get back to roads later on. The Government has made various other promises but has done very little about them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to another aspect contained in the appropriations or statements made by this Government as we move towards the next Budget. I will refer briefly to what the Industry Commission had to say about road transport in Australia from the late 1970s until the present day. The Industry Commission referred to the application of the neo-classical economic theories of the 1980s. Unfortunately for the Australian population, this Government has been in power throughout most of the 1980s. Anyone trying to run a business and develop new projects will know that the Government has produced negligible benefits for road transport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Industry Commission said that new ideas and actions are urgently needed to put the sector on an internationally competitive basis. It was the view of the Industry Commission that the only thing that had happened in that time was the reform of user charges. That is all that has been done. There has been a reform of multiple user charges, which has increased the taxes on road transport. However, these have not been reflected into road funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Industry Commission went on to say that road investment levels in Australia have only been targeted for increases when spending has been needed to boost the economy and not as part of a general theory of economic growth. In other words, during any lead-up to an election or when the economy is bottoming out&mdash;although it is actually still in a free-fall&mdash;this Government simply makes certain announcements about what it will do with regard to road funding. This is vastly different from the approach of our Asian competitors in trade where infrastructure spending on roads is part of each country's economic structure and can be generated at all times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overall spending in Australia has decreased. It has not increased since the mid-1970s, but in real terms it has decreased since the Fraser years. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Sherry), who is at the table, is looking at me in amazement, but if he reads up on this matter he will find out. Since 1970 we have gone backwards in spending in real terms, but there has been a 180 per cent increase in car travel and a 320 per cent increase in truck travel. Yet this Government has not given roads the priority that is needed for Australia to keep up with other Western countries. Most Western countries have a continuous and ongoing commitment to roads, but Australia has not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is time that Australia did the same as these other countries. Road agencies should receive these road user charges and apportion them in a non-political way. In other words, whatever money is available should be apportioned to areas where it will improve the road system and reflect what is needed in project and resource development. The money should be apportioned into that sort of development rather than being spent on black spot programs designed to relieve unemployment. It so happens that those black spot programs were implemented in marginal seats, as in the case of Stirling which the Government ended up losing anyway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have liked to see the Government address those points. But so far it has failed to address them and I believe it will fail to address them in the Budget also. In my own State of Western Australia, for instance, a vast injection of capital is needed on the main railway line which stretches from Perth to Sydney. I know that the Government made some money available in the One Nation package for re-sleepering and upgrading, I think in Queensland, Victoria and parts of Western Australia. But we have not yet seen that money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One section between Kwinana and Koolyanobbing needs a lot of upgrading. The Western Australian Government was promised that funding quite some time ago, but as yet it has not come through. Koolyanobbing was an iron ore town which closed down in 1983, but fortunately is now up and running again. The line from Koolyanobbing out to the Port of Esperance also has to be done up. It could be made much more efficient than the Kwinana line, but no funding is available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are the sorts of things that the Government should be addressing. It should be getting projects going which will do something towards reducing the figure of one million unemployed. The Government is now starting to accept the fact that Australia will have those unemployed forever and a day&mdash;or at least for the rest of the decade. That is contrary to the Government's promise made during the election campaign that it would reduce unemployment and whatever else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe this Government got back in by fooling the population at large. Madam Acting Deputy President, I have already shown you how this Government fooled the women of Australia in the previous election campaign; I have already done that with the issue of child care, which Senator Sherry and the Cabinet have immediately put off. Government senators have the hide to come in here and say that, because of unforseen circumstances&mdash;which they have known of all along&mdash;they have had to go back on that promise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has fooled the women of Australia and it has fooled a lot of others too. It fooled people about the company tax collections which supposedly reduced company tax from 39c to 33c. I could see through that measure at the time and Senator Watson probably saw through it before I did. We got onto the press, but they would not run the story. The Government fooled the people about that issue. It will be collecting more money in taxation rather than less. The Government has failed us. It has failed us by going back on its promises and now it is casting around for what to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition did not win the last election because of the untruths which were put around by the Labor Party, the Labor Government and the unions. We were hurt by these untruths on four fronts: firstly, the GST; secondly, education; thirdly, Medicare; and fourthly, the Kennett factor. On all of those issues we are proving that our policies were right. Day by day, government Ministers are admitting our policies were correct because they are getting closer and closer to our point of view. All of our policies were right; this Government misinterpreted them and the press helped the Government. The Australian Democrats laid down for the Government.

The system has been around for two years and the Government is looking at the idea of making three levels of sales tax only that would average out at 15 per cent and not take away the taxes that we were going to take away&mdash;fuel excise and all of those excises&mdash;to help the businesses of Australia and the export industries.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;First of all, I compliment my colleague Senator Panizza on the very important matters that he has raised tonight. In my comments tonight on these Appropriation and Supply Bills, I want to deal with just one particular aspect which came out of the additional estimates the other night as a result of my questioning. It relates to the lack of coordination within the various arms of government, particularly in the Department of Trade, Austrade, which is tied to it, the Department of Primary Industries and Energy, the Australian Wool Corporation and the Australian Wool Realisation Commission. In doing that, while I will not go over all the debate that occurred, I wish to quote a number of statements which highlight very much the point that I wish to make. My question to the Minister at the time, Senator Gareth Evans, was as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You have led me to my next question, Minister. I make particular reference to the current wool crisis. What coordination is there between the Department of Trade, the Department of Primary Industries and Energy and the Wool Realisation Commission in terms of identification of potential markets and alternative uses for wool?</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Evans said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think that question is better answered in the context of the inquiry that is now proceeding about how we might best take advantage of market conditions, getting rid of the stockpile and generally moving the industry forward. I suppose someone here might be in a position to give a snapshot account of how these arrangements have worked in the past.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that answer from the responsible Minister&mdash;in this case Senator Evans&mdash;highlights very clearly just how little coordination there is, how little he knew about what was going on and how poorly this Government had addressed the current crisis in the wool industry. Senator Evans then referred the matter to the officer at the table Mr Delofski. Mr Delofski said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am not aware that we are closely involved in the issue that you have identified . . .</PARA>
<PARA>I find that quite remarkable coming from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade which has, as we know, units all around the world in various countries. Of course, the answers were very similar when I questioned Austrade officers, although they had a little more knowledge of the matter that I was questioning them on, and the answers were not very different when it came to the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason I raise this is that it is now almost three years since the severe wool crisis hit Australia. Its impact is felt throughout the economy, whether it be on the producers on the ground, the service people or on the capacity of the industry to earn export dollars. This country has operated for three years in a total void with regard to a management plan for handling the stockpile. I want to quote from what I said in a debate in this place on 18 October 1990. It was at a time when people on this side of the chamber were saying that to get on top of the problems of a collapsed reserve price and a stockpile in excess of four billion bales a major effort had to be made to get a balance between supply and demand. I am sure that Senator Sherry would remember what I said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to the already announced low value slaughter scheme to humanely slaughter old sheep at an estimated cost of up to a $2 a head, a commercial scheme to slaughter the younger sheep must be considered. I would just like to say that unfortunately, in my view, the industry has no choice but to put in place a commercial slaughter scheme. In other words, I am saying that in terms of the situation now with the oversupply of wool the industry is at D-day and it is absolutely essential that the numbers be got down to around 130 million so that we have some chance of equating production with demand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, and as unpalatable and difficult as it is, I cannot see any other way. If this action is not taken, the stockpile will become an albatross</PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise that&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">around the neck of the industry and more and more producers will be bankrupted as the tax goes up. This is not a debate about the floor price or the Corporation's existence or non-existence. Regardless of the floor price or the role of the Corporation, supply has to be reduced to demand.</PARA>
<PARA>On 15 November I said a very similar thing:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The position is totally unsustainable and it cannot go on. The stockpile has become an albatross which unless brought under control will destroy the industry in two ways:  firstly, by distortion of market prices into the future and, secondly, in that the tax required to maintain it will send producers broke.</PARA>
<PARA>We have now had almost three years of crisis and this Government has no plan to manage, properly and sustainably,  the Australian wool industry or to overcome its current problems. It is about time&mdash;to put it quite frankly&mdash;that government members got off their butts, put together a comprehensive plan, coordinated the various arms of government, did the research required and set up an environment where private enterprise would feel comfortable about coming back into the Australian wool scene, purchasing our wool as it used to be purchased and developing new markets. I could criticise the Government all night&mdash;that is very easy to do&mdash;and it deserves to be criticised, because, as I have said, it has had almost three years to address this problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason I spent a significant amount of Additional Estimates time the other night was to try to ascertain whether the various departments or arms of government, in conjunction with the Australian Wool Realisation Commission and the Australian Wool Corporation, which are also set up under statutes of parliament, were doing anything that was at all imaginative or likely to develop in the future. An announcement has been made with regard to the Garnaut report. We had the Vines report. We have had a number of reports into the wool industry and none of them has addressed the essential point&mdash;none of them has looked at how we are going to manage the wool industry through this difficult period, with supply still running where it is and the stockpile overhanging the market. As I predicted two and a half years ago, the stockpile has become an albatross around the industry's neck. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposition that I wish to put before this Parliament and the Government and will be putting before the Garnaut committee&mdash;in fact, I have even started processing the finer detail&mdash;is that a highly refined technical unit should be set up between the Department of Trade, the Department of Primary Industries and Energy, Austrade, the Australian Wool Realisation Commission, the Australian Wool Corporation and, I suggest, two professional, highly motivated marketers. This unit should have the responsibility of analysing and objectively researching various opportunistic markets, if I can put it that way, for alternative uses of wool. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have heard many people throwing around ideas such that we ought to hand the stockpile to the CWA and get it all knitted into socks. We have heard other suggestions that a large percentage of the stockpile should be used for insulation. We have heard that barter schemes should be set up between what was formerly the USSR and other countries in the world. But these things have just been put on the table. None of them has been followed through. They need to be tested to see whether they have a place in the market. We then need to find people in private enterprise, whether it be within Australia or externally, to look at the total proposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am putting before this Parliament and the Garnaut committee that we need to use the best brains in these departments and a couple of marketers and resource them properly so that they can carry out international research. I received a phone call about 10 days ago from some people from India who happened to be in Western Australia. They said that there was an opportunity in northern India, Pakistan and Bangladesh for wool to be used as insulation. They asked where they could go to find out how they could progress this idea. If we had a finely tuned, developed research unit that knew what it would cost to do these things and that could go into these areas and find out what was required and what the market potential was, it might give us a chance to do something constructive about the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One thing I know is that we cannot continue to sit back in Australia and hope that somebody will come along with a big golden egg and solve the problem for us, because it will not happen; it is as simple as that. We cannot sit back in Australia and wait for this Government to solve the problem. It has to be driven into doing it. It is absolutely crucial that we in this place drive the Government. I have heard comments that some of these ideas that have been put forward are snake oil remedies. I agree that some may be snake oil remedies, but it does not necessarily mean that they all are or that they cannot be utilised somewhere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point that always comes to mind when it comes to the utilisation of significant levels of wool from the stockpile, even to pick up the additional production that exists in Australia, is that of insulation. A small company operating in Perth is insulating houses using a different process from the batt processes. It is cheaper; better in quality; safer from the fire aspect; and protected from infestation of bugs and wogs. That process has been neatly developed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Until the Government actually gives somebody the resources, responsibility, direction and the guidelines and gets people who have a bit of will, get up and go and guts, we will just sit back and watch the wool industry wallow in the bottom of the trough, as it is doing now. I will have my critics in the wool industry because I have dared suggest we should walk through the golden gates of the Wool Corporation. But the structure of the Australian Wool Corporation is just so cumbersome and weighed down in its various aspects that it is not actually addressing the key point of finding markets. It is not finding alternative markets, researching those markets, measuring their size and potential, and then coordinating with private enterprise to bring about the development of those markets. I seek leave to table the extract from <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Focus on Wool</EMPHASIS>, volume 2, No. 3, July 1992, headed `New structure of Australia's wool industry'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not suggesting that the Government should actually be the processor or the manufacturer of the wool, but there is a role for it, when coordinated properly, in bringing about some of these things through its various arms. These arms of government could combine with a couple of dynamic people in private enterprise who are skilled in marketing&mdash;which would make a total of about seven people. It would be necessary to make sure that they had a very defined research unit and marketing promotional unit. It would be absolutely crucial that this body be resourced properly and thoroughly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Estimates have been made of the additional income tax this Government received because of the operation of the reserve price scheme while the four million or so bales were stored. After the $1.8 billion of growers' money in reserve was spent, another $2.3 billion to $2.5 billion in funds was borrowed which was used to buy our wool, put it into the stockpile and increase the price. In my estimation, the additional income tax received by the Government was in the order of $750 million. It would not seem unreasonable to me, in view of the benefits that the Government and the community received from the wool reserve price scheme through additional income tax, that such a body could be resourced. I would give it a life of three to five years, with something like $50 million, so that it could get out there and tie it up. There would be no need for this body to set up new office structures because we already have offices established around the world, through our various embassies and trade divisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have spent virtually all of my time in this appropriations debate speaking on one thing: the wool industry.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like somebody to come up with a better idea or a better way of doing this. I have not heard anything yet, but I do know that if Australians, this Government and this Senate value rural Australia&mdash;if they value the foundations upon which the wealth of this nation was built, the people who live in rural Australia and the multiplier effect of the jobs that come out of rural Australia&mdash;they will look very seriously at what I have put before them tonight. If we do not address this issue we will see the worst infrastructure collapse in this country since European settlement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wool industry today&mdash;and I must declare my interest in this area because I am a woolgrower&mdash;is in a very serious state. In fact, `serious' is not a strong enough word. Last year the wool industry, in the depths of despair, still put $3.8 billion into the Australian economy. If it is not worth having a close look&mdash;and I mean a close look&mdash;and actually taking up some of these issues and doing something about them, then it is not worth continuing to live in this country. I challenge the Government here tonight to look very seriously at what I have put before it and, after 2 1/2 to three years, not to sit around and wait any longer. The people out there cannot afford it and they deserve better treatment. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Budget deficit has increased dramatically in the last three years. The Government was re-elected on 13 March after making many promises. The Government deceived Australians at the last election. It did not tell the Australian public the true situation in our country. One side of politics told the truth, told the Australian people what was required. Unfortunately, we did not win the election. I concede that point. We have a deceitful Government led by the Prime Minister, Mr Keating. How he can lie straight in bed, I would not know. He told so many lies during the election campaign&mdash;I had better retract the word `lies', because it is unparliamentary; I will use `untruths'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has a gross foreign debt of some $203 billion. Not enough store was made of this by the Government at the time of the election. Not enough store was made of the fact that the Government has a domestic Budget deficit that is burgeoning. It is of the order of $16 billion. That is a lot of money. It is very hard for many of us to comprehend what $1 billion is, let alone $16 billion. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RD4">Senator BROWNHILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Panizza. That was very eloquently put. Senator Panizza, being from Western Australia, obviously knows a lot about what this Government has done to the gold industry. If I remember correctly, during the election campaign we had the Prime Minister promising some 500,000 new jobs. He also made something like $3.5 billion&mdash;billion again&mdash;worth of promises.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe the Government has to be held accountable. Every time we get the opportunity, we have to remind the Australian people of the promises that this Government made&mdash;the promises that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Senator Sherry, has to sit and take note of. Probably he sits not that happily with the fact that these promises have been made but cannot be put into place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was no improvement in the March 1993 current account deficit of $2.1 billion seasonally adjusted. It was the highest monthly deficit since January 1990&mdash;a dramatic blow-out. It is the second largest seasonally adjusted deficit on record. Those March current account figures show that exports fell by some 7 per cent while imports rose by 16 per cent in the last quarter; that is not only a dangerous trend but quite horrific. As Senator Crane has been saying, a lot of that is due to the wool industry, which I will allude to later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This level of imports is the highest ever recorded. Surely the Prime Minister should be coming clean with the Australian people and telling them exactly how things are instead of failing to tell them the full truth of the situation. We have got a spiralling current account deficit problem and a foreign debt which is increasing rapidly. What is this Government doing about it? It has said, `Okay. We have made some promises. We are going to break a few of those. We tell the truth always. We told the Australian people during the election campaign that we were going to do things, but already we are going to break some of those promises'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest that a couple of those broken promises might nearly have won the election for the Government; for example, the promise of the Government to match dollar for dollar donations to charities. I quote from the Prime Minister's media release of 6 December 1992:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am pleased to announce today that the Government will match dollar for dollar cash donations by the Australian public to major voluntary agencies for their Christmas appeals.</PARA>
<PARA>The Government has decided not to match the amount raised through the Christmas appeals but only the money actually spent over Christmas. I believe that that promise would have won quite a few votes. I do not want to use unparliamentary words, but the Keating Government has welshed on the deal. Another promise that the Government made was that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a new Commonwealth dental health program will be established for emergency and basic dental care for health card holders.</PARA>
<PARA>The Government welshed on that deal&mdash;it pulled the plug. It was another promise broken. What do Australians expect from this Government?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another broken promise was funding for the Darwin to Alice Springs rail link survey. Now that the election is over the Government is unable to give any time frame in upholding its commitment to provide funding for that survey. I ask the Parliamentary Secretary whether the Government is now welshing on that deal made during the election campaign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is now talking about raising taxes. During the election campaign it knew the state of the coffers. If it did not know the state of the coffers, then it should be indicted for a felony&mdash;killing the Australian economy by not knowing what it was all about. Surely the Government should have told the Australian people like it was. If it did not know the position and it is now saying, `We have to change it and we can't give some of the things we promised', then it has told an untruth and is indictable for the fact that it did not know the facts. Yet the Government has been in charge of those Treasury benches for quite some time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has got no mandate to raise taxes. It is now talking about broadening the wholesale tax range. That has increased from about $3 billion to about $10 billion under this Government which sits here and says, `The goods and services tax is no good for you. But we'll increase the wholesale tax take by some $6 billion'&mdash;another raking off from the Australian people of $6 billion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the dinner break I was talking about the broken promises of the Keating Labor Government. Until a second ago I thought I had blown senators on the Government front bench out of the water, or that they were not game to come back into this chamber because of their worry, concern and disgust that they had broken so many election promises&mdash;matching donations to charities, free dental care for pensioners and funding for the Darwin-Alice Springs rail link survey. But I notice that the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley) has come into the chamber; it is great to see someone back on the Government side after the dinner break.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian economy is in great disarray. We have a Government that is ripping taxes off us like we have never seen before. In fact, government revenue from primary industry charges has increased by 340 per cent since this Government came to power. In the same period, primary industry levies have increased by 72 per cent; the primary industry sector is being slugged all ways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A Bureau of Industry Economics study has revealed that port authority charges in Australia are twice as high as comparable overseas ports. It is interesting that, recently, when Senator Collins was asked a question about this, he said that great reforms had been made on the waterfront. But I noticed in the papers in the last couple of days that the Minister for Trade, Senator Cook, who is actually doing a great job in this portfolio&mdash;trade is one of those areas of bipartisan support where we must be all helping each other to do the right thing for Australia&mdash;said that port charges are one of the problems as far as exports are concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one looks at some of those charges, it is little wonder. In one instance port charges for coal were up to 20 times higher in Australia than the lowest overseas charge. That is quite horrendous when one thinks about it. Looking at the wheat industry, for example, the world best was Vancouver at 16c, and Australian charges ranged from $1.11 at Fremantle to $2.63 at Wallaroo in South Australia. This made Australian charges at the waterfront seven to 16 times higher than those in other parts of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Crane said earlier tonight and as Senator Panizza, on behalf of the farmers of Australia, said, how in the hell are we going to compete with the rest of world if we have charges like that imposed upon us? Why does this Government not do something about fixing up this problem in one way or another? To say that there has been an improvement, as Senator Collins says, is absolutely ridiculous. There has been improvement in Australian conditions; but, improvement compared to the rest of the world, not on your life. In fact, we are well behind the rest of world. It is time this Government woke up to it and did something about it to make sure that Australia becomes competitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another interesting statistic is the $9.4 billion collected every year in sales tax, which I mentioned before dinner. That has trebled in the last nine years. The wholesale sales tax take by this Government has trebled in the last nine to 10 years. This Government, the Government that told so many untruths during the election campaign&mdash;it is now reneging on a lot of the promises it made&mdash;about how bad the goods and services tax would be for Australia, has a secret tax which it has never told the Australian public about, the wholesale sales tax regime, which has trebled in the last 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should look at what this Government, the Keating Labor Government&mdash;because Mr Keating was the Treasurer before he stole the position of Prime Minister&mdash;has done as far as fuel taxes are concerned. Fuel tax costs the motorist $7.2 billion each year. In 1983 the petrol excise was a bit over 6c a litre. It is now 26.2c a litre. That represents tax by stealth. Again, the Government is not telling the truth to the Australian people; it is taxing them by stealth. When one thinks about the promises that this Government made during the last election campaign, who would ever trust it again? If we look at what our dollar could do for us in 1950 compared to what it does now we see that in 1950 3.7 bales of wool bought a standard Holden motor car; in April 1993 it takes 54 bales of wool to buy a standard Holden motor car. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RD4">Senator BROWNHILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right; it is absolutely horrific. If we look at today's figures, perhaps even more bales would be required. In the last 10 years the Keating Labor Government's total tax collection has more than doubled. In 1982 the Commonwealth's total tax take was $40.8 billion, in 1992-93 it is predicted that the tax take will be $90 billion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are seeing government by stealth. The Government is ripping the dough off honest taxpayers, trebling wholesale sales taxes, and more than doubling the ordinary tax collection. Yet the Government got away with it on 13 March; it got away with telling untruths to the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week we were talking in this place about the wool industry, to which matter Senator Crane has alluded again tonight. Currently, there is something like 3.9 million bales of wool in the stockpile. In real terms, wool values are lower than they have been for 50 years. Only four years ago the wool industry earned something like $6 billion in exports; now it earns only $3 billion. ABARE predicts that this year the average woolgrower will lose just under $40,000 per year. That means that in the last three years the income of woolgrowers has halved. In total, each woolgrower has lost in excess of $100,000 in three years. Farm costs rose again in the March quarter&mdash;the biggest increase in two years. In fact, over the last 10 years there has been a 342 per cent increase in farm costs. Increasing costs are driving the nail into the coffin of the rural producers of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) gave some form of relief through his drought package and wool package. While those packages represent a step in the right direction, it is too small a step taken a little too late to really do the job for the people in the wool industry and the people who have suffered from the effects of drought in the last little while. Woolgrowers need a return to prosperity if Australia is to prosper in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the present time farmers are paying something like $1 billion in taxes on farm inputs. Yet we have a Government which, since the last election, has been talking of increasing taxes rather than dropping them, as it promised in its election campaign. Only last month the Australian Industrial Relations Commission granted a 2.5 per cent pay rise to shearers, adding another burden to the budget of woolgrowers which they can ill-afford to pay at this stage. In fact, they simply cannot afford a pay increase on top of all the other problems that they have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government has to stop taxing our productive sectors, stop taxing transport and stop taxing production. Farmers simply cannot absorb any more tax increases while this rural crisis exists. Something also has to be done about the stockpile and the Government has to give incentives by way of guarantees of money so that we can get rid of some of that stockpile to some of the central European countries which need long term credit. Interest free loans have to be given to make sure that we can move some of our wool into the CIS&mdash;particularly Russia&mdash;and get rid of it. We have to be trading as a country to get ourselves out of this mess. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bottom line is that when this Government makes promises and does not come up with the goods, and reneges on the promises it has already made&mdash;in other words, tells untruths to the Australian people&mdash;it is time it took note of the fact that it is our exports that will get us out of the hole. I call on the Government to do something about that&mdash;to take the taxes off our backs and make sure that we get our exports going again. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I listened with interest to what Senator Brownhill said about some of the troubles and trials that much of Australia's rural community is going through. I can only endorse the comments that he has made, particularly regarding the wool industry. Senator Brownhill has been in this place for a considerable time; when it comes to highlighting the problems and issues in rural Australia today, nobody knows the situation</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>better than Senator Brownhill. I commend him on his speech. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to raise a couple of matters which were raised in the Senate today and which have received some media attention, but I believe not nearly enough. They are certainly far removed from the rural field. When they become common knowledge they will cause unrest, dissatisfaction and division in an area where Australia needs to be stable and united&mdash;that is, our defence forces. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have heard a lot of talk today about enterprise bargaining and performance based pay rises. Performance based pay is the method by which senior public servants can be judged as to whether they have done a good job and awarded bonus payments. A debate is being conducted at the moment about performance based pay in the Public Service and I do not particularly wish to become involved in that. However, I do wish to state that I believe performance based pay does not necessarily belong in the military or in our defence forces&mdash;precisely because it will not promote stability and unity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The idea of having senior officers at the same rank but earning different pay goes against the military ethos of `one company' and it will have a negative effect on morale. Even if this were not the case, how could performance based pay possibly be consistent across our three armed forces? How could we possibly compare a commanding officer of an operational squadron of fighter planes, who is an experienced pilot, with an army officer who is in charge of an intelligence section and an expert in Asian languages? How could we even judge within the services? How could we compare that same commanding officer of an operational squadron of fighter planes with the commanding officer of a base squadron in charge of financial and administrative matters?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But this is not the only reason why junior officers and other ranks are becoming increasingly angry about some senior officers getting pay rises. They are angry because there is no corresponding pay increase for them. The only thing that they will be getting in July is a decrease in the subsidy for renting married quarters. Their service allowance, which is paid in lieu of overtime and other benefits, has not changed since 1987. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is hardly surprising that last week newspapers across Australia carried headlines such as `Armed Forces Uproar on Pay', `Performance Wage Bid Splits the Military', `Pay Deal Splits Ranks in Forces' and `Services Rift as Officer Pay Deal Riles the Rank and File'. This uproar, as the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> termed it, is easy to understand when we look at the issue for what it really is. Senior officers are agreeing to significant pay rises for themselves while junior officers and rank and file either do not get anything at all or effectively suffer a pay cut. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For all these reasons the Army has decided that it will not go ahead with performance based pay. Why? Because the Army consulted relatively widely and discovered that giving a hefty pay rise to senior officers, at the same time as many junior officers and soldiers would effectively receive a pay cut, would be very unpopular. The service allowance for junior officers and other ranks, which is supposed to be reviewed every two years, has not been increased since 1987. This allowance compensates for the loss of civil liberties, hours of duty and for forced moves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part of the rationale for the service allowance is, therefore, to be a payment in lieu of overtime and penalty payments, call-out allowances and many other payments that people in both the public and private sector regard as their legal right, and in many cases can be worth thousands of dollars each year. Yet Defence Force personnel, many of whom regularly spend weeks and months overseas and interstate, working irregular and long hours, receive only $4,000 a year to compensate for overtime as well as their loss of civil liberties, forced moves and many other features of Defence Force life which distinguish it from all other areas of work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would suggest that the Australian taxpayer is getting a real bargain. I certainly know of defence personnel who spend a significant amount of time overseas&mdash;usually working outside normal hours. Their overtime would easily exceed the $4,000 a year allowance which, of course, means that they are not being compensated for being subject to military discipline, for being posted every three years, or for the disruption that it causes to their families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Paying defence personnel an allowance in lieu of overtime makes very good sense. If we paid flight crews overtime every time they flew early in the morning or late at night, or every time they were called out at 2 o'clock in the morning for a search and rescue mission, we would see an enormous hole in our defence budget when it comes to the salaries of defence personnel. This allowance has been stuck at $4,000 since 1987 when it only increased by one-third of the expected amount. The Australian Armed Forces Federation estimates that for the service allowance to be brought back to its pre-1987 levels it would need to at least double to $8,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But this is a mere patch on the increases that some senior officers could receive under performance based pay. The top bonus that is being talked about is in the vicinity of $12,000 to $16,000 a year&mdash;an amount that really would not be very far off the lowest wages that are currently being paid in the Defence Force. Where is the equality in senior officers receiving bonuses almost equal to what their apprentices earn in a year? Some defence personnel receive the family allowance supplement because their wages are so low. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I concede that it is very difficult to make comparisons with defence pay and conditions, but I would like to know whether any other Commonwealth employees have effectively had their overtime frozen since 1987. Would the public sector unions which represent the public servants accept that a payment in lieu of overtime had not been increased for five years? I think not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is significant to note that in the published reasons for decision, matter No. 14 of 1992, the Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the question of the review of Service Allowance has been before the Tribunal for some time and we consider that any further postponement of the review of the allowance would not be appropriate. Service Allowance is an integral part of the remuneration of ADF members . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It is no wonder that junior officers and the rank and file are angry. It is no wonder that the Army rejected the idea of performance based pay for senior officers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an argument that Defence Force personnel should receive roughly comparable pay to that of personnel in the Australian Public Service. It is obvious that members of the Australian defence forces should not receive less pay than their Public Service counterparts. But, if that is the reason why the Air Force and the Navy hierarchy have decided to grant performance based pay to their senior officers, the same hierarchy should argue strenuously for better pay and conditions for its junior officers and other ranks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It appears that only the Army consulted widely. As it is only the Army which has not implemented the scheme, I ask the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Senator Faulkner): what was the result of the Army's consultation which led it to reject the scheme? Am I right in guessing that the overwhelming majority of officers contacted rejected performance based pay? I also ask the Minister: when will junior officers and other ranks finally get the agency based productivity increases under tier three of the workplace bargaining agreement and when will their service allowance be increased?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I could not let the comments of the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel today regarding improvements in Defence Force housing go without comment. With regard to my home State of South Australia and the RAAF base at Edinburgh, I ask Senator Faulkner whether he has ever visited any of the married quarters in the Munno Para, Elizabeth and Smithfield areas. Maybe after he has been to see for himself he would not stand up here and give such a glowing report of Defence Force housing. All he would need to do is talk to the wives of Defence Force members who are living in areas where they feel unsafe, where they feel threatened, where they literally sleep with knives or some other weapon under their pillows or by their beds when their husbands are away, where they are scared to go to the local shops, where there is graffiti in the street and where local troublemakers can easily identify Defence Force families and single them out for harassment. When we heard of the glowing reports of Defence Force housing by Senator Faulkner today, I wondered whether he has ever been to see&mdash;</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EP5">Senator FERGUSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I have been to see where some of them are already. It is all very well to talk about the new ones, but we are talking about the ones already in existence. I know of these three areas in particular where what I have said is quite true. Senator Faulkner referred to a study undertaken by the Defence Force Housing Authority which showed a high level of satisfaction with Defence housing. I simply ask the Minister whether that survey asked the families, particularly the wives whose husbands are regularly away, whether they felt comfortable or safe, whether they had ever been broken into, whether there had ever been prowlers at their houses or whether they had ever been subjected to harassment on the basis that they were from Defence families.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe it would be very instructive for the new Minister for Defence Science and Personnel to talk to the service personnel and their families directly. He would then know that performance based pay is causing extreme anger and that defence housing is the bane of a defence family's life and a major contributor to wives convincing their husbands that they ought to leave the defence forces. Yet again this Government has shown that it is out of touch with the community and, in this case, the defence community in particular. If any extra money should be spent in this particular area of defence personnel, it should be on increasing the service allowance and granting a service-wide pay increase, not performance based pay for a select few. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many other matters have been raised, but for briefness I will comment on one or two other issues which I believe are very important at this stage. I am very glad that Senator Brownhill referred to the Alice Springs to Darwin railway, which is one of the most important issues confronting South Australians and people in the Northern Territory at present. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was absolutely staggered to hear the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) say, a couple of weeks prior to the election on 13 March, that the Alice Springs to Darwin rail link would be of no benefit to South Australians. He said that people would bypass South Australia, and that the most important thing was the rail link between Adelaide and Melbourne. After he had made that statement&mdash;which prompted an initial response from people in all the areas directly affected&mdash;three days before the election the Prime Minister then said that he was prepared to commit $3 million to complete the survey of the Alice Springs to Darwin rail link. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have never seen a more blatant election promise or election propaganda than that. It only emerged after members of the coalition had promised that they would complete that survey and would then give considerable consideration to the completion of that rail link. The Prime Minister offered a considerable amount of money, a financial inducement, to South Australia to get it out of the trouble it was in with regard to the dealings of the State Bank of South Australia&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He offered $600 million in order to help the South Australian economy, which has never been in a more parlous state than it is at present. Why would the Prime Minister not help South Australia to help itself by committing funds to help build the railway? This would then allow South Australian businesses to connect to the Asian market and enable them to help themselves, rather than receive a handout from the Federal Government. It is a decision that this Government has to make, but it would seem to me that it would be of far greater benefit to allow South Australians to help themselves rather than to give cash handouts to try to get them out of the trouble they are in because of their current State Labor Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also would like to touch on the area of help to rural communities, which was mentioned previously by Senator Brownhill. In the last few months we have heard a lot from the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) about the effect of his adjustment schemes and his grants to rural communities. In many cases what has been offered will really only touch the tip of the iceberg. I particularly refer to those people in rural communities who have shown enterprise and who have in the past made some outstanding achievements. I will refer to one particular case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to fulfil the objective of trying to value-add to rural commodities and of trying to expand and diversify all the commodities that we have for sale in rural areas, some 18 months ago a young farmer on the Eyre Peninsula received the Young Achiever's Award in South Australia for an enterprise into quandong farming, which he did in conjunction with the rest of his rural enterprise. It was seen fit that he should be the young achiever in South Australia because of his decision to diversify and because of his enterprise in trying to value-add in an area that has undergone some horrendous problems due to drought, low commodity prices and then, last year, incessant rain, which ruined the crops of his normal harvest of wheat and peas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I noticed in an article in the Adelaide <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS> last week that this young man's farm was being sold up because he could not get any help through the rural adjustment scheme. Despite his having previously been the young achiever of the year and in spite of the hardships that he suffered at the last harvest because of most unseasonable rains&mdash;probably the worst we have ever had at harvest time in our history&mdash;this young man's farm was being sold, bar the 400 or 500 acres that were left for his quandong production for which he had received the young achiever award. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight we are debating the appropriation and supply Bills. In the lead-up to this Government's 1992-93 Budget, Australia finds itself in its most tragic economic position ever. We have a government presiding over one million unemployed, another one million under-employed and the most severe foreign debt problem in our history&mdash;$203 billion. The Government has been warned that the International Monetary Fund could well intervene in its economic decisions. We have a government that has blown out its own Budget debt to $16 billion. It is a government which has presided over the worst lowering of living standards on record. An unprecedented number of families just cannot make ends meet and have to rely on voluntary organisations for their survival.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I visited the City Mission the other day and I was told that a whole generation of youngsters believe that going to the supermarket is just not on; these days groceries are obtained from the City Mission. The Salvation Army backs up those statements. It is to me extraordinary that we have children who so regularly go with their mothers to get their groceries at these voluntary organisations that they believe only mugs go to the supermarket. We have a government that is so cynical towards the people of Australia that it was able to dupe them into believing that all the promises made prior to the election would be kept. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government, through the Governor-General's speech to the people of Australia at the opening of this Parliament, did not even mention the rural recession. It did not mention the farmers and it did not see fit to mention the dreadful situation in which the country people find themselves and which has been spoken about so well tonight by my colleagues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come back now to these promises that have not been kept: there are six. In two months we have had six promises broken&mdash;three a month. Not bad! For instance, one of the promises that was meant to start in July has been put off; it will arrive some time in the next three years. But I will mention just a few. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First of all, there was the promise that all people receiving any pension would no longer have to pay any tax by the year 1995. Many pensioners voted for the Government in the belief that that promise would be kept. It has already been broken, with the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) saying that it certainly will not be abided by. Pensioners and health card holders were promised free emergency dental services starting from 1 July, but that promise has also been broken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were told by the Minister for Health (Senator Richardson) that 10,000 hospital bed days would be bought from the private hospitals every year to overcome waiting lists in public hospitals. Senator Richardson has assured us in this place that no, that promise will not be kept; he hopes to be able to spend the money to alleviate the queues but certainly he will not be able to spend the money on 10,000 private beds to alleviate that public hospital queue. Why was that, I wonder. It was because the Prime Minister spoke off the top of his head without referring to the private hospitals, and the private hospitals have told him that it is not on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Keating promised to match dollar for dollar all money raised by voluntary organisations in their Christmas appeals. Senator Crowley got into hot water in Question Time the other day when she said that that promise would be kept. Of course, it will not be kept. The Prime Minister changed the wording from `raised' to `spent', which makes a very big difference. In much the same way the previous Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, said that by the year 1990 no child would live in poverty. He, too, changed the words when he found there was no chance of being able to keep that promise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We note that all these promises have affected the poor and pensioners, yet during the election this Government accused us of not caring and of not looking after the poor. The Council on the Ageing has already objected strongly to these promises being broken, but it is not being listened to. The next election is a long way off&mdash;in three years time. We have not forgotten that the Government's promised tax cuts do not apply to the poor. No-one earning under $20,700 will get any tax relief; it will apply only to those earning above that amount. Those above, yes; those below, no. Mr Keating's comment was, `We have already done enough for that mob'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Do honourable senators remember the promise of a $30 a week child-care subsidy for mothers who stay home to look after their children? I am sure Senator Crowley and you, Madam Acting Deputy President, remember that promise. That promise will not be kept this financial year; it may not be kept next financial year&mdash;maybe it will be kept the year after that. We do not know. At no stage did the Prime Minister say that it would not be given until the last financial year. It was to be had from the beginning. We all know it is a great deceit because all the Prime Minister is doing is taking the dependent spouse rebate from the husband's wallet and giving it to the wife. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Less $17. What woman was told&mdash;and it was a plank of the Government's women's policy&mdash;that that promise really ripped $17 out of the family budget? No-one was told that. The final duplicity the Government has entered into is its acceptance and implementation of the coalition's industrial relations policy. The Prime Minister has now accepted workplace agreements and the eventual petering out of awards. At least the breaking of that promise will help the Australian economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the result of all this? As a result we have a million unemployed. An engineer came to my office not long ago begging for any sort of job at all. He really felt that he had deserted his family. He had teenage children and it was the most expensive time in his life. He had applied for a job washing dishes in a hotel. He did not get it because he was told that he was overqualified; as he said, anyone can wash dishes. As an engineer he was told that he was overqualified and therefore was not given the job. The thought of one million unemployed should wipe the smile off the face of the Minister at the table, Senator Crowley. </PARA>

In the majority of cases young people are made homeless because of the breakdown of their families.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further factor to be considered is the tremendous increase in the number of suicides. Research was recently undertaken by Mr Phil Rascal of the University of New South Wales who stated:</PARA>

<PARA>The increase in the number of suicides in Australia, taking the last figures, was 9.2 per cent. In my State of Tasmania the figure went up 51 per cent in one year&mdash;mainly in the country areas in the north west. That is where the rural recession is hitting hardest, yet this Government cannot even mention it. In the Governor-General's speech at the opening of Parliament, a speech that lasted an hour and a half, the rural recession was not even mentioned. In Tasmania, I repeat that the suicide rate went up 51 per cent and for every suicide about 100 are attempted. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not have to accept this sort of long-term unemployment. We have only to create the situation where business can expand and thus employ more people. But because it will not we will have headlines such as: `Locals hurt as NZ manufactures hit record'. We have Heinz, Gillette, Glaxo, Kraft, Unilever, the Australian division of Lever &amp; Kitchen, Rexona, and Consolidated Apparel Industries of Adelaide all moving to New Zealand where, they say, production costs are up to 50 per cent less.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will raise issues similar to this in a few moments upon reaching the reservations on program 8 for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs section. But, given that the report of Estimates Committee A lists a very large number of unanswered questions for this entire committee. I would like some information from the Minister as to why there have been no substantive replies to what probably must be many more than 100 or so unanswered questions for the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. As I said, I am specifically interested in the 34 questions listed against my name with regard to ATSIC. But this matter concerns much more than just the issue of ATSIC and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs section generally.</PARA></TALK.START>

It is highly unsatisfactory to have such a large number of unanswered questions. I hope that my comments have perhaps alerted some of my colleagues to the fact that the issues that they raised two weeks ago before the Senate estimates committee have not yet received adequate or satisfactory replies. As I mentioned earlier, I will certainly address my comments under specific reservations, but I think there is a very general question that needs to be answered as to why this department has not accounted to this committee for what must be between 100 and 200 unanswered questions of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. </PARA>

I appreciate that there are 30-odd questions that specifically relate to the issues I wish to pursue in the Aboriginal area, for which the Minister has just offered the feeble excuse that the Minister was out of the country. That is only one Minister and there has been an Acting Minister in the interim who ought properly have dealt with it, given the nature of the issues that are gong to be raised, and that I am certainly going to raise, tonight.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Chairman, I refer to the running sheet that you have distributed. I note that a number of items listed are similar to, but in a different order from, the reservation that I filed as part of the report of Estimates Committee A. I draw the attention of the chamber and the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Evans) to the comments in the report of the estimates committee, specifically on this program. Clause 17 of the report states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Tambling sought extensive and detailed information from ATSIC concerning a number of issues, particularly the activities of the Northern Land Council. He drew the Committee's attention to a significant qualification by the Auditor-General of the Council's Annual Report.</PARA>
<PARA>Clause 18 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Tambling asked whether any additional section 64(7) funding had been approved by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs following receipt of the qualified audit report. This matter was taken on notice by ATSIC officers. No reply has been received to date.</PARA>
<PARA>Clause 19 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Chief Executive Officer, Dr P. Shergold, informed the Committee that the Minister took the audit qualifications very seriously and had sought assurances from the Council that it has implemented procedures to avoid overspending in the future. The Minister has also approached the Auditor-General seeking advice on whether any matters in the audit report require further investigation.</PARA>
<PARA>Clause 20 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee notes that this matter may require further investigation following receipt of additional information.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Chairman, I draw clause 20 specifically to your attention and that of the Minister. This report has been available to the officers and, therefore, they ought to have known that this committee needed the information in order to conduct the process that is going on here this evening. The answers that have obviously been made available to the Minister or the Acting Minister, whoever he or she may have been, in the last fortnight are very important. I do not accept Senator Evans's statement that that is an excuse. Government always operates on the basis that, if the Minister is out of the country, there is an Acting Minister, who, in this case, could have drawn this matter to finality and presented it earlier for the consideration of the estimates committee and of the committee tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of issues were directly related to the activities and responsibility of ATSIC. I separate them from those of the Northern Land Council, and I do that very specifically. In estimates committee last September, I asked similar questions, though not as extensive, with regard to the activities of the Northern Land Council. The answers on that matter which were tabled were received in final form by the Senate estimates committee only in recent weeks. Various draft pieces were dribbled in. The Minister obviously showed that he had no capacity to direct or to offer assistance in any way whatsoever with regard to the activities of the Northern Land Council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to section 64(7) funding&mdash;and the Minister's credibility is very much at stake here&mdash;which is approved by the Minister and which is very necessary for ATSIC to receive additional funding. In the estimates committee two weeks ago, I pursued this matter very deliberately and very intentionally. The Minister signed that approval, whatever it was and for whatever amounts, and, therefore, the available information ought to have been provided within a day or so. I am not worried that the Minister can now wave it under my nose a fortnight later and expect me to respond to it here in the chamber because he has managed to drag it out of the Minister's office or somewhere else. The fact is that it was not provided to the Senate committee or the chamber in an appropriate form. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have thought the seriousness of the issues that I raised two weeks ago, with regard to the Minister providing additional amounts of money and the qualifications that the Auditor-General and the auditors of the Northern Land Council have raised with the Northern Land Council, would have sent bells ringing throughout government as to the serious nature of funding for Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory&mdash;that it is obviously being perverted or diverted in many ways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also have expected some sort of formal discussion here this evening about the availability of information from the Northern Land Council. I appreciate the delicate relationship between ATSIC as the intermediary body and the Northern Land Council. I appreciate that in those sensitive relationships ATSIC itself is not responsible for the activities of the Northern Land Council. But the Minister certainly is, and the Minister's agent, ATSIC in this area, ought to have been able within a fortnight to have conveyed the seriousness of this problem to the Northern Land Council and demanded of it all the information to the 30 or 40 questions that were asked on 10 May. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The questions were all set out very clearly. They were all available in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> the next day, 11 May. As we have seen with many other departments, the information ought to have been provided and should well have been provided here. There are many issues in that area that related to Aboriginal employment, to the royalty trust accounts, the funds that flowed to many Aboriginal people throughout the Northern Territory and the discretionary payments for administration of the Minister from the ABTA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister might remember that at the estimates committee there was considerable discussion about a so-called internal audit report into the Aboriginal Benefits Trust Account. Mr Miller at first denied that any such report existed and, in questioning at the estimates, it was subsequently ascertained that the report had been tabled and presented to ATSIC. Why have we not got an answer here as to whether that report, in all of its seriousness, was to be made available to the committee for consideration before this stage?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was also the matter of the personal debts of the Chairman of the Northern Land Council, Mr Galarrwuy Yunupingu. It had been alleged to me that he owed some $25,000 as a personal debt to the Northern Land Council. What sort of operation do we think this Government is running in allowing the Northern Land Council to operate as the private banker of its statutorily appointed chairman? I ask the question very deliberately whether any other executive members or council members of the Northern Land Council had their fingers in the till for topping up funds in any way. That personal debt very much raises the whole issue of conflict of interest of the Chairman of the Northern Land Council, his capacity to operate and whether he had received any counselling from ATSIC, the Minister or any other officer of Government on that particular matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was also the matter that I had raised with the Minister himself in January with regard to fringe benefits rorts by senior staff and management of land councils. These are important issues. It is a very serious matter if, as has been alleged in correspondence to me, the land councils were avoiding considerable responsibility on a comparable basis. The Minister acknowledged that there were some 30 or 40 outstanding questions in this area. What annoys me is that those serious matters, raised now a fortnight ago, are not back here for proper consideration, the only feeble excuse being that the Minister was out of the country. I am not surprised that Mr Tickner wants to look at the answers. He personally signed any forms that made additional funding under section 64(7). As there are serious implications arising from the qualified audit reports of his subsidiary body and as he has subsequently approved additional funding, perhaps there is some personal sensitivity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> That ought not to be seen in any way as a camouflage for the Minister's responsibility or for that of ATSIC acting as agent, and particularly for the Northern Land Council which has a very direct responsibility to thousands of Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory on behalf of whom it has to exercise a care of trust. I am bitterly disappointed. I will look to the Minister for some answers on this issue. If I do not receive adequate answers this evening, there will be no alternative but to move that consideration of the estimates of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet be postponed until such time as the answers are forthcoming. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) says that we will have to wait for the production of answers from ATSIC and the Northern Land Council, it might well mean that further consideration of the estimates of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet will equally have to wait.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have hoped that the matter could have been resolved this evening; unfortunately it seems that that will not happen.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The answer that has just been passed to me by the Minister specifically relates to section 64(7). I note, very importantly, that in the grants to the Northern Land Council in this financial year there have been these additional payments of some $4 million. I am very concerned about that with regard to any changes in the budget approvals of the Northern Land Council. I think its annual operating budget is currently in the order of $8 million. If it has had to be topped up by an additional 50 per cent in this financial year there is a very serious matter going on, and a very serious matter of approvals that need the attention of the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner), who has obviously signed each and every one of those approvals. Also, in the normal course of events, any additional expenditure would naturally have shown in the appropriate accounts presented to the Parliament for consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that these funds are channelled through the Aboriginals benefit trust account. That means that when they are made available to the land councils for additional administrative expenses, those funds are not then available for general community grants to Aboriginal people in my constituency in the Northern Territory. So it is all right for the Minister to say that there are no additional funds being allocated&mdash;there are. The process is just that they are channelled through a trust account and they are specifically being drawn against funds that would otherwise be available for the provision of very worthwhile and necessary benefits for Aboriginal people. Here, by ministerial fiat and approval, they are being syphoned off and used for purely administrative functions of a land council that is under review by the Auditor-General, and that has had a qualified audit report in the last financial year that would certainly have been before the Minister for his consideration before the dates of some of these grant approvals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to the Minister that this is a very serious matter. I would hope that he would acknowledge that the Aboriginal people of the Northern Territory are the people who are missing out on these benefits. They are the people making representations to me as their senator about the concerns of the Northern Land Council&mdash;the constituents. There is considerable controversy not only with regard to the administration of this trust account&mdash;which is the Commonwealth Government's Aboriginals benefit trust account&mdash;but also the unanswered question of the royalty trust accounts that are separately maintained by the Northern Land Council, which I believe are being syphoned off and used for additional and further administrative costs. Those issues need to be very carefully addressed. </PARA>

It is perfectly true that it is undesirable, and that we would infinitely prefer to be able to rely on current revenue from the mining royalties. But when they are down and the expenditure has to be met, this is the way that is provided for; this is the way it has been met. There is nothing irregular or unusual about this.

Twenty-five to 30 per cent of my constituents are Aboriginal people. I am sure that if this sort of activity were taking place in the portfolio interests closer to the Minister's heart, such as South Africa or Cambodia or Eritrea or Ethiopia and the matter involved these sorts of funds, he would not in any way be lambasting me.

That is not synthetic indignation, Minister; it is a matter of disgrace and shame. Every one of those five appropriations has required the approval of the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner). On each occasion he would have been aware of the very serious matters that were before the Northern Land Council, either from management reports, internal audit reports, the audit report of the Northern Land Council itself or, now, the fact that he has had to accept responsibility for the matter being deferred for consideration by the Auditor-General. The amounts are not insignificant. On each occasion they have been between half a million dollars and $1.2 million. The people who are missing out on the realisation of this matter are individual constituents not able to apply to the Aboriginals benefit trust account for other grants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other issue that I raised in the estimates committee hearing and for which I am still awaiting answers relates to the consultancies within the Northern Land Council.

In fact, many of them are very closely aligned with the Australian Labor Party as well. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I raise the question of what the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has done to ease the current crisis in the wool market. I preface my remarks by saying that I raised that matter during the Estimates Committee A hearing not only under this particular program and program 8 but also during the consideration of the estimates of the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. My continuing concern has been that there does not appear to be any coordination between the activities of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Austrade, the Department of Primary Industries and Energy, the Australian Wool Corporation and the Australian Wool Realisation Commission.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I acknowledge at the outset that, after I raised my concerns at the estimates hearings, the Minister for Trade (Senator Cook)&mdash;who is presently overseas&mdash;arranged for discussions to take place tomorrow morning between me and Austrade, and on Thursday with officers from his department. Having said that, it is worth noting that the answers I have so far received clearly confirm my concerns, and that this confirmation comes at a time when, as I have already mentioned, the wool industry is in serious crisis. The nature of that crisis has not changed during the last 2 1/2 years. Perhaps it would be more appropriate to pursue the matter I have raised when we look into the activities of Austrade and the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In an answer given during the Additional Estimates hearing, Mr Delofski said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am not aware that we are closely involved in the issue that you have identified.</PARA>
<PARA>The point I wish to make to the Minister&mdash;and I emphasise this&mdash;is that this crisis has been with us for almost three years. As I said earlier today, the types of structures that will identify the opportunities that exist for alternative uses of the product or other areas of research have not been put in place. My plea in raising the matter during the debate on the appropriation Bills and again now is for the Government to address in a constructive manner the implementation of a system or mechanism&mdash;I have called it a research coordination unit&mdash;which would coordinate the different pieces of information held by the various arms of the department and other government bodies so that the existing problems can be objectively and sensibly addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are dealing with a broad range of things when talking about this particular problem. One answer that was given to us says that, to date, Austrade has no formal relationship or communication with the Wool Realisation Commission. We can tie that back to the answer that was given to us by Mr Delofski in estimates, when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am not aware that we are closely involved in the issue that you have identified . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Yet in other answers that we have been given it is acknowledged that information is tied up in these various arms of government or deep in the bowels of the various departments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that we have a crisis situation before us. It is easy to stand here and be critical of the Government; it deserves to be criticised for the time that this has been going on. I make a plea to the Minister at the table, Senator Evans, as well as to Minister Cook, with whom I will continue this line of questioning when he returns, and to Minister Crean to address this issue in a proper and fundamental way and put some coordinating process in place so that the information, the research capability and the extension that we have into various parts of the world can be put together to identify solutions to the problem we have now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is well known&mdash;it has been highlighted in the press&mdash;that a number of people have different ideas about solving these problems. They have been described in terms ranging from `having prospects' to `snake oil theories'. I will continue my campaign on this problem until it is absolutely solved. Until such time as the Government gets serious about this matter and we start reducing that stockpile in a rational and sensible way, rather than have it remain as an albatross, not only to wool producers but to all those people involved in the industry&mdash;and the Australian economy, which is currently losing between $1 billion and $2 billion of export income a year&mdash;it deserves to be pursued relentlessly. I say to the Minister at the table that the time for talking is over and the time for action has arrived. </PARA>

I do not want to draw an obvious conclusion from that, and I want to avoid point scoring at this time of the evening, but I ask the Minister whether he could enlighten us as to the discrepancy between those two figures. Secondly, the Minister will be aware of concerns amongst the officers of his own department about how the performance pay cycles have developed.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The hard question is: how is this Parliament charged with the responsibility of ensuring that there is correct expenditure of taxpayers' money? Bear in mind that the money given to the chosen few, the first best friends who get the allocation of money, is not to be disclosed and taxpayers are not to know where their money has gone.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Kemp has asked the question about Mr Miles Kupa, well known for his involvement in the Marshall Islands affair. How are we to know on what basis he got a so-called special payment? How are we to know which officers have been rewarded for doing precisely what? That is the essence of the sort of thing that breeds corruption. If the officers of the SES in this department want their names to be clean and held high, then they ought to be the people clamouring at the gates to say, `Disclose what we got and why we got it'. Let us see what the criterion is and who made the decision. Who made the decision to say, `You can have some and you can't'? Who made the decision to say, `Your work is better than somebody else's'? Where is the objective criterion by which the taxpayer can say, `My money was wisely spent or not wisely spent'?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Out there in ordinary, struggling Australia, where people are having to tighten their belts, where is the belt tightening going on for this brigade of people who, in the words of the head of the department, say that it has been reported that this scheme is only for `gaining a salary increase'; one under the lap if you like? How do we expect to earn the respect of ordinary Australians while we have payments being made secretly to selected officers? And there is nothing on the record to say why it is so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Foreign Affairs has come under a cloud again and again with the Burkegate affair, the Marshall Islands affair, and, lastly, the Gillespie affair&mdash;different criteria, but on every occasion we see there is room to criticise the Minister. With regard to Burke, again and again honourable senators from this side rose and said, `Why, Senator Evans, will you not investigate the deplorable appointment of this man Burke'? Is it not amazing that, come his prosecution, suddenly a critical file goes missing?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we came to the Marshall Islands affair. The Minister held himself at arm's length&mdash;there was lots of paddling going on underneath. Finally the Minister had to stand down. Who were the people who were rewarded? The public want to know, the public are entitled to know because the Government has no money at all. Government can only dispense money which it first takes from the people. Therefore, in our system of governance, it is the members of the Parliament who are responsible for reporting to the people how their money is spent. If we do not ask the hard questions, then the questions will not be answered. I would put it you, Mr Chairman, that it is not only a question for members on the opposition side to ask, but it is also the responsibility of backbenchers of the Labor Party because they are no more members of the Government than I am. They are elected with the same responsibility that I am elected. That responsibility is to ensure that taxpayers' money is properly spent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here on this issue we have it admitted that piles of money are being allocated secretly to chosen officers. There is no accountability, no criterion to be answered for, and nobody to answer whether it is a secret commission or anything else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is simply not proper and it must be disclosed. I would put it to the members of the SES who have been on the handout end that it is in their best interests to have the whole system disclosed and to have it put on the public record so as to put themselves above the suspicion of the public&mdash;suspicion which the public is entitled to have at the present time. It is the most horrendous principle that has been introduced, and one that very simply must not be allowed to continue. </PARA>

Not a great deal of it was specifically directed to the matter immediately in issue, which is the performance pay operation. Let me just make a couple of things clear. For a start, there is no performance pay system in place for SES officers at all, including people like Mr Kupa who have long been in that particular band. The performance pay system that is in place at the moment is for senior officers below the SES level&mdash;that is, SOGBs and SOGCs in public service parlance&mdash;and, as such, quite a deal of Senator Bishop's fulmination about particular individuals is, not unusually, quite astray.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As to the alleged secrecy provisions, I am advised that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is acting in this respect wholly in accordance with general public service guidelines. Those guidelines, widely promulgated and agreed in the middle of last year I think, make it clear that appraisal and review records for individuals are appropriately the subject of privacy protection and that third parties would not have access under FOI to such records generated in the course of a performance appraisal process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My department has taken the view that that privacy protection extends to the final conclusion and the recommendation that is made to pay, if is actually paid. My understanding, although I am in the course of checking that, is that that is exactly the system that is applied Public Service-wide. If there is any variation from department to department in the policy that is adopted in relation to disclosure of the actual decisions made, I would be glad to hear of it from Senator Bishop, who knows everything about everything, as we are well aware from the past. If she does know everything about the way in which the system operates elsewhere, maybe she will share some of that knowledge with us. She is usually not slow to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It needs to be appreciated that the orders of magnitude for these performance pay top-ups are not spectacularly large. For example, for SOGCs a rating of three gives a person an additional $1,284 and a rating of five gives a person $2,000, and the difference is between $3,300 and $5,200 respectively for SOGBs. These are not huge percentages of the basic salary; they are there by way of inducement for effective performance. Although Senator Bishop fulminates on this subject with great passion and great indignation, I cannot imagine that she would be unaware of the extent to which there are incentive agreements of this kind in place almost universally in more senior levels of the private sector. </PARA>

The cash bonus for the so-called group 5, the outstanding group, will be in the order of $15,000 per person&mdash;certainly between $8,000 and $15,000. That applies to other departments certainly, and I would be interested to see whether it applies to the Minister's department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like Senator Evans to confirm, firstly, when the upper bands of the SES&mdash;the Mr Costellos of this world&mdash;become entitled to performance based pay and, secondly, what is the maximum amount they can receive under performance based pay. I would like the Minister to address those two questions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Senator Bishop's remarks raised a very important issue. There have been, before the estimates committee and before this chamber, examples of Ministers dumping on public servants. I do not find that a particularly edifying spectacle. I think the Minister has at times hidden behind people in the Public Service for errors which, under more traditional processes, I suspect he would have been held responsible for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have recently had before this chamber problems in relation to the Department of Transport and Communications. Senior public servants have been held by so-called independent reports to have not performed particularly well. It is of concern just how performance based pay relates to these particular people. Senator Bishop has raised a real dilemma. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can see that in the coming round of estimates committees, after the Budget session, people will look at some of the major errors which have occurred in departments and see whether performance based pay has been awarded to particular individuals which Ministers have been prepared to name and hide behind. I think the public would be shocked if a public servant who had perhaps been named by a Minister or an independent report as being involved in a department which had clearly made a major bungle received a significant amount of performance based pay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister can make somewhat curt and unpleasant comments to Senator Bishop&mdash;he is entitled to do that; he is a Minister and he has a name for doing those sorts of things&mdash;but I think there are fundamental issues of public policy involved here. I think it is a dilemma. The Senate chamber would like to see whether Senator Evans can make a contribution so that we can see a way out of this. We can then assess whether Senator Bishop's comments are correct in relation to performance based pay being given secretly to people in the Public Service who, on other occasions, have been named by Ministers who have stood behind them and blamed them for errors which we believe should have been more directly sheeted home to the Ministers. </PARA>

So there is some distance to go before these issues are resolved, even in terms of general principles, quite apart from their application to particular individuals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the general issue of principle that is involved here as to whether these payments should be regarded as appropriately subject to privacy considerations or whether there should be some overriding principle of public sector accountability applied to them, I acknowledge there is some force to the argument&mdash;if Senator Bishop would be prepared to listen, she might be interested&mdash;prima facie that accountability principles be applied here as they are indeed to other aspects of remuneration. That is a matter that could usefully be revisited by the Public Service Commission and by the Government in looking more carefully perhaps again at the weighting and balancing of the privacy consideration, which is applicable to a great many aspects of the record keeping and the determinations, the promotion procedures and so on that are applicable to particular individuals for good and obvious reasons. There is a case for looking at how one should balance out that consideration on the one hand against other accountability considerations on the other. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I acknowledge there is an argument here, and I am happy to undertake to raise that matter myself with the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and the Public Service Commission to see again how the balance of argument falls out on mature consideration. I am able to confirm that the principle to which I referred of privacy protection for individuals in this respect does apply throughout the Public Service.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the business of dropping buckets on public servants, I do not think the point should pass without mention.

And let the record speak for itself in that respect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might also say in answer to Senator Bishop and to Senator Kemp that I do not look forward to the day when individual public servants who may have made some error along the way in the course of a year's very hard work are hauled over the coals and exposed to ridicule by the likes of Senator Bishop and others in estimates committees on the basis of the particular performance pay which they may be given.

The richest 20 percent of the world population consume 80 percent of the resources. The underlying issues of consumption patterns in the developed world must be addressed in a meaningful way. In short, peoples of the North must eliminate over-consumption and unnecessary waste if the population and development crisis is to be resolved.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Extreme inequalities of wealth and opportunities in poor countries must also be addressed.</PARA>
<PARA>The subjects of population and debt took up considerable time and we were actually addressed by a representative from the World Bank. As a result, the parliamentarians at the workshop resolved as follows:We urge the World Bank, IMF and other financial institutions to ensure that structural adjustment programmes and other obligations do not damage health and education services as some have done in the past, because these are crucial to real economic and social development.</PARA>
<PARA>The issue of the rights and role of women was a major focus in the population and development debate. The majority of parliamentarians were women and for the first time at such a forum the numbers were quite indicative of the changing role of women in society and the increased participation of women in their parliaments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was resolved that progress in promoting the role of women in contemporary society is a central feature of the population and development challenge. The rights and responsibilities of women, especially in the developing world and particularly in rural areas, have been neglected and must be asserted. More attention must also be given to the rights of women to have greater economic power. Access to education for girls and women must be quickly improved, as a correlation exists between educational levels and smaller family size. Therefore, there is no better economic investment return that can be made by the international community than on education for girls, to bring them to the same level as their male counterparts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I found it very rewarding to be part of this process of reaching a consensus on some of the difficult issues contained in the population and development debate. Of course, the fundamental issue relates to the reproductive rights of women. It was agreed that exercise of the reproductive rights of women should be recognised to ensure that women themselves&mdash;not governments&mdash;can make a choice according to individual culture and religion. The group believes that abortion must be recognised as a health issue and that, accompanied by safe, affordable and accessible contraception, fewer abortions will result. Experience shows that, when combined with better education, the provision of these services results in smaller family size through freedom of choice. With sound economic investment policies, the exercise of individual rights will significantly reduce current concern over global population trends. Governments should be challenged to combine policies of smaller family size with reduced infant and maternal mortality rates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was emphasised that family planning is a joint responsibility and that all countries need to focus on the education of both men and women in order to fully accept their mutual obligations as parents, including financial responsibility for children. Family planning must be integrated into community based health services with the focus on the quality of health care provided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was reported during the four-day discussions that a survey had been conducted by the United Nations population and development fund focusing on attitudes of women in developing countries to family size. It was found that the majority of women would have preferred not to have had their last child, and certainly did not believe that they could provide adequately for a future child. But in so many cases access to contraception, even information about contraception, was not available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Special attention must also be given to the needs of adolescents, particularly with regard to family planning. Sex education programs must be made available, oriented to adolescents and their parents. Failure in this respect within this decade will have a major effect on fertility rates into the next century. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the financing of the solutions, parliamentarians believe that all OECD countries should achieve what some countries have already achieved during the 1980s&mdash;that is, the attainment of a 0.7 per cent target for official development assistance. It was also pointed out that governments should allocate four per cent of that official development assistance to population activities by the year 2000. The recent decisions by the United States in this respect are very encouraging and should be regarded by other countries as a model. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, Silvia Hernandez from Mexico, on behalf of parliamentarians, presented this declaration to the Monday session of the conference. The following are the highlights of parliamentary commitments. First of all, parliamentarians believe that it is vitally important that they get involved in the establishment of national committees on population and development, where those committees do not yet exist, in preparation for the major Cairo conference. Of course, the Cairo conference on population will be as significant for our future as the Rio conference was last year. In Australia, while there is an interdepartmental committee that has just started work in preparation for the national report and for the Cairo conference next year, there is not yet a national committee. I hope that that position will be rectified in the near future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other highlights were that the provision of national reports by member countries should be reviewed by the parliament before they are submitted; the initiation of parliamentary mechanisms on population and development to ensure that national activity after the Cairo conference is maintained at the same level of political will so that recommendations from Cairo are actually implemented; the observation of World Population Day on 11 July through a variety of activities to focus the attention of governments and communities on the importance of population and development issues; parliamentarian involvement in the Cairo conference; and delegations as appropriate to Ministers of governments and institutions to involve a range of organisations, including churches, in this vital debate on our future. </PARA>
