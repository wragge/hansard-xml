<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Federal Parliament assembled:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showed that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since May 1992, the Government of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam (GOSRV) started a new campaign trying to stamp out the voice of the United Vietnamese Buddhist Congregation (UVBC), which is led by the Most Venerable Thich Huyen Quang, an Amnesty International's prisoner of conscience since his third arrest by the GOSRV in 1982.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The GOSRV has ignored the UVBC's moderate demands: the restoration of its structure and activities in the country, as clearly stated in the letter signed by Thich Huyen Quang on 25/6/1992 to the Hanoi authorities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Instead of listening and considering the UVBC's genuine and sound desires, the GOSRV is continuing on their criminal path of repression and persecution: torturing till death Venerable Thich Thien An in late September 1992 in Chi Hoa prison, arresting Venerables Thich Khong Tanh and Thich Tri Luc in 2/10/92, and carrying out other oppressive measures, such as threats, distortion, slander, preventing communication, searching of religious places and private homes, etc of Buddhist monks, nuns and lay people who support the UVBC.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1981, the GORSV intervened by creating the Vietnam Buddhist Church (VBC), a puppet body, with the intent of dispossessing the Buddhist clergy and lay communities. Many clergy have been forced to join VBC, and threatened due to their support to the UVBC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Your petitioners therefore pray that the Senate make stronger representation to the GOSRV by:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">1. Urging that, in order to enjoy good relations with Australia and to receive equitably Australian tax payers' aid, the GOSRV must response, promptly, two Motions passed by the Australian Senate in 24/6/1992 and by the House of Representatives in 20/8/1992 condemning the repressive actions of the GOSRV.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">2. Asking the Prime Minister of Australia send his Diplomatic Note to the Prime Minister of the GOSRV, Mr Vo Van Kiet expressing the strongest disapproval of the religious intolerance and intervention and oppression of religious organisations, especially the UVBC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">3. Requesting that the GOSRV restore and recognise the independence of the UVBC's structure and activities; to release, from prison or home custody, the UVBC's clergy, ie. Venerables Huyen Quang, Quang Do, Duc Nhuan, Tue Sy, Tri Sieu, Nguyen Giac, Phuc Vien, Thien Tan, etc, including newly arrested monks Khong Tanh and Tri Luc (in 2/10/92).</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 1993</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill introduces changes to Part 7 of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 to modify some aspects of the procedures for allocating Satellite Subscription Television Broadcasting Licences A and B.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Let me make clear at the outset that this amendment does not apply to those tenderers who were announced as the highest bidders on 30 April 1993. Those companies' applications are now at the second stage of the established process which will continue to finality. This legislation does not reflect a judgement that either of the current highest bidders is unable to meet its bid, and to ensure that appropriate procedures are in place should such a contingency arise.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The process to allocate these licences, which was determined under Section 93 of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992, has 3 stages.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first stage that has just been completed, involves an impartial assessment of complying tenders to identify which delivered the highest bid price.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second stage involves assessment of the tenderers so identified by the Australian Broadcasting Authority who will need to form a view about the suitability of the applicants under Section 98 of the Act. The ABA will also seek the opinion of the Trade Practices Commission in relation to Part IV of the Trade Practices Act as required under section 93 of the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The third stage involves actual issuance of the licence but only after the ABA and TPC processes have been satisfied, and the full bid price paid.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the legislation, Trade Practices Commission consideration could take up to 45 days. Following that, licensees have 30 days within which to pay the bid price.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The interest of the public is that the issuance of pay television licences and the effective commencement of broadcasting services should occur as soon as possible. This has always been the Government's intention.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Until licences A and B are issued, it is not possible for the standard for a digital transmission system to be declared, nor for a third licence to be issued to the ABC.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislation before the Senate therefore provides that, in the event that either of the present highest tenderers were not successful, any alternative tenderer who thereby had the opportunity to be assessed as a potential licensee would be required to provide a 5% deposit within 3 days of being given that opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That deposit would not be refundable if the licence was not subsequently allocated, unless non-allocation was due to an unfavourable report by the Trade Practices Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This amendment will put an additional step in the process after the initial identification of highest bidders&mdash;its purpose is to provide an additional indication that those tenderers have the financial capacity to pay the price bid hence justifying continuation of the process through its detailed assessment stages.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Financial Impact</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill is not expected to have a significant impact on Commonwealth expenditure or revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the Bill to the Senate and present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">ROAD TRANSPORT CHARGES (AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY) BILL 1993</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of the Road Transport Charges (Australian Capital Territory) Bill 1993 is to give effect to the National Road Transport Commission's (NRTC) first determination regarding annual registration charges for vehicles rated above 4.5 tonnes and permit charges for vehicles operating above 125 tonnes. The Bill is vital to the Government's national micro-economic reform agenda for land transport.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For too long the efficiency of Australia's interstate road transport operations has been impeded by a lack of uniformity in regulations and charging. Currently heavy vehicle operating conditions and registration charges vary considerably between nine different jurisdictions and bear little relation to the costs imposed on the road system by various types of vehicles.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The NRTC, which is an independent statutory authority, was established as a result of the Heads of Government Agreement of July 1991 and set up under Commonwealth legislation passed in December 1991. Its purpose is to investigate and make recommendations regarding the establishment of a national registration scheme and uniform road use charges for heavy vehicles, and nationally consistent operating regulations for all vehicles.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Intergovernmental Agreement, which forms a schedule to The National Road Transport Commission Act 1991, requires the NRTC to recommend charges for heavy vehicles which: achieve full cost recovery; achieve a reasonable balance between administrative simplicity, efficiency and equity; improve the link between pricing and investment decisions; and minimise the incentive for road transport operators to shop around for lower charges.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Ministerial Council approved the NRTC charging determination on behalf of State and Territory Governments. It is envisaged that each of the States and the Northern Territory will pass legislation in their respective Parliaments which will adopt the legislation passed in respect of the Australian Capital Territory and any Regulations made under it. This will ensure that there is uniform charging for heavy vehicles throughout Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In accordance with the Intergovernmental Agreement, this Bill will require the Government of the Australian Capital Territory, from 1 July 1995 onwards, to fix annual registration charges for vehicles rated above 4.5 tonnes and to fix charges for the granting of permits to operate vehicles with a gross mass exceeding 125 tonnes. Those charges will be fixed in accordance with the schedule to the Bill. The Bill will not affect the existing registration scheme in the Australian Capital Territory other than to fix the charges to be collected when a heavy vehicle is registered. Responsibility for determining registration exemptions or concessional charges will continue to be a matter for the Australian Capital Territory. Revenue from the registration charges will be retained by the Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The charges provided for in the schedule to the Bill may be increased or decreased by regulations under the proposed Act. The amount of increase or decrease is limited to a maximum of 5% per annum. Heads of Government have agreed that the matter of concessional registration charges for particular groups is for each State and Territory to address according to their own priorities, with the cost to revenue being met from their own budgets. In accordance with this decision, the NRTC charging determination does not make recommendations on the level and structure of concessions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the process of implementing national charges, the States and Territories will be reviewing the structure of registration concessions in their individual jurisdictions, including those which apply to the rural sector. The charges provided for in this Bill do not include, and the schedule does not preclude, the fixing of fees for administration and other services provided by the Australian Capital Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In this context, it would be contrary to the spirit of the Intergovernmental Agreement for Governments to impose administration or inspection fees that varied greatly across jurisdictions, as road transport operators would see these as part of the total cost of registering a vehicle. This would encourage operators to shop around between the States and Territories. A working group of officials is currently examining the issue of acceptable and uniform levels of administrative charges and inspection fees and is expected to complete its report in the next couple of months.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As in the Australian Capital Territory, revenues from national registration charges received by the States and Northern Territory will be retained by them and will be available for use on roads. The use of those funds, including distribution to local councils, and the determination of road funding needs, will be decided by each jurisdiction.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The passage of this Bill is testimony to the continuing commitment of the Federal Government to implementing the reforms in the road transport industry which have been needed for so long, and which were agreed to by Heads of Government. I expect that Heads of Government will honour their commitment made in the Intergovernmental Agreement and all administrations will implement the reforms by July 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Road transport is an essential part of our land transport system, and approximately 70 per cent of freight which is moved in Australia travels by road at some stage. Australia cannot afford to squander opportunities to bring about workable and acceptable reforms in the road transport industry, and assist in enhancing Australia's international competitiveness. There will be no significant costs, revenues or savings to the Commonwealth arising from the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill and commend the Bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">AUSTRALIAN WOOL REALISATION COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL 1993</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendments to the Australian Wool Realisation Commission Act 1991 will provide for a one year extension to the repayment period for the wool industry debt. That debt currently stands at $2.26 billion and is backed by a Government guarantee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's recently announced package of measures, of which this amendment forms part, is in response to the deteriorating conditions in the wool industry. We have experienced reduced demand for our wool due to the continuing global recession affecting our key markets in Western Europe and Japan and the virtual withdrawal of Russia from the market. In combination with this we are faced with continuing over-production, a 3.9 million bale stockpile and wool prices which are at their lowest level in real terms in over 40 years. The key elements of the recent package provide immediate relief from the short term circumstances facing the industry and set in train a process to address the more fundamental issues in the longer term.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, as you will be aware, the Australian Wool Realisation Commission is charged with the responsibility of managing the stockpile and discharging the industry's debt which was accumulated under the former wool Reserve Price Scheme. It is to undertake this in a manner that is in the best interests of the nation and woolgrowers in particular. The legislation currently requires the Commission to acquit the debt within 7 years or less. The Commission ceases to exist upon the sale or transfer of all assets and repayment of the debt.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This amendment will now give the Commission 8 years, from 1 July 1991, in which to repay the debt and the Government guarantee will also be extended by one year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In current circumstances it was apparent that the Commission could not retire the debt within the requirements of its current schedule, without an adverse impact on an already deteriorating wool market. The Commission was not in a position to sell significant quantities of its stocks without further depressing the market. At the same time the Government agreed that woolgrowers could not afford increased tax payments to maintain the debt repayment schedule.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In providing an additional year in which to repay the debt, the Government is providing the Commission with the opportunity to be able to meet its objectives, minimising the effect on woolgrowers' incomes, but ensuring that the responsibility for the debt remains with woolgrowers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result of these changes and changes which the Government will shortly be making to the Australian Wool Realisation Commission (Performance of Functions) Guidelines, the Commission will not need to sell wool in 1993/94 to meet its obligations. Under the changed Guidelines the Commission will not be required to repay debt in 1993/94 beyond the $118 million funds already in hand for this purpose. This should entirely remove any speculative element that might exist in the market that the Commission will be required to make forced sales.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the amendment that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy is proposing together with the other elements of the wool industry package recently announced are vital to assist the industry overcome the difficulties currently facing it.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This motion by Senator Faulkner seeks to restrict the speaking time of senators on a second reading debate from 30 minutes to 20 minutes. Some people on the other side of the chamber may find that a good idea. That may be a reflection on how much respect they have for the Senate chamber, but this is an important place and the matters discussed here are important. Senator Patterson moved the amendment to the motion to ensure that if Bills are taken cognately, the 20-minute speaking limit should not apply.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is an eminently sensible proposal. Even the people on the other side would have to recognise that when Bills are taken cognately there are many matters that have to be dealt with by members of the Opposition front bench, who of course have to speak in some cases on behalf of a shadow Minister in the other place and sometimes in their own capacity. It is entirely appropriate that in those circumstances honourable senators be given a full and adequate opportunity to address those issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A perfect example of the necessity of having a 30-minute speaking time, at least in so far as a cognate debate is concerned, occurred immediately after this motion was last dealt with by the Senate. We moved to the adjournment debate and Senator Bell raised two matters, both in relation to the State of Tasmania. It took Senator Bell&mdash;and I know he was trying to get through it as quickly as possible&mdash;almost 30 minutes to deal with the two matters. That is not a criticism of Senator Bell; it merely points out the absurdity of saying that we can deal in the space of 20 minutes with two or more Bills which are being taken together. We cannot do it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How is this Senate to give adequate consideration to three or four tax Bills which Senator Watson has an obligation to address in detail? How could he deal in a second reading debate with three or four very complex tax Bills if he were given but 20 minutes to discuss them all together?

Senator Watson has the capacity and the diligence to work through the Bills clause by clause.

When we have a government that does not think through the consequences of legislation, who is it whose task it is to protect the taxpayer? Who is it whose task it is to protect the community at large? It is the task of the Opposition.

Although he does not speak frequently in this place, he makes speeches of enlightenment which really go to the nub of the issues before the Senate. If the speaking time available to Senator Harradine&mdash;who has only one opportunity to express his point of view, who is not part of a team as we are in the Opposition, and who cannot allocate different points to different people if they cannot be dealt with in the course of the time allotted to him&mdash;were reduced to 20 minutes, how would he be able to give adequate representation to his State of Tasmania and the people he represents and how would he be able to express the principles he holds true?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Faulkner has said in defence of this proposition&mdash;and I say `in defence of this proposition', not `advancing this proposition'&mdash;that if one cannot say it in 20 minutes, it is not worth saying. It took him, I hasten to add, between 15 and 18 minutes to advance that very simple proposition. Senator Faulkner got up on his hind legs, thinking he was the new Cicero of the Senate chamber, and gave us a lesson entitled `Do as I say and not as I do'.

Senator Faulkner advanced not one reason why the conduct of business in this place would be improved. He advanced not one reason for us to say, `Yes, the Senate will be able to give better organisation to these Bills'. He could not come before the Senate and say that by cutting back the speaking time from 30 minutes to 20 we are going to give more enlightened discussion. Of course he could not do that; it would be a nonsense. Senator Faulkner well knows what cutting back the speaking time from 30 minutes to 20 will achieve: it will give less enlightened discussion to these matters. Of course, as Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Senator Faulkner has a vested interest in having less enlightened discussion on these matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It behoves the Senate and it behoves every individual honourable senator to give proper consideration to whether, in the space of a couple of minutes, we are going to vote for a measure which will make it less easy for us to do our job on behalf of our constituents. Very simply, the proposition we will have to decide on in a couple of minutes is this: do we vote to do our job less well than we do it at the moment? Do we vote to give our second-best to our constituents, or do we vote to do the job thoroughly until the job is done? That is the standard we expect of every other Australian and that is the standard we should expect of ourselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course Senator Faulkner would say, `But most of the second reading speeches that have been given in this chamber over the last three years&mdash;some 67 per cent of second reading speeches&mdash;have been dealt with in 20 minutes or less'. That is absolutely correct, because honourable senators do not enjoy having to get up and speak for 30 minutes. Speaking for 30 minutes is a hard task, particularly when one has complex matters to deal with. But it is that 24, 25, or 26 per cent of speeches that go over the 20 minutes that are the exception for which we should make provision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, when the 20-minute rule applied at the end of the last session in the lead-up to Christmas, I well recollect how my National Party Senate Leader, Senator Boswell, in speaking on the rural crisis, required an extension of time&mdash;which, I am pleased to say, was given to him by the Senate&mdash;so that he could outline the concerns of the people of Queensland in relation to the rural crisis, the drought and the effects it had not just on farmers but on people who live in rural communities. Of course, it should not be the case that a leader of a party speaking on an issue which goes right to the core of what that party stands for should be obliged to go on bended knee to the other side of the chamber to beg for another three or four minutes to complete a speech which he had already gutted to try to fit into the 20 minutes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That should not be what this chamber is about. This chamber should be about freedom of speech; this chamber should be about adequate consideration; and this chamber should be the bastion of the liberties of Australians. How can this chamber complete its obligations in that respect if honourable senators in this place are gagged to 20 minutes because it suits Senator Faulkner and so that Senator Faulkner can get home on time.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I point out to my colleagues in the Democrats who sit to my left that we in small parties, more so than those in large, need the full 30 minutes to lay down our point of view. In the Democrats there is an arrangement whereby individual senators deal with particular areas of interest. In the National Party we have an informal arrangement where some of us take particular interest in certain matters. For example, Senator Bjelke-Petersen has during her time in the Senate taken a particular interest in family issues and issues affecting women who live outside the capital cities. Therefore, we do not have an array of speakers to deal with particular matters. We cannot throw four or five adequately briefed senators into the debate. In many cases we have but one senator to lay down our point of view. That one senator should be allowed the opportunity to lay down that point of view fully, adequately and thoroughly so that everybody&mdash;not just in this Senate chamber but also throughout the community&mdash;knows the view of that particular party. </PARA>

I remember that on numerous occasions Senator Vallentine would come into the chamber on the adjournment debate, not having been in the chamber all day, and then proceed to give an adjournment speech of 30 minutes which would cover some 20 pages of finely printed text.

We should not further restrict Senate speaking time when adequate speaking time is the hallmark of the enlightened and reasoned debate for which this Senate chamber is justifiably proud and famous, not just in this country but throughout the region. In many countries with which we deal, people say that the Australian Senate is one of the finest chambers of review that one will find anywhere.

<PARA>This is part of a pattern of measures which have come through at the start of this new Parliament which will have the effect of further curtailing the rights of senators to debate Bills and to make governments more accountable. That is a matter of great concern. There is probably no year on record in which the Government has attempted to get more Bills through the Parliament than it did last year.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that proposals we have put up to improve the performance of standing committees and Question Time have received very short shrift from the Australian Democrats. That is a great pity. This was a chance to sit down together in a sensible and balanced manner and look at what could be done to improve the performance of this chamber. On many occasions in the last Parliament I spoke to Senator Coulter about the sorts of measures that we thought would improve this Parliament. Senator Coulter gave us very little comfort and tended constantly to buy the Government's line that somehow it was all so vital that the Government's program be rammed through this chamber in the shortest possible time. The guillotine was supported by the Australian Democrats, including Senator Coulter. I acknowledge that there were some changes to impose reasonable restraints on lengthy answers by Ministers, but they certainly were not the changes which I believe would have made a substantial difference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I fear that a great opportunity has been missed to improve the performance of the Senate and to give a very clear lead to other chambers around the nation about what the elected members and senators of Parliament can do to carry out sensible reforms and make governments more accountable. Senator Faulkner is the new boy in the job and we would all want to give him a reasonable chance to see whether he can perform to make this chamber operate better. I am prepared to reserve judgment on just what sort of performance Senator Faulkner will give in his important new role as Manager of Government Business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to say that there has not been a great start to this Parliament. Senator Evans, the Leader of the Government in the Senate, recently pointed out that no legislation of any substance has been debated in this chamber, despite the fact that we have now been back almost two weeks. In fact, the time of the chamber has been taken up with a whole host of procedural motions that Senator Faulkner seems determined to ram through this chamber without any sensible attempt to get a proper consensus and without any recognition of the need to make some changes. Instead, he has done a deal with the Democrats in an attempt to impose the Government's will on this chamber. It is a great pity that Senator Coulter and his colleagues have cooperated with him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the Parliament has resumed. A series of procedural motions have been brought forward before this chamber by Senator Faulkner which I believe will certainly restrict the effectiveness of the Senate. Days and days have been wasted, and I am sure that further days will be wasted. We on this side are committed to sensible reform in the Parliament and will be making it very clear that we are not prepared to concur in a further restriction of the rights of senators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Faulkner may, with the assistance of the Democrats, win a Pyrrhic victory on this issue and may well get this motion through. But I wonder whether Senator Faulkner has advised his colleagues that senators do have other rights and that any time saved as a result of this motion&mdash;I notice from Senator Faulkner's figures that practically no time will be saved on this motion&mdash;will be taken up with other procedures that are available to senators. For example, senators will have further time to contribute on second reading amendments. So there are ways around this motion, although they are somewhat untidy, but if this motion is forced through, they will undoubtedly be used. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Faulkner's colleagues may well ask him in the weeks and months to come why he proceeded with this motion, which on his own figures was not needed, and why he insisted on taking up so much time of the chamber to ram it through. When the procedures are available, if senators are so disposed, they will be able to manage to circumvent the intention of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a pity that in a whole series of areas in which we are seeking to make reforms to the Senate chamber the Democrats have chosen not to support us. Once again, they have chosen to follow the Government road, which is again a pity. Senator Coulter will remember one of the least glorious aspects of his parliamentary career as being the Marshall Islands affair. Senator Coulter initially came out with guns blazing on that matter. We were going to have a Senate inquiry, as very important issues were involved. Indeed, the Marshall Islands affair is still occupying columns in newspapers today as new stories break. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members of the Government spoke to Senator Coulter. They suggested to him that the real issue was not looking at the whole Marshall Islands affair or examining the behaviour of Ministers and public servants in relation to that issue; the real issue was about setting up a code of conduct for Ministers and that we really needed to get a committee together to do this. So we suddenly swung to having an inquiry into an issue of central importance and interest to the public. Who knows what that inquiry could have turned up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Faulkner&mdash;one would have to give him credit for this&mdash;spoke to the Democrats and convinced them that the real issue was the code of ethics of Ministers. So we set up a committee, which met four times but produced nothing. I would have thought it would be a most striking lesson to Senator Coulter that it is sometimes dangerous to lie down with the lion. In the end, he and his party were not advantaged by concurring with the Government's proposal on that issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, that is just one of many issues in which Senator Coulter has chosen to concur with the view of the Government. At the end of the day, the Government was laughing that he had been conned. The public had not been informed properly as to the nature of those great events in relation to the Marshall Islands. I would have thought that would have been a warning to Senator Coulter and his colleagues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by urging the Democrats, once again, to join with us not only in protecting the rights of senators&mdash;this Bill, of course, restricts the rights of senators&mdash;but in seeking to bring about major reforms to this Parliament. Senator Coulter and his colleagues will have to recognise one day that those reforms must involve making Government Ministers more accountable for their actions, more subject to scrutiny, and that will mean a better Question Time and a more effective committee system. I regret that it will not happen this time. We may have months and years to see how fast these reforms can be brought in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I say, I urge the Democrats to think again. The Democrats should not join with the Government in restricting senators' rights; rather, they should join with us in trying to enhance the performance of this Parliament, to ensure that the fundamental right of the public to know what governments are doing is protected, and to ensure that those whom they elect to these parliaments have the ability to ensure proper scrutiny of government actions. </PARA>

I said to the person sitting beside me, who at the time was Senator Reg Withers, arguably one of the greatest senators ever to have been in this chamber, `Why don't we move that he be no longer heard?'. He said, `Your views are not important. What is important is that every senator has the right to be heard'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the fundamental tenets of this chamber is that a senator is entitled to be heard. That cannot be an unlimited right but, as other speakers have said, it was not so many years ago that we had an hour to speak on a Bill. For years after I was elected there was the entitlement to speak for an hour on any Bill. What we are faced with now is not, as my colleague Senator Kemp says, a minimalist reduction from 30 minutes to 20 minutes. We are now in a situation where we have one-third of the entitlement we had when I first came into the chamber&mdash;20 minutes as against 60. That is a massive reduction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point of all of this is that the business of the chamber, in the eyes of the Labor Party, has to be reduced to the level of impotence that the House of Representatives now enjoys. The Labor Party has never matured in its thinking. It does not understand the exercise of power. It does not understand that power is not unqualified, that the right to exercise power carries with it certain responsibilities, and the most important of those responsibilities is the responsibility of accounting for the exercise of that power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The accounting of the exercise of power cannot be done on television interviews; it cannot be done in the press. It can only be in the Parliament that the executive government is brought to account. Because of the limitations constitutionally on the House of Representatives, this chamber is the crucial chamber where governments are brought to account. So any move that denies the right of a senator to speak or the access of a senator to speak to some degree circumscribes the matter of accountability of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mention has been made of the guillotine. When we were allowed to speak for an hour, the guillotine was rarely used, except by the Labor Party. If one goes through the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansards</EMPHASIS>, one will find that for the years we were in government, even though we granted senators the right of one hour to speak, we very rarely resorted to a guillotine and then only in extreme circumstances. The Labor Party loves the guillotine. I remember the time when Senator Murphy was Leader of the Senate. I think he guillotined 68 Bills through in 20 minutes. I was not here but the notoriety that that earned the Labor Party spread right throughout Australia. We have had the incredible situation where right at the start of this session the Labor Party has already introduced the guillotine in the House of Representatives, where it has absolute power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another manifestation of this same avoidance of accountability has been the marked deterioration of the committee system in the Senate. The committees are very dear to the proper functioning of the Senate. We have seen a marked reluctance on the part of the Labor Party to allow those committees to operate properly. Nothing demonstrates that better than the estimates committees, which are sitting at present. Mr Deputy President, how many times do you walk into an estimates committee and see only Liberal or National Party senators around the table forming the quorum?</PARA>

They simply do not use the system. They prefer the secret backroom deal of the Caucus committees. This is ultimately what is behind the whole of the republican movement for the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). It is a naked grab for power of a Prime Minister who wants to take unto himself a new Constitution which puts greater powers in the hands of the party of the day governing the country. This is promoted by a Prime Minister who knows that at present he has absolute and total control over Caucus, so he is answerable to no-one.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other very upsetting manifestation of committees at present is not only the lack of cooperation of the Labor Party but also the arrogance of the chairmen of the committees and of the Ministers at the table to control and restrict the flow of questions to those committees. Unless we can have an honest answer or frank explanation from a public servant as to where money is proposed to be spent, we simply cannot have an examination at the level we need to assure the Senate that the Government is spending its funds properly. The incident last night where Senator Collins once more reverted to his characteristics, which I compared once to a dying wounded buffalo in the Northern Territory, and steadfastly refused to answer questions or allow questions to be answered is really a very serious assault on the committee system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The matter we have before us this morning is not, with the greatest of respect to some of the speakers, a small reduction in time; it is a significant reduction in time, but it is part and parcel of a coordinated plan to reduce the powers of the Senate. If that happens, the whole of the democratic system in Australia falls into disrepair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This matter of accountability cannot be overemphasised. We live in a society where compliance with the law is essential. If we do not comply with the law, society ends up in a state of anarchy. But compliance with that law is a voluntary matter. In general, people comply with the laws because they accept they are for the common good. One of the laws involves paying money. A lot of us in this country pay taxes. We pay those voluntarily&mdash;certainly, we can be pursued by the tax commissioner, but 99 per cent of the community pay their taxes voluntarily and on time. The reciprocal obligation on the Government of those taxing powers is to account for the expenditure of money. One of the principal ways of bringing the Government to account for that is in this chamber. I am implacably opposed to anything that restricts or diminishes the powers of the Senate to inquire into the proper workings of the Government. I therefore oppose this motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy President, I congratulate you on taking the chair of the Senate for the first time in your role of assisting the President and Deputy President. I oppose the Government's motion that there be a restriction of 20 minutes placed on speeches by honourable senators in second reading debates. The principal argument that I put to the chamber is that the Senate is a precious, essential element of the Australian democracy and to restrict its powers is to undermine the ability of the Senate to fulfil its objective to represent the Australian people in ensuring&mdash;by scrutiny; by questioning; and by putting forward views, particularly contrary views&mdash;that there is a proper examination of all matters that come before this Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is with great regret that for a long time, especially in the last 10 years, we have seen legislative debate become all the more concentrated in the Senate. I believe it is tragic that the legislative scrutiny of this Parliament has now been virtually vacated by the House of Representatives. In saying that, I do not wish to show any disrespect for the other place&mdash;of course, it is against our Standing Orders to show any such disrespect&mdash;but I speak plainly when I say that the Senate is the only chamber where there is careful scrutiny of government legislation and, indeed, even of a large number of other areas such as government reports and inquiries by Senate committees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government wants to put in place this fortnight a number of measures that will restrict the powers of honourable senators. It is in the spirit of opposing those measures that I speak against this measure. In concert with this proposal to reduce speaking time to 20 minutes we have a reduction of the powers of honourable senators to raise matters in the Committee of the Whole after estimates committee debates and the lamentable proposal, which is the next item of business today, to reduce the number of Senate committees from nine to seven. I am opposed to that and ready to speak on that matter as soon as we get onto it later this morning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very much opposed to the restrictions that the Government is putting forward. Why is it doing it? The Government is the main proposer of legislation in the Parliament&mdash;indeed, it is the elected government that ought to be the main proposer of legislation&mdash;and it would suit it to have its proposals go through with the minimum of restraint, as they currently do in the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a scandal that yesterday, the fourth day of sitting, a guillotine was introduced into the House of Representatives for 30 Bills to be handled with often only 20 minutes allocated to each Bill. That is the kind of intention that the Government can impose upon the House of Representatives because it has a majority there. Against whatever protests are put forward by Liberal and National party members of the House of Representatives, or by the two independent members, the Government has its way. Its way is achieved by its iron majority in the House of Representatives. So, because of what happened yesterday, 30 Bills are to be adopted, regardless of contrary view and regardless of debate. These Bills are all to be determined according to the Government's wish; that is, the Bills are not to be amended or varied in any way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has even grown an assumption by Government members that in practice any debate, any variation, any amendment&mdash;even any good amendment&mdash;any improvement of legislation and any channel through which the public can put a view about a proposal must happen in the Senate. The Government does not have a majority in the Senate. Also, we have a continuing tradition of examining every matter carefully and debating legislation at the second reading and committee stages. I point out that, had we been successful in March, on coming to government we would not have proposed such a reduction. We are not hypocritical in this matter: we treasure the powers of the Senate, and in government we would not have proposed this restriction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me say to the Democrats that I believe former Senator Chipp and former Senator Mason, the first two Democrats who came here&mdash;they happened to be elected at the same time as Senator MacGibbon and I, in the 1977 election&mdash;would not in their hearts have supported any move by the Democrats to join, as they appear to be doing on this occasion, with the Government and vote in favour of this restriction. When we put together all of the restrictions that the Government&mdash;it appears with Democrat support&mdash;is proposing for this Senate, I believe Senator Chipp and Senator Mason, and even Senator Haines, would be very angry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The earliest tradition of the Australian Democrats was to give proper regard to the Senate as a place of scrutiny, a place of debate, a place of argument, a place of bona fide examination of every proposal, a place of keeping everybody honest and a place of exposing through that scrutiny the views of the Australian public. It is a sad day to see restriction on restriction being proposed by a government and supported by the Democrats. I do not wish to labour this point, but I appeal to Senator Coulter, who is in the chamber, and to other Democrat senators watching the debate on television, to reconsider their position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make one thing very clear: I believe that on most occasions a 20-minute speech is better than a 30-minute speech. I believe that restricting a speech to 20 minutes is best achieved by self-restraint and self-discipline, not by such a restriction being placed in the Standing Orders of the Senate. I think there are times when honourable senators need 30 minutes to express properly their views on a particular Bill or even a series of Bills. I support the amendment that has been moved by my colleague Senator Patterson to except from the proposed 20-minute restriction speeches made on two or more Bills that are being debated cognately. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me give a practical example in support of Senator Patterson's proposition. I have for many years handled education Bills at the second reading stage for my colleagues in the Liberal and National parties. On one occasion I was summing up the views of these parties with regard to five education Bills. I remember that there was $10 billion involved in the Bills that were being considered by the Parliament. Even when such legislation comes up each six months, it contains a great complexity of new measures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In trying to deal with five Bills in 30 minutes, I have on a couple of occasions asked for an extension of five minutes so that I could give proper weight to the five Bills over a 35-minute period. That is from a person who tries to limit speaking to the minimum that is required to put a view clearly and persuasively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put to the Senate that if this motion is carried with Democrat support for the Government's proposition, it will be able to be evaded. There is no such time restriction on speeches at the first reading or third reading stages and, as we know, 15 minutes is allowed to speakers on any matter at the committee stage. Under our current procedure there are occasions&mdash;for instance, the consideration of finance Bills&mdash;that allow for a speech on any topic. This opportunity has not been taken up in recent years as much as it was 12 or 15 years ago, when I was first here. If restrictions are imposed in this way, the Senate has its own way of getting around them. Any view a senator needs to express could be expressed through such alternative means&mdash;even including during the adjournment debate. I happen to think that a five-minute speech on the adjournment is an admirable self-restraint, but I have, along with others, spoken for 30 minutes on the adjournment on a few occasions. I believe, in retrospect, that the length of time I took on those occasions was justified because there was a need to speak comprehensively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put it to members of the Government and the Democrats that the ideal of 20 minutes or less that we all could be persuaded to accept is best achieved by self-restraint and not by the restriction that is now being placed on us. I give only one other example&mdash;the two-day special sitting in late January 1991 to debate the Gulf war. I regard it as one of the high points of the Senate in terms of the contributions of the approximately 50 senators to the debate on one motion. That one matter was before us for the two days and we spoke, as many will recall, until 3 and 4 o'clock in the morning to give everyone an appropriate turn. Many senators rightly spoke for 30 minutes. It is appropriate, when there is need for a full expression of view on a matter of major import to this country, that the Senate should allow that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by urging colleagues among the Democrats and Independent senators to agree with Senator Harradine and to agree with the Liberal and National Party senators that we should not place restrictions such as that now proposed on the speaking time of senators. I urge that it at least be conceded that in cognate debates there ought not to be that restriction and that Senator Patterson's amendment should therefore be supported. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The speeches I have heard so far from those in the Opposition have ranged very widely away from that particular point. I was rather intrigued by Senator Kemp's mention of the Marshall Islands. I was a little unsure as to how the debates that went on during the so-called Marshall Islands affair relate to the matter of speech time limits. The Senate may well be aware that there is a parliamentary delegation going to a number of South Sea Island countries. I am hoping to be a member of that delegation, which I believe might be leaving in June. I might, for the edification of senators, be approaching Senator Richardson for a reference to give to a few people over there or perhaps an introduction to people to see whether I could set up a suitable immigration scam! That seemed to me to be the only relevance of Senator Kemp's comments to the debate this morning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point that really needs to be stressed was made by Senator Baden Teague; that is, it is true that, since no party has had the numbers in the Senate to ram legislation through on numbers alone, it is in this chamber that legislation has been properly considered. There is no doubt about that at all. That is not a function of the speaking times; it is a function of the way the numbers fall in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To pick up the assertion of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and assert the opposite, I remind everybody that, under the unrepresentative system of election of the House of Representatives, it is possible for a party with just over 12 per cent of the vote to gain government. It is in the Senate, with its proportional representation system, that we have a properly representative chamber. I see Senator Watson looking puzzled. I would invite him to do the numbers on just three parties seeking election and to recognise that the party that wins government has to win only 25 per cent of the votes plus one vote in 50 per cent of the seats plus one seat. That adds up to just over 12 per cent of the vote. So the House of Representatives is a very unrepresentative House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I observe the hypocrisy of the Opposition in that during the recent election it was claiming very vociferously that, had it won government, we the Democrats should simply lie down and agree with most of what was in its Fightback package. We went to the electors with an undertaking to oppose certain elements, such as the goods and services tax, and we had a mandate from our supporters to come back, if the Opposition had won government, and carry that view. We had a responsibility to carry that view into this chamber and if the numbers had prevailed then, in relation to the point Senator Baden Teague made about government scrutiny, the boot would have been on the other foot. If the coalition had won government it would not&mdash;as the present government has done&mdash;have done so with over 50 per cent of the vote. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This chamber is the proper chamber of the people where proper scrutiny of legislation, government and every aspect of administration occurs simply because of the numbers and because no party&mdash;neither government nor opposition&mdash;has the numbers to ram anything through this chamber without the support of at least one other group. I think that point needs to be stressed. Senator Baden Teague was quite correct in pointing to the important role of the Senate, but I think his diagnosis went astray when he tried to link that with the length of time allowed for speeches in second reading debates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come back to a more specific example&mdash;a debate we have only just recently had in this chamber. During the last session, in December, legislation was passed, as other senators know, which removed from pensioners some of their entitlements if their shares gained in value, and that would come in in September. The Opposition supported that legislation introduced by the Government. It has now changed its position. Are Opposition senators suggesting for a moment that, had they each had half an hour to debate that matter back in December, they might have taken a different position? Of course, that is absolute nonsense. They had made up their minds on that position. It took them from December to May to change their minds, and now they have decided to support what we supported back in December. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Are they suggesting that they should have had a second reading debate from December to May so that they might, in the course of it, change their minds? Of course not. They came in here with a position; they supported the Government; and they denied the pensioners of this country the proper scrutiny of that legislation. They were too quick with their economic rationalist line to recognise that justice was far more important than adherence to an abstract economic ideology. Fortunately, now they have changed their minds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raise that point also because even this morning's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> has got it wrong and, again, is accusing the Democrats of not opposing that legislation in December. It was the Opposition which supported the Government on that occasion and denied proper scrutiny of that piece of legislation. It had whatsoever nothing to do&mdash;and this is the point&mdash;with whether there is half an hour or 20 minutes or any other time limit set on speeches at the second reading stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Teague also made the very significant point that in the committee stage of the debate senators can speak for up to 15 minutes as many times as they like. It is at the committee stage of the debate&mdash;and I stress that word `debate'&mdash;that true debates occur. That is where we get into the nitty-gritty of legislation; that is where we change the legislation; that is where we move amendments to legislation. As I say, if one feels strongly about a particular amendment, provided there is objection to it&mdash;and presumably there is objection if one has to debate it&mdash;one can get up and continue to make points with respect to that amendment, and there is no limitation on that debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is at the second reading stage, which is improperly called a debate, that each party states its general philosophical position with respect to that legislation. As Senator Harradine has pointed out, from statistical evidence, between two-thirds and three-quarters of speeches are 20 minutes or less, and he gave an account of that over several sessions of this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question then arises: how much more useful were the one-quarter to one-third of speeches which actually went over that 20-minute time limit? I suggest that the majority of them, as Senator Teague suggested, probably could easily, with great benefit, have been reduced to the 20-minute limit. The detailed points that need to be raised, particularly if they lead to an amendment and a change to the legislation, can be dealt with in the committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pick up a point here that Senator O'Chee made. On several occasions it has been quite clear that senators in this place have spoken for 20 minutes, half-an-hour or whatever the limit at that time happened to be; they clearly have been in need of additional time, have sought leave and, to my knowledge, that leave has not been refused. I would disagree with Senator O'Chee when he rather pejoratively suggested that Senator Boswell had to get on bended knee and go to the Government to get that leave. I would suggest that most of us in this chamber would recognise that if a speaker was making valid points, clearly in continuation of some argument, and then sought leave, that leave would be granted. That mechanism would not be needed very often. The Opposition has many members in this chamber and it can put two or three speakers on. It can easily cover the philosophical aspects of a piece of legislation over the course of an hour by putting on three speakers. So there is not, in that sense, a limitation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is not true, and it is not the way that government members should approach debate in the Senate. As I said, when we were in government we kept matching them speaker for speaker on every occasion on every Bill and on every procedural motion that came up before us. There was none of this, `You don't talk. You sit back. Don't debate it in the Senate. You are only there to vote and nothing else'. It is typical of how the Government believes democracy works.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had lots of experience of the Labor Party form of government. We know how the Labor Party conducts its Caucus meetings. I know that the students in the gallery will understand that a secret ballot is meant to be that. You are meant to be able to vote and that vote is meant to have nothing do with anyone else. It is your decision alone. Your ballot is secret. But when the Labor Party Caucus has a secret ballot, what do Caucus members have to do? Immediately they make their ballot they have to show it to one of their factional members. Good democracy! The way this Government conducts democracy is to have a so-called secret ballot, where a member voting must show his vote to another factional member&mdash;because they do not trust each other&mdash;who will check up on him and make sure that he is doing the right thing. That is the way the Government believes democracy ought to be run. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us come to the second reason why the Government is indulging in this proposal. For years and years the policy of the Government, the policy of the Labor Party, was to abolish the Senate. That was written into its policy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is no use Senator Schacht saying that it was not. It was written into Labor Party policy, into its platform. We all knew about it&mdash;it was front page in the newspapers&mdash;when Senator Evans came in here and said, `Look, it's not good public relations to have it written into the policy. Let us take it out of the written part of the policy. I am going in there and I will white-ant it from within'. He said so unashamedly. His maiden speech denigrated the Senate. Senator Coates is another good example; he has always said that the Senate should not be here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does the Leader of the Labor Party call us? The Prime Minister, Mr Keating, called the Senate `unrepresentative swill'. That is the true opinion of the Government regarding the Senate. So, naturally, the way it carries out its policy is to downgrade on every occasion possible the rights of senators in this place. Government senators have already done it in regard to the allocation of time for speeches and, with the Democrats' support, they will do it again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has whittled away the rights of the estimates committees, so we had the shameful debacle last night of Senator Collins refusing to allow his bureaucrats to answer the questions rightfully put by the Opposition senators. In other committees the Government would not allow senators to ask questions except on a particular line of expenditure. Last night we had a most shameful situation in the estimates committees, another attempt to undermine the powers of the Senate estimates committees. I do not understand the Democrats, frankly. The Senate is the only place the Democrats have any say. They do not have any members in the House of Representatives. Yet they are supporting the Government in gradually whittling away the powers of the individual senators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Straight after the debate on the downgrading of the time allocated for speeches from half an hour to 20 minutes was adjourned, Senator Bell got up on the adjournment debate and spoke for 29 minutes&mdash;nearly 30 minutes. He had previously said&mdash;and you say, Mr Acting Deputy President&mdash;that anyone who cannot make a speech in only 20 minutes should not be allowed to make a speech. He got up and could not use 20 minutes; he took just on 30 minutes. The hypocrisy of that is unbelievable. If Senator Bell, who is a Democrat and who believes that he should have been able to fit his speech into 20 minutes, found that he could not and took just on 30 minutes, then surely to heavens the vote in that situation would be nothing but hypocrisy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Harradine said, some time in the next couple of years&mdash;in this next three-year period no doubt&mdash;the Senate will have debates on the Constitution, perhaps on the referendum the Prime Minister is proposing on whether we retain the monarchy or become a republic. I believe that everyone in the Senate will have personal views on that. Of course, Labor Party members will not speak; the Minister will, but no-one else will be allowed. On this side of the chamber we will be wanting to speak. I am sure that the Democrats will be wanting to speak. Therefore, I believe that they will be wanting at least 30 minutes each. Senator Coulter has said that the Democrats will not deny any senator who wants an extension of time so long as the Democrats believe that it is just for that to happen. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Crichton-Browne said, it really does not matter what the Democrats want, any senator can stop a speaker having additional time. But is that the whole point of it? Is it not, as Senator MacGibbon said, the right of all senators to make that speech, be heard, represent their State and take the full 30 minutes because they believe that what they are saying is important? It does not really matter what Senator Coulter believes is important, as far as other senators are concerned. They believe they have something to say that represents their particular State and is important for their State. It does not matter a fig what the Democrats think, the Labor Party thinks or, indeed&mdash;vice versa&mdash;what we think if one of the Democrats wants to get up and speak for half an hour. It is, and has been, the right of every senator to be able to do that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government realises that it will no longer have the numbers in the new Parliament. It has lost an additional two seats in the Senate. After 30 June the Labor Party will have only 30 senators in this place; the coalition will have 36; the Democrats will have seven; and there will be Senator Harradine and two Greens. The Senate will be a very interesting spot&mdash;a very sensible spot. It will be very interesting to see the Government making deals with the Greens that it has not had to do in the past; it has only had to do deals with the Democrats. The Government will be offering the Greens all sorts of things, too, in compensation for their vote. It will be very interesting to see how the Government goes on that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now have the Government attempting to downgrade the Senate to the same situation that is presently occurring in the House of Representatives. The rights of senators here are so much greater than those of members of the House of Representatives. Because the Government does not believe in the Senate, it is trying to downgrade the Senate to the same level as the House of Representatives so that it can control the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the House of Representatives at the moment, Bills come in that never reach the committee stage. Members do not look at the committee stage; they are not allowed to because the Bills are guillotined. Everything is pushed through like a sausage machine. That cannot happen in the Senate unless the Government controls it, and we are far away from that situation. We rely on the Democrats who, in the past, have said that they will not apply the guillotine. Last year, in the lead-up to Christmas, to do them justice, they said, `No, we will not apply the guillotine in the same fashion'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A little chat will be going on now between the Minister and Senator Coulter. I am not quite sure where that will lead to, but we can guess. A vote will be taken in a little while after we have heard from a few more speakers on our side. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today Senator Coulter said that we supported the Government on pensioner investment. The Government and the Democrats know that the reason we did that was that it was included in a Bill in which the pensioners were to receive certain benefits which we believed they should receive. So we supported the Bill in total&mdash;bearing in mind, of course, that that Bill was put through with the guillotine in the House of Representatives&mdash;purely for that reason only. Even in the House of Representatives we said that we would review that in government. Because we are not in government, we are now saying we will review it and we are doing it, and Senator Patterson has already moved an amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For Senator Coulter to say that the Democrats convinced us and talked us into it is a lot of rubbish; absolute rot.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was absolutely staggered to hear Senator Coulter say that debate is not important in this chamber. Let me quote his exact words. He said, `All it is in this chamber is how the numbers fall'. Debate does not matter. We have had the Democrats saying to the public at large, `Our policy is that anyone who comes into the Parliament in our party has the right to vote as they think. They will not be caucused. We will listen to the debate and we will vote the way we believe we should'. That is what the Democrats told the Australian people; that is what they tell their constituents; and that is what they tell their party members. But today we have heard Senator Coulter say that debate is not important; it is how the numbers fall. That, I think, is a travesty of their whole credibility and we will see what happens as a result of it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise on behalf of the Opposition to oppose the motion moved by the Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Senator Faulkner, to restrict speaking time to 20 minutes. On this side of the chamber, the Liberal and National parties side, we are appalled at this motion by the Government, and we are even more appalled by the attitude of the Australian Democrats.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate forms an integral part of the accountability chain; an accountability that sits very uneasily with the Labor Government. From time to time newspaper editors are rung up and abused by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) when they take a contrary view to that of the Government. At present we have the fiasco of the special deals in relation to communications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate is not the favourite chamber of the Labor Party. We have had unsavoury comments from the Prime Minister about senators and the role of the Senate. Why? Because the Senate chamber is part of a very important link within our democratic system&mdash;a system of checks and balances and of accountability. In a democratic society accountability is very important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the important links in the chain is the role of the Auditor-General. Why were the Auditor-General's funds restricted so that he could not fully discharge his responsibilities as Auditor-General? The way in which the Auditor-General has managed his task draws admiration from a wide spectrum of Australian society. He adheres to the highest standards. I think that, in his role as Auditor-General, John Taylor has raised the status of auditing. He has done that because he has fearlessly supported the need for accountability and the need for checks and balances. One of our roles in this place is to ensure proper scrutiny and proper accountability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Senate that accountability is not just a matter of counting the dollars and cents. Last night we saw a very unfortunate situation arise when the Government believed that the accountability of the tax office in terms of the estimates committee debates was just a matter of dollars and cents. The Government ignored the very special responsibility of the Australian Taxation Office in discharging its obligations to administer tax law in a fair and impartial way to ensure that our tax laws are fair and equitable. These issues were going to be challenged last night during the estimates committee hearings but those challenges were not allowed. What has the tax office got to hide?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposal to limit speeches in second reading debates to 20 minutes is more than just a matter of limiting speaking time; it is a matter of putting a further check or limitation on this accountability, important though that be. This 20-minute limit on speaking time is restricted further by the Government's practice of grouping Bills together and debating them cognately. Last year in the tax area we had something like three to four minutes per Bill to thrash out the important issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Within the next fortnight this chamber will be debating three tax Bills: two taxation laws amendment Bills and the Taxation Laws Amendment (Superannuation) Bill. If this motion is passed, contributions to the debate on those Bills will be limited to 20 minutes. Therefore, we will have less than seven minutes to debate each of those important Bills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second reading stage of a Bill is very important because it sends messages to the Australian people telling them what issues they should be contacting us on. But if senators do not have the opportunity of sending out those signals and messages through this Parliament, then we are taking away from the Parliament the very responsibilities that we were elected here to carry out&mdash;to debate, to challenge and to put alternative positions. If those responsibilities are taken away from us we will have to rely on networks other than this Parliament to send our messages to the Australian public. I think that is unfortunate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us see how that is reflected in regard to administration. The taxation office&mdash;an area for which I have particular responsibility&mdash;is becoming subject to less and less parliamentary scrutiny. The office seems to be more concerned about dealing with its own groups that it has set up outside the control of this Parliament and as a result is devoting less time to the Parliament. It is making determinations and rulings which cannot possibly come through the Senate. For those people who do not have the opportunity or money to challenge those rulings&mdash;and challenges to a ruling must go before a court and the court system is so expensive that they cannot afford it&mdash;where is the justice? Taxation justice in this country depends on how much money one has and, as some witnesses suggested, on how much influence one personally has with the taxation office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I first entered this Parliament the time allowed for a contribution to a second reading debate was one hour.

The Democrats will side with the Government and because of their numbers&mdash;the numbers being more important than the logic of the argument&mdash;they will sway the vote. For Senator Coulter to say that the numbers are important and the debate is unimportant betrays the ideals on which the Australian Democrats as a party were founded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that those comments that were made today will be overruled by the Democrats' new leader, Senator Kernot. I believe Senator Kernot knows the value of debate in this place. Senator Coulter may not recall, but Senator Kernot certainly would, that last year when we were debating certain sales tax amendments it was the logic of certain proposals put forward by Senator Kernot that encouraged the Opposition to support a number of those motions. At that time a number of commentators, including representatives from the Democrats, said, `This is the way that the Senate should always work'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To the Democrats' credit, in the past the reverse has been true and, because of the sheer logic and strength of the argument in a debate, the Democrats have supported the coalition's point of view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we limit debate at the second reading stage, the opportunity for such important decisions to be taken, based on the logic and force of the argument, would be lost. If a person who has been a successor to some of the great leaders of the Democrats, including former Senators Chipp and Haines, comes into this place and indicates that the debate is not important, it makes me wonder where that person stands in relation to the Democrats' original philosophy of selling to the Australian people its philosophy of keeping the bastards honest. If it is just the numbers that are important, debate is therefore unimportant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would hope that, in the light of this debate, Senator Coulter may be persuaded to change his point of view and support the coalition so that we retain the 30-minute time limit. The 20-minute time limit is a further restriction and what will happen is that in time we will have a further whittling away of opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the point of view of the Opposition, this measure is just another link in the chain of taking away the rights of parliamentarians, particularly senators, to debate and challenge issues. It is a sad day for democracy. This measure will diminish the important role of this Senate. If that is on the Labor Party agenda, let every Australian take note because democracy is at risk in this country while the Labor Party pursues such a line. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party has a proud record of wanting to get rid of the Senate, wanting to downgrade its importance, wanting to restrict its power. It is not the Senate that holds up government legislation; the Senate scrutinises and amends it where appropriate. It is simply atrocious management by retrospective managers of government business and the current Manager of Government Business (Senator Faulkner). In years past, for weeks and weeks at a time, the Government simply has not had its program ready; it has not had any legislation here for us to debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party's view on the Senate is well known. As my colleagues have mentioned, Senator Evans, the Leader of the Government in the Senate, wanted to get rid of the Senate and made that quite clear in his early speeches to this chamber.

They were formed to make sure the incumbent government was kept on the straight and narrow. What has their record been? Have they done that? The Australian public does not think they have. In the last election the vote for the Democrats fell from about 12 per cent to 5.3 per cent. That shows what the people of Australia think about the way the Democrats have simply rolled over for the Labor Party every time some proposal is put up to curtail speech in this Senate, to interfere with the Senate's scrutiny and to oppose reform. Every time we propose matters to make things better in the Senate, to allow the Senate to operate more effectively, to scrutinise the Government more, the Democrats roll over, go with the Government and agree with it. </PARA>

At least in the last Parliament the Prime Minister knew that his numbers were very, very tight. He occasionally paid lip-service to Caucus decisions. Of course, now&mdash;and it has been demonstrated in many ways, particularly with the appointment of the frontbench&mdash;the Prime Minister is not even going to take any notice of the Labor Party Caucus anymore, let alone the Australian public. He has no concern for those sorts of things. Where we might have hoped that, at some stage, the excesses of the Government could be curtailed, we have a group&mdash;a very small group and getting smaller, I might say&mdash;in the Australian parliamentary system, the Australian Democrats, who seem determined to do everything possible to allow this Government to ride roughshod over the wishes of the Australian public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We hoped that the Australian Democrats might have learnt their lesson. It is pretty obvious that they have not.

They should make a statement at this time and tell the Government that it is not going to be able to rely on their vote almost 100 per cent of the time, as I think happened before. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens will have to appreciate that they have this responsibility to consider the wider aspects of government in Australia and the wider operations of this Parliament. They have a responsibility to think about the sorts of things that are being proposed and say to the Government, `Enough is enough. We don't agree with this. We are going to exercise our judgment independently. We are going to ensure that the Senate forever continues its originally contemplated role of a States house, a house where checks and balances can come into play and a house of review'. That is very important. The Greens should not take any action which will lessen the Senate's opportunity of properly reviewing the excesses of the Government. I hope that the Greens, Senator Chamarette in particular, will make a statement at this time and tell the Government that they are not going to be ridden roughshod over in these matters and join with us in that action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Chamarette may well have some influence on the Democrats, because the Democrats' vote is falling everywhere and the Greens' vote seems to be increasing. I suspect, certainly after the next election when there are five Democrats up for re-election, that very few, if any, of them will be re-elected and there may be one or two additional Greens. The Democrats realise that they are on the way out. On that basis maybe Senator Chamarette has some influence on the current few Democrat senators. I urge Senator Chamarette to talk to them and suggest that they should not support these proposals. They should not continue to take these actions which result in a lessening of the importance and the powers of the Senate. I urge Senator Chamarette to take that action, as I urge the Senate generally to oppose these proposals by the Government. </PARA>

But I respect the right of my colleagues to speak for 30 minutes when they need to.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason I felt moved to come in here and say a few words was that I have only been in this place for six years, but all I have seen happening over that six years is the gradual erosion of the powers of this place. The other House has the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the guillotine. The Government has already applied the guillotine in this new Parliament. The only hope the Australian people have is this Senate. We are the only people who can scrutinise, correct and fix up all these Bills. We should think of the number of Bills that have come from the House of Representatives that have had to be changed or amended. Last year there were 148 amendments to one particular Bill. They were all agreed to by the Government. It was in such a rush to shove all its legislation through that it made an absolute mess of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We as a Senate have a duty to amend those Bills, to change them and to make them workable so that the government of the day can enact its legislation. But I think it is a disgrace to the whole parliamentary system of Australia to continually try to erode the powers of this Senate, which has a duty on behalf of the people of Australia to ensure that the government of the day does not get away with murder in its legislation. It is getting away with murder. What is it frightened of? In 1993 the House of Representatives will sit for 42 days. It is trying to escape scrutiny. </PARA>

I do not need to remind the chamber that it is this Senate that has been responsible for the dismissal of at least two Ministers. You never know, there might be another one coming up shortly.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to raise a couple of issues in connection with this motion to limit speeches during second reading debates to 20 minutes. I am very serious about the nature of debate which takes place in the chamber. When I first came into this chamber, I could not make a speech for more than eight minutes. For about the first 10 speeches I made, at the end of eight minutes, I could not think of another word to say.

I am all in favour of senators being able to develop an argument.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make the following proposition very seriously to the committee that deals with the Standing Orders: we ought to stand by standing order 187, that senators shall not read speeches. We ought to stick to that firmly. In the case of a Minister or a shadow Minister, we would allow them to incorporate in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> a document which, in effect, contains an essay on the subject or, if you like, what could be called a speech&mdash;although I think it is wrong to call it a speech when it is being incorporated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There would need to be some caution. The shadow Minister or the Minister would need to be able to let both sides read the document first so that we could make sure there was nothing improper in the speech. That is what is wrong with incorporated speeches; someone could incorporate in a speech something which is highly improper and to which objection would be taken in the Senate. If that problem could be overcome by allowing people to see the speeches, we would enable the Minister and the shadow Minister simply to incorporate their speeches. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We then might get the Minister, the shadow Minister or whoever saying, `The points of this document that I have just incorporated include one, two and three', or whatever they are. They might actually speak to the points which are in the document that they have just incorporated. There would then be proper debate in the Senate. We would be able to go back and insist upon standing order 187 being acted upon, and people would not be able to read speeches. It would make debate in this chamber so much better. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I see Senator Faulkner nodding in agreement. I have seen Senator Faulkner, as a relative newcomer to this place, making speeches with just a handful of notes in front of him. Another senator on his side is Senator Schacht, who frequently comes into this place and makes excellent speeches. I certainly do not like some of the things that he says, but they are excellent speeches. He directs his mind articulately to the subject and people enjoy listening to him, although we might not enjoy some of the things he says, especially when he makes outrageous, unfair and unreasonable attacks on me and my colleagues on this side of the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If senators did not read speeches, they would really start to debate issues properly. We might then get debates which only take three or four minutes. When senators started to read speeches, someone would be able to object and the whole Senate would uphold the objection that they are not allowed to read them; not even Ministers would be allowed to read them. Once we did that, we would not have to worry about whether there were 20-minute speeches or 30-minute speeches. The whole thing would flow and the Senate would be a much more exciting chamber in which to be present. </PARA>

It takes us to the situation that applies in the House of Representatives where the members do not make a significant contribution in the chamber; they are simply but numbers for the Government. The members get to speak but rarely and when they do speak they are entitled to do so for 10 minutes. From time to time when I have flipped through the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansards</EMPHASIS> of the House of Representatives, looking for some intellectual argument that is put by the Government or the Opposition in respect of any piece of legislation, I find them bankrupt.

It logically follows that, if we are going to limit the time of debate, we might as well simply give Independents, the minor parties and the coalition a global amount of time&mdash;in other words, formalise the system of a guillotine and say, `The Opposition has got three hours for this debate.

Worse than that, 46 per cent said that they had actually moved their financial business to another institution because of the bad service.</PARA></TALK.START>

It also contains some very simple and explicit instructions to people in the financial area&mdash;in particular, not to treat women as mental defectives; and that it is not a good idea, if you are talking to a woman about financial matters, to ask to speak to her husband. I sincerely hope that people in financial institutions will read the report and take it seriously because there is financial business out there to be done, provided the institutions are sensitive to the needs of women. Also, if they are serious about good business and they recognise that 46 per cent of women will move their business because of poor service, they might take heed.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I advised the Senate yesterday of the addition to the Australian shipping fleet of an LNG tanker as a direct result of the success of the Australian Government's shipping reform program. Indeed, crewing levels on that tanker are significantly below those of similar Japanese and British flag vessels.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bureau report referred to by Senator Burns provides further confirmation that there have been major improvements in operating efficiency at our container ports. It concludes that, in some cases, Australian performance levels are approaching observed best practice in similar sized overseas ports. In grain and coal handling, it concludes that the operating efficiency in Australia of relevant ports now approaches or is at world best practice. It will be recalled that stevedoring reforms in grain handling were an important element in the Government's waterfront reforms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, this level of improvement has not been uniform across all waterfront sectors. The bureau found that government and port authority charges in Australia were substantially higher than those observed for similar cargoes and ships overseas. This clearly emphasises, as I have been saying now for some three years, that there is scope for further efficiencies to be achieved in the port sector. Indeed, one of the major reasons why the changes were made in this portfolio, after discussions that I had with the Prime Minister last year, to incorporate all of the transport responsibilities under the control of one Minister, was to address this question of developing a cohesive and mutually supportive transport system for Australia where resources were not duplicated or wasted on alternative transport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government will be canvassing with the States the scope for further reform following the release of the Industry Commission's final report into port authority services and activities which is due at the end of this month. Already, the Government is pursuing improved competition in waterfront industries through the activities of the Prices Surveillance Authority and the Trade Practices Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to see that the shadow Minister for transport is criticising the Government for not pursuing port reform with the States. He makes the extremely novel suggestion that the Government should progress these issues with the States in the ministerial forum of the Australian Transport Advisory Council. It may come as some surprise for the shadow Minister to learn that this is precisely what I have been doing for the past three years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Already, reforms of port authorities have seen their work forces reduced by 35 per cent since 1989. However, again, these reforms have not been uniform across all ports, as indicated in the report. The Government's reforms have successfully created a more competitive and efficient stevedoring industry, with ongoing performance improvement and record low levels of industrial disputation. The focus is now moving more fully to the port authority sector and to improving the efficiency of the sea-land interface.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Justice has sought advice from the commissioner of the Australian Federal Police in respect of this issue. As a consequence of that advice, I am advised that the AFP has in fact been monitoring Japanese organised crime trends and activities for a number of years. I am also advised that the AFP has an excellent working relationship with the Japanese national police. There is high level liaison between the two agencies and, in fact, the AFP's assistant commissioner for investigations recently visited Tokyo for further discussions with relevant Japanese authorities. This sort of liaison has enhanced the AFP's understanding of the level of the threat to Australia of Japanese organised crime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been some success achieved by agencies, particularly the AFP, in the monitoring of this issue. In fact, in 1991 several alleged members of Japanese gangs were visiting Australia and were detected as violating immigration laws. They then admitted to having failed to declare their past criminal records and, as a consequence, underwent supervised departures from Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the immigration perspective, AFP's close liaison with authorities has enhanced our immigration controls in this area. There has been media speculation in recent days, particularly in Queensland. That speculation has named specific persons. I do not think it is appropriate for me in my capacity as Minister representing the police Minister to comment directly on much of that speculation. We do, of course, have a responsibility not to prejudice investigative methods and we also have a responsibility not to unduly violate individuals' privacy by unproven allegations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I will say, though, is that I have asked my department, the immigration department, to investigate the allegations as they affect immigration laws. I have asked for an urgent brief on that. I do know that the person involved holds a multiple visa. That visa, I am informed, was issued at a time when he had no criminal records. The last time he entered Australia was January 1992, on the advice I have.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for the Arts and Administrative Services. I refer the Minister to the sale by tender of the opalised skeleton of an ancient reptile, a plysoran, known colloquially as Eric, and presently located at the Australian Museum in Sydney. Mr Alex Ritchie of the Australian Museum is quoted in an advertisement in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> as saying that the skeleton is one of the most important scientific specimens of its kind ever discovered in Australia. He describes it as a national treasure. In view of the cultural importance of the fossil, I ask the Minister: has the museum notified his department of the intended sale? Will the Minister notify the museum that the Government considers that the permanent export of the fossil would significantly diminish the nation's cultural heritage and, as such, would be refused a permanent export permit?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This issue arises because the company that owns this particular exhibit is in provisional liquidation. Therefore, the receiver has called for sale by tender, which in the normal course he would, of this fossil as an asset of the company in provisional liquidation. But the concern is that a number of prominent experts are very concerned that this opalised skeleton is of such unique value that it should not be allowed to be exported. It comes before the Commonwealth Government, although it is in the custody of a New South Wales Government establishment, the Australian Museum, because of the Protection of Moveable Cultural Heritage Act. Anybody who purchases the fossil, if wishing to remove it from Australia, will have to apply to my department in accordance with that Act for a permit to export it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Government introduced that legislation to prevent the removal of significant cultural items from Australia, and I think it is important.

It is clearly something of significant commercial value also.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No application for export has been received by the department until now. If an application is received, the advice of expert examiners would be sought and that advice would be referred to the National Cultural Heritage Committee. Although no application has been received, because of the obvious and well-known significance of this particular fossil and the publicity surrounding it, which has drawn it to public attention, the department is already seeking advice from expert examiners appointed under the Act to ascertain whether they would be likely to recommend or refuse a permit, so that if any decision is made&mdash;because tenders for this sale close on Friday&mdash;we will be in a position to make a prompt decision in response to any application that might be made about the export of Eric.</PARA>

We simply do not spend enough on it.

Their credibility and their capacity on the ground to get close to the people in need and to know how best to provide that emergency relief to them are some of the things that make those organisations so invaluable. There should be nobody in this place who would object to the work done by St Vincent de Paul; to the work done by the Salvation Army, which I noticed in today's paper was launching its appeal with Mr Kennett; or the Brotherhood of St Laurence, to name just three of our major agencies.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to inform the Senate that the level of Australia's domestic aviation activity continued to increase significantly to new overall record levels for the March quarter. The news is also very good for Queensland. Activity in the March quarter 1993 was the highest on record for any March quarter to date, with 4.7 million passengers carried. This was boosted by the presence of Qantas carrying domestic passengers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The availability of seat capacity in the March quarter was also at record levels. On an annual basis the airlines carried over 18.3 million passengers in the year ended 31 March 1993. That is another record for a 12-month period ending in March. Given these record levels, the Department of Transport and Communications notes that the domestic market may well stabilise over the next few reporting periods.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was especially goods news for Queensland in these figures, with some significant increases compared with the March 1992 quarter results. Increased passenger movements in March 1993 compared with March 1992 were achieved at the following Queensland destinations: Cairns, an increase of 44 per cent; Proserpine, up 38 per cent; Townsville, up 33 per cent; Maroochydore, up 30 per cent; Mackay, up 17 per cent; Rockhampton, up 11 per cent; and Brisbane, up 11 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, if I might be parochial for a minute, I note that the March 1993 results compared with the March 1992 results also indicated very encouraging growth at Yulara, with an increase in traffic of 37 per cent, and at Alice Springs, with an increase of 13 per cent. These results are a clear demonstration that the Government's decision to deregulate domestic aviation has been a major contributor to the development of the many holiday destinations in Australia and the economic benefits which continue to flow from the tourism industry. I might add, with some satisfaction, that it is a policy which has no added GST.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins), in response to questions without notice asked by Senators Alston, O'Chee and Tambling this day, relating to the tendering process for subscription television licences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The answers given by Senator Collins today were a classic trifecta because he simply refused to answer each question he was asked. That goes a long way to explaining why every journalist who has examined this issue over the last two or three weeks has come to the unanimous conclusion that Senator Collins ought to go. They have reached that conclusion for the reason that he manifestly cannot handle the issues; he ducks and weaves; and, on almost every occasion, he says whatever suits him if he thinks it will get him off the hook. Today there were two instances in which Senator Collins made statements which were demonstrably untrue. In neither instance was he prepared to concede or to back down; he simply chose to tough it out. That is, I would have thought, a contempt of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth examining the answers given by Senator Collins because there is probably some greater significance to the reason for his behaviour than simply sheer pig-headedness or stupidity. The first question that Senator Collins was asked today related to the statement contained in his letter to the Secretary to the Department of Transport and Communications dated 11 May. That is four days after he received the letter from the secretary dated 7 May. So the Minister's reply was not dashed off on the spur of the moment. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you for your letter of 7 May in which you provided draft terms of reference for the inquiry into the Pay Television tender process following your discussions with Professor Pearce.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the discussions with Professor Pearce must have occurred prior to 7 May. Yet today the Minister told the Senate that Professor Pearce was first briefed on this matter on the morning of 8 May. In other words, Professor Pearce played no part in the drafting of the terms of reference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That fact is also dealt with very specifically by the answer Senator Collins gave to a question asked by Senator McKiernan in Question Time the other day about how the terms of reference came to be determined. Senator Collins talked about the terms of reference being settled between the secretary to the department and Professor Pearce. `Settled', of course, is not the appropriate term. They were simply presented to Professor Pearce as a fait accompli. More importantly, if that is true, Senator Collins clearly got it wrong when he said, `I did not draw up these terms of reference, Professor Pearce did'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Collins ought to acknowledge that that is clearly incorrect and at least have the grace to back down and apologise to the Senate for that statement. If he wants to say, for example, `Well, I said it in the heat of the moment. It was simply because of Senator Hill interjecting and I got it wrong. I did not really mean that. What I meant to say was that he was consulted or that he settled', that would be one thing. He was given the opportunity to say that today and he did not take it. Therefore, we are entitled to ask why it is that we have this obvious obtuseness on the part of the Minister to the point where he is deliberately trying to run an agenda. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the answer is that he is trying to invest Professor Pearce with some high degree of involvement in the drafting of the terms of reference to create the impression that this is somehow objective, somehow above a grubby little exercise of trying to divert attention from his own manifest lack of responsibility. He is trying to suggest that somehow Professor Pearce is the one who ought to be given the credit for these terms of reference. That is outrageous. The Minister ought to apologise to Professor Pearce for using or misusing him twice in the way that he has, and he ought to apologise to the Senate and explain that the statements that he made and that are on the record simply cannot stand up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know, for example, from today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>&mdash;and again Senator Collins did not take any opportunity to dispute it and merely confirmed it&mdash;that Professor Pearce was first approached on 8 May to head the pay TV inquiry. So how can it possibly be that the terms of reference drafted by the secretary on the seventh were, in any shape or form, discussed with Professor Pearce prior to their being provided to the Minister? One can look not only at that answer, but also at the Minister's clear determination to hide behind the coat-tails of the Federal Court and basically plead the last refuge of a failed law student, that is, that this matter is sub judice. Senator O'Chee made it clear that the evidence was proving beyond doubt that the only written advice provided and made available to Senator Collins was very much against the direction that he was moving in and the banning of the ABA from involvement in the process. He simply said to the court, `I did have other advice'. That other advice would seem to have been oral advice. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have read the transcript. Senator O'Chee read portions of the transcript today. His Honour, in due course, will stitch the Minister right up. It is obvious to all concerned that the only advice he had in writing told him not to do what he was determined to do. The reality is that he was not particularly keen on doing it, anyway. It was only as a result of a severe bout of arm twisting from the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) that both he and his department were dragged screaming to his agenda. We can understand his reluctance, but to somehow suggest, as I presume he must, that he talked Mr Doherty out of his written opinion so that he got him to the point where he had positive oral advice in favour of the Minister's actions is a manifest absurdity. Therefore, we have those two examples of Senator Collins simply refusing to provide any coherent explanation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Tambling can deal more precisely with the answer that he was given. The end result is that, after about two weeks, we still do not have a Minister prepared to accept responsibility, or to face up to the basic proposition, which is: why did the Minister not read that document before he signed it? Why is he engaged in this elaborate smokescreen of setting up a bureaucratic witch-hunt to divert attention from his own shortcomings?

He conceded last night that there was nothing in law or convention that entitled him to do what he did. It was simply his preferred course of action. In other words, he was in political damage control mode. He was frantically determined to avoid responsibility to this Senate. He is wanting to put the matter off as long as possible, to hand it over to Professor Pearce as an objective outsider. From the very outset, the Minister has been trying to pretend that these terms of reference are Professor Pearce's, not his. It is about time he faced up to where true responsibility in the matter lies.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today, in one of the answers which form the subject of this motion, Senator Collins carried on while not providing the appropriate information. Yesterday Senator Ferguson raised some very important issues that needed to be addressed. Yet Senator Collins says one thing in this place and another thing to the Northern Territory media. It is that issue to which I would like to refer. Yesterday when Senator Ferguson asked the question about what Senator Collins had read before he signed the documentation, Senator Collins made the statement that he always received a brief. Today when I requested information as to whether or not he had received a brief, I was told that I had to wait until the Pearce report was finalised and brought back to this chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a matter of Senator Collins saying one thing in this place, where he has full proper ministerial and parliamentary responsibility, and another thing in the electorate&mdash;currying favour with the electorate; I wonder why. I wish to refer to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Territorian </EMPHASIS>coverage of this TV fiasco&mdash;TV row issue&mdash;that was given good electorate coverage by a journalist in an opinion piece, obviously very sympathetic to Senator Collins. It is obvious from the article, because of the direct quotes of Senator Collins, that he had a hand in preparing that article by Mr John Loizou. The first quote was:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"I accept responsibility for the fact that the submission which should have been checked by my communications adviser was not because he was on leave," Senator Collins said.</PARA>
<PARA>A further quote was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"I didn't ensure that he was either recalled or replaced.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And I accept the responsibility for not taking a more interventionist role in the tender process myself.</PARA>
<PARA>He did not tell us anything like that here in the last few days. But he has given it to a journalist to put into a Northern Territory newspaper. In the article Mr Loizou says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The admittance by Senator Collins that he did not examine the terms of the tendering process prepared by his department for the granting of the licences has not helped.</PARA>
<PARA>This is a matter of real, extreme and major concern to this chamber. Senator Collins is prepared to say one thing to his journalist mate in the Northern Territory and withhold the same information from this chamber. He ought to have been just as open and honest with us in here. Obviously, not only is he prepared to say those sorts of things differently and exercise his ministerial responsibility differently, but also, again, he tends to camouflage and hide behind his staff. In the quote that I just read, he referred to the checking by his communications adviser. Further on in the article Senator Collins is directly quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">" But I've made arrangements with my principal private secretary to ensure that only if I'm on my death bed or the third world war arrives is such a situation to arise again.</PARA>
<PARA>Again, he does not have the fortitude, the intelligence or the strength to stand by his own decisions. He has put the onus back to his principal private secretary&mdash;to ensure that his staff has to hang around for this type of advice. This is very much a matter of the Minister passing the buck to others, as he continually seeks to do. Where is the doctrine of ministerial responsibility? He has obviously divorced himself from it.

Yet every time he is asked a question here, in the chamber where he is expected to answer, his response is always, `Well, I've set up an inquiry so you shouldn't ask me about those things'. That is a grave slight on this Senate. It shows, first and foremost, that Senator Collins lacks the respect and the decency to recognise that it is here in this chamber, amongst his colleagues and the elected representatives of the people, that he must answer for his manifest failures. That is Senator Collins's first grave mistake. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, we have a Minister who seems to have misled the Federal Court of Australia on two separate matters in sworn evidence. First, he told the Federal Court that he received legal advice from his department's senior legal adviser to the effect that he could rule out the MDS-pay TV option. Secondly, he told a judge of the Federal Court of Australia that he was doing it to preserve the intent of the legislation. When we read the legal advice that was provided to him by his department's senior legal adviser, what does it say?</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A direction not to grant MDS licences for subscription television broadcasting services seems to cut across the objectives of the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Collins is wrong again. The problem is that these clearly misleading statements that he made were made under oath in the Federal Court of Australia. He is a Minister of the Crown. As a Minister in this Government, he is expected to have a standard of decency and honesty that is elevated to a sufficient degree so that he will tell the truth. But unfortunately he will not do it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, we find the situation that Senator Tambling has shown the Senate today where Senator Collins has one standard for when he is in the electorate and another for when he is here.

Most of this expenditure was incurred through credit cards with purchases ranging from $12 to $1600. The ANAO considered that this type of expenditure would normally be of a private nature, and sought clarification from the branch office regarding the necessity and relevance of this expenditure to meet ATO activities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">20.4.119 The branch office investigated the cases referred by the ANAO and concluded that:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">`After considering explanations offered by the relevant officers, and bearing in mind the major culture change pressures at the time, the Deputy Commissioner has formed the view that no budget holder sought personal gain from any expenditure, nor had any improper intent, nor deliberately set out to breach the rules. On the contrary, we think that at worst there were instances of over-enthusiastic efforts to embrace the thrust of change and to lead staff into their new environment'.</PARA>
<PARA>I would like Senator McMullan to explain to me, as he refused to listen last night at the estimates committee, what is meant by the change of environment, the fact that there was no personal gain and the major cultural change pressures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Within the group of the one million unemployed around Australia there are very many unfortunate people who have had many social pressures on them after they or their spouses have lost their jobs. There have been various instances around Australia of social security fraud, entailing only amounts of a few hundred dollars or less in some cases, that have come to the notice of the social security department. People have certainly been fined, and in the bigger cases gaoled, for that offence, which is the very same offence that has been committed in this case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Do not tell me that there are no cultural and social pressures on people who cannot find a job or who have lost their jobs. Yet here we have well-paid officers of the Australian Taxation Office blaming social and cultural pressures. I can understand an officer paying $12-odd for a box of chocolates for someone, but I cannot see that riding lessons or dancing lessons are not a personal gain. If one gains knowledge, that is a personal gain. Whether or not one can ride a horse or dance has little to do with how to operate the tax office, so it must be a personal gain. The report went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ANAO was concerned that there was a lack of clear written instructions on hospitality expenditure, and that public monies had been spent with insufficient regard to the probity and propriety of such expenditure.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">  `. . . it has been decided that the thrust of our remedial action should be to move in the direction of clarifying current roles, expectations and authorities, and to endeavour to ensure that they remain clear in the future'.</PARA>
<PARA>These unfortunate people around Australia who have had to resort to a bit of petty thieving because of the position they are in and because of the impositions of the social security department have found no such sympathy. They have been dealt with by the courts, and justifiably so, and put into gaol, in most cases justifiably. Yet here we have a whitewash of the tax office. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This response incorporates the ANAO <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">recommendation</EMPHASIS> that clear guidelines should be issued, particularly with regard to working lunches and the purchase of goods and refreshments for ATO staff.</PARA>
<PARA>I wish Senator Walsh were in the chamber. Going back over the last 10 years, when he was Minister for Finance he pointed out the abuse of the free lunches, the free trips, the free accommodation that seemed to be available to the high-fliers of the business community in the roaring 198Os. As a Minister, through the Parliament and through his department, he put an end to those practices. But today the taxation office, which demands the highest standard of honesty of everyone in Australia, cannot apply that to itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I could go on and deal with other things, such as the lack of substantiation. For instance, there was a certain amount of property bought for which there were no original invoices. What happens when we file a tax return? We have self-assessment these days, which means that substantiation must be available if one is audited, and there are a few audits around. The tax office does not listen to excuses, so why should this Minister listen to these sorts of excuses from the tax office? The report goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There were some instances where proposals to spend public moneys under Finance Regulation 44A and/or Section 64 of the Constitution had been approved by officers in excess of their authorised limit.</PARA>
<PARA>Once again, there is a limit and an officer goes over it. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ATO advised that the responsibilities of officers with financial authorisations and delegations are being emphasised through the Managing in the Nineties training program.</PARA>
<PARA>Is that opportunity offered to some poor housewife who has been picked up for the petty thieving of a $3.50 lipstick when she goes to court? Sometimes the magistrate takes social pressures into consideration and dismisses the charges against these people as first offenders. But here we have officers of the Australian Taxation Office, who expect the highest standard of honesty from taxpayers, who are not willing to apply that standard to themselves. That is a total disgrace. I believe that in this case the Minister for Finance has an obligation to come clean about what has been going on, to have a thorough investigation of what happened, and to report back to Parliament on actions he has taken in relation to wrongdoers in the ATO. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus), in response to a question without notice asked by Senator Jones this day, relating to the entry into Australia of a person allegedly involved in organised crime.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Bolkus responded today to a question from Senator Jones following revelations in recent days. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS> of last weekend reported that one of the most powerful crime bosses in the world had purchased for $800,000 a unit on the Gold Coast. The person referred to was Mr Masaru Takumi, who is the second-in-charge of Japan's largest organised crime group, the Yamaguchi-Gumi. That Yakuza gang, the Yamaguchi-Gumi, is said to have 37,200 members. It rakes in more than $8 billion a year, mainly from extortion, prostitution, drugs, gambling, money laundering, protection rackets and fraud. Mr Takumi is not unknown in Australia. It is reported that he has visited Queensland five times&mdash;twice in 1987, twice in 1988 and once last year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This matter was brought to the Senate initially by my colleague the honourable member for Moncrieff, Mrs Sullivan, whose electorate encompasses the Gold Coast, where the purchase took place. She asked the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) a question about this on Monday of this week and made a very interesting and important speech on the matter in debate in the House of Representatives on Monday night. I refer the Senate to that important speech by Mrs Sullivan, which appears on page 477 of Monday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. I will not go into all the details and repeat the facts she outlined there, but she raised the question: how is it that a person such as Mr Takumi, one of the known crime bosses of the world, can apparently visit Australia at will and outlay hundreds of thousands of dollars on purchasing residential property in Australia? In the answer Senator Bolkus gave today to Senator Jones about this matter&mdash;and I thank the Minister for his answer&mdash;he raised more questions than he answered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Bolkus talked about the fact that for years now the Australian Federal Police has been monitoring the entry into Australia of organised criminals and organised crime&mdash;including from Japan but from many other countries as well. He said that the AFP has a good link and liaison with the Japanese police and that, as a result of that, in 1991 some of the members of these crime gangs were identified and deported. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the person at issue in my comments today, Mr Takumi&mdash;although my comments do have wider application&mdash;Senator Bolkus said that Mr Takumi was entering Australia on a multiple visa which had been issued before he had a criminal record. That is a very interesting point. One does not get to be No. 2 boss of pretty well the largest criminal organisation in the world overnight. Obviously that is a situation that has built up over a period of time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am told that until recently people in Japan who had been convicted of criminal activities and had served their term had their conviction expunged from the public record. Once they had done their time, there was no further record of it. To talk about criminal records of Japanese individuals can therefore be misleading, as Mrs Sullivan pointed out earlier in the week, because there may be information beyond that which now appears on the public record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that Minister Bolkus will give the Parliament more information about this matter because the present situation raises more questions than those he answered today. For example, what sort of multiple visa does Mr Takumi hold? Is it a tourist visa? Is it a visitors visa? Is it a business visa? If it is a business visa, given that his past activities are now known to the authorities in Australia, including the AFP, what sort of business is he carrying on? Above all else, why is it that that visa has not been cancelled, and was not cancelled when his activities and his criminal background were first discovered? That must be some time ago, given his very senior role in the crime organisation of which he is No. 2 at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a lot of questions in this connection regarding immigration that need to be answered in this matter. I will not go into them in any further detail at this stage. I hope the Minister will respond at an appropriate&mdash;and very early&mdash;time because it is a matter of urgency. We know now about Mr Takumi, but how many other Mr Takumis are out there doing the same thing, entering Australia seemingly at will? What is the scope now for organised crime from other countries to enter Australia seemingly unhindered?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other issue that I find quite staggering is how a person with that record is allowed to purchase residential property in Australia when under our administration and policy all applications for the purchase of residential property are required to go to and be vetted by the Foreign Investment Review Board. What is the relationship between the AFP's knowledge of matters and criminals such as these and the Foreign Investment Review Board? What is the knowledge of the immigration department about these persons? Is there any arrangement whereby the Foreign Investment Review Board automatically checks out these people, at least in a standardised way, with our law enforcement and other agencies?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that most Australians would find it extraordinary to discover that it is possible for a major foreign criminal to buy property in this country seemingly with impunity. I repeat that the Australian Federal Police is well aware&mdash;and has been for some time&mdash;of Mr Takumi's background and interests. I will not take up any more of the Senate's time. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley), in response to a question without notice asked by Senator Vanstone this day, relating to a High Court judgment and alleged bias against women by the judiciary.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Crowley was asked what view her Government had with respect to the outcome in Longman's case and whether her Government was happy or unhappy with the degree to which it was being followed or not followed. Ordinarily one would not expect any honourable senator in this chamber to be full bottle on every case in the community; it simply would not be possible. But that is not the situation Senator Crowley found herself in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I recall, Senator Crowley first raised the matter of gender bias in the judiciary in October of last year in this place. She did so by quite specifically raising some remarks made by a South Australian Supreme Court judge, Justice Bollen. Clearly she was unhappy with those remarks, she believed that they were inappropriate and that something should be done about it. Nothing was done about it for a while. As I understand it, it was in January sometime that the Director of Public Prosecutions in South Australia referred certain matters within Justice Bollen's summing-up to the Full Court of the Supreme Court for a ruling. Justice Bollen, in effect, lost on each of those matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Crowley then made some remarks about gender bias in the law and she has made remarks since then in this place, and on radio here, there and everywhere, before, during and after the election. So on that subject we would expect her to know something, especially since she and her Government purport to have thought about this matter seriously enough to come up with what they say is the best way of alleviating this problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The suggestion the Government has come up with is some funding to the Australian Institute of Judicial Administration for that institute to develop some gender bias curricula and to offer courses on a voluntary basis to the judiciary. So some attention has been given to this matter. One would expect, therefore, that not only the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women, who has had so much to say about this matter, but the Government&mdash;the Public Service, for example&mdash;would be familiar with what the High Court says judges can and cannot say when summing up in sexual offence matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This development in the law is not something new; it is not something that happened last year. Senator Crowley was not caught on the hop by something that happened in December or February and she did not know about it. This High Court case was decided in 1989. Anyone who was seriously interested in the substance of the matter&mdash;that is, gender bias reflected in judicial remarks&mdash;would have been looking at the extent to which that case was being followed or not followed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite clearly, when I asked Senator Crowley about Longman's case I might as well have asked her whether she knew how to walk to the moon in a day. She did not have a clue; she did not have even the vaguest idea about the subject matter. Worse still, when a supplementary question was asked to give her a hint about the subject matter, she still did not have any idea what the High Court might or might not have said about those things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a Minister coming into this place and making remarks about the adequacy or otherwise of what judges say and about what judges ought to learn and ought not learn. However, she clearly has not even bothered to make any assessment about what judges can and cannot say in these matters. She has not given the slightest bit of attention to the question of whether the High Court decision on this matter is being followed by the lower courts. My understanding is that an unfortunately large proportion of the judiciary takes no notice, or insufficient notice, of Longman's case, and that is the problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If it wanted to, the Government could raise this problem publicly via debates in this place. The Government could say, `The High Court says that blah, blah and blah ought to happen; clearly this is not being followed'. The Government could say that it is concerned about this matter. It could look to asking, for example, the attorneys-general of the relevant States to change the law. So it is not as if it is impossible to do anything substantive about this problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's idea of funding the AIJA is not the only idea around in this area. I have prepared a brief for the Minister, since she clearly speaks only on her briefs. I look forward to her assessment in later ministerial life, however short that might be, on whether she wants to comment only on matters on which she is briefed or whether she will be like Senator Collins, who says that he does not need to look at his briefs, that he wants to keep his distance from them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Crowley is not here, for the benefit of other senators who may be interested in this matter let me take up a few more minutes to outline what the High Court has said about this matter, because it is a serious problem affecting a large number of people in the community. To the extent that there is a perception of gender bias in the judiciary, it is a problem for all of us. It is something we should all be interested in and watch as the problem slowly but surely is eradicated.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would not say it is my learned view; it is my view, though. In a number of States it used to be the case, and it still is in some States, that a judge in summing up a case involving a victim of a sexual offence was required to warn the jury of the dangers of relying on the alleged victim's uncorroborated evidence. For years and years, alleged victims of sexual offences thought the need to have their evidence corroborated more than that of anyone else was a bit rough. The picture generated by this rule basically was that one could not trust women who make allegations that a sexual offence has been perpetrated against them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some States have had the foresight to change the situation and say that they no longer regard victims of sexual offences as being so unreliable that a warning must be given about them. Why is a warning not given in the case of the evidence of a victim of a bank robbery, if that witness happened to be the only person behind the counter? Why is a warning not given about such evidence? Why is not a warning given about everyone else who gives uncorroborated evidence? Why are victims of sexual offences treated differently from victims who give uncorroborated evidence in other cases involving only two people?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">South Australia, Western Australia, New South Wales and Victoria have changed that requirement, and I am grateful that they have done so. They now say that if a judge thinks it is appropriate to warn about a particular witness and the particular circumstances of a particular case, the judge is obviously free to do so. But, in effect, they have taken away the requirement to warn. So in those States judges do not have to give a warning about the need for corroboration of the evidence of alleged victims of sexual offences&mdash;and that is a good thing&mdash;but they are free to do so if they believe that that is appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The High Court had a serious look at this matter in 1989 and it said&mdash;I think this is correct, and in fact I am sure it is correct; I give that caveat for the benefit of Senator Cook, who seems doubtful that I would know anything about this matter&mdash;that in circumstances where parliament no longer considers victims of sexual offences to be so unreliable that a warning must be given about their evidence, judges can give a warning but only in respect of the particular case.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In deference to my colleague Senator Crowley, something should be said about the remarks that have just been made. We are dealing here with a sensitive and important issue in terms of Australian justice and in terms of the perception of gender bias in Australian courts. In the most recent speech we have heard on this subject, an aura of principle was used to cloak a snide political point. Senator Crowley was asked a particular narrow, technical question to which she did not respond. From that point on the issue was raised in order to get a horse laugh from the Opposition, and perhaps the wider community, at Senator Crowley's expense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a serious issue and not one that we ought to be exploiting for the purposes of what gallery tittle-tattle we can generate. I remember just recently a Victorian judge said in a sexual offence trial that when women say no they often mean yes which, taken in the broader context, is approval to proceed in circumstances of sexual harassment. In a recent South Australian case, a judge opined that it was permissible to hand out a bit of rough treatment in the matrimonial arrangement between a husband and a wife. These are just a couple of notorious examples in the public debate of where the judiciary has expressed views well and truly out of step with what is reasonable, fair and objective&mdash;views that have a tone of misogynism about them and views which ought to be taken as entirely inappropriate for people on a bench making judicial judgments about human conduct on matters sexual. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Crowley for her part, and this Government for its part, believe that something ought to be done about that. I would have thought that is an unexceptional and quite appropriate thing for a government to say. </PARA>

The effort of the Opposition is to undermine the best intentions and good efforts of the Minster&mdash;who in this case is Senator Crowley, the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women&mdash;to try to change a misogynist perception in some of the judiciary in Australia, so that women who are victims of sexual offences and have those sexual offences before the courts can be properly treated. I would have thought there would be unity in this chamber in helping Senator Crowley to achieve that instead of trying to undermine her efforts by, at her expense, making a simple, narrow, technical foray in order to get a horse laugh.</PARA></TALK.START>

The extent to which I believe I have been misrepresented by Senator Cook is that he has purported to say to the chamber that my remarks today are such as to undermine any bipartisan effort and to undermine Senator Crowley. That is not the purpose of the remarks, and I think it misrepresents me to say that my remarks are in that context.

I would be showing gender bias, for instance, if I described Senator Vanstone as `der frau' rather than `die frau'. Gender is not appropriately applied to Senator Vanstone as a woman; she is of the female sex, not of the female gender.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me speak to the paper. The Minister is anxious for me to draw out a number of points that have been made by NBEET. The Higher Education Council has pointed out that the channels by which students may enter higher education are changing rapidly. In particular, credit transfer arrangements are being improved. However, it is pointless for institutions to develop extensive transfer arrangements only to find that there are not sufficient places because of overcrowding. The Prime Minister's engineered recession has forced the higher education sector to hide more than 30 per cent of the unemployed youth in our higher education institutions. This is making entry to universities through other methods, such as credit transfer, very difficult. The report points out that there has been a shift from undergraduate to postgraduate studies. This is causing concern because of the reduction in opportunities for school leavers and other commencing students.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Higher Education Council also looks in this report at the growth of open learning programs. The council notes that the Government has announced that fees for students enrolled in programs are broadly compatible with higher education contribution charges that would apply to the same studies on campus. At this point the council fails to point out that the federal funding for the open learning program ceases after three years and that the open learning program is supposed to be self-sufficient. The Government is, therefore, proposing that the open learning program can be provided at a cost per student equivalent to the HECS charges. This is clearly absurd, and it is an issue which the Government urgently needs to address. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA>The report by the National Board of Employment, Education and Training on the Australian Research Council's evaluation program in relation to grants for ecological research is an important one because increasingly people are recognising the importance of ecological research if we are really going to be effective in moving towards a pattern of ecologically sustainable development. The report notes that Australian ecologists are at the centre stage of world research and that in this country's universities we have many people of very high repute doing absolutely excellent work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the level of support which is given to those people and, indeed, to much scientific research in Australia is totally inadequate. The report notes that only 20 per cent of applicants for ARC grants were successful and some 80 per cent of grant applicants failed to get grants. While some of those grant applications may have been of poor quality, undoubtedly among that 80 per cent would have been many applicants of quite high quality who would have failed to get a grant because the amount of government support is totally inadequate. Indeed, under `Principal Findings', the committee also reports that its members were puzzled by apparently arbitrary and sizeable cuts in seemingly reasonable requests. It may well be that in many of those requests the arbitrary cuts meant that the work was inadequately performed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report also says that, by comparison with equivalent Canadian, British and American funding bodies, the ARC funding for top ecological research would have to be regarded as niggardly. So while Australia, at least in terms of rhetoric, has taken some lead in relation to ecologically sustainable development, the research which is necessary to underpin that move and which will have to be extended over the next several decades is, according to this report, niggardly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report also goes on to note that the great majority of successful applicants expressed dissatisfaction with the level of funding. So while the work which was being done within that 20 per cent was of high quality, nonetheless those people felt constrained by the shortage of funds. They also felt very constrained by the need to supplement their niggardly funds from government sources with additional funds from private sources. This bears on a matter which I raised with Senator Button some time ago by way of a question in relation to the requirement for CSIRO to obtain 30 per cent of its funds from private sources. Senators may recall that the substance of my question was how much time was spent by researchers applying for, and writing reports in relation to, grants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Button pointed out that some 20 to 25 per cent of scientists' time was now being spent on applying for and reporting back to grantors on grants. In his answer to my question he said that he thought that was a good thing because it helped to set the direction of the research. While that may be true&mdash;it may be advantageous with respect to some research in the narrow industrial area&mdash;I believe that in the ecological area it is extremely dangerous because much of what ecologists will be researching is likely to be seen initially as inimical to the interests of industry. Under these circumstances they will find it even harder to get money from private sources. Indeed, that is referred to in this report. Given that circumstance, the type of research which they can take on board, the more fundamental type of research, the research which perhaps is going to be critical of some aspects of industry, is not likely to attract funding. The work of ecologists will be even further inhibited. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> That matter was raised yesterday by Professor Ian Lowe in a lecture at CSIRO. I believe there is a great deal of concern throughout the scientific community about the direction which this Government has taken with respect to that requirement for private funding for ecological research as well as research of a more general nature. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL 1993</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill was originally introduced as the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.7) 1992, but lapsed with the calling of the election. The major change to the bill as previously introduced is to include a transitional measure for one of the proposed amendments to the capital gains provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will amend the taxation laws in a number of respects.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It includes an amendment to the existing law to provide specifically for the assessability and deductibility of payments made in respect of accrued leave entitlements by one employer to another at the time an employee transfers to a new employer. This measure will operate where payments made are to facilitate the transfer of the employee pursuant to, or to accommodate the implementation of, an industrial award. Such payments will be called accrued leave transfer payments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill proposes a number of amendments to the provisions relating to the taxation of capital gains and losses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also contains measures to synchronise the capital gains tax and plant depreciation treatment of terminations of Crown leases. These measures were foreshadowed in the Explanatory Memorandum to the depreciation Crown lease amendments contained in Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Several technical amendments are to be made to various capital allowance provisions and to anti-avoidance rules relating to those provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will make two changes to depreciation cost price limit rules for luxury motor cars. One will exclude certain motor cars from the limit. The other will remove an anomaly under which some taxpayers gain earlier access to an indexed limit than others.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act proposed by the Bill relate to dividend streaming arrangements, PAYE, and the gift provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also includes minor amendments to fringe benefits tax provisions and the Taxation Administration Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I turn now to a more detailed discussion of these measures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Assessability and deductibility of accrued leave transfer payments</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In general, employees accrue leave entitlements based only on the period of employment with their current employer. However, in some industries, such as the waterfront industry, employees are likely to change employers so often that they could never take leave, but rather would be paid out the value of leave entitlements each time they transfer to a different employer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In those industries, leave entitlements under the terms of an industrial agreement or award may be based on total service with a number of employers. Accordingly, employers may be required, or may as a matter of commercial reality decide, to pay one another on account of a transferring employee's accrued leave entitlements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the existing law, an employer is not entitled to a deduction for a payment made in respect of leave entitlements that have accrued to an employee during the course of his or her employment with that employer unless it is made directly to the employee or, if the employee is dead, to a dependant or personal representative of the employee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consequently, if a payment in respect of an employee's accrued leave entitlements is made by one employer to another upon the transfer of the employee, no tax deduction is available to the employer who makes the payment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This amendment will allow the employer who makes the payment to claim a deduction for the amount of that payment. The amendment also will ensure that the amount of the payment will be assessable income of the employer who receives the payment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment is intended to facilitate structural reforms such as flexible employment practices, specifically where there are industry practices for the transfer of employment pursuant to, or to accommodate the implementation of, an industrial award.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment is not likely to have any effect on the revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Capital Gains Tax</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill proposes a general anti-avoidance provision relating to the transfer of assets within company groups to which a CGT roll-over applies. The current CGT group roll-over anti-avoidance provisions will be repealed as a consequence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new anti-avoidance provision will deem the disposal and re-acquisition of an asset which has been rolled-over within a company group if the company holding the asset ceases to remain part of the group in respect of which the roll-over was available. This will occur where, for example, the company is sold outside the group.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A new transitional provision will have the effect that the current CGT group roll-over anti-avoidance provisions will not apply after 16 December 1992 in circumstances where the new general anti-avoidance provision would not apply.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consequential amendments will be made to the capital gains record keeping requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also proposes an amendment which will ensure that the capital gains provisions do not apply inappropriately to tax an amount, or part of an amount, which is concessionally taxed under another provision of the Act. This amendment will apply where the effect of that other provision is that all or part of the amount is not included in a person's assessable income.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A further amendment will ensure that a taxpayer holding a statutory licence which is cancelled by the issuing authority for no consideration will not be deemed to have received the amount that would have been the market value of the licence prior to its cancellation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Technical amendments are also proposed to the provisions relating to the principal residence exemption and the transfer of capital losses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments to the CGT provisions are not expected to have any significant impact on revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Capital Gains Tax&mdash;Depreciable Property Installed On Crown Leases</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further amendments to the capital gains tax provisions are to be made so that disposals of interests in plant installed on Crown leases of land are treated consistently with their treatment under the depreciation Crown lease provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This amendment will prevent capital gains or losses from accruing in respect of plant installed on a Crown lease where a lease is terminated but the lessee retains an interest in the plant. It will also prevent capital losses from accruing in respect of plant installed on a Crown lease where the lease is terminated and an associate of the lessee obtains an interest in the plant.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These changes will apply to relevant disposals occurring after 26 February 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of the amendments is to prevent anomalous results and there is no direct impact on the revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Technical Amendments To Capital Allowances</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Five technical amendments are to be made in relation to provisions dealing with deductions for the capital cost of income-producing property.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first amendment relates to the broadbanding of depreciation rates for plant acquired before 27 February 1992. The amendment will make it clear that rates of depreciation determined on effective life that match a broadbanded rate cannot be increased to the next highest broadbanded rate. The amendment will apply from the same time as the broadbanding measures; that is, in relation to the 1991/92 and subsequent years of income.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second will amend the plant depreciation Crown lease provisions in relation to disposals of pre-27 February 1992 plant, for which deductions have been allowed under the prime cost method, to prevent balancing loss deductions for that portion of the cost of plant notionally depreciated before 27 February 1992. It will also ensure that tax is imposed on the recoupment of previously allowed deductions. The amendment will apply to disposals occurring after 26 February 1992, the date from which the Crown lease provisions applied.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A third amendment will replace an existing option taxpayers have to adopt annually a lesser rate of depreciation for an asset with a once-only option to adopt a lesser rate of depreciation that is not less than that based on effective life. This new option rule will apply in relation to current and subsequent years of income.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Next, to correct an oversight, the petroleum mining rollover relief provisions are to be amended so that they apply, as appropriate, to pre-18 September 1974 expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The final amendment in this series relates to anti-avoidance rules applicable to arrangements involving the use of property by tax-exempt bodies and the like. The amendment will make it certain that those rules can apply to arrangements where a person is entitled to deductions under a capital allowance provision in relation to property which they do not own. The amendment will apply to relevant arrangements entered into after today.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These technical amendments are unlikely to have a significant effect on the revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Depreciation Cost Price Limit Rules</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Two changes are to be made to depreciation cost price limit rules for motor cars. One will exempt motor cars specially fitted out for the carriage of disabled persons seated in wheelchairs from the limit. The cost of this concession is estimated to peak in 7 years at about $1M per annum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The other change is to remove a distortion arising from the annual indexation of the limit. At present, the limit is indexed in relation to each year of income. Taxpayers whose year of income commences earlier than others' can obtain an advantage from earlier access to a new limit. This second change is expected to be revenue neutral.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both measures apply to motor cars acquired after today.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Dividend Streaming Arrangements</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I announce, today, amendments to the dividend streaming provisions of the income tax law which will ensure their consistent application.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments contained in the Bill will ensure that dividend streaming arrangements using an interposed entity between shareholders and companies carrying out the arrangement are subject to the provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Arrangements using an interposed entity are otherwise the same as arrangements already subject to the provisions in that they seek to stream franked dividends to those shareholders able to benefit most from the imputation credits attached to those dividends.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment will apply to dividends paid under these arrangements on or after the date of Royal Assent of the Bill and will prevent the loss of unquantifiable amounts of revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Pay-as-you-earn or the PAYE provisions</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will also amend the PAYE provisions in the income tax law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, the definition of salary or wages will be expanded to include training allowances paid to participants in the Landcare and Environment Action Program and remuneration and allowances paid to members of an eligible local governing body.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Second, the current arrangements for variations of PAYE tax instalment deductions will be modified so that an employee with more than one employer may obtain a single variation in the amount of deductions to be made from his or her salary or wages.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Gifts</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill will amend the gift provisions of the income tax laws to give effect to the Treasurer's announcement of 25 November 1992. The announcement allows gifts of the value of $2 or more made to the Shrine and Remembrance Restoration and Development Trust to qualify as an income tax deduction if made on or after 25 November 1992 and on or before 30 June 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This measure is to assist with the restoration of the Shrine as it is in a serious state of disrepair and needs urgent attention to avoid further deterioration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The impact of the amendment on revenue is not expected to be significant.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Fringe Benefits Tax</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill will amend the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986 to correct a technical error and to reflect a change in the name of the Commonwealth Savings Bank of Australia to the Commonwealth Bank of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Access to Taxation information by the Queensland Criminal Justice Commission</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also proposes to amend the Taxation Administration Act 1953 to include the Queensland Criminal Justice Commission within the definition of law enforcement agency for the purpose of gaining access to taxation information.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I present the Explanatory Memorandum which contains more detailed explanations of the provisions of the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the Bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT (SUPERANNUATION) BILL 1993</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Taxation Laws Amendment (Superannuation) Act 1992 implemented many of the measures outlined in the Treasurer's `Security in Retirement' statement of 30 June 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Those measures introduce changes to both the voluntary and compulsory tiers of the Government's superannuation policies; changes which are designed to make the Government's policies fairer, simpler and more efficient.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill now before you, which is largely the same as Taxation Laws Amendment (Superannuation) Bill (No 2) 1992, will introduce two of the remaining measures outlined in that Statement; the treatment of death benefits and excessive components.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also gives effect to the Treasurer's announcement of 4 September 1992 relating to the tax exemption available to continuously complying fixed interest approved deposit funds (ADFs).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other amendments contained in the Bill change the notice requirements relating to personal superannuation contributions and rectify some technical difficulties relating to the tax treatment of allocated annuities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, the Bill will make some changes to the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act 1987 (OSS Act) which are consistent with current policy and to the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992 to allow a superannuation scheme which is not a defined benefit scheme to be treated as a defined benefit scheme for the purposes of the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Taxation Laws Amendment (Superannuation) Bill (No 2) 1992, which was introduced on 16 December 1992 but lapsed on the dissolution of Parliament in February, proposed amendments to the OSS Act and to the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 to allow ADFs to provide allocated pensions. That proposal is not included in the current Bill but will be considered in the development of Superannuation Savings Accounts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I turn now to a more detailed discussion of the measures in the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Death Benefits</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill introduces amendments to assess lump sum superannuation benefits received by a person, on the death of another person, against the deceased's pension reasonable benefit limits (RBLs). The purpose of these amendments is to reduce the scope for estate planning and to ensure the retirement plans of non-dependants are not disrupted by a bequest of a superannuation benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also changes the taxation treatment of death benefit eligible termination payments (ETPs). Under the current arrangements the tax treatment of a death benefit varies considerably, depending upon the source of the benefit and whether it is received direct or through the deceased's estate. The new arrangements are both simpler and more equitable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If a death benefit ETP is within the deceased's pension RBLs and is paid to a dependant of the deceased the benefit will be exempt from tax. If the benefit is paid to a non-dependant the ETP will be broken into its ordinary components. However, the post-June 1983 component of the benefit will be taxed at a maximum rate of 15% (plus medicare levy) if paid from a taxed source and 30% (plus medicare levy) if paid from an untaxed source.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Benefits in excess of the deceased's RBL entitlement will be taxed as an excessive component of an ETP whether paid to a dependant or a non-dependant of the deceased.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These measures will apply from 1 July 1994 and are not expected to have any revenue implications.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Excessive Component</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At present, under the Income Tax Rates Act 1986, the excessive component of an ETP is taxed at the taxpayer's marginal rates of tax. In line with the Treasurer's Statement, the Bill will amend that Act to ensure that the excessive component of an ETP (ie. the amount in excess of the RBL) is taxed at the top marginal rate of tax (currently 47%) plus medicare levy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These amendments will apply from 1 July 1994. This measure, combined with the measures relating to limits on deductions for superannuation contributions and RBLs, is expected to increase revenue by $20 million in 1995-96.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Notice Requirements</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will amend the notice requirements relating to the tax treatment of personal superannuation contributions. Under the existing arrangements superannuation funds must treat all personal superannuation contributions as taxable contributions unless they are notified that the member is not going to claim a tax deduction for their contribution.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As most personal superannuation contributions do not qualify for a deduction, the Bill proposes that personal superannuation contributions will not be treated as taxable contributions by a superannuation fund unless the fund has received a notice from the member stating that they are intending to claim a deduction for their contributions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consequently, taxpayers will be eligible for a deduction for personal superannuation contributions to a complying superannuation fund only if they give a notice to the fund advising the fund that they are intending to claim a tax deduction for their contributions and receive an acknowledgment of the notice from the fund.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These new arrangements have been actively sought by the superannuation industry because they substantially reduce the administrative burden on superannuation funds.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These amendments will apply to contributions made to a fund on or after 1 July 1992, other than contributions made by a person who has ceased to be a member of the fund before the date of Royal Assent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These measures are not expected to have any revenue implications.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Continuously Complying Fixed Interest ADFs</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will make a technical amendment in relation to continuously complying fixed interest ADFs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Continuously complying fixed interest ADFs are exempt from tax on income that is referable to certain deposits held in ADFs as at 25 May 1988 when the tax arrangements applying to superannuation funds and ADFs were announced. The exemption applies only if an ADF receives at least 90% of its investment income as interest or from amounts received in respect of the disposal of long term securities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given that the disposal of securities is a normal activity of these investment bodies, the Bill will allow ADFs to take into account profits on the disposal of securities to determine whether they qualify as continuously complying fixed interest ADFs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This measure will apply from 1 July 1988 as it is broadly consistent with the original policy intention of exempting continuously complying fixed interest ADFs. The measure is not expected to have any revenue implications.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Allocated Annuities</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will make some technical amendments to ensure that the income derived by an annuity provider in respect of an allocated annuity is exempt from tax and that allocated annuities are not qualifying securities for taxation purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments will apply from 22 December 1992, when allocated annuities became acceptable products for ETP purposes, and are not expected to have any revenue implications.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Occupational Superannuation Standards Act</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill makes some changes to the OSS Act which are consistent with current policy. Very briefly, the changes to the OSS Act are to put appropriate rules on the number of employer sponsors that have to be notified for superannuation guarantee purposes if there is a breach of the OSS Act, formalise the arrangements under which the ISC can release information to the public, make some minor changes to the information that the ISC can release about superannuation funds used for superannuation guarantee purposes, provide the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner with discretionary powers to deal with prospectus requirements for superannuation funds, make it easier for retired persons to select the pension provider of their choice, and extend the exemption from reporting ETPs of small value for reasonable benefit limit purposes to all payers of ETPs other than ADFs and deferred annuity funds.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, the Bill will amend the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act to allow the trustee of a superannuation scheme which is not a defined benefit superannuation scheme to elect that the scheme be treated as a defined benefit superannuation scheme for the purposes of the Act. This will enable employers, when measuring the level of employer support in such a scheme, to take account of reserves or surpluses which are used to provide benefits to members. The amendments will not have any revenue effect.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Full details of the amendments are contained in the Explanatory Memorandum being circulated to Honourable members.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Acting Deputy President, I commend the Bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">BANKRUPTCY AMENDMENT BILL 1993</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bankruptcy Amendment Bill 1993 proposes amendment to a provision of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 which is a small but significant feature of the compulsory income contribution regime provided for in the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bankruptcy Act enables a trustee to make an assessment of the income a bankrupt is likely to derive during the period of bankruptcy and where the income is assessed as being above a specified threshold, the bankrupt is liable to make contributions from his or her income of 50 cents in each dollar above that threshold. Section 139ZG of the Act enables a trustee to file a certificate in a court of competent jurisdiction in respect of amounts of contribution which a bankrupt has refused or failed to pay. The Act provides that such a certificate operates and is enforceable as if it were a final judgment of the Court in which it is filed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are proceedings currently on foot in the High Court of Australia which challenge the validity of subsections 139ZG(3), (4) and (5) on the basis that because a bankruptcy trustee's certificate is given the status of a judgment of the court in which it is filed, the provisions enable a person who is not a judge or holder of other judicial office to exercise the judicial power of the Commonwealth, contrary to Chapter III of the Constitution. The Government has been advised that there is a significant likelihood of the provisions being declared to be invalid. The case is scheduled for hearing before the Court on 7 June 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is concerned that there should be adequate means of enforcing the obligations of bankrupts to make contributions from income to their estates. This Bill proposes the substitution of the impugned procedure with new provisions which give the trustee a right to take action in the courts against a bankrupt who has refused or failed to pay income contributions to the estate. The trustee will be able to file a certificate in relation to any proceedings for the recovery of such debts stating the nature of the debt and the amount owed, and the certificate will be prima facie evidence of those matters. The Government has been advised that the revised provisions could not be considered to trespass upon the judicial power of the Commonwealth, since the trustee will be required to initiate court proceedings to recover amounts of unpaid income contribution from a bankrupt.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government moved decisively in 1991 to tighten up bankruptcy law in response to community concern that certain high flying bankrupts were avoiding their responsibilities to creditors. This was done by introducing a compulsory income contribution regime specifically designed to prevent persons from diverting income at source to associated entities and putting it beyond the reach of creditors. The present High Court challenge was initiated by one of the persons whose activities gave rise to the community concern to which I have referred. The Government is determined that the integrity of the important reforms it has made in the bankruptcy area be maintained, and it brings forward this Bill in order to achieve this.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the Bill to the Senate and present the Explanatory Memorandum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">DAIRY PRODUCE AMENDMENT BILL 1993</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this Bill is to introduce amendments to the Dairy Produce Act 1986. The amendments will provide greater commercial flexibility to the Australian Dairy Corporation allowing it to save on costs and to implement a risk management program enhanced by specific reference to its capacity to undertake hedging operations through banks.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the dairy industry is an important and strong sector in the Australian economy. Its recent performance has been very encouraging. Milk production has been increasing for the last decade and production this year of 7 200 million litres is expected to be similar to the peak of the early 1970's.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Honourable Senators will be aware that this Government has been working closely with the dairy industry to improve the competitiveness, efficiency and profitability of the industry. We have worked to broaden its focus towards the export market, adopt best international business practices, improve industry integration and provide well targeted research and development. I believe the industry has made some commendable improvements and I expect it will continue to adapt, compete successfully and bring much needed export earnings to Australia. The industry should be proud that its export earning in 1992-93 are forecast to be over $1 billion for the first time. This is a rise of about 32% from the previous year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Supporting the industry's pursuit of market expansion and development has been substantial technical improvement in dairy production and manufacturing. Dairy farmers are realising the benefits of these changes and, unlike many other rural industries, have a relatively sound financial outlook. The most recent ABARE survey indicates a healthy average farm cash income of $51 000 for 1992-93.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To further encourage progress and development in the Australian industry the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy introduced a new dairy plan from 1 July 1992. The plan set the direction for the industry until the year 2000. A key element of this approach was the establishment of the Dairy Marketing Review Task Force. The Task Force has been charged with the responsibility of developing an industry-driven strategy aimed at redirecting the industry's effort to further enhance the export marketing and development of dairy products.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy received the Task Force's interim report at the end of last year and the final report should be submitted in the near future. The Task Force has consulted widely with dairy manufacturers and exporters to ensure that the Review recommendations will be realistic and achievable. I am confident that the Task Force will identify a forward looking and progressive marketing strategy, giving due consideration to the structure of the industry, which will lead the industry through the remainder of this decade and into the next century.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When the Review is completed, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy will evaluate its recommendations carefully.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, as I have said, the primary purpose of these amendments is to improve the Corporation's financial operations in relation to banking and foreign exchange. The effect of these amendments is that the Corporation should not be inhibited from normal commercial dealings with the banks. Removing the impediments which have been identified will result in reduced costs for both the Corporation and the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments specifically empower the Corporation to undertake futures dealings with banks. The Corporation's futures trading will be limited to hedging. These powers are similar to those previously given to other marketing authorities such as the Wool Realisation Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments will remove uncertainty concerning the ability of the Corporation to secure exchange rates and cover the financial risks involved in international trade. Of prime importance in this area is the trade in cheese to Japan. This is a market in which Australian product has been performing very well. This trade is expected to amount to over $100 million this financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another important amendment will improve existing banking arrangements. The Corporation can now consolidate funds and avoid banking charges and management expenses associated with separate accounts. The savings resulting from this change are estimated to total $40 000 in a year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Reducing the number of bank accounts has not diminished the responsibility of the Corporation to clearly report the sources and uses of funds. There is no abrogation of accounting and management responsibility.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has been an interesting debate on the question of how long speeches during second reading debates should take. I have listened to the entreaties of the members of the Opposition who, throughout this debate, have said that I, for one, speak at far too great a length in the Senate chamber. I have really taken that on board and I do not intend to prolong the agony on this issue this afternoon.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will make a couple of points relating to this matter. I believe that when this sessional order was introduced at the end of last session it worked well and most senators would agree that it worked well. I think it is true to say that the most effective speeches made in this chamber are ones like the one I am making at the moment&mdash;ones that are of 20 minutes duration or less. There is no doubt that if senators cannot say what they want to say in 20 minutes, it is probably not worth saying. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the sessional order that was introduced at the end of the last session did save a significant amount of time. It is important to point out that there are ample opportunities for senators to make their points. Every senator has the opportunity of making a half-hour adjournment speech every sitting day. I think we are all fairly thankful that many senators do not avail themselves of that opportunity. But the key point is that the opportunity does exist. The opportunity for senators to make speeches of 15 minutes duration on the many Bills that create controversy is available on countless occasions in the committee stage. I think it is worth reinforcing that point with senators&mdash;perhaps with those Independent senators who may not have made up their minds on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that, historically, speeches have been longer in the Senate than in the House of Representatives, but that is now changing because the nature and role of the Senate is changing. The Senate is no longer the club for retired old gentlemen which meant that one could get away with making a speech for an hour or so. There are a great deal more pressures on individual senators, the Senate and the Government in terms of its legislative program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I stress that just because the right to make extraordinarily long speeches in the Senate chamber is a long established one, I do not think it necessarily means that it is a good one and that it automatically should be defended by us when circumstances have changed, as they clearly have. That is, by definition, in my view, unthinking conservatism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I strongly reject the concept that we should not be debating these sorts of issues; that we should instead be looking at the Government's legislative program; that that, in some sense, is the fault of the Government. The reality is that it is very sensible&mdash;and most organisations and houses of parliament do this&mdash;to put the procedural framework in place first. We have come back after an election, we are putting in place the procedural framework within which the Senate will work and after that we will be debating our legislative program within that framework. I believe that is an eminently logical way for us to deal with these issues and it is certainly in the proper order. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not a question, as many Opposition senators have said, of the powers of the Senate. This motion relates to the length of speeches given in this chamber. It is not a question of scrutiny or the capacity of senators to ask questions. All these issues have been raised. We had a long discourse from one senator about the role of the estimates committees, and so it goes on. This motion relates to the length of speeches and not to the powers of the Senate. I think any reasonable and objective observer would accept that that is a fair point to make. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that a 20-minute time limit on speeches made at the second reading stage will force senators to concentrate their minds on the matters before the Senate and will inevitably result in a higher quality of debate in this chamber. The time limit will impose greater self-discipline on senators and I think that is worth while. It will discourage senators from rambling on about irrelevant issues which do not address the key issues of principle that are before the chamber in any piece of government legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that most senators believe that this is an appropriate measure for the chamber to be taking. I know that if it were a free vote most senators would vote with their feet and join the Government. This discipline needs to be enforced because there are literally a handful of senators who take advantage of the capacity to have 30 minutes in which to speak in the second reading debate to disrupt the Government's program in the chamber. Most senators would know that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that Opposition senators will be opposing this motion, but they will be hoping like hell that this motion is agreed to. I believe from the reaction we have heard from the Independent senators and the Democrats that it certainly has every chance of being agreed to. It is a proposition of merit and it is one that deserves the support of the chamber. I commend this motion to senators in the fulsome knowledge that the procedures of this place will be improved and we will continue the appropriate process of reforming the work and procedures of this chamber. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, I seek your indulgence, and that of the Government and the Democrats. I was speaking when the debate on this matter was interrupted, and when the matter was brought on again I was not in a position to attend the chamber when the bells rang for a quorum to be formed.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. I will not canvass the points I was making this morning. Some people will put the argument that if senators cannot say what they want to say within 20 minutes, they should not be saying it at all. That is the sort of thoughtless, nonsensical cliche that is put to us by people who are either not interested in healthy debate or do not have the capacity, competence or ability to deliver an intellectually stimulating debate for more than about five minutes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the essential difference between speaking for 20 minutes and speaking for 30 minutes? What is so vital and so compelling to the Government that it wants to reduce the speaking time of senators by 10 minutes? We have been debating this matter since quite early this morning; it has been running for several hours, but the savings which are intended by reducing the speaking time from 30 minutes to 20 minutes are but some minutes a session. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to the number of senators who have spoken for longer than 20 minutes over the last three years. For instance, in the fortnight between 1 May and 17 May, there were only three senators who spoke for longer than 20 minutes and only four senators who spoke for longer than 25 minutes. For that fortnight, the difference between being able to speak for 20 minutes and 30 minutes meant there was an additional 50 minutes of debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When speeches have continued for more than 20 minutes, invariably they have related to appropriations, special issues, relevant issues of particular interest to individuals and to big issues. In the 1990 Budget session, in the fortnight from 1 September to 11 September, one speaker spoke for between 20 and 25 minutes and there were but five speakers who spoke for between 26 and 30 minutes. If speeches had been limited to 20 minutes duration, there would have been a saving of 35 minutes for the fortnight. In the following sitting fortnight from 2 November to 6 November, again, just a handful of speakers spoke for longer than 20 minutes. If this measure is introduced, the time savings in any one session of Parliament will be probably, at the very most, an hour. Yet that is a crucial hour for those who believe they have a vital contribution to make on a particular issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this matter were put to the public by way of a referendum, I believe that, without question, overwhelmingly the majority of Australians would argue that their representatives ought to be able to present an argument to the Senate on their behalf for more than 20 minutes. Without question, they would argue that their representatives in the Senate ought to be able to speak for 30 minutes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was talk this morning about the difference between the House of Representatives and the Senate. I make the point that the Senate is now the only chamber where the Parliament has a say. While the constitutional debates disclose that the founding fathers anticipated the formation of a two-party system, there is no evidence that they anticipated that we would have only two parties and that any one party would have a majority by itself in the House of Representatives. That now being the case, the House of Representatives is no more than the executive chamber of government. There is no legislation that can be impeded; there is no process that can impede the intentions of the government if the government so chooses. That has had the effect of abolishing the House of Representatives as a chamber of scrutiny of the government. It is simply a mechanical process used, and required to be used under the Constitution, in conformity with its own standing orders for the formal passing of legislation so as to end up ultimately with the enactment of laws. It was never intended that the Senate be in the same situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The founding fathers had anticipated that the Senate would be the States house. We know that it is not such a house in the sense that it used to be. But in a referendum, notwithstanding that it was a referendum supported by both major parties, the public rejected the breaking of the nexus between the House of Representatives and the Senate. The purpose of equal representation was to ensure that each State had equal representation. It was designed and intended that the Senate not be a chamber of executive government. It was set up in such a way as to ensure proper and adequate scrutiny of the actions and activity of the executive government. There was, and there still remains, concern to ensure that the Senate is a house of check and balance on the government, a house of review, a house of second consideration, and a house of contemplation and further deliberation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The very Constitution and standing orders which led to the creation and ultimately to the running of the Senate are premised on the basis that the Senate would not be a house of executive government but a house of review. It is because of the very nature, character and style of the Senate Standing Orders that the late Lionel Murphy was able to stimulate and breathe life into the committee system, which provides a very proper scrutiny of government legislation. One does not need to reflect upon the contribution the committee system of the Senate has made in refining, improving or ultimately rejecting legislation. One does not have to reflect upon the role the Senate committees have made in terms of scrutiny of government legislation and government conduct, and ultimately government accountability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By controlling both chambers of the Parliament, the Government to all intents and purposes is able to bypass the parliamentary process in scrutinising legislation. When the coalition last controlled the Senate to the extent that it had more than half the required numbers to succeed in any one division, as I remember at that stage, the time allowed for Question Time was unlimited. I think it was Lionel Murphy who put a time limit on it. Initially, as I recall, we had unlimited time available for speeches and they were restricted to an hour. We had lengthy, robust, articulate and investigative Committee of the Whole debates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, I believe a heavy responsibility rests upon the Government to ensure that it preserves the character and the nature of the Senate to enable it to scrutinise carefully the activities and the conduct of government. To swipe at and wipe that away, in my view, is to abolish any form of accountability. No government ought to fear scrutiny by the Senate. It ought be encouraged. It ought not be seen as a threat to the program of government. This debate ought not to be a debate, on the one side, of scrutiny of government legislation and, on the other, the developing of a process to ensure that legislation goes through in spite of the fact that there is not proper scrutiny. It is vital that the integrity of the Senate is preserved in the same way as we preserve the judiciary in an independent form&mdash;and hopefully in the same way that we also have independent media and an impartial and competent Public Service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by reminding the Senate of the findings of the royal commission in Western Australia, which showed the dangers when governments, by whatever mechanism, are able to bypass the due processes of parliament. It showed what happens when there is not proper scrutiny. It showed what happened when there was not due diligence on a number of occasions, perhaps by the coalition, in respect to the conduct and activities of the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I regret to say that this Government seems to take a somewhat cavalier attitude towards the role of the Senate. There are those on the other side of the chamber who believe that the Senate ought to be abolished in the same way that the States ought to be abolished&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They believe that it ought to be white-anted and that it is nothing more than an impediment and a nuisance to the Government's program. It was a great disappointment to me last night as a member of an estimates committee to have Senator Collins tell us not once, not thrice, but numerous times that he did not see a need to be accountable to the estimates committee. In his view, the setting up, by his decree, of an investigation or an inquiry into the conduct of his department supplanted the functioning, the role and the responsibilities of the Senate. He was asked a question today by a member of the coalition and he declined to answer. He said, `You will find that out from my inquiry'. It is as though the inquiry he set up is more important than this place and has responsibilities which preclude him from accountability to this Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the same way, we have seen the gutting of the Committee of the Whole to the point where, while the Estimates play a role, we no longer have the focus of examination of legislation in this chamber. Bills are now put off to the side where Ministers conduct themselves in a way quite different from the way they do in the chamber, and in a quite different atmosphere. Last night, hour after hour the Minister was able to refuse to answer any single question in a way which he would not be able to do if he were in this chamber because he knows he has the media present, he knows the proceedings are being broadcast and he knows that those people in Australia who care enough to worry about the conduct of the chamber are examining his response and his conduct. He knows that in the Committee of the Whole he would not be able to answer in the way he did last night. So the answer is to gut the Committee of the Whole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps that attitude is reflected in the level of attendance in this chamber by Labor senators. As we see almost every single day that the Parliament is sitting, members of the Government do not bother to come in. The same thing is true of the House of Representatives, but it is particularly sad to see it in the Senate. The reason they do not bother to come in is that the Government has made a judgment that they are not to speak on issues. So they are taken off the speakers list and there is no point in being here. Their contribution to the Parliament is simply to come in here at Question Time and cheer the front row along and to come here for divisions and quorums. Beyond that, the organ and the activity of the Government in terms of making a contribution to debate in the Parliament have now all but thoroughly disappeared. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know that if the Government makes a judgment that the arguments being presented by a senator are irrelevant, the Standing Orders accommodate that situation. Further, if the Government believes that a senator presenting a debate ought to be prevented from continuing, there is a simple mechanism in the Standing Orders which requires no more than for the Government Minister on duty to stand and move that the senator no longer be heard. In effect, that mechanism is a standing guillotine. But the Government is reluctant, as were we when in government, to introduce the guillotines or the gags because it knows it is an undesirable course; it knows it is not well received by the public and that it will be under scrutiny if it conducts itself that way. So, by surreptitious means, it introduces a process whereby, in effect, it has a permanent guillotine in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many occasions when the arguments require more than 20 minutes to present&mdash;for instance, speeches on the Constitution alteration amendment Bills which no doubt we will be seeing before the next election. To tell me that I have but 20 minutes to present to this Parliament all the arguments as to why the Bills should not be passed in the first place is an absolute nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last time we had 30 minutes to present our arguments in respect of the various amendments proposed to the Constitution by way of referendum. I think I spoke for 2 1/2 hours because I did not deal with them cognately&mdash;and I still had plenty more material. That might have been boring, pedestrian and irrelevant to others, but as long as I feel that I have a point of view to put and an argument to present I ought not to be gagged by the Government because it believes it has a program it has to put through and the most expeditious way of doing that is to prevent senators from the other side&mdash;whether they be the Democrats, the Independents or the coalition&mdash;from representing their constituents, their party and their point of view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to foreshadow a further amendment and to indicate that we propose to refer this matter back to the Procedure Committee so it can examine the questions I have raised. I say to those who bothered to listen to this debate with an open mind that, if they examine the time taken to debate matters during 1990, 1991 and 1992, they will find that the savings are minimal. On a sample annual basis, in 1990, 71 per cent of the speakers spoke for 20 minutes or less. That is 228 speakers. In 1991, 72 per cent of the speakers spoke for less than 20 minutes and in 1992, 81 per cent of the speakers spoke for less than 20 minutes. Perhaps we are becoming less verbose, less articulate or less intellectually rigorous. But 81 per cent of the senators who spoke in 1992 spoke for less than 20 minutes. Based on samples, the average percentage of speakers who spoke for less than 20 minutes in the 36th Parliament was 75 per cent. So I put it to the Senate that the savings are minimal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by saying that, if we calculated the time taken for this debate and aggregated it over the life of this Parliament, we would find that we consumed more time debating this matter today than we will for the life of this Parliament. Yet we are being gagged because of the Government's notion that it has to prevent the Opposition from presenting the arguments in the way it would wish to. I hope the Democrats, the Independents and the Greens cast this proposal aside. </PARA>

They would fill the Senate chamber in the old Parliament House because their speeches were so good. I commented that people who heard them on radio would come in to listen to the points they were making. I see that Senator Crowley was clever enough to pick up that comment and say, `Oh, yes, they would come in from miles around'. Senator Crowley was not here then, but in those days we did not have television. We used to listen to parliamentary broadcasts in our rooms, where we could listen to either the House of Representatives or the Senate. That is what I meant.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During the debate Senator Macdonald claimed that I, as a Democrat, and the Democrats generally had entered into some sort of deal with the Government in the course of which we were given extra perks by the Government. Senator MacGibbon interjected, `Yes, and those extra perks involved additional staff'. I would like to put on the record that, as a Democrat senator, I have three staff, the same as every other senator. I am not aware that I get any additional perks in that respect whatsoever. I would like Senator MacGibbon and Senator Macdonald to provide objective evidence that there is any distinction made between the Democrats and the Opposition with respect to that matter. Secondly, we voted the way we did on the last matter because we believed we were voting for the right cause, not because there were any perks involved in it whatsoever.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second matter on which I claim to have been seriously misrepresented is the claim by Senator Walters that I had said that the debate did not matter, it was only a matter of numbers. Senator Walters clearly did not understand the point I was making, which was also made by members of her own side during that debate. My point was that if the position in the Senate were such that any party had the ability to ram through decisions on numbers alone, we would not get into a debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The threshold issue is that this Senate works as a debating chamber simply because the numbers are so distributed that debates are forced.

Having established the question of numbers, then of course the question of the debates is vitally important. That was exactly the point I was making&mdash;that numbers determine whether the Senate is a debating chamber and does not behave in the same way as the House of Representatives. </PARA>

<PARA>This proposal relates to reducing the number of standing committees from nine to seven. I am going to be absolutely honest&mdash;and I think many senators know that this is the situation&mdash;and lay the politics out before them. This proposal was not the Government's preferred option in relation to the standing committees. The Opposition and the Democrats know that at one stage we tried hard to see whether the existing Standing Orders, which have six senators serving on each legislative and general purpose standing committee, could operate for this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After considerable negotiation on this issue, it became clear that the Australian Democrats were keen to protect the position that had been enshrined over recent years in relation to their serving on these standing committees. After discussion, in order to achieve a similar result, the Government amended that original proposition and is now moving to reduce the number of committees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, as we will debate at a later stage, we are very serious about trying to ensure that the workload across the committees is even. I think that is very important. Many senators know that one or two of these standing committees have really borne the brunt of the committee stage work of the Senate and a number of others have not had anything like that overwhelming workload. It is worth while seeing whether we can balance the workload and have a more equitable spread of work across the committees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to outline briefly the Government's view on the issue of Chairs of these committees because I understand that Senator Hill will be moving an amendment at a later stage to see the Chairs of the committees shared between the Government, the Opposition and the minor parties and Independent senators who are represented in the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe it is worth recalling the way in which these committees have operated in the past. I think the nature of the committee system and the way it has evolved certainly does reinforce the need for the Government to have the capacity to nominate a Chair for these committees, given the important role the Chairs play. Certainly, having a government Chair on legislative and general purpose standing committees has been accepted as a longstanding convention. Even Odgers, on page 468 of the fifth edition, indicates without any equivocation at all that this is certainly the case. Odgers states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Senate's committee system is possibly unique in that the party composition of standing and select committees does not necessarily reflect voting strength in the Senate. It is a long-standing convention that the Government provides the chairmen of committees and enjoys a majority of votes in committees, even if the Government may be in a minority on the floor of the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The convention probably grew out of the early concept that is still valid today&mdash;that committees are fact-finding and advisory and do not aspire to decision-making.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result, committees have been remarkably non-partisan in their activities.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not know whether the latter part of that quote from Odgers is true, but I thought that if I did not provide a fulsome quotation from Odgers I would hear any number of Opposition senators giving me one later in this debate. I think that is indicative of the principle that has been established for a long time&mdash;the convention that has worked in this chamber for a long time&mdash;and it is one that it is essential to retain. I personally believe that this suggestion from the Opposition is tantamount to its accepting that it is going to be a permanent opposition in this chamber. No fair dinkum alternative government would want to see the Government lose the chairmanship of committees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have also been honest previously in saying quite clearly that the Government has difficulty in staffing the committees because of the number of frontbenchers that we have. We have 10 Ministers and a Parliamentary Secretary in this chamber. We all know how the mathematics add up. Most of us who can do simple arithmetic&mdash;I would not put Senator Walters in that category&mdash;understand that. It may as well be on the table that it is a difficulty for Government backbench senators to cover the committee workload&mdash;and it is enormous. The Opposition has an advantage in that any number of frontbenchers and all the shadow Parliamentary Secretaries, which I think amount to five or six, can serve on these committees. That is not a luxury the Government has and it causes, obviously, very significant logistical difficulties for us as we look to staff these committees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important for honourable senators to recognise the legislative role that these committees now have in terms of the committee stage of Bills. It is important for the Senate to recognise that the Government was re-elected with an increased majority at the last election, and I think in all conscience the Opposition ought to be taking into account the resources the Government has lost in terms of staffing these committees, simply because we won the last election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a genuine attempt on the part of the Government to come to a conclusion on this issue that will see these committees work effectively in the next Parliament. We are committed as a government to ensuring that the committees do work effectively and we believe that the only way that can occur is for the number of committees to be reduced so that the remaining committees get an absolutely full commitment from all senators. That is the intention of this motion, and I believe it will work well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the committees the Government proposes to have omitted from the Standing Orders and hence, in effect, abolished, is the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. I make the point that that committee was chosen because of the role of the joint committee, which I think most senators and members, both Opposition and Government, would accept plays a very important role in this Parliament and does contribute to the standing of this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other changes that have been made along with that I believe will add to this chamber's capacity to work effectively and to see our committee system work with maximum attention. Those changes will enable honourable senators to give full commitment to their committee work. I believe that this is yet another reform the Government is proposing which will assist the Senate itself and individual senators to give attention to their important work. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It seems to me that there are three separate issues in this debate. The first is that the Government is seeking&mdash;and apparently in so doing has the agreement of the Australian Democrats&mdash;to abolish two of the standing committees of the Australian Senate. Basically, the Government is seeking to abolish both the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade and the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems that the Government is seeking to abolish these committees simply because of its low numbers in this chamber after the last election. No case has been made out on the merits for abolition of the committees. It is simply a matter of fact that, now that the Government has fewer members and more Ministers in this chamber, it has decided that its backbench cannot adequately service the current committee structure of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The abolition of these committees is convenient for the Australian Democrats because they do not have enough senators to service all legislative and general purposes committees unless some of them service more than one. So when the Government went to the Australian Democrats and said, `We propose to cut back the existing Senate committees', that was received positively by the Australian Democrats because it suits their low numbers in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sad aspect of this is that these committees are not committees of the Government; they are committees of the Senate, and their record has been good. I want to speak briefly on the one I know best, and that is the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. Although I have never been a member of the Senate committee, I am well acquainted with its high public standing. I think some of my colleagues who have served on the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure will express their concerns about the abolition of that particular committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate foreign affairs committee in fact received its first reference in 1971, so it has existed for over 20 years. As I have said, it is held in high regard by practitioners in foreign affairs in this country and it is also well known internationally. In my observation, certainly some of the work it has done in recent years has been up with the best it has produced in that long period&mdash;work which, I am prepared to acknowledge, has been done largely under the chairmanship of Senator Maguire, whom I hope will later enter this debate and put his view about the abolition of a committee he has so well chaired in recent times. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As my colleague Senator Teague reminds me, the stimulation he has added to work on particular inquiries has not only enhanced his reputation in the foreign affairs area but also added to the high esteem of the Senate foreign affairs committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I think of the work that committee did, for example, in its inquiry into Australian-Indian relations&mdash;which is the only contemporary work that has been done by this Parliament on what is now an important relationship but will be a much more important relationship in the future&mdash;my view is that if that work had not been done by the foreign affairs committee, it would not have been done at all. That inquiry explored the potential for the relationship, the economic potential, and how the Australian foreign aid component in south Asia and India in particular might develop. It also looked at the defence aspects of the relationship, which have been of some concern to many Australians, and to some extent it put to rest some of those concerns, which were not well-founded in fact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, that particular inquiry performed a public service of providing information, ensuring that the debate within this country was better informed; and it also made very worthwhile recommendations to the Government, many of which have been picked up. Senator Teague might like to deal with some of those in greater detail, but I recall that the recommendation in relation to an Australian-Indian institute was accepted by the Government and has been implemented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think also of the inquiry the committee undertook into Australian-Latin American relations, which was the first inquiry of that type by the Australian Parliament. It explored the potential for growing relationships between Australia and the various Latin American states. When that report was brought down, all the heads of mission from Latin American states based in Canberra attended in this chamber. They gave high commendation to the work and the detail that had been put into the report by the Senate committee, particularly the work on the potential of the economic relationship, which has been largely unknown within Australia. Of course, that report was largely endorsed by the Australian Government in due course. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One could spend time&mdash;which I will not do&mdash;in going through a whole series of other important inquiries that have been undertaken by that particular Senate committee that have brought credit not only to itself but to this Parliament and that have made a very useful contribution to the foreign affairs debate within Australia. Just because the Australian Labor Party in the Senate has lost a couple of seats while at the same time increasing its frontbench representation, it now wishes to abolish that committee after more than 20 years of work. As no better reason has been given, I think that is a sad state of affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am really astonished that the Australian Democrats are so ready to be a party to the abolition of a Senate standing committee that has so well served Australian interests for so long. I understand the problem that faces the Australian Democrats in servicing all these committees. I have even suggested to them that if, say, Senator Bourne, who has an interest in foreign affairs and who might participate in particular inquiries, such as the inquiry on Australia-China relations, were to find that because of the pressure of her other work she was unable to participate in other inquiries of less interest to her, it would not be unreasonable that we should find a way of accommodating that difficulty on the part of the Democrats. That would be a much better solution to the problem we have before us today than simply abolishing the committee, which is the solution the Government put to the Australian Democrats and which, as I have said and as I understand it, they have so readily accepted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The case has not been made out for abolition of these two committees. It is said by some that perhaps the foreign affairs work could be picked up by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. That is not possible. That committee is fully engaged with its own workload and, interestingly, there has not been duplication. Mr Acting Deputy President, you will be aware that the joint committee has expanded its role in recent years; it now has a subcommittee dealing with human rights, for example. There is no way that it would be able to pick up the work that has been done in recent years by the Senate foreign affairs committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, as I said a moment ago, if the Senate committee had not existed, the work would not have been done and the particular benefit to Australia from that work, which has been acknowledged time and time again by the Government, would not have been gained. I do not often reflect on Senator Gareth Evans's own book on foreign affairs, but I notice that in it he gives credit to the foreign affairs committees of this Parliament, and in particular to the Senate committee. He also might like to come in and participate in this debate and acknowledge publicly what he has previously said&mdash;that it is very worthwhile work in the Parliament's overall contribution to our international relations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will, therefore, oppose the abolition of these two committees. We hope that at this late stage the Australian Democrats will realise that what they intend to do is a mistake, join with us and vote down the Government's intention to abolish these committees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second issue that has been brought within this debate is our proposed reform that the chairmen of general purpose standing committees be shared around the chamber. It is true, as Senator Faulkner has said, that the practice in the past&mdash;and it is incorporated within the Standing Orders&mdash;has been that the government of the day chairs these committees. One suspects that it ended up in the Standing Orders in that form because it was assumed that the government of the day would have the majority in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I repeat what I said a moment ago: these committees are not committees of the government; they are committees of the Senate, and there is no logical reason why the government should chair all of them. Work done by legislative committees is brought back into this chamber for debate in the Committee of the Whole. At one stage we followed the practice of the Opposition providing the Chairman of Committees, the Deputy President. Nobody said that that system would not work because it was an opposition chair heading up the debate. The same logic applies to the work being done by the committees when they are operating in their separate state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are proposing as a matter of reform is that the Standing Orders be changed so that senators other than government senators would have the opportunity to chair some of these committees and provide the benefit of their own unique backgrounds and experiences. In doing so, we are not in any way being pessimistic about our future opportunities in government. In fact, we see it as a reform of the Senate. We recognise that it would have to be a reform that was carried on if the numbers changed in the other place and we were in government. We believe that it is time that the Senate as a whole asserted itself properly in relation to the functioning of the committee process. We should not allow the government, in effect, to run the Senate's agenda in respect of this very important part of the Senate's work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To be reasonable, we have suggested&mdash;and we did so on the basis of there being nine committees; but as I said, if the Democrats stand by what they have earlier said, we will end up with only seven&mdash;that four committees be chaired by a government senator, four be chaired by an opposition senator, the Opposition representing the largest block in this chamber, and that the ninth be chaired by a representative of the minor parties or Independents. Because of the Australian Democrat numbers, I am anticipating that the ninth one, on the current structure, would be chaired by a senator from the Australian Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So this proposition has the benefit of being fair. It has the benefit of a reform that gets away from what I think is the illogical practice, although it has long existed, that chairmen of these committees are automatically taken from the side which has the majority in the House of Representatives. I will, therefore, seek to move an amendment to bring about that reform. I hope that the Australian Democrats, who I know have been thinking about this issue for the last week and a half, might be prepared to support us on this occasion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the event that the committees are chopped back in the way the Government intends, we need to consider what is the best mix of departments to be serviced adequately within just seven standing committees. The Government has put forward a certain formula in its amendment. That has been given careful consideration on this side of the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Panizza has circulated an amendment&mdash;it has been put to the Government and to the Australian Democrats for their consideration&mdash;which we think will provide a better mix. It has the effect of linking transport with the rural affairs committee of the Senate. We think there is some logical merit in that as it will allow better attention to be given to the transport area. It is a second-best option to the option of retaining the existing committee on transport, communications and infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If it appears that the Government is going to be successful in cutting back the number of committees to seven, we will seek to amend the structure the Government is advocating in the form that I have just indicated which, as I said, is specifically covered by Senator Panizza's amendment. But I hope that will not be necessary. I hope that at this late stage the Australian Democrats have realised the error of unnecessarily cutting back the Senate committee system that has been built up over such a long period and that has such prestige and experienced staff. I hope that they will join us in throwing out this unnecessary change that is being suggested by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, I hope that they will join us in supporting a well considered Senate reform to provide for a sharing of the responsibility of chairing these committees. I might say to the Democrat senators that this arrangement has already been incorporated within the British system. If they join with us, then Senator Panizza's amendment on restructuring will not be necessary. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let us have a look at the situation relating to the nine Senate committees. I point out that we have had an extra committee added in the last year&mdash;the rural affairs committee. I certainly do not oppose the addition of that committee to the system. But in this instance the Government is starting from the position of having preferred three government senators and three other senators on a committee. That has not proved possible. One of the reasons it has not proved possible is that we did amend Senate procedure some time ago to refer far more Bills to these committees to be assessed on a legislative basis. So I can understand why Senator Bell and his colleagues would therefore want to participate in that process, whereas they may not normally have wanted to join some of these standing committees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a situation where on the majority of these committees the Government will be required to provide four members, the Opposition three, and the Democrats or Independents one other. From a numbers point of view, that does give the Government a difficulty. We have not tried to dodge that. I must congratulate Senator Hill on his contribution today. It was a far less cynical performance than trying to increase the number of committees, which is just an Opposition device to try to put pressure on us to supply bodies to committees. That sort of cynicism was lacking in his contribution today and I congratulate him for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Throughout all these debates we have heard a variety of interjections such as, `You are going to go down two seats in July. Serves you right'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Whether one makes that mandatory or not, that is the existing situation. It is normal that governments&mdash;at least until today&mdash;provide the President of the Senate and sometimes his deputy. I think everybody knows what is going to happen in August in regard to that. But at a minimum we have 11 people who cannot serve on committees. Thanks to opposition intervention the other day, Senator Sherry now can serve on committees, and that is not all bad. Now that he cannot actually appear in front of estimates committees we welcome the fact that he is now able to serve on any committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we are close to a situation of having to commit to committees senators who have a much higher workload than opposition senators. That may well lead to a situation where they do not carry out their duties with due diligence or put in as much as everybody else. That is a great shame. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The only practical solution we can come up with is to reduce the committees by two. I have not read Senator Panizza's amendment, and no doubt the Manager of Government Business in the Senate (senator Faulkner) will give it due consideration. I do not think we on this side of the chamber would take a totally hardline position on the actual dividing up of which government departments go to which committee. I hope that some reasonableness appears on that level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I return to the point about the Government having 30 senators and the Opposition having 36 in July. I took the trouble today, because I have heard all these interjections, to see what aggregate votes the various parties received in 1990 and 1993. It is quite an interesting reflection. The Liberal-National Party-CLP&mdash;I have added them all together&mdash;received 8,751,671 votes at the two elections. The Australian Labor Party received 8,454,673. In other words, the Liberal-National Party combined vote over those two elections comes to 42.5 per cent. Their Senate representation after July will be 47.4 per cent. The Labor Party's vote totalled 41 per cent combined over the two elections and we receive 39.5 per cent. The Democrats received 8.8 per cent of the vote over the two elections and get 9.2 per cent of the representation in this chamber. The Greens' aggregate vote is 2.4 per cent and they get 1.3 per cent in the chamber. Those who argue that this chamber is totally representative of votes cast and reflects those power realities are wrong. </PARA>

The reasons are partly due to preferences, but not much. It is simply that in every Senate election there is a missing quota; that is, the total amount of votes are divided by seven and we have six successful candidates. The history of the 1990 election especially rather than this one is that the Labor Party had the missing quota. Therefore, we are substantially and proportionately under-represented in this chamber than the primary votes cast. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That could just as easily happen to the Opposition in any particular period. If one goes back through the past, I am sure it has been equally disadvantaged at some time. I put that on the record because of this sort of trite interjection: `This chamber is purely representative. You didn't get enough votes. Therefore, we don't care less that you are going to have difficulty in staffing the committees with senators'. A lot of luck is involved in this. I do not whinge and say that the system is bad, corrupt or biased. I do not say that at all. We have had the wrong end of the stick luckwise&mdash;especially in 1990&mdash;in terms of having the missing quota, as is reflected in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Senator Hill went to the question of why the Senate foreign affairs and defence committee has gone. He should not have been surprised by that. I proposed that, but did not put it to the chamber, in 1987 and 1990. It is not as though it is a recent discovery. It was selected on the basis of looking down the list of committees to see which one has the least legislative role and which one can have its workload picked up by another committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, we believe that the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade&mdash;comprising about 30 parliamentarians and with enormous resources in terms of staff, et cetera&mdash;can adequately cover these issues. Where it cannot cover these issues, then another committee to which we move these responsibilities can take up the slack. Hence, if the Opposition insists on doing an inquiry, such as it did on India and produced an excellent report, that committee can still do it. But it also has to be said that committee members will only be able to devote probably half the time to those sorts of issues as they have in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me move on to one of my long-term concerns. If in this chamber we continue to increase committees and their workload, we are going to move to the American system, which I abhor; that is, having 90 per cent of the work on committees done by staff and not by senators themselves. I have noticed a tendency over the last 11 years for that to increase. More and more reports are written by secretariats, rubber-stamped or altered slightly by chairmen, and then rubber-stamped by the committee members. Members do not have either the resources or the time, if their efforts are spread out over a number of committees, to go ahead and properly supervise the eventual report or adequately prepare questions to witnesses. I think this process of reducing committees by two will slightly help to stem that process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Hill said that when these committees were set up it was always assumed that the Government would have a majority. No-one here, other than maybe Senator Durack, could even comment on that. They were set up in 1971 precisely because the Government did not have a majority. The DLP, for once in its life, voted to reform the system and voted with the Labor Party. The basic point made by Senator Hill as to whether it was always assumed that government should chair these committees was based on the fact that the Government did not have a majority in the chamber. That was one of the checks and balances put in at the time when the rest of the powers of the committee were put in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These committees have immense power and give the Opposition immense opportunities. The Senate in its wisdom in 1971 said, `How can we slightly counterbalance a disproportionate amount of influence and opportunity of the Opposition and not the Government?'. We agreed at the time that the Liberal coalition could provide the chairs of all these committees, the Estimates committees, et cetera. Now we hear some sweet and honeyed words about power sharing. Where was the power sharing in the day of the McMahon Government when the committees were set up?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two senators in the chamber who were here prior to 1980, during the Fraser Government. When did they bob up and say, `Look, Labor Party, we have just kicked you to pieces in an election. However, we want to get into power sharing. We want to give you committee chairmanships'. People tend to forget the pretty tough show that the Fraser Government ran in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope Senator Teague has not forgotten the time when he went to an education and training meeting, slamming through a motion three all, and then using his casting vote to roll me. He should remember that very well. I admired him for it, frankly, even though I whinged at the time. We had a disagreement over a reference. Suddenly we fronted up at the committee; and bang, in came the numbers which made it three all, casting vote&mdash;`See you later Robert, you are wrong'. I just slotted that away in my memory and said, `We'll get our chance one day. We'll do almost the same thing', although it is not a preferable course on which to go. </PARA>

But, of course, no. We are a bit cynical as to why suddenly the coalition would want to be into power sharing to disrupt what was an original agreement in 1971, when in fact they control four State parliaments around this country. How much power sharing is done there? How often in Western Australia, Tasmania, Victoria and New South Wales do opposition members chair committees in the Parliament? The answer is, absolutely never. I think this is just a big try-on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not waste too much time of the Senate. In summary, I make the point that the Government has come forward with this proposal to meet changed circumstances. The change is that, inevitably, most of these committees will now constitute eight senators rather than six. It means that if those opposite want a meaningful contribution from government senators and want to force them onto these committees&mdash;that is, to serve on two or three&mdash;they will not get the output from them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our response to that is that we will take two of the committees and merge them with other committees, which will still give the opportunity to the Democrats to exercise their rights, will still give the opportunity to all senators to pursue inquiries on these committees, and finally will enable them to activate senators actually to write the reports and deliver them themselves, rather than the secretariat doing it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the chairmanship issue that Senator Hill raised, we remain a little cynical about this sudden surge of power sharing. We have heard nothing about it in the last 10 years. This sort of motion should always be debated three months before an election. When senators want to substantially change the Senate and the relativities between the Opposition and Government, three months before an election is the time to do it. Everyone has an eye on the weather then. We may think we are going to lose and think that power sharing is a good idea. Those on the other side can be held to it, because if they think they can win government they should not mind power sharing down. It is a rather cynical move to introduce this proposal when those opposite face three years, six years or whatever in the wilderness. I suggest that Senator Hill introduce that amendment in two years and eight months time. We can all have an objective look at it then, none of us knowing what the future holds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the question of the allocation of departments to committees, I still say that that is fairly negotiable around the traps, even if it is not settled here today.

I put the particular plea that this not be a swan song for an excellent committee, the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, but rather a convincing speech for evaluating its record, seeing it to be excellent, and making sure that we do not lose the momentum and the established credibility we have in that committee, along with the others. </PARA>

At the time this was a hot political issue in this country and many in the public regarded it as a genuine danger to civilians in port cities, and, more widely than that, that there were visits to our ports by nuclear-powered or armed vessels. This measure has taken all of the fire out of those concerns. There were some 50 recommendations which made sure that all of the arrangements were in good order. There was a change whereby some ships would not come to the Victoria Docks adjacent to the city of Hobart. All of the politics has gone from that issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me talk about the report Senator Hill has referred to, that is, the Senate committee's report on Australia-India relations. It addressed both strategic assessments of India in the subcontinent and trade prospects between Australia and India. When there was a major mistake made by the present Government in the sale of redundant aircraft to Pakistan&mdash;a mistake which is greatly regretted, I believe, even by the Ministers responsible&mdash;this report was at hand and was a fallback to repair and rebuild the damaged relations between Australia and India. The recommendation in this report that there should be an Australia-India council has been accepted. The essential text for the politics of the relationship between Australia and India&mdash;if one asks any of the academics and any of the business people involved in Australia-India matters&mdash;is this Senate report. </PARA>

Another area of very real concern both to our foreign affairs interests in this country and to defence has been our increased involvement in United Nations peacekeeping. It was very appropriate that there be a careful study by politicians of United Nations peacekeeping in Australia.

It will be circulated not only to business but also to academia, to anyone involved in trade or anything to do with the relations between our countries&mdash;transport, airways and so on. The findings in the report indicate the prospect of Australian trade in the region increasing from the current level of one per cent to three per cent or even more. We should not be neglecting any one part of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I repeat that I am thoroughly proud of this report. If, for the temporary convenience of some members of the Senate, we were to abandon the 22 years of achievement of such an important standing committee of this Parliament, we would be doing a great disservice to the Parliament and to Australia. I can only make the plea that Government and Democrat senators look beyond the convenience of their own arrangements in the next three years, actually concentrate upon the track record of excellence that has been achieved in this Parliament through such committees, and not abandon these achievements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw to the attention of the Senate some of the supplementary papers that were generated by the Senate with regard to the Latin America inquiry. I know that these are now essential texts, not only in Australia, but also in the foreign capitals of the countries of Latin America. Let me give one example. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had a full day's seminar at the department of Spanish studies at Flinders University which was opened by my good friend, John Lovering, the Vice Chancellor of the university. A State Minister spoke at the seminar in glowing terms about the initiative taken by the Senate in this report. Senator Maguire, Senator Crowley&mdash;who recently returned from leading a delegation representing the Parliament&mdash;and I also spoke at that seminar. We were seen to be senators making a relevant, practical and constructive contribution not only to the Parliament but also to the practical agenda of universities such as Flinders University. That is only one example. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I am concentrating on Latin America, let me say that the members of the diplomatic corps in this city, some 80 ambassadors&mdash;at least all those who have heard of this possible move in the Senate&mdash;are lamenting that this move will be a huge loss to Australia's ability to build links with the nations of the world, especially those nations with which we have a direct trading, defence or other substantial relationship. I think of the ASEAN representatives in this city, the Latin Americans, the Americans, the Europeans; I could go through the whole diplomatic corps in this city. They know the value of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might be interpreted in these remarks as singing a swan song for a marvellous committee that we are now seeing disposed of to meet the temporary convenience of some senators. I will refer in my concluding remarks to those directly practical matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposal to have only seven Senate standing committees happens to match the number of Democrat senators. There are only seven Democrats in this chamber. I note that it is difficult for Democrat senators to attend more than one committee. Senator Spindler is a member of two standing committees, the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade and the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Am I being too cynical in saying that the proposal before us amalgamates the two committees on which Senator Spindler happens to be a member? Am I being too cynical in saying that it is the view of some Democrat senators that it would be very much to their personal convenience if there were one secretary and one agenda, and they could organise their lives that little bit better, whatever the losses to the Senate as a whole? In the future, when others look at this debate, and at the downgrading of the Senate committee system, they will see it as meeting no argument on merit, only the convenience of some senators, and they will see this as a very sorry day in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been able to do the arithmetic&mdash;something to which Senator Ray referred. There will be only 30 Labor senators in the chamber. Ten are Ministers. I welcome the fact that one-third of the Ministry is drawn from this chamber. It should be so. One-third of the members of Parliament are in the Senate; one-third of the Ministers of the Government ought to be from the Senate. When we take those 10 into account, plus the President of the Senate&mdash;or if there should be other than a Government President, presumably a Government chairman of committees&mdash;this leaves only 19 senators to serve on the standing committees. If there are nine standing committees and three or four are required for each&mdash;even at the most, that is 36 places to be filled&mdash;each of those 19 senators would be required to serve on two standing committees. I understand that arithmetic but I do not believe that that is an argument that ought to sway this chamber to abandon standing committees of great worth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note in particular the loss of the resources that the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade would suffer in being only half a committee. At the moment we have considerable expertise in our own secretariat. It is clear that that secretariat would be halved through this amalgamation and we would see the dispersal of resources which have been of great value. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More than six years ago I was, for five years, a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. I valued that time. But I have always seen the Senate standing committee as complementary&mdash;doing additional work of value to what the joint committee is able to undertake. There is a convenience, a concentration and a focus which senators bring to an all-senators committee which mean that it is a very achieving committee in the way that I have outlined in the reports that I have referred to. That will be lost if we see the loss of this committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Ray said, this proposal was put up three years ago and six years ago. Senator Ray was the Manager of Government Business in the Senate and was aware of pressures, even in those years, on Labor senators to service committees. It was at least informally put about that there might be some reduction. One of the committees discussed was the Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. However, rightly, six years ago and three years ago that discussion led to the confirmation and retention of this very achieving Senate standing committee. Even at this eleventh hour, I still hope there will be the same outcome this time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now refer to a transition. Despite the views of coalition senators, if the proposal before us is successful and we see a reduction from nine committees to seven, I would ask that consideration be given to ensuring that there is no lapse of the three-quarters completed current inquiry into Australia's assessment of Japan and Japan's security concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 16 September last year the Senate referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade for an inquiry and report on the matter of Japan's defence policy and current defence development and debates in Japan. A number of very valuable witnesses have appeared at our public hearings, including His Excellency the Ambassador of Japan. It would be of great discourtesy, not only to the senators who have three-quarters finished that task but also to our witnesses, including the Ambassador of Japan and through him the Government of Japan, if we were to not see the completion of that reference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have completed our public hearings. We have already developed a draft and it would be the wish of the committee for that to be completed by the end of June this year. I put the plea that, if there is going to be a loss of a committee, there be a certainty of transition such that this current inquiry, the only major current inquiry to be completed, is completed and reported to the Senate. There are two or three ways to do this. One is through retaining the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade at least until the end of June with its current membership. Another is to have a select committee, again with the membership of the current standing committee, that would have the precise task of completing that report on the same terms of reference and building upon the transcript of evidence and material that has been available to the Committee. A third is to ensure that in any amalgamated committee it be a priority reference and that there be sufficient personnel from the former committee continuing into that amalgamated committee to ensure that it is completed by June this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I see Senator Cooney in the chamber. I commend, as I did at the beginning of my speech, Senator Cooney's first-class record as chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. Senator Hill has served in this area in the past, as has Senator Tate, former Senator Puplick, former Senator Missen and so on. There has been an enormously high regard for that committee. Yet the proposal that is before us is to take these two most eminent standing committees and amalgamate them so that there would be half the resources and half the ability to complete the good work of both committees. Even in this transition, I would see that the concerns of such persons as my good friend across the chamber Senator Cooney in legal and constitutional matters would have difficulty competing with the completion of a report such as that which I referred to with regard to Japan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make the plea that there be a certain transition so that that report can be completed by the end of June. I have taken a great deal of the time of the Senate in speaking for 25 minutes. I do not make any apology. I only say with every amount of sincerity that I can muster that we should not, for the temporary convenience of some senators, abandon a 22-year record of excellence of achievement in the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade.

I would also look for a signal with regard to Senator Panizza's amendment that would change the actual combination of responsibilities or portfolio areas with regard to the continuing Senate committees. I will defer to those alternative considerations if I can see that we will have the full number of Senate committees.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Watson should take a deep breath. I do not have long; he should at least let me get through it. The underlying principle of the income test is to assess people's current need for income support based on the current financial resources available to them. The real truth is that capital gains on listed shares are readily available. Determining whether to access the capital gain or not is entirely up to the individual. Nevertheless, the gain is available, and that is the same across a whole range of investments.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is one of the more ridiculous interjections. It is not as good as Senator Macdonald's `You lost two seats' today, but it is not bad. It is in the same league, but not as good. The first point to make is that some pensioners may decide to get out of shares as a result of this measure. But it is pretty well certain that those who seek to do so will reinvest the money. When they do reinvest the money, because this is an anomaly, they will be caught under the income test anyway with those new arrangements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I answered the ridiculous claim about investing overseas the other day. The idea that Australia's pensioner population is flocking to invest in the New York stock exchange is, to say the least, bizarre. Pensioners do not have the arrangements in place to gain the benefit of doing that, and it is just not likely to happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rules that will apply to shares have applied to managed investments for five years. Over that time, 128,000 pensioners have invested in managed investments. They do that because there is intrinsic merit in the investment. They will have to weigh up the intrinsic merit of the investment in shares as against managed investments and other forms of investment. As I said, even if some do sell their shares, they are pretty likely to reinvest in ways that are covered by the income and assets test anyway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I mentioned, the number of people affected by the change is around 60,000, and around 24,000 DVA pensioners are also affected. So we are talking about less than three per cent of the social security pensioner population. Those affected are mainly those with large shareholdings, including some with as much as $100,000 in shares. For those who have a small number of shares, this measure has so little effect that it does not matter anyway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that the new rules do not apply to non-listed shares, real estate, art works and antiques. There are pretty good reasons for that. Shares in non-listed companies are not part of the measure because they are not readily realisable in the way that shares in listed companies are. Therefore, capital growth cannot be readily utilised for income support purposes as it can be with shares in listed companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Real estate, antiques and art works are not part of the measure because the whole investment must be sold in order to gain access to the capital gain, whereas listed shares can be sold in small lots to realise gains as people consider them necessary to be realised. A pensioner does not need to sell the whole portfolio to access profits. If I were an antique dealer, I would not really believe that 100,000 pensioners would be marching down the street beating a path to my door this afternoon to invest in antiques. It simply is not going to happen. The truth is that pensioners may seek investments other than shares as a result of this measure&mdash;although I still think many will stay with what they have&mdash;but they will not be racing off to invest in antiques. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the other point we have to cover concerns comparisons between definitions in the Department of Social Security and the Australian Taxation Office. There is no sound reason why those two organisations should use the same method of assessing income. The social security income test serves a totally different purpose from the tax office assessment of income and it always has. Social security legislation provides a level of income support based on people's current needs and their current ability to meet the needs. The Australian Taxation Office assesses a person's income over the course of a full year to determine what he or she can contribute to the revenue of the community. So to suggest that social security income tests should mirror the tax definition of income ignores the intrinsic differences in the way the two organisations go about their tasks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The criticism that the changes do not allow losses to be fully offset against gains is flawed, because if one says that, one does not understand the current nature of a social security income assessment. It presumes that past dollar losses should be offset against past dollar gains, but the income test seeks to establish the current earning capacity of a particular investment and the corresponding financial resources available to individual pensioners. This method of assessing current earning power has been in operation for many years, and it has been endorsed by the High Court of Australia as an appropriate way to administer the income test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The assertion that identical managed and unmanaged investments will be assessed differently under the new rules is incorrect. Such anomalies are possible under the current rules. Currently, a pensioner who invests directly in the share market is assessed differently from a pensioner who invests indirectly in the share market through an equity trust. That is the kind of anomaly that the legislation seeks to correct. The change will remove the anomalies in assessment and ensure a fairer and more workable treatment of investments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The claim that the Department of Social Security will apply arbitrary assessment dates is patently untrue. All clients will have their share portfolios assessed on the same day, using the same source information, when the change is introduced in September. The department will obtain updated information on share market performance every fortnight. Clients can seek individual reassessments of their share portfolios based on this information if they feel the need. Consistency of assessment will be maintained by automatic quarterly reassessments which will occur, again, using identical share market information for all clients. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The suggestion that pensioners investing in listed shares are disadvantaged compared to those who invest in non-listed shares shows little understanding of the difference between listed and unlisted companies.

So this assertion that there is a flood of pensioners trying to get out of shares is simply not true and will not be true for the future.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have to answer some of Senator Richardson's comments, and I am not going to reconsider. I do not think he gave me a very good argument. He said that the number of pensioners with investments had increased, but he did not give me any details as to the level of their investments in shares. He has not told me whether those people are full pensioners or not and whether they have investments at a rate which is low enough to entitle them to a full pension anyway. That figure really has not convinced me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Richardson said that I went along with these matters before, when the legislation came through. But it was with reservations. Senator Richardson might remember that I said we would review that this year because of our concerns that the Government had it coupled with benefits. Had we suggested that we oppose that, Senator Richardson would have said, `We cannot pay for the benefits'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As for the accuracy of the estimates of the savings, these have been questioned by the stock exchange. I also question the accuracy of the figure because when I asked in Estimates whether it took into account changes in pensioners' behaviour, the department said that it did not. I do not care what Senator Richardson says about the increasing number of people investing in shares, the fact is that financial advisers are telling pensioners to take their money out of shares. If Senator Richardson had read any of the material that goes out from investment advisers, he would see that that is what they are telling pensioners to do. That is what they are ringing my office and telling me that they are telling pensioners to do and that is what they will do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Richardson says that only three per cent of the population of pensioners are affected, but I point out that it is three per cent of two million. That is a lot of people. So to cast those people aside as not being relevant is, I think, not appropriate and it is an argument that we cannot accept. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to know how much this will cost to administer. Senator Richardson has not told us how much it will cost to administer. He has told us the net savings, but, as always, the administration cost creeps up. The report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Super&mdash;fiscal and social links</EMPHASIS>, which was the fourth report of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the Treasurer and the Minister for Social Security form a working party to examine income tax and social security legislation with a view to maximising the consistency of definitions and treatment of matters of common concern to the two systems and that the report be tabled in Parliament by the end of 1993.</PARA>
<PARA>What we have been asking for is a total review of incomes and assets tests for pensioners. Tinkering at the edges in the way that Senator Richardson has done makes it even less fair and more uneven. It has not addressed the problems that are there, and I am in no way convinced that we ought to withdraw this Bill. I will proceed with it forthwith. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased that Senator Patterson is not convinced by the Minister's questions and assertions because I believe this particular measure of Senator Patterson's is, as was the private member's Bill introduced by Senator Lees and myself, thoroughly deserving of the support of not only the full chamber but also the rest of the Parliament of Australia, the House of Representatives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Richardson made a number of assertions about what pensioners would and would not do, what moves could and could not be taken and the alternatives which exist. None of those assertions is in accord with the communication that I have had with pensioners in the community who are concerned about this. None of the answers given by the Minister is acceptable to those people who are concerned about this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The very premise on which this move is based, as Senator Richardson has said to us several times, is the premise that we should be treating equally those who invest in management investment trusts and those who invest directly in the share market. If, in the way that the managed investment trusts are treated at the moment&mdash;and that is not to say that is correct&mdash;it is deemed that capital gains are income, that is a contradiction and an illogicality which should not be perpetuated over other investments. If it is, and if the Minister wants to extend that treatment in fairness to other areas, the gain in value that might accrue to antiques, as Senator Richardson mentioned&mdash;I did not hear the actual words he used but the implication was that one could not sell the corner leg off an antique table, that it was not as redeemable as a parcel of shares&mdash;or, as other people have suggested, to land, stamp collections, coins, art works or whatever, is a gain in capital value which is taxed as capital gains when the items are sold. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A portfolio of antiques or a portfolio of philatelic value has some degree of flexibility. I can sense an attitude that starts off with managed investment trusts extending through share markets to those other areas of alternative investment which I have mentioned. Just because we start with the thin end does not mean to say we should not resist the wedge coming through all the way. I think it is right to resist that wedge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this Government wants to deem that capital gains are equal to income, I will resist it, because that is just nonsense. It is illogical, it is inaccurate, it is unfair and it is not even good English&mdash;and we should always be on our guard against the misuse of the English language. Capital gains are not income, never will be, and should not be treated that way. The Minister has not yet explained why we should make this unfair, illogical, inaccurate and bad English attack on what people understand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fundamental of our laws is the language. If people understand that there is a capital gains tax to be applied when they sell things and when they have the money in their hands, that is how they behave. They organise their affairs accordingly&mdash;and organise their affairs they have, on the strength of what they understood to be plain English. Here we have this deeming business which defies all logicality as far as I am concerned&mdash;and that is not very good English either. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the other aspect of what financial advisers are and are not doing. There was one aspect of the Minister's response which concerned me greatly. I agree&mdash;in fact, it is a platitude&mdash;that those who will be most affected are those who have the biggest shareholdings. Wow, that is really enlightening stuff. Of course that will be the case. But those who are in that situation do not need us to leap to their defence. Of course, it is worth while for financial planning advisers to take the trouble to rearrange their affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people who will be most significantly affected are not those people at all. The significant effect will be felt by those people who have a part pension and who would have that pension compromised by the Government's deeming that their small capital gains are income and enough to take them off the pension entirely. Those people are not necessarily in the category of having large shareholdings; they are people who have a few shares, and they could well be people in what I think is the average range of seeing perhaps $700 to $1,000 accrue to their share portfolio over a year. It might be that $700 or $800 is taken off it by movements in the share market in a subsequent year. One year they are on the pension and the next year they are off the pension. One person who wrote to me said, `At my time of life, at 82 years of age, I do not need this hassle'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to respond to the comments made by the Minister for Health (Senator Richardson) in relation to the private member's Bill introduced by my colleague Senator Patterson. I regret that the Minister has left the chamber, because his speech was not really a very spirited defence of the Government's position. I am led to the conclusion that had he been the Minister last year, this private member's Bill may not have been necessary. But he has to defend the Government line, and defend it he does.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole thrust of the problem that we as a Liberal-National party coalition foresee is that the Labor Party is treating people differently. True, there are differences between valuations of private company shares and public company shares, and it is more difficult to invest overseas for elderly people, but the whole problem is that the Government is treating people differently. It is making particular selections. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask Senator Collins what the next level will be. We have seen a progression. We have seen the introduction of a wealth tax on that section of the Australian community that can least bear this cost. With the increased value of their share or their investment bond, they lose a proportion of their investment because it comes off their pension. That is a wealth tax. The Government started off with friendly society bonds. Any increase in their value reduces the pension. Increases in management investment trusts reduce the pension. Now it is concentrating on increases in the value of shares. What is the next item the Government will be looking for? It will be the family home. Pensioners out there, beware, because this Government has a very bad track record. We have what is tantamount to a wealth tax. We are increasingly seeing evidence of this coming through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have legislation before us at present regarding eligible termination payments and the death benefit component which pass to a person who is not a member of the family. An increased value of tax will be applied, but it is being applied in a very discriminatory way. Taxes should be fair; they should be equitably distributed; and they should be borne by those who are in the best position to afford them. The Government is trying it out with the pensioners, and it may be the beginning of a wealth tax for all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the debates on superannuation, the Government consistently implored Australians to save more. The whole thrust of the superannuation guarantee levy was that the increased amounts of money had to be put aside by employers on behalf of their employees to provide for their retirement; people had to be encouraged to save for their retirement. This very proposition discourages people from retiring, from investing and from hedging against inflation rather than putting their money under their beds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What incentive is there in this? I support the proposition put by our shadow Minister. The Government has taken a very cynical line as to why we introduced this at the time. True, we were expecting to be in government. We undertook that when in government we would revise it, examine it and change it. Because we are not in government, we have had to do the second best thing. We have raised it as a private member's Bill, both here and in the other place, to ensure that those people in the community who can least afford to have their savings knocked back are not disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The need for this level of savings is written about constantly by every responsible financial journalist in this country. The problem with Australia is that our level of savings is too low. That is why we owe the rest of the world so much money. This move is a retrograde step in so many areas. I commend Senator Patterson for her initiative and for honouring the undertaking that we gave to the pensioners of Australia. Well done, Senator Patterson of the Liberal Party. </PARA>

I pay particular tribute to the work of Senator Maguire, who chaired that committee very well and, of course, to my colleague Senator Teague who, as deputy chairman, really did a lot of very fine work. Senator Teague, as we all know in this chamber, has a very great and sincere interest in foreign affairs particularly, which is well evidenced by his very great knowledge and understanding of foreign affairs, and his very close contacts with&mdash;I suspect I would be right in saying&mdash;all of the representatives of foreign countries who are resident here in Canberra. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not just a question of being kind; it is very obvious. I do not think anyone in this chamber would in any way say anything different. Senator Teague did at some length indicate the reasons why that committee should be retained; I do not want to repeat them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I do want to draw attention to the inquiry by that committee&mdash;to which Senator Teague made rather lengthy reference&mdash;into Australia's relationships with Latin America. That was a first report; that was the first time any parliamentary group had made any in-depth study into our relationships with Latin America. As Senator Teague has rightly said, it has become almost the&mdash;I think `bible' might be taking it a bit far&mdash;principal reference book for anyone in Australia who might be interested in doing business with, or having cultural, sporting or other links with, the countries of Latin America. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of that report on our relationships with Latin America, the committee received an enormous number of congratulatory remarks&mdash;very encouraging remarks&mdash;and a lot has eventuated from that it. It is a report that I think will long be referred to by people interested in dealings with Latin America. Certainly it was, as Senator Teague said, a report that had the very enthusiastic support of the diplomatic representatives of Latin American countries in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is more than a shame, it is a tragedy, that the Government, because of its own inefficiencies, wants to get rid of that committee. Like so much that this Government does, there are other ways of correcting any perceived difficulties it has. One would be to manage the committees a bit better. Possibly the Government could make sure that the workload was not quite as heavy, but still retain those committees, particularly the foreign affairs, defence and trade committee, which has really carved out for itself a major niche in the parliamentary system. The Government could well retain that committee but look at lessening in some way the workload on it and on other committees. </PARA>

As Senator Teague says we, the Liberal and National parties, would be more than willing to negotiate with the Government on any suitable reforms that need to be made to make sure that all of the existing committees can operate effectively. Senator Panizza's motion, which has not yet been moved but will be, makes provision for the retention of that committee while coming to some other arrangements which, hopefully, the Government and the Democrats may find acceptable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think Senator Bourne was a member of the foreign affairs, defence and trade committee and contributed substantially at times. I appreciate that when she became the Whip her time became a little more precious; she was not able to attend as often as she had previously. Senator Bourne is well aware of the fine work that that particular committee did. I ask Senator Bourne&mdash;as one who understands and has been part of that committee&mdash;to reconsider the proposal and not just simply go along with the Government willy-nilly. I ask her to have a look at other arrangement which may be able to be made which would allow those committees to remain in place, but possibly with a lesser workload. </PARA>

In comparison, in the banking industry, entry salaries are linked to qualifications and fairly constant across sectors, with a pass degree attracting about $26500 and no loading for a second language.</PARA>

This may also act as a disincentive to Australians with Japanese language skills to apply for tourist guide positions.</PARA>
