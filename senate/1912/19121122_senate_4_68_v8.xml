                    <para>- When progress was reported yesterday I was endeavouring to elicit from the Minister what powers are to be given to licensed pilots and their duties, and also to ascertain by what means the Government propose to test the qualifications of those who desire to be appointed as licensed pilots. These amendments would appear to be intended to meet the case of certain individuals who will not be authorized to art where pilotage is compulsory, and as a kind, of solatium to men who are not considered qualified to act in that capacity on account of age or incapacity. If that be the case, it means that licensed pilots are to be distinctly inferior to the ordinary pilots who will be appointed.</para>

                    <para>- Under the clause as it left the Senate coastal pilots were to take ships from one port to another, and there the matter ended. Under the amendments it would appear that these men are to have no power to act as pilots in any ports in which pilotage is compulsory. In Melbourne or Sydney, or any large port where pilotage is compulsory, there are men perhaps who have been acting as pilots there, but who, under this clause, will be precluded from so acting in the future. </para>

                    <para>-  I rise to order, sir, because if we are to have a discussion on the status of pilots now, probably we shall have a renewal of the discussion when we come to deal with the amendments to clauses 351 and 352. The amendments to clause 333 do not affect the status of pilots at all. The whole clause is not before the Committee, but only amendments altering the designation of " coastal " pilots. It is on the amendments to clauses 351 and 352 that the question of the respective duties of classes of pilots will arise. I ask whether it is in order, sir, on a mere amendment to alter the designation of " coastal " pilots to discuss the powers of different classes of pilots. </para>

                    <para>- There must be some reason for altering "coastal" to "licensed." It is impossible to discuss the meaning of " coastal" without referring to the latter part of the clause which enlarges the powers originally contemplated. The amendment to clause 351 does not deal with the powers of particular pilots and the reasons for the change, while the amendment to clause  352  deals with an entirely different class of pilot, and that is the man who is in compulsory charge of % ship. On this clause we are dealing with only one class of pilot, and not the ordinary pilot. I submit that I am in order in asking for information in reference to the clause. </para>

                    <para>-  The whole clause is before the Committee. It provided, as the Bill left the Senate, for coastal pilots, and we are now dealing with a new class of pilots. In the amendment the words " licensed pilots " are used, and there is a provision that a licensed pilot shall not, except as authorized by his licence, act in any port for which pilotage is compulsory. I submit that in the circumstances the whole question of both licensed and compulsory pilotage may be discussed under this clause. </para>

                    <para>- This question was raised yesterday afternoon. I have gone into the matter again, and it seems to me that the point of order must be. upheld. We are dealing with the House of Representatives' amendment to clause  333,  which merely changes the term " coastal " to " licensed." That is only a matter of designation. I again remind honorable senators that discussion of the widest kind, and ranging over the whole question of the duties and liabilities of pilots may take place when we are dealing with the House of Representatives' amendments to clauses  351  and  352.  I rule that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> will not be in order in discussing the duties and responsibilities of pilots on the motion now before the Committee. </para>

                    <para>. - I was discussing this matter when progress was reported last evening, and I have since had an opportunity to consult an expert on the question. The conversation I had was hurried, and it is possible that I did not quite gather what the pilot with whom I conversed intended to convey, but I was left under the impression that the pilots of Australia would all like to be classified as licensed or coastal pilots rather than as compulsory or Government pilots. The question put to the Minister in this connexion is a very simple one, though there may be something important behind it. I should like to learn from the honorable senator whether the technical examination for a licensed pilot will be the same as that prescribed for a Governmentpilot operating in ports where pilotage is compulsory. I stated yesterday afternoon that  there  is a difference in responsibility between a pilot who takes charge of a vessel and cargo worth£1,500,000, and one who takes charge of a small vessel at some outlying port. The answer to this suggestion from the other side is always that the lives of those on the small vessel are more valuable than a ship and cargo worth £1,500,000; but that answer only shirks the difficulty. Perhaps the Minister will say whether or not the qualifications required of licensed and Government pilots will be identical. </para>

He has told the Committee that it is desired to make the change, because " licensed " pilot is regarded as the most appropriate term. I would ask the honorable senator whether he seriously intended that statement to be regarded as an explanation, or as an answer, as to what has been said on this side? Would the honorable senator propose an alteration in a taxation system, and justify it by the mere statement that it was considered more appropriate ? </para>

The tenacity with which the Minister is hanging on to the proposed amendment would lead to the belief that there is something important about it. As I understand the matter, these pilots will be both coastal and licensed. They will be able to act only under a licence issued by the Government, and their operations will be limited to the coast of Australia. </para>

                        <para>- Does the honorable senator suggest that we could have a port inland, or outside the territorial waters of the Commonwealth? The waters in our ports are coastal waters. These men will be licensed by the Government, and their operations limited to the coastal waters of Australia. That being so, the original term of " coastal " pilots sufficiently designated the duties which these men will be called upon to discharge. As one title seems to be as explicit as the other, I should like to know why the Minister displays so much pertinacity in his endeavour to secure an alteration of the title. </para>

                    GOULD (New South Wales) [11.7]. - In dealing with the second amendment to the clause proposing the insertion after the word "Australia" of the words "or to act as pilots for any port at which pilotage is not compulsory," I suppose it is competent to ask whether it is proposed in this way to enlarge the powers of licensed pilots. Originally it was apparently intended that coastal pilots should take charge of ships only between one port of Australia and another, and it would not be competent for them to act inside of a port. Now it is proposed that they should take charge of ships from pne port to another, and also in ports for which pilotage is not compulsory. I would like to ask whether it is intended to have two classes of licensed pilots? Is k intended that some shall take charge of ships between one port and another, and others shall take charge of ships in ports for which pilotage is not compulsory? Again, it might be explained whether the" latter class is to be subdivided, and some pilots given the right to take charge of ships in particular ports and not in others, whilst some may be competent to take charge in all ports. The explanation given by the Minister amounts to very little. Instead of calling the place outside this building a street, we might call it a road, or even a lane, if that were not an indignity offered to one of the fine streets of Melbourne. But what difference would it make ? I recognise that additional duties are to be given to pilots. Is this done for the purpose of helping individuals who have not been considered as qualified to act as pilots in the ports of Melbourne, Adelaide, Sydney and Brisbane, and wherever pilotage may have been compulsory up to the present time ? Is it intended to give these gentlemen an opportunity of still earning a living as pilots, although they are not competent to take charge of ships in ports where pilotage is compulsory ? If these . men are not competent to occupy their positions as pilots, they should not be licensed Is there anything in the Bill to prohibit a master of a ship from taking a man on board and accepting his assistance for pilotage purposes although he is not a licensed' pilot ? The Bill, it is true, provides that  a  licensed pilot is not to act as a pilot for any port where pilotage is compulsory unless authorized to do so. But if the master of a ship considers that a man who may not be licensed is competent to give him advice and assistance in taking a ship into  a  port, is there anything to prevent the master making use of that assistance ? The Minister cannot point to a single clause in this Bill which would preclude a master from inviting a man to help him to navigate his ship into a port where pilotage is not compulsory. Suppose that
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline>
                    were to help the master of a ship in such a case. If an accident happened, the master would be liable. If
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline>
                    had been a licensed pilot, he and the master would be equally responsible. Is it not possible under this Bill for any man to go on board a ship and act as a pilot without running the slightest risk of punishment or interference on the part of the Government?

                <para class="block">That practically divides the 'ports of the Commonwealth into two classes - that is, ports at which pilotage is compulsory and; ports at which pilotage is not compulsory.. At compulsory ports there will be no licensed pilots. The examination in the case of licensed pilots will refer to the navigation of the port, where the licensed pilot is to act. In the case of compulsory pilots, it will be of a more general character. Let us assume - as of course will be the case - that Sydney will be made  at  port where pilotage will be compulsory.. In that port an examination as regards the competency of pilots will relate to their local knowledge of the port of Sydney. As regards, say, the port of Warrnambool" in Victoria, where pilotage will probably: not be compulsory, the qualifications for a licence will be the pilot's local knowledge of the port of Warrnambool. </para>

                        <para>- Of course that has to be taken into consideration. As honorable senators will see, in addition to pilots licensed for  a  particular port, there will be pilots who have licences for pilotage from port to port. They will more: strictly come under the designation of coastal pilots. Such a case occurs on the Queensland coast. There we shall have licensed pilots for pilotage within the Great Barrier reef running up to Thursday Island. There will not be an examination  as to their competency on that course for  any one route, but as to their competency to take a ship through the Barrier Reef and through the channel at Thursday Island. There are various ports along the route. Take the port of Townsville. There may be pilots at Townsville who will be licensed for Townsville only, and whose competency will be judged by their knowledge and seamanship with respect to Townsville only. The responsibility of these pilots does not arise under his amendment. It can be more conveniently discussed in connexion with the amendments to clauses 349 and 351. I wish to add as regards licensed pilots that this Bill does not alter their position in the slightest degree. </para>

As regards compulsory pilotage, wherever the Government declare a port to be one where pilotage is compulsory, the pilots will be Government servants. That is the only alteration made in this Bill from the position of pilots as they existed under State laws. </para>

                        <para>- I am not in a position to say. I understand that negotiations have been proceeding on those lines, but I do not think that the Government have committed themselves to anything, because, of course, the Bill is not law yet. I understand, however, that where pilots have been acting in ports where pilotage will be compulsory it is the intention to take them over. </para>

                        <para>- Melbourne will undoubtedly be a port where pilotage will be compulsory. Another point which has been raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> is with regard to his assumption that the master of a ship will be likely to do something in the way of engaging pilots which we ought to prevent him from doing. Clause 342 provides for certificates of exemption for masters who hold the necessary qualifications. If a master is qualified to pilot his own ship, he can apply for and get a certificate of exemption for a specified port or. a specified trade. </para>

I may add that we are not doing any injury to any class of pilots by this amendment, and that we are also safeguarding the shipping of Australia, as far as our pilotage provisions are concerned. </para>

                        <para>- To a brilliant intellect emanating from my honorable friend's country, that may be so. But it may not be brilliancy of intellect that induces some honorable senators to accept a Ministerial explanation without question. It may be merely a desire to shirk public duty. I have no wish to yield to that temptation. Whilst expressing my appreciation of the Minister's action in having made the explanation, I want him to go a little further, because there is still a lingering doubt in my mind as to the matter of responsibility. This Bill, as far as licensed pilots are concerned, undoubtedly maintains their right to their licences. But it does not seem to me to go far enough. Take the case of a pilot in Sydney. I understand that he has a licence to-day. </para>

There was also a question from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie about the Melbourne pilots, and I said that they were not public servants. I understand that in Sydney and' Newcastle, where there are compulsory pilots, the pilots are public servants. They would not be affected by the Bill. </para>

I see no clause in this Bill which* safeguards their interests. There is a clause which transfers their property, but there is no clause which transfers their right to employment under the CommonwealthThere is no provision which .will insure to* publicly-employed pilots to-day a continuance of public employment after the Bill becomes operative. </para>

                        <para>- Whatever is said about the Sydney and Newcastle pilots will apply to other ports where there is compulsory pilotage. The State Act provides that these men must be competent and liable to examination from time to time. If they are competent, as we must assume that they are, it is intended to take them over, but if they are incompetent undoubtedly the Commonwealth will not take them over. </para>

                    <para>. - The Minister's explanation is really what one might have anticipated. The Commonwealth proposes, although it as not provided for in the Bill, to continue in Government employment those pilots who are now employed by the State Government, always reserving to itself the fight to decline to employ obviously incompetent men. This clause, coupled with the following one, does secure to licensed pilots their existing rights as represented by their licences. Take the pilots in the port of Melbourne who are licensed pilots only. This measure provides not only that the Commonwealth shall respect their rights and continue their licences, but also that a licensed pilot shall not operate in a port in which pilotage is to be made compulsory. What are we going to do, then? The position is that a licence held by a pilot to-day is to be respected for what it is worth - that is to say, we shall continue existing rights. This clause says that a licence is to be operative for the purpose for which it was issued. The Melbourne pilots hold a licence to-day to operate in the port of Melbourne. The Bill respects that licence so far as the words written on the paper are concerned, but we have a clause to the effect that no licensed pilot shall operate when a port is declared a compulsory port. </para>

                        <para>- That, of course, is a very satisfactory explanation. It makes it obvious that, not merely in regard to pilots employed by the State, but in regard to pilots operating under licences, their rights will be respected as well in ports intended to be made compulsory as in ports to be left optional. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> knows quite well that there are terms used at present which we do not intend to continue. For instance, a licensed pilot in Melbourne is a port pilot, at a port where pilotage is compulsory. Under this measure a licensed pilot may be a port pilot, but a port pilot will not be a licensed pilot in the sense in which the term is used under the State Act. It is quite evident that in future a licensed pilot will not be a port pilot where pilotage is compulsory. </para>

                    <para>. - I have not gathered from the reply of the Minister whether an answer has been given to the question I addressed to him. I pointed out that there are pilots who are specially licensed to pilot ships between Townsville and Thursday Island. From the Minister's explanation, I take it that these men have been licensed because  of their special knowledge. I asked the Minister if there were any different tests, so far as examination was concerned, as to the technical or other skill of a pilot whose certificate entitled him to pilot vessels in a certain locality as against a pilot who is in the position of a Newcastle pilot - a Government servant. </para>

                        <para>- The difference between the two is simply that of local knowledge. There are pilots who have held for years certificates to pilot vessels between Townsville, Cooktown, and Thursday Island. They have been tested in various ways - by examination and, of course, by experience - and hold a certain status as pilots under the Queensland Act. What their position is to be under this Bill has not yet been made clear. Will they have to go through a new test ? Is it to be a separate or a new examination ? </para>

                        <para>- Will those who are simply licensed pilots for a particular portion of the coast of Australia, by reason of their tests and experience, be eligible to be pilots in ports where compulsory piloting will at once come into effect, and will such pilots be Government servants? The Torres Strait pilots must be exercised on that point. That explains why, in a short conversation I had with some pilots yesterday, the impression was given to me that they would have preferred the position regarding coastal pilots to have remained entirely as it was before the Bill was amended. The Minister is making a distinction now which did not prevail before. There are cases where the pilotage system has been a licensing system, but, according to the Minister's explanation, there will be some ports where there will not be licensed pilots. That at once draws a line of distinction in respect to the pilots in a port who are now licensed, but who, under this Bill, may not be public servants under the control of the Commonwealth. The point is, will the licensed pilots of to-day be entitled <inline font-style="italic">ipso facto</inline> - by reason of their work and experience - to be classified under the Bill as pilots directly in the employ of the Commonwealth ? </para>

I certainly hope that these pilots, who pass from the State service to that of the Commonwealth-, will find their positions improved under this Bill. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie raised the constitutional question, but I think the Minister was justified in asking that the Committee should be spared a discussion on the constitutional aspect of the matter. Still,I remind honorable senators thar there axe some public servants of the Commonwealth who, believing they had certain rights upon their transfer from the service of a State, took their claims to the High Court, only to- find that the constitutional section upon which they relied was a delusion and a snare. </para>

                <para class="block">The balance of the section deals with the case of officers who are retained, and we?  are not concerned with them. If on the transfer to the Commonwealth of the Public Department which controls pilots in New South Wales it is not desired to continue the service of any pilot now employed, we have no assurance that he will receive any compensation if the Commonwealth Government declines to employ him. There is absolutely no guarantee given under this Bill that pilots employed to-day under the State authority will, when this measure becomes operative, have their means of livelihood continued to them under the Commonwealth. What is the position with regard to the merely licensed pilot? Although some honorable senators seem to be abundantly satisfied with it, I invite any one of them to refer me to a single clause in this Bill which will give them any protection at all. All the pilots operating in the port of Melbourne to-day do so under a licence. What this Bill provides for is that the Commonwealth shall continue the licences of those pilots, but, having made that provision, we further provide that the possession of those licences shall not necessarily enable them to follow their present means of livelihood. We can assume that under this Bill Melbourne will be made a compulsory pilotage port, and, that being so, these men will be prohibited from acting as pilots in this port unless the Commonwealth Government steps in and employs them. I am given to understand that the Melbourne pilots have expressed themselves as not dissatisfied with the Bill as it stands. I hope that honorable senators who have had that intimation conveyed to them will not be unduly influenced by it. I venture to say that the pilots who have expressed that opinion arrived at their conclusion probably as the result of con-  suiting officers of the Department, and I do not know of any more dangerous guide which men so situated could seek than the officers of the Department, or the persons responsible for the drafting of this Bill. I can quite understand that they would view the matter from an entirely different stand-point from that from which it would be viewed by the pilots. The officers ot the Department may, in all good faith, have assured these men that their interests  are sufficiently safeguarded under the Bill, and yet that assurance may not have weight with those called upon to administer the Department, or if tested in the Courts of the country. Although I am very much pleased with the Minister's assurance, I think that even now some provision should be included in the Bill giving a specific guarantee to pilots in the port of Melbourne, and others similarly situated., not merely that they will have their existing licences continued to them, but that their transfer from licensed to compulsory pilots will be observed, honoured, and respected by the Government. </para>

                    <para>. - There is a good deal in the contention regarding the status of men who have served as pilots and done good work in the pilotage service in the past. The Minister of Defence admits that under this Bill no guarantee is given to them that, when the Commonwealth takes over the pilotage service, they will be given any employment. I do not think that any trouble will arise so far as compulsory pilotage ports are concerned, but we have to consider the case of ports where at present only licensed pilots are engaged. In the port of Melbourne, there are twenty-two licensed pilots, who possess property worth many thousands of pounds. The Government make provision for taking over their property when the pilotage service is taken over by the Commonwealth, but there is no guarantee given that the Commonwealth will take over the men. They may decide that, instead of having twenty-two pilots for the port of Melbourne, it will be necessary to have only eleven, and, therefore, eleven of the existing pilots will be sent about their business. They will still hold their licences, but these will be useless to them, because their employment will have been taken away. </para>

The clause we are now dealing with has no reference whatever to pilots in the Public Service of the Commonwealth, but only to licensed pilots. It reads -  (1.) The Minister may subject to the regulations license persons (in the Act called licensed pilots) to conduct ships from one port to another in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- The amendment of the House of Representatives inserts after the word " Australia " the words "or to act as pilots at any port at which pilotage is not compulsory under this Act." <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> desires to add to those words other words which would provide that licensed pilots already operating in ports which, under this Bill, may be proclaimed compulsory pilotage ports, shall be taken over as public servants of the Commonwealth. Suppose a port where there is no compulsory pilotage to-day, and that it is made a compulsory pilotage port. The pilots there would become public servants, because it is only intended to have public servants at such ports. I submit that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie's</inline> proposal is necessary in order to protect those persons who are pilots at present. I think the suggestion of the  Chairman  that the proposed words should be put in as an addition would meet the requirements. During the consideration of this matter, we have gone so far as to amend another clause in the Bill because of an amendment made in a clause amended by the House of Representatives. The Minister said that he proposed to accept that amendment, provided an addition were made to another clause. No objection was raised to that procedure. Now we are only proposing to amend the very clause which is under consideration, and to make an addendum to it which would induce many honorable senators to accept the amendment submitted by the other Chamber. I submit, therefore, that it is competent for the Committee to consider the amendment. </para>

All that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> is endeavouring to do is to protect the interests of those men who are taken into the Commonwealth service. I hope that the Minister will not endeavour to defeat the amendment by a technicality. We ought to consider it from the point of view of the justice of the case. We know that it is quite possible for a Department to be taken over by the Commonwealth and for its officers to receive very scurvy treatment, as was the case with the South Australian post and telegraph officers. </para>

                <para>I ruled, somewhat reluctantly, that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie's</inline> amendment was out of order, because it was not relevant to the amendment of the House of Representatives which the Committee was discussing. Clause  333  of the Navigation Bill, on which an amendment had been made by the other Chamber, has reference only to the licensing of coasting pilots, and, in my opinion, has nothing whatever to do with the employment of pilots in the Public Service; nor has it any relation to those ports in which pilotage will be compulsory. In fact it goes further and prohibits coastal pilots, where pilotage is not compulsory, from having anything to do with ports where pilotage is compulsory. I further ruled that the amendment was not in order on the ground that such an amendment, if moved at all, could only have been relevant to clause  331  of the Bill,, which was not then under discussion, and which dealt with compulsory pilotage and with the employment of pilots who were officers of the Public Service. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has dissented from my ruling, and I have much pleasure in leaving the matter for your decision. </para>

                <para>If the standing order stopped there, I should admit that the decision of the Temporary Chairman was unchallengeable. But it does not stop there. I think you will observe from what I am about to quote, not merely that there is an addition, but that there is a qualification in the direction of enlarging the power of discussion, and necessarily the making of amendments upon amendments of the House of Representatives. The standing order continues -  nor can an amendment be moved to the Bill unless the same be relevant to or consequent upon either the acceptance, amendment, or the rejection of a House of Representatives' amendment. </para>
                <para>That phrase "consequent upon" is entirely different from " revelant to," and suggests that we are entitled under the Standing Orders to take the view that where an amendment is made by the other House, which viewed in a technical sense would require either a negative or an affirmative decision from the Committee, we are entitled to consider an amendment upon that amendment, realizing that an important amendment must have an effect upon the structure of the Bill itself. I submitted to the Temporary  Chairman  of Committees that the amendment made by the other House might be likened to taking a brick out of a wall. It would be absurd to say that we can only deal with the removal of the one brick. We have a right to consider the effect the removal is likely to have upon the wall of which it forms a part. </para>

                        <para>-  But we are entitled to make amendments which are " consequent upon " amendments made elsewhere. Just as the effect of removing one brick from a wall may be so to weaken the structure that we have to put in iron bolts and to underpin it, so we may have to make amendments in a Bill before us, in order to make allowance for amendments made elsewhere. Having dealt generally with what I conceive to be the rights of the Committee under the standing order, I want to deal with the amendment itself in its relation to clause 333. The Committee was engaged in considering an amendment which inserted in the clause the words "or to act as» pilots in any port at which pilotage is not compulsory." Those words have reference to the issue of licences to pilots who are to be intrusted with pilotage duties in ports where pilotage is not compulsory. It was useless for the Committee to ask whether or not it was favorable to the issue of licences unless it could also consider the "rights and privileges conferred by the licences. We have to turn to clause 335 to ascertain what is to be done in regard to these licences. Taking the two clauses together, it is proposed that the Commonwealth shall issue a licence to pilots to act in non-compulsoTy ports, or, where licences are in existence to-day, renew them under Federal authority. In the port of Melbourne, and perhaps in other ports, there are licensed pilots who are not Government employes, but act under licences issued by the Government. Under this clause and the one to which I have just referred, licences will be issued by the Commonwealth to these men, but as Melbourne will be a compulsory port, by the addition of these words we would say to the present holders of State licences, " Although we provide for the issue of a Federal licence to you, we shall not allow you to use it," because under the clause the licences are only to be issued in respect to ports which are not compulsory. That being so, we have to accept the words of the amendment from the other House, or to reject them, or to accept them with an addition. The object of the addition to the amendment is to safeguard existing rights. Can it be said that the words are unconnected with, or irrelevant to, or have no bearing upon, the words which the Committee is asked to add ? Suppose, for instance, that two men are bargaining about a horse, that the intending purchaser offers <inline font-style="italic">£20,</inline> and that the vendor says, " I want £25." And suppose that the would-be purchaser says to the vendor, " If you will throw in the saddle and the bridle I will give you <inline font-style="italic">£25."</inline> Will any one say that the saddle and the bridle are not relevant to the deal ? Now, the other House has made an addition to clause 333, and we say that we are prepared to accept that amendment with the addition of certain words. I submit that any alternative condition that we like to put in asa reason for the acceptance of the proposal from the other House must be in order. </para>

The use of the words "nor can" indicates a still further prohibition., </para>

                <para class="block">Again, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> misread the standing order. The first part of the standing order deals with an amendment of the other House, but the second part deals with an amendment which we can make, not upon the amendment of the other House, but upon the Bill. The honorable senator did not stress the word " Bill." My contention is that we can do one of two things. We can amend the amendment of the other House, but our amendment must be relevant to the subject-matter of their amendment, or we can amend another portion of the Bill, as we have already done, on the ground that the amendment is consequential upon our acceptance or rejection of the amendment of the other House. In the previous case, we have an amendment of the other House to a certain clause. There was another clause which was not amended by the other House, but which was affected by the amendment with which we were dealing, and the latter portion of standing order 219 deals only with that class of cases. Consequent upon our acceptance or rejection or amendment of an amendment of the other House we are entitled to amend a clause with which that House has never dealt. That is what the latter part of standing order. 219 means, and I think that no one knows that better than does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen.</inline> Clause 331 deals with two points, namely, the question of compulsory pilots as dis. tinct from licensed pilots,' and, secondly, with the question of what pilots shall be in the Public Service of the Commonwealth. Before the Bill was sent to the other House the Senate was entitled to say that licensed pilots under certain conditions should come into the Public Service of the Commonwealth, but it did not avail itself of that opportunity. We have now to deal with clause 333, only so far as it has been amended by the other House. Here we find two limitations. First, the clause does not deal with compulsory pilots at all or with the Public Service of the Commonwealth, but simply with licensed pilots. The amendment of the other House deals with neither of those points, but only with the name of the licensed pilots, that is with the question of whether they shall be called "coastal" or "licensed" pilots. As regards the other limitation the clause simply lays down what a licensed pilot may do. Neither the clause nor the amendment deals with compulsory pilotage, but solely with licensed pilots, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline></para>
                <para class="block">Guthrie's amendment deals with two things. It says, in effect, that the Commonwealth shall make licensed pilots compulsory pilots, and take them, into itsPublic Service. The amendment cannot,. I contend, be held to be relevant either to the amendment of the other House or to the clause with which we are dealing, nor can we under the latter part of standing order 219 amend clause 331, which deals with both those matters, because it is not relevant to our acceptance or rejection or amendment of the proposal of the other House, which deals entirely with licensed pilots. For these reasons, sir, I think that you should uphold the ruling of the Temporary  Chairman. </para>

                <para>Then it would have been necessary to see whether, consequent upon that alteration, another clause of the Bill ought to have been amended, and we could have amended clause 331, which reads as follows -  (1.) The Governor-General may proclaim the ports at which the employment of a pilot shaft be compulsory. (2.) At any such port the pilotage shall be performed by a pilot in the Public Service of the Commonwealth. </para>
                <para class="block">We could have amended sub-clause 2 by providing that at any such, port the pilotage should be performed by a licensed pilot. That amendment would have been consequent upon an amendment which we had made in clause 333. I submit that we can adopt <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie's</inline> amendment as being consequent upon our acceptance of the amendment from the other House, just as we are entitled at the present moment to alter the, words " or to act as pilots for any port at which pilotage is not compulsory." We can so alter that provision as to enable these persons to act as pilots for any port within the Commonwealth. If we can do that we can turn to the other clause, and provide, by omitting certain words and adding a word, that at such ports the pilotage shall be performed by licensed pilots. If we can make a consequential amendment in that way, can we not make an amendment in the straightforward way proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie?</inline> We want not simply to leave it within the power of the Minister to do this thing whether he likes it or not, but to provide that pilots who are now licensed by States may act in ports in which pilotage is made compulsory. We want to provide that licensed pilots shall continue to act as they have hitherto done. </para>

                    has contended that it is competent for the Senate to make an amendment on the amendment of the other House, but that the Senate's amendment must be relevant to the clause under discussion and the amendment of the other House. It has been pointed out by the Minister in charge of the Bill, and I think it has been held, that it is not competent for the Senate to make an amendment to an amendment of the other House which does not deal with the particular matter or clause under consideration. It has also been pointed out that this amendment would have been in order had it been proposed to an amendment to clause 331. I cannot see how there can be any argument against that position being taken up. The whole matter submitted in dealing with compulsory pilotage is confined to clause 331, and if we were to take this matter as dealing with clause 333, which provides for licensing pilots and the ports at which the licensees shall be able to carry out their work, it seems to me that this amendment would interfere not so much with that particular clause as with clause 331, which has already been passed. I think that the ruling of the Temporary  Chairman  is correct. In my opinion, the latter part of the standing order referred to by
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline>
                    means that where an amendment has been amended, agreed to, or dissented from, consequential amendments may be moved to bring the Bill into conformity with the action taken by the Committee. I rule, therefore, that the Temporary  Chairman  was correct in the ruling he gave with regard to the amendment submitted by

                        <para>- No; but to render licensed pilots eligible to act , in ports at which pilotage is compulsory. If my amendment be carried, I intend to propose a subsequent amendment, which I will indicate. Under my proposal, assuming that Melbourne is made a compulsory pilotage port, licensed pilots operating in that port at the present time would be entitled to be licensed to continue to operate in that port. If the amendment I now move be agreed to, it will' be necessary to amend clause 331 consequentially. Sub-clause 2 of that clause reads -  (2.) At any such port the pilotage shall be performed by a pilot in the Public Service of the Commonwealth. </para>

It would afford the Government an opportunity to do an act of simple justice, and give the men at present licensed as pilots for the port of Melbourne the right to continue in their occupation. The Government practically say to these men, " We will give you a licence, but we will not take you into the Public Service." </para>

                        <para>- The Government will not necessarily take these men into the Public Service. I desire to bring all these pilots within the one category of licensed pilots, with a right to employment in any port covered by their licence. Of course, the regulations will provide for the necessary qualifications to enable a person to secure a licence. I submit that my proposal offers a fair and reasonable way of dealing with this matter, in view of the difficulties which our Standing Orders presented in connexion with the amendment submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie.</inline> The amendment I propose is, I submit, clearly within the competency of the Committee, because we may amend the amendment of the House of Representatives as we think fit, and may then make consequential amendments in the Bill. If this amendment be made, it will be necessary to make a consequential amendment, as I have stated, in clause 331, or otherwise the provision in clause 331 would conflict with clause 333. </para>

                    GOULD (New South Wales) [2.35]. - Honorable senators must make up their minds as to whether they will do justice to- these people. If they consider that the position would only be made worse by accepting my amendment, well and good. The Minister naturally fights to maintain the position taken up by the Government, but that does not appear to be any reason why the Minister administering this measure should not have control over licensed pilots as well as over Government pilots. If a Government pilot makes a serious mistake, which shows incompetence or incapacity, the Minister may deal with him. And I contend that if a licensed pilot were to make a serious mistake, indicating incompetency or incapacity, the Minister could deal with him just as effectively by taking away his licence. What further control the Minister could desire I am at a loss to understand. My only object in submitting the amendment was to leave a way open to the Government to deal with these licensed pilots in such a way as would be satisfactory to them and the public gene rally. It is natural to suppose that the Government would be more careful in issuing licences to pilots for ports frequented by great ocean liners than for ports like Warrnambool or Port Pine, frequented by very much smaller vessels. I have said that if my amendment be agreed to it will be necessary to make a consequential amendment to clause 331.

                <para class="block">If the amendment made by the House of Representatives in this clause means anything, it means that a man who holds a licence to act as pilot in a port may or may not be taken over as a Commonwealth public servant. If he is not taken over his licence will become absolutely useless and his living will be gone. The men. composing the pilot service of Australia to-day are the picked men of the mercantile marine. They have thrown up commissions as master mariners for the purpose of acting as pilots. All of them have had to pass stringent examinations, and they are liable to be examined at any time. If it is found that they are suffering from any defect, physical or mental, their licences may be cancelled. I want to safeguard their interests. In the port of Melbourne, we have twenty-two Hobson's Bay pilots and six river pilots. In Port Pirie, South Australia, and in Port Augusta, there are also a number. As far as  1  can see, the object of the Government in having this amendment made is that they want to have power to pick up the best men, and let the others go. I am not prepared to permit that to be done. When Federation was brought about, a promise was made that public servants that were taken over to the Commonwealth Public Service wouldl have all rights which they had secured under State Acts guaranteed to them. Although the pilot service will not be a transferred Department in the sense in which that term is used in the Constitution, we ought to make good the promise made, and recognise th' rights of the pilots by taking them over into the Commonwealth Service. </para>

Clause  331  of the Bill deals definitely and exclusively with the question which the -amendment affects. The amendment intro.duces the principle that pilots at a port where pilotage is compulsory, shall become members of the Commonwealth Public Service. I cannot say that that is relevant to clause  335.  It seems to me that the question raised is practically on " all-fours " with that which was settled this :morning by a ruling of the  President. </para>

                        <para>-  I think there is a difference between the question ruled upon toy the  President  this morning and that raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie's</inline> amendment. The amendment, first of all, contains a declaration as to what privileges' shall be conferred upon the holders of pilot licences. The amendment of the House of- Representatives takes something away from the holders of licences. Surely, if an amendment can be made in the clause withdrawing something from them, we can insert words adding compensation. That is all that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie's</inline> amendment does. The House of Representatives says, in effect, " We put a disability on these licences." <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> proposes to accept that disability, but to add an advantage. I submit that if a limit can be put in in one direction, we can make an amendment granting an extension in another. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has argued as though we were at liberty to deal with the whole clause. . That is the fallacy which he and others have been constantly falling into. The Standing Orders Jay upon us the duty, not of dealing with the clause at this stage, but with the amendments of the House of Representatives. That is a very different thing. The only question is whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie's</inline> amendment is in any way consequential upon the acceptance or rejection of the House of Representatives' amendment. That amendment does not affect the privileges of the compulsory pilots in the least degree, and the compulsory pilots are the only persons who can become public servants under this Bill. An amendment upon the House of Representatives' amendment must be relevant to the question of whether these licensed pilots shall or shall not act as pilots for any port at which pilotage is not compulsory under the  measure. That is the only question at issue. I submit that it is not relevant to raise any question as to whether these pilots shall or shall not become public servants. That is another question altogether, which will have to be determined by this Parliament. The amendment raises no question of the pay or status of the pilot It merely deals with the ports at which they can act. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator. Guthrie</inline> wants to alter the whole status of the men. The amendment is clearly governed by the previous ruling of the  President. </para>

                        <para>-  The question raised by my amendment is what is to be done with the pilots who are to be dealt with under the clause? The position is that, after this Bill passes and the pilot service is controlled by the Commonwealth, there will be in existence certain uncancelled! and certain unexpired licences. In this clause, the Government ask for the right to take over a certain number of certificated pilots into the Public Service, and to reject the others. At present, there is no provision to protect the rights of those who now hold certificates. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> was, I think, a little premature in proposing his amendment to this clause. It should have been proposed to amendment 154, which is to insert after " pilot " the words -  but no such licence shall entitle the holder to act as pilot at a port at which pilotage is compulsory under this Act.  If it were proposed to be made there it could not be objected to, I think, on the ground that it was not relevant to the amendment of the other House, because that amendment deals with the pilots who are to be taken over, and the desire of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> is to protect the rights and interests of those men when they are taken over. </para>

Unless my amendment is made, the Government may decide to work the port of Melbourne with twelve pilots instead of with twenty-eight as at present, so that sixteen men would be deprived of their livelihood. To all intents and purposes, licensed pilots at present are public servants. My amendment does not apply to the port of Melbourne alone, but to a number of ports which, probably, are equally important, so far as pilotage is concerned. I think that we should, in justice to these men, preserve their opportunities to earn a livelihood. </para><interjection>

                        <para>-  On a point of order, sir, I ask whether this amendment can be moved here, because it seems to me that it raises the old question. Clause 335 deals with the State licences of licensed pilots, and the amendment of the other House places a sort of prohibition, or, rather, limitation on those licences; and it seems to me that any amendment must be relevant to the question of whether the holder of a State licence is entitled to act as a pilot at a port at which pilotage is compulsory under this Bill. I do not think that it needs any argument to satisfy you, sir, that this amendment is on all-fours with the other proposal which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> submitted. </para>

                        <para>-  The Minister admitted that this amendment is a limitation of the rights which are conferred upon the pilots by the State licences. If we are entitled to place a limitation upon the purpose and use of the licences we are equally entitled to expand them. What <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> says, in effect, is that as we place a limitation upon the licences we should as a set-off against that, give the holders of the licences something in the nature of a compensation. Let us look at the wording of this amendment. No such licence shall entitle to do something; he is not entitled to do it by reason of the licence. If we say that he is not entitled, because of the licence to do one thing, we are equally-entitled to say that because of the licence he is entitled to do another thing. If we pass a form of words the effect of which is to take away a man's livelihood", it is relevant to those words to say, as a set-off, that we give him something; and that is what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> proposes. I see no reason why it should be regarded as being; out of order. </para>

                        <para>-  Suppose that we had a free hand to deal with this amendment. We could substitute the words I have mentioned, and provide that every such licence shall entitle the holder to receive a fixed amount, so that he would be in a position to carry out certain duties assigned to him. I take it that if we can impose a prohibition or limitation upon the holder of a licence it is competent for the Committee to provide any compensation which, in its opinion, he is entitled to receive on account of our having deprived him of something which he now posseses. In other words, it must be as competent for the Committee to compensate the holder of a licence for any right or privilege of which it deprives him as it is to deprive him of that right or privilege. I think, sir, that you would unduly limit the power of the Committee if you were to hold that it had no power to deal with the question of compensating the pilots for the withdrawal of certain advantages which they now possess. </para>

                        <para>-  I can hardly see the force of the argument advanced by the Minister. The amendment of the other House is a restriction of the rights which are now held by licensed pilots, and the object of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie's</inline> proposal is to conserve and expand the rights which that House has restricted. Surely, in dealing with the amendment of the other House, the Committee is entitled to say whether the rights of licensed pilots shall be expanded or conserved. If the Bill is passed in its present form a distinction will be set up be tween the pilots, and the result will be that some will be licensed and others will not be licensed. What is to happen to those whose licences may be taken away? All that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> is trying to do is to preserve their rights. Out of a sense of justice, the Committee should conserve the rights of pilots who are taken over from the States; and  1  cannot see that the amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> is not relevant to the amendment of the other House. </para>

                        <para>-Colonel  Cameron. -  The whole of this trouble appears to me to have arisen out of the changing of a word which was descriptive of the pilots. I refer to the amendment of the other House to substitute " licensed" for " coastal." It is out of a desire to protect the interests of port' pilots who require to possess special knowledge that all this trouble has arisen. Had the distinctive words "coastal pilots" been retained, the term " licensed pilots " might have been retained in the amendment without any doubt as to the proper interpretation. It is the interpretation of " licensed " which seems to have bothered every honorable senator. The use of the word "licensed" has apparently conveyed a double meaning to the minds of honorable senators. We shall have two classes of pilots - men requiring special qualifications as pilots for ports at which pilotage is made compulsory, and coastal pilots. I believe that if the term " coastal pilots " had been retained, no difficulty would have arisen. </para>

                            can be accepted. It seems to me that it cannot be accepted, for the reason that it is not relevant to the amendment before the Chair, nor is it consequent upon the acceptance or rejection of that amendment. It proposes to put licensed pilots on the same footing as Government pilots dealt with in clause  331.  The amendment would bring the clause before the Committee into conflict with clause  331,  and I think it is going too far to say that it is consequential upon the acceptance or rejection of the amendment of the House of Representatives in this clause. I have no wish to curtail discussion or the opportunities afforded to honorable senators to submit amendments, but on my reading of standing order 219 I have no option but to refuse to accept the amendment. The standing order says -

                <para>SenatorLt.-Colonel <inline font-weight="bold">Sir ALBERT</inline> GOULD. - Just so. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie's</inline> amendment has again been ruled out of order, and perhaps it would have been just as well if the Committee had considered an amendment which I submitted in connexion with an earlier clause. However, the honorable senator expressed himself as quite satisfied that he could do what he desired by proposing an amendment when we came to clause 335. He submitted his amendment, with the result that it is ruled out of order. The honorable senator is not prepared to question the ruling, and we are now unable to further consider the matter. We have now to accept the amendment of the House of Representatives or cut out altogether the words " but no such licence shall entitle the holder to act as pilot at a port at which pilotage is compulsory under this Act." In view of the provision in clause 331, it may be contended that these words would be surplusage", because under that clause only certain pilots who will be Government servants will be permitted to take charge of ships in ports at which pilotage is compulsory. The Committee has proved itself powerless to make any amendment which would provide for simple justice being done to men who have been in the pilot service for many years, and who may, under this Bill as it stands, have to leave the ports in which they have been engaged, and earn a living as they best can. I congratulate honorable senators upon the beautiful tangle into which they have got themselves in connexion with this matter. </para>

They would be entitled to say, " We have certain qualifications, and have done certain service. There are certain vacancies for which we are eligible, why should we not be appointed to fill them? " I cannot imagine that the Government would exclude these men, who have shown themselves competent to act as pilots in ports at which pilotage will be made compulsory. </para>

                    (New South Wales) 13-36]- - I was very much surprised to note that some honorable senators appear to regard the word " eligible " as equivalent to the word "entitled." I can give a concrete instance in which it will be seen that the two words may mean something quite different. Under the laws of New South Wales a man is entitled by will to receive property, but if it takes the form of some tenures created under the State land laws, although he is entitled to receive the property under a will, he is not eligible to hold it if he is already the possessor of a certain area of land otherwise obtained. If

                    Ledger's amendment be accepted, the holders of these licences will not be entitled to act as compulsory pilots at ports at which pilotage is compulsory, "but the fact that the Commonwealth Government will honour their State certificates  by giving Commonwealth certificates in exchange for them will render them eligible to receive Government employment in ports at which pilotage will be compulsory. The Minister has said that it is the intention of the Government to give them this employment. This brings me to a statement made by the Minister a little time ago. He said that the representatives of the Port Phillip pilots had communicated with him, and he mentioned in an impressive way, which showed that he must him self have been impressed, that they had expressed themselves as absolutely satisfied with both the Bill and the Ministerial assurance. Honorable senators can picture for themselves what happened. This body of simple-minded, honest, guileless sailor men approached the Minister, and with a touch of pathos laid before him the position in which they are situated. They say, " Here we are with our wives and families, and we fear that our occupations are threatened by this Bill of yours." The Minister turns to them-, and with an ample flow of words, says, "My dear friends, how could you entertain a suspicion of this Government? The one purpose for which the Government lives, and for which I occupy this Ministerial' chair, is to make your lot in life happier. Can you doubt me? Leave it all to me, and be satisfied that this Bill of ours will make your last condition better than your first."

Rights can only be secured in one way, and that is by an Act of Parliament. </para>

                        <para>. - In some States, in particular New South Wales, pilotage exemption certificates have, in the past, been granted to masters without discrimination as to nationality. This is the practice in Great Britain also, though it is, I believe, proposed in a Pilotage Bill  now before the House of Commons to discontinue the practice. Representations have been made by the Board of Trade, as welT as by several foreign Governments, that it would be an injustice to the holders of existing certificates to take them away. There is considerable weight in this, and as the number of aliens who hold Board of Trade certificates as masters, and also pilotage exemption certificates, is not great, and will in course of a few years disappear, it is proposed to conserve existing rights in this respect. Pilotage exemption certificates will be issued in regard to Australian-registered and certain classes of British ships only, and will not be available for foreign vessels. I move - . </para>

In accordance with the provisions of an International Convention in regard to Collisions and Salvage, to which practically the whole of the maritime nations are parties, the defence of " compulsory pilotage " has been abolished. That: is to say, that it is to be no longer a good defence for the master of a vessel that has. caused damage to another vessel to plead that he was required by the law to carry a pilot, arid that such pilot was in charge. Clause 352 deals with this by expressly 'declaring that such circumstances shall not confer immunity from liability upon the master or 'owner of the ship in fault. Seeing, then, that the master is the responsible party, it must be made clear that the charge of the ship remains in his hands. The pilot will be in charge merely as pilot, but the master may supersede him at any moment, whenever his experience and knowledge tell him the ship is being run into danger. The amendment is to make it clear that the pilot is there as a pilot only, but is not in charge of the ship. </para><interjection>

                            GOULD (New South Wales) [3.47].- The change proposed to be made in this clause is a very . important one. As the law stands, when the master of a ship is compelled to receive a pilot on board, the pilot, as far as the navigation of the vessel is concerned, is master of the situation. The skipper is relieved of responsibility in connexion with that matter. But it may be that under certain circumstances the master of a ship might take upon himself the responsibility of disregarding the directions, or instructions of the pilot in charge. . The responsibility would be a very grave one as the law stands. This clause refers to a case where pilotage is not compulsory, but where the master of a vessel chooses to take on board a pilot to assist him in' navigating his vessel. In that case, unquestionably the master is still in control of the shipyard the pilot is his servant. In just the same way as any other person employed1 on the ship the master or owner becomes responsible for the actions of his servant, the pilot. Under this Bill, the master is compelled to take the first pilot whose services are offered. He cannot pick and choose. There may be some reason why a particular pilot at a particular time is not believed to be competent. The incompetency may be believed to be due to illness or intoxication. Nevertheless, that pilot has to be taken.
