                    <para>- I should like, by leave of the Senate, to make a personal explanation. It has reference to certain remarks and incidents which passed between myself and another senator on the occasion of our last meeting. I then used certain words, and should like to explain by relating the following facts: - In February,  1899,I  published an address to the electors of North Brisbane, in which I stated that I stood as a candidate in the interests of the Opposition. Secondly, the Opposition was then led by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Charles</inline> Powers, and the Labour party by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Anderson</inline> Dawson. The line of political demarcation was clear and distinct. With regard to legislation and social questions, my address to the electors contained the following paragraph: - </para>

                        <para>- I bow to your ruling, sir. It is sufficient for me to say that my election address can be found in print. The third point is this. In December,  1899,  I was invited by the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Anderson</inline> Dawson to take the portfolio of Postmaster-General in his Ministry, with a seat in the Queensland Legislative Council. That offer to me was unconditional. &#91; refused it. I need not enter into the reasons. So far, then from coquetting with the Labour party, I refused to take any political advantage of the offer made to me. I beg now to say to the Senate that, whilst I recognise that the language which 1 used was inconsistent with the dignity of the Senate, and with the spirit and intention of the Standing Orders, I hope that you, sir, and the Senate, will take into consideration the strong sense of irritation which I felt, and the circumstance that I considered certain remarks made to be a reflection upon my personal and political honour. </para>

                        <para>- My impression is that it would be better to embody a definition of &#34; Asiatics &#34; in this Bill. It is all very well to say that a word is understood, but all of us who have to do with business know how misunderstandings continually arise through matters not being put in black and white. I propose to read a short extract from the <inline font-style="italic">Encyclopædia Britannica</inline> bearing on the subject. It states </para>
                    </talk.start>
                </continue>
                <para>Asia, including its outlying islands, has become the dwelling-place of all the great families into which the races of men have been divided. By far the largest area is occupied by the Mongolian group. These have yellow-brown skin, black eyes and hair, flat noses, and oblique eyes. They are short in stature, with little hair on the body and face. In general terms they extend, with modifications of character probably due to admixture with other types and to varying conditions of life, over the whole of northern Asia as far south as the plains bordering the Caspian Sea, including Tibet and China, and also over the Indo-Malayan Peninsula and Archipelago, excepting Papua and some of the more eastern islands. </para>
                <para>Next in numerical importance to the Mongolians are the races which have been called by Professor Huxley Melanochroic (dark skin) and Xanthochroic (light skin). The former includes the dark-haired people of Southern Europe, and extends over North Africa, Asia Minor, Syria, to South-western Asia, and through Arabia and Persia to India. The latter race includes the fair-haired people of northern Europe, and extends over nearly the same area as the Melanochroi, with which race it is greatly intermixed. The Xanthochroi have fair skins, blue eyes, and light hair ; the others have dark skins, eyes, and hair, and are of a slighter frame. Together they constitute what were once called the Caucasian races. The Melanochroi are not considered by Huxley to be one of the primitive modifications of mankind, but rather to be the result of the admixture of the Xanthochroi with the Australoid type. </para>
                <para class="block">The tradition is that the Circassian family are descended from a very ancient stock, like the Vice-President of the Executive Council, who says that he is descended from Fergus I. of Scotland. They are said to be descended from Japhet, the son of Noah, from whom the British race are also alleged to be descended. </para>

                        <para>- We ought to be very careful not to exclude the fair-haired races of Asia, or we may do an injury which we may afterwards regret. The Circassian family are divided into three groups, the western, or Abkasian group ; the eastern, or Chechar  group ; and the southern, or Georgian group - all typical races. The Georgians, as honorable senators know, may be very slightly dark, but they are a very handsome race. I hope that the Minister will consent to recommit the Bill with a view to the consideration of certain amendments, particularly the one which was lost last week, and which I believe will commend itself, at certain moments of our existence at all events, to our earnest attention. One or two friends told me after the Senate adjourned on Friday that I had been unfortunate in delaying the passing of this Bill. But I am not aware that the Senate merely exists to record its agreement with another place. We are elected by the people, arid are expected to look after their interests. I have always maintained that the Senate is a Chamber which ought to give very close attention to all Bills. I beg honorable senators to give the greatest consideration to this Bill. I have been twitted in this matter by a friend, for whom I have a great regard. &#34; Are you aware,&#34; he asked, &#34; that through  the delay which has taken place you have deprived 300 women each day of this allowance of  ^5?&#34;  I replied, &#34;I am very sorry to hear that, but it can be obviated if the Vice-President of the Executive Council will agree to a recommittal and alter clause 2, so as to bring the Bill into operation as from the 1st October. &#39; &#39; It is the rule to date back the commencement of a Customs Tariff Bill, arid that can be done in this case. My amendment is to leave three words out of clause  6  so as to take Asiatics out of the exception, but I am prepared to withdraw the amendment if the Minister will say that he is prepared to recommit the Bill and insert a definition of &#34;Asiatics.&#34; That is a fair offer, I think. </para>

                        <para>- It . happened so long ago that the honorable senator does not remember what I did. We are now acting in accordance with the previous legislation, because we think&#34; that it is the wisest policy to pursue. Until the people of Australia and their Parliament make up their mind in favour of altering a great many Acts, such as the Immigration Re striction Act, the Naturalization Act, and the Old-age Pensions Act, we cannot say that the time has arrived for departing, from a principle embodied in existing legislation. The day may come, perhaps, when something will have to be done, but then it will be done comprehensively. Consequently, the Government cannot accept any amendment such as has been indicated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker.</inline> I am sorry that so far the Government have found themselves in  a  position that they cannot accept an amendment from anybody who likes to move it.. We should be only too willing to do so if it were convenient. But as we have an earnest desire to carry this measure as speedily as possible, and in conformity with existing legislation, I hope that honorable senators will see the advisableness of adhering to the provision as it stands. </para>

                <para>Here we encounter the fundamental defect of Peel&#39;s character as  a  statesman. It is  a  defect to which, in  a  greater or less degree, all parliamentary statesmen are liable; and Peel, who was pronounced by no very friendly critic to have  Deen  &#34; the greatest member of Parliament that ever lived,&#34; had it in excess. He had insight, but not foresight. A parliamentary statesman is irresistibly impelled to deal only with, such circumstances  as  compel his attention, with such questions as imperiously demand  a  settlement. All other questions are to him &#34; outside the range of practical politics.&#34; They only -come within that range when he is either com.pelled to deal with them by the force of circumstances or tempted to deal with them by the prospect of party advantage. </para>
                <para>He had little or no perception of ripeness in political issues other than that which was forced on him by the imperious teaching of circumstances. The atmosphere of Parliament is very unfavorable to the growth of this inestimable quality. It engenders an opportunism which distrusts forecast and disdains all argument not adapted to its own temper. In this respect the temper of Parliament only reflects the temper of Englishmen at large. </para>
                <para class="block">I was one of those who thought there was not any great advantage in finishing this Bill last week, but I can- only say that my honorable friend, is possessed of insight - whether he is gifted with foresight I know not. The insight at that time took the form of &#34;Let us have the Bill put through, and then the Prime Minister will be able, on Monday, to announce elsewhere that this great measure has been passed, and the Governor-General&#39;s assent has been given to it.&#34; I am sorry to think that that is the case, because I defended my honorable friend (before from the charge of bringing forward this Bill as merely a card to counteract the effect of depriving women of the postal vote. I hope he will see his way to agree to recommit the Bill, if only to amend one clause which I think he would like to see amended. </para>

                    <para>. - I wish to remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> that many years ago this question arose with respect to the Immigration Restriction Bill, and that an attempt was made to include the aboriginal natives of Asia, Africa, and the islands of the Pacific, but that honorable senators on the other side - in fact, a majority of them - objected to do so. When the Naturalization Bill was under consideration the same objection was not raised, and the aboriginal natives of Asia, Africa, and the islands of the Pacific were included. Then followed the Old-age Pensions Bill. If it be necessary that the words should be in this clause, it was equally necessary that they should be in the Old-age Pensions Bill. Why did not <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> insist upon them -being put in then? As regards interpretation, so far there has been no difficulty in connexion with the Old-age Pensions Act, and why should any difficulty be anticipated under this measure? To make alterations such as those which have been indicated, and which are of no great consequence to my mind, in view of what has occurred, would only delay longer the passing of this legislation. Is that what honorable senators want, seeing that they would effect nothing by the alterations which they seek to make? If it is, then let them stone- wall &#34; the Bill as long as they like. I cannot help them doing that. In view of the fact that no evil has arisen from the existence of a similar provision in legislation already passed, and of our desire that this Bill should be passed as speedily as possible, I cannot see my way to accept any amendment. I am very sorry that I cannot please every honorable senator who may raise an objection. </para>

An amendment was moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> on the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Bill for the insertion of words almost exactly the same as those proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> in order that Asiatics in Australia might be entitled to receive old-age pensions.

                        <para>- Perhaps the honorable senator wishes to say that that is why he assisted to expel them. As they were expelled before I entered Parliament, they could not have voted for me. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> moved an amendment upon <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford&#39;s</inline> amendment to add to the proposed new clause the words, &#34; and. Africa, the islands of the Pacific, or New Zealand.&#39;&#34; The voting on <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce&#39;</inline> s amendment was - Ayes, 20 ; Noes, 1 1 ; a majority of 9 in favour of the amendment. Then the proposed new clause, as amended, was put to the Committee, and was carried by a vote of  17  &#34; Ayes &#34; to 14 &#34; Noes.&#34; That was the important division, and I may inform honorable senators that, included amongst the &#34;Ayes,&#34; were some honorable senators who were on this side, and also Senators Findley, McGregor, Guthrie, Pearce, E. J. Russell, and Story. The &#39;-&#39;Noes&#34; included, amongst others, Senators de Largie, Givens, Gray, Keating, McColl, Needham, Stewart, St. Ledger, Turley, Vardon, and Chataway. I think that it is just as well that these facts should be put on record. We are now faced with another position, and we find that a number of honorable senators, who at that time voted in favour of making an exception on behalf of Asiatics for the granting of old-age pensions, now refuse to treat them in the same way in this Bill. In the face of this, they accuse honorable senators on this side of being the black labour party. </para>

                    <para>. - Dealing rather with the desire of the Vice-President of the Executive Council, than with the probable effect of this clause, I gathered, from what the honorable senator said, that the clause would be interpreted as excluding only aboriginal natives of Asia. That, we are told, is what the &#34;Government wish, although they have used in the clause only the word &#34;Asiatics.&#34; I point out that, in citing somewhat similar provisions of other Acts, the Vice-President has really given a strong argument why the wording&#39; of this clause should be altered- The Acts Interpretation Act will not assist us to solve this difficulty. The honorable senator mentioned the fact that, in the Naturalization Act, the words used are &#34; aboriginal natives of Asia.&#34; If the matter were taken before a Court, and the provision of the Naturalization Act cited, the Court would obviously decide that, in that Act, the Legislature indicated clearly what was meant by using the words &#34; aboriginal natives of Asia.&#34; It is probable, I think, that, when the Court learned that the word &#34; Asiatics &#34; alone was used in this Bill, it would say at once that a difference was clearly indicated by the absence of certain words in the description of the persons referred to. The Court would not necessarily interpret &#34; Asiatics &#34; as used in this Bill as meaning aboriginal natives of Asia. It would be much more likely to decline to interpret it in that way, because of the use of the words in the Naturalization Act. I do not think that the Vice-President of the Executive Council is justified in accusing any one on this side of &#34; stonewalling &#34; the Bill. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator did so just now ; and, personally, I resent the accusation. I resent also another remark which the honorable senator made, to the effect that the Senate must pass a measure merely because it has been passed- in another place. If our legislation has come to that, it is time the Senate was abolished. I am not greatly concerned about this clause; but, in the interests of what I regard as proper legislation, and, opposed as I am to slovenly legislation, I have not the slightest hesitation in saying that doubt and difficulty will arise from the use of the word &#34; Asiatics &#34; by itself in this clause. As the Government desire that it should be interpreted to mean &#34; aboriginal natives of Asia,&#34; some amendment should certainly be made in the clause. </para>

                        <para>- The Court will interpret this measure by what they find in it. I was urged to raise the question because I personally know members of a large family who might be affected. I have just received a letter from which it is clear that a similar provision of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act has detrimentally affected certain individuals. If we said in an Act that no American should be entitled to an old-age pension, that would exclude the people of every part of America. It would be of no use for any one to say later that that was not what was meant. I know the case of a man who was born a mile or two within the boundary of the United States, but of British parents. He has been in this country for something like forty years. He was employed in a Railway Department as a porter, has exercised a vote during all the time, and has looked upon himself as British. He has been told that he is not eligible for an old-age pension. The statement made to him was &#34; We cannot give you a pension until you have been naturalized for two years.&#34; The case here is somewhat similar. The word &#34;Asiatics&#34; is used in the clause, and in interpreting this measure, any Court will interpret it as it stands. The Court will probably say, &#34; If the Legislature had intended the Act to apply to white persons born in Asia, it would have said so distinctly.&#34; In the case which I have mentioned, the father was a Scotchman, who was employed in the capacity of overseer in a tea plantation in India. The members of his family were born in that country. According to my reading of the clause, every one of them would be prevented from participating in this maternity allowance. I do not think that is the intention of the Committee. Surely it is not too much to ask that recognised flaws in the Bill should be remedied. If the Vice-President of the Executive Council will consent to the insertion of the word &#34; aboriginal &#34; before the word &#34; Asiatics,&#34; I am sure that the other branch of the Legislature will agree to the amendment. Had he accepted such an amendment on Friday last, the Bill would have been the law of the land today. I hope that he will not prove stubborn on this occasion, and I am glad to find that the legal members of the Senate uphold my view of this matter. </para>

                    <para>. -A few minutes ago,I referred to two divisions which were taken in this Chamber on the 5th August, 1909, upon, a proposal to insert the word &#34; Asiatics &#34; in the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Bill. That proposal was carried in both instances. I have since found that the word &#34;Asiatics&#34; does not appear in that Act; and I learn from a perusal of the <inline font-style="italic">Journals of the Senate</inline> that, on the recommittal of the Bill, the clause was struck out by sixteen votes to fourteen upon the following; division : Ayes - Senators Best, Cameron,. Chataway, de Largie, Givens, Henderson,. Lynch, McColl, Millen, Needham, Sayers,. St. Ledger, Turley, Vardon, and Stewart. Noes - Senators Croft, Dobson, Findley,. Gould, Gray, Guthrie, McGregor, Neild,. Pearce, W. Russell, Story, Trenwith, Walker, and Pulsford. That circumstance explains why, despite the fact that the amendment to include &#34; Asiatics&#34; was carried, it does not appear in the Act. </para>

                    <para>. - This discussion emphasizes the need which exists for a clear and sharp definition of the word &#34;Asiatics.&#34; I am not quite sure that the adoption of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating&#39;s</inline> amendment will overcome the difficulty, although it will make it clear that the exception applies only to the aboriginal natives of Asia. But, even then, it will be difficult to interpret this clause. </para>

                <para class="block">Speaking from memory, I fancy that, under British constitutional law, naturalization follows the nationality of the father. Certainly that rule applies in the case of children, unless it is specially restricted by legislation. I am not sure that an aboriginal native of Asia - for example, a Syrian woman - who marries a British subject does not lose her Asiatic nationality, and by reason of her marriage, become a British subject. Whilst it may be hazarded that the children of such a marriage would be British, there is, I think, some reason for holding the view that the nationality of the wife follows very largely the nationality of the husband. All of this goes to show how hurriedly the Bill has been drafted.  I do not say that I shall oppose the amendment, because it would have the effect of making it clear that the term &#34; Asiatics &#34; will apply only to the aboriginal Asiatics. But the term &#34; aboriginal Asiatics &#34; is very difficult to define as compared with the term &#34; aboriginal native of Australia.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- No. If the Vice-President of the Executive Council thinks that the term &#34;Asiatics&#34; in this Bill should have the same significance as attaches to it in the Old-age Pensions Act, it will be easy for the Government to insert an amendment to that effect now. Surely there is no violent hurry for this Bill for twenty-four or forty-eight hours. If it&#39;s passage were delayed for that period, the Vice-President of the Executive Council would be afforded an opportunity of consulting the Crown Law officers again, with a view to securing a more satisfactory definition of the term &#34; Asiatics.&#34; </para>

He was born in the British Isles, served in the British Navy, and afterwards came to Australia, where he married a white woman. He can talk English probably just as well as I can. Yet that man is refused the sugar bounty on the ground that he is a coloured man, and notwithstanding that he employs only white labour. He originally hailed from Jamaica.

                    <para>. - I do not think that we need fear that the natives of Singapore or Hong Kong, whether they happen to be naturalized or natural-born British subjects - that is, the Chinamen - will come to this country, because they can be easily dealt with under the Immigration Restriction Act. To that extent, the argument which was interjected just now is of no importance. But what seems to be of real importance is the omission of the words &#34; those of European descent.&#34; The progress of Russia in Manchuria and Lower Siberia has created quite a large settlement, and there is no doubt that these settlers are Asiatics. Generation after generation has settled there, and a very large number of very valuable Russian settlers have come across from Vladivostosck, and are settling in Queensland. I do not know whether many of them are settling in the other States, but I think, speaking on behalf of these people, that the Government should make it perfectly clear that people of European descent are not to be regarded as Asiatics, even though they have lived for many years in a part of the world known as Russia. </para>

                        <para>- I have not the slightest doubt that we have; but does not my honorable friend want them to have babies, as well as any one else? If it was a question of only one missionary who was born in the New Hebrides, I would not think so much about this provision, but, as a matter of fact, during the last four or five years, as many as 400 or 500 young settlers have come to Australia from Siberia, and are settling in Queensland, and very valuable settlers they are making. I should say that the Minister might meet the whole case by inserting in the clause the words &#34;except those of European descent,&#34; and leaving out the rest of the amendment. We shall, I think, make a great mistake if the clause is passed in its present form, because Russian Asiatics and various other people, who make very valuable settlers may be excluded. Germans, for instance, who come from South Africa, will have to describe their birth-place as Africa, and it will be of no use for us to turn round afterwards and say that they are not Africans. </para>

There are hundreds of those persons, I repeat, coming into Queensland, and under this Bill, if strictly interpreted, they will receive no maternity bonus, though they are as white as we are, or will have to go to law and spend a large amount of hard-earned money in the attempt to compel the Government to give them fair play. </para>

                <para>In  1903  we passed that provision, and, so far as I know, New Zealand stands now where it stood then. If it stood then in the Pacific, and would be included among the islands of the Pacific, obviously nothing has happened in the meantime, although it is a very volcanic country, to necessitate a departure from the words in this case. I think that the Minister will recognise that my amendment is not moved for the purpose of delaying the passage of the Bill. </para>

                    <para>. - I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger, and other senators, must recognise that this is a maternity allowance only. It is not an allowance for doctors, or nurses, or for maternity homes, or hospitals, or anything of that kind, but purely and simply a maternity allowance. Any woman can apply for the grant. If a woman is in a maternity home and gives birth to a child there, and the child is registered, and the other conditions of the Bill complied with, the mother may make application for a maternity allowance. She can dispose of the money as she pleases. She can pay doctors or nurses with it, or give a portion of it to a maternity home or a hospital. I hope that honorable senators will accept the principle of the Bill, which provides only for a maternity allowance, I hope they will not make any alteration dealing with maternity homes or any other institutions of the kind. </para>

There is such machinery in existence for the administration of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act.

The appointment of women officials for the administration of such a measure should not be regarded merely as a sop or concession to women. It should be peculiarly within the province of women to have a consultative voice in the administration of a measure of this kind. In complex situations the assistance of women should be availed of. It should not be forgotten that women are entitled to invalid and old-age pensions as well as men, and should new officials be required, and women be appointed, their services would be available for the administration of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act, as well as for the administration of this Bill. These measures might be as well, and probably better, and mo sympathetically administered if, at any rate, one woman were associated with the male officials administering them. </para>

Where the services of women will be of use, they will be availed of. Honorable senators should read the Bill, and understand what its administration involves. When a birth is registered, the mother of the child has to make an application, furnishing a copy of the registration of birth, and the allowance will then be sent to her in the form of a Post Office order in a registered letter for which she will have to sign. All these things will act as securities against fraud. In connexion with&#34; offences under clauses 10 and 11, it .may be necessary ultimately to appoint a few females as inspectors in some of the States for the purpose of inquiries in cases where there is a suspicion of fraud. In connexion with the ordinary administration of the measure, there will be no great room for the appointment of officials, men or women. I hope that honorable senators will not go into hysterics about this matter. I repeat my assurance that where the services of women will be of use, they will be availed of. </para>

                        <para>- No; I have been right on my feet all the time. I am sorry that my amendment was not adopted, but I am proud, to say that I secured support for it from one supporter of the Government. I have pointed out that persons in the community representing a small section living under certain conditions are, by this Bill, .given the same grant for the same reason and for the same purpose that it is being given to decent married women in the community, who may, or may not need it. In other words, at a stage like that which we have now reached, and with an audience such as I am addressing, one need not be particular in his choice of language. But when one is addressing public meetings - and particularly audiences which consist mostly of women - he is bound to exercise a certain amount of restraint in the expression of his views. That is the position which I occupied when I spoke upon this Bill at several public meetings. I recognised all along that there was a moral blot upon it. I recognised that from the very moment when the Prime Minister announced that this maternity grant was to be made irrespective of considerations of legitimacy or illegitimacy. Naturally, in addressing public audiences, there were certain phases of the question at which one could only hint. Nevertheless, in as public a form as possible, I did indicate my views upon it. </para>

                        <para>- I am not. Under this Bill what have we done? We have placed the paramour and the concubine on an absolute equality with married women. This has been done notwithstanding that my amendment recognised the infirmity of human nature, both male and female, and proposed to offer them a resting place from which they could reconsider their position. I recognise that, in legislation as well as in administering the law, we are bound to take into consideration the infirmities of human nature. Only by so doing can we ask, in all sincerity, to be lifted to higher things ourselves. My amendment recognised those infirmities fully and freely. It proposed to appeal to the Christian organizations to especially help those women - often young women - who, after their slip, would, if not arrested in their downward course, certainly find their way to the only hell upon earth. I asked that the Bill should recognise the principle. The Senate, however, flagrantly rejected it. It is possible that I may hold too strong opinions in regard to the aspect in which marriage in relation to offspring ought to be considered by a Christian Parliament. It may be that, in the strength of my convictions, I do not see this question in its proper light, and that, as a result, I do an injustice to the Government. But I hold that the foundation of our civilization and progress rests, fist. last, and all the time, upon the obligations which are imposed by law and religion upon marriage. Whether I am right or wrong, I believe that we cannot consider this question unless we consider both maternity and offspring in their relation to marriage. I say that, from the moment any nation ceases to be jealous of its regard for all these obligations, it is upon the down grade. When my amendment was rejected, the Senate placed women of a certain class upon the same social, civilizing, and Christian level as that which is occupied by married women. My amendment bespoke my spirit, in that it provided for giving unfortunates a second chance. I object to placing married women-  on an absolute equality in the matter of receiving the grant provided for in this Bill with the paramour and the concubine. </para>

                    <para>. - When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> on Friday last remarked across the floor of this chamber that the time was when he regarded <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger as a promising Labour man, I thought it was a mighty good thing for the Labour party that that promise had  not been fulfilled. It is speeches of the kind he has just delivered which makes me thank God that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger does not belong to our party. I have no desire to misconstrue anything that he has said. If we were to judge him by the language in which he has indulged, we might be disposed to say that he has made strong statements. But that is not so. He has merely made loud statements, which is an entirely different matter. One of his most amusing assertions was that the Opposition have taken up a decided stand upon this Bill. I should like to know upon what side they have taken up a decided stand, for certainly nobody has been able to tell upon what side they have been since this Bill was introduced. When the proposal for a maternity grant was first mooted by the Prime Minister at the beginning of the session, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColland</inline> others were much more definite in their condemnation of it than they have been since. </para>

                        <para>- I regret that I was drawn aside by an interjection. Underlying this Bill is a great principle, and I can assure honorable senators opposite that we are only at the beginning of those great principles. There is no subject to which the State can direct attention with more advantage than that of the welfare, of the infant life of this community. The Bill recognises that it is the duty of the State, as far as possible, to reduce the great mortality rate which exists amongst the children of Australia to-day. That is the intention of the measure, and even the small grant for which it provides will go a long way towards achieving that end. If there is one country in the world which ought to be careful about the preservation of its child life, that country is Australia. Statistics convincingly prove that the days of big families are gone, and that we have now reached an age of small families. How are we to make the most of them? How are we to make the most of the decreasing birth rate? </para>

                        <para>- I said nothing of the kind. I suppose I am talking above the honorable  senator&#39;s  intelligence, because what I have said must have been quite clear to any intelligent man. We are living in an age of small families, and we must make the most of them, in order to increase our population as much as possible. That can be done by safeguarding the lives of the 8.000 or 9,000 children who are annually lost to the Commonwealth. There is no country which requires population more urgently than does Australia, and the very best immigrant that we can get is undoubtedly the Australian baby, for the simple reason tha\t it is an Australian native. No citizen can possibly love Australia so well as the citizen who is native born. I make that statement as one who is not a native born. The person who hails from another country, and becomes a citizen of Australia, has always a divided allegiance. No man or woman can ever forget the  land of his or her birth. They have always a sentimental leaning towards the land of their birth. An Australian, being a native of the country, is the best kind of citizen we can have. In order that we may have as many of them as possible, it is the duty of the Government to pursue this policy. I hope that we shall pass other legislation with the object of making the most of the children born in Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> in his brief speech on this subject last week, said that no economic reasons had been given in support of the measure. If economic reasons were required, I make bold to say that they are as plentiful as blackberries. I have already mentioned some, and may point to another aspect of the same question. If we take the wages earned in Australia, we shall find that an enormous percentage of the population, notwithstanding all that is said about the high wages earned in this country, draw what may be regarded as a very modest return for their labour. I have taken the trouble to obtain a few figures on the subject. I have it on the authority of the Commonwealth Statistician, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs,</inline> that miners in Victoria are paid the handsome wage of 7s. 6d. per day for pursuing their dangerous and unhealthy calling. Labourers and others in mines receive only from 6s. 6d. to 7s. a day. There are 20,000 miners in Victoria. Taking the wage-earners of Australia generally, the same authority informs me that there are only 114,000 persons earning over , &#163;200 a year.  There  are 2,500,000 persons who are receiving less than &#163;200 a year. So that it will be seen that the  &#163;5  which the Government propose to pay as a maternity allowance will undoubtedly serve a very good purpose amongst a very large section of the community. These are facts that cannot be gainsaid. A considerable number of people in this country require such assistance. It has been said time and again by Opposition members that we are providing an allowance for those who do not require it. I think I have shown that only a small percentage of the community do not require this aid. I should like to say, in conclusion, that the Opposition have been in difficulties throughout the consideration of this Bill. I sympathize with them. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> showed how difficult his position was when he spoke on the second reading of the measure elsewhere, and no one could understand on which side he intended to vote. From that time up to the present moment it has been clear to every one that the Opposition have been embarrassed. That is their own fault. They have been making professions of being favorable to legislation of this kind, whilst every one knew perfectly well that they were the bitterest enemies to it. They make claims as to what they have done with respect to old-age pensions and other social legislation; but I hold that every time measures of that description have been introduced into the Commonwealth Parliament, the opposition has invariably come from the other side. When they dared not oppose a measure openly, they have said that they opposed it. because we were robbing the States, and they felt obliged to protest. That was done when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> showed a way out of the difficulty respecting old-age pensions years ago. </para>

Undoubtedly, we shall pass other legislation of the same kind in the future; and I am satisfied that by its means we shall find that we have added much more to the population of Australia than by means of any other legislation that has hitherto been enacted. </para>

                    <para>. - I should not have risen to continue this debate had it not been that I wish to resent the insinuations which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger has cast across the floor. The object of his speech, if it had an object, was, I take it, merely to misrepresent the position of those who are supporting this Bill. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger to-day moved an amendment of which he was evidently very proud. I wish to define my attitude regarding the question which he raised. I believe that I am speaking the mind of a good many people when I say that those who support this Bill are not unaware of the magnificent services performed by the maternity homes of this community. I have clearly in my own mind the splendid work done by them. I am fully aware of the kindness and generosity extended by those who manage those institutions to many an unfortunate woman who has slipped, not once, but a second and third time. But to say that, because these maternity homes exist, we ought not to allow a woman to choose whether she shall go to one of them to be treated is merely so much clap-trap. There is good reason to believe that those who have mouthed most about morality, and who have introduced the word Christianity most often into this debate, are by no means the most ready to give an example of what Christianity really means. Is it Christian to say that because a woman has made a mistake, we shall not pay this maternity allowance to her, but shall hand it over to a maternity home whether she likes it or not? I quite recognise the benefits conferred by those institutions, and the spiritual influences with which they surround their inmates; but is it not far better to allow a woman her choice of going into such an institution or not, as she thinks proper? I venture to say that a man who would misrepresent the attitude of his opponents on a matter of this kind is unworthy of being a member of this Chamber. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger today puts forward the gospel that we glory in the fact that we are subsidizing illegitimacy. That is an attitude which he has taken up both inside and outside Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- The press records are available to show that what I am stating is correct. Now the honorable senator says that his meaning is that the allowance will increase illegitimacy. He says that unfortunate women do not slip from desire, or because they have mapped out a career of shame. No one desires to say that any woman would fall in order to get &#163;5, or even a much larger sum. Yet to-day we have the insinuation made again that the supporters of the measure glory in illegitimacy. Let me say, quite distinctly that I should be one of the first to move for the repeal of legislation of this description if it had any tendency to increase illegitimacy. I believe that that would be the desire of all of us. It certainly has not been the Labour party that has been responsible for the condition of society in which women have slipped. We have endeavoured, since we have been a party, to remove the causes as far as the material resources of politics would enable us to do so. </para>

In conclusion, sir, I would point out that this legislation must necessarily be experimental. It may have weaknesses. I believe that weaknesses may be discovered particularly with regard to the administration of its provisions. But, because the measure is not perfect, is that any reason why we should reject it at this stage? On the contrary, let us put this class of legislation on the statute-book and give it a trial. If our hopes are justified the woman will have the opportunity of  v&#39;  getting material comforts at this event in her life. She may, if she so desires, get all the comforts of the spiritual surroundings of a maternity home. The child will have the opportunity of being brought into the world with the best medical treatment, and will be given a pure environment in the early stages of its existence. </para>

If the measure should fail to achieve its object; if our hopes should not be realized, surely <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger will not say that there are not clean-minded men enough in Australia who will, at some future date, come into these legislative halls and repeal anything which has a tendency to militate . against the moral or spiritual welfare of the people of this country. Knowing that it is an experiment I wish it well. I trust that it will have the beneficial effect which all the members of our party desire. I trust that it will realize the best hopes of, may I say, the clean-minded public of Australia, that it will never be regretted that the Australian Parliament initiated such legislation, and that it will have no baneful effect, but a tendency to elevate, and not to demoralize, society. </para>

                    <para>. - I desire, at this stage of the measure, to emphasize a statement I made in speaking to the second reading. I said that the Leader of the Opposition, in another place, speaking for the party &#39; which he leads there and outside, received the measure with maledictions, but, that when it left there to come to the Senate he gave it his benediction. In justice to myself I desire to draw attention to the fact that my statement has been brought under the notice of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin,</inline> and that he has denied giving the Bill his benediction when it left another place. </para>
