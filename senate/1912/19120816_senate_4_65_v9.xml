          <para class="block">This is a very short Bill for the purpose of bringing the Commonwealth Fleet under the provisions of the Audit Act. When the original Audit Bill was passed, the Australian Fleet was scarcely in contemplation, and therefore no provision was made for the peculiar circumstances that must exist in every navy in comparison with other portions of the Public Service. The object of this Bill is to make the same provision with respect to the Australian Navy as exists in connexion with the Imperial Navy. It will enable the captains of vessels to pay their men, as is done in the Imperial Navy, without it being necessary to get receipts, and also to obtain credit, in a manner different from that which is necessary in the ordinary Public Service.  All the transactions will be subject to a report by the Auditor-General, but the same hard-and-fast rules will not apply to the Navy as apply to other portions of the Public Service. I am sure that every honorable senator will realize the necessity for passing the Bill owing to the different circumstances which now prevail. </para>

            <para>. - I think that this is a suitable opportunity to draw the attention of the Government to the fact that we do not get the Auditor- General's report at a reasonable time. On the 30th April last, the Auditor-General stated in his report that on that date he had received the last figures of the Budget-speech, which was delivered by the Treasurer in October of the previous year. The result of this delay was that the Auditor-General's report appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette,</inline> and did not appear as a separate document. Obviously, it appeared long after the time when it could possibly have been of any value to members of Parliament in discussing the Budget-papers. Of course, this Bill only deals with the application of the provisions of the Audit Act to naval establishments. But I think it is up to the Government to see if it is not possible for the Treasurer, when he has delivered a Budget-speech, to hand the papers straight away to the Auditor-General; in fact, I think that the Auditor-General ought to have the papers even before the Treasurer delivers his Budget-speech. The position is getting worse and worse. We have Budget-papers before the Senate at the present time, and the Auditor-General's report will probably appear some time after the next general election. Whether the delay is the fault of the Auditor-General or of anybody else, I am not prepared to say, but if it is possible, the Government should try to speed up the Auditor-General. When the members of a State Parliament are discussing financial matters, they have in their hands the Auditor-General's report, and are therefore able to check any statements made by the Government or appearing in the Budget-papers. </para>

            <para>.- When I read the Bill this morning, it seemed rather an alarming one, doing away with desirable safeguards; but the Minister's explanation has put a different complexion upon the matter. At the same time, we are asked to take a good deal on trust. We cannot but agree to the Bill, though I hope that the Government will see that in giving the necessary authority for the expenditure of money, there will be an absolute check, so that the expenditure can be capably supervised. We do not want to get into a loose habit with the Navy. We all know that naval men are prone to be extravagant, and, therefore, I hope the Government will exercise that care that is demanded in connexion with all such matters. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lt.-Colonel Sir ALBERT</inline>GOULD (New South Wales) [10.37].- Before I had an opportunity of looking at the Audit Act, or hearing the explanation of the Vice-President of the Executive Council, I feared that some undesirable course was being introduced in connexion with the auditing of our accounts. But after that explanation, and also an explanation which I had privately from the Minister of Defence, I see no possible objection to the passage of the Bill. It seems to be necessary in order to facilitate the payments in connexion with our ships, and, to a certain extent, payments to the Naval Force, and it should therefore, be safe to pass the Bill. I should </para>
          <para class="block">Hike to emphasize what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> has said in regard to the desirability of feeing supplied with the Auditor-General's report within a reasonable time after the close of the financial year. If honorable senators take the trouble to refer back, they will find that it has been laid upon the table of the Senate at a period very remote from the event. Exception has been taken to the action of the Auditor-General in. delaying the presentation of his report, but in one or two reports which I have examined I have found that the delay has not been due to any negligence or carelessness on his part, or on the part of his officers. The delay has generally been due to the default pf the Treasurer in not more promptly providing the Auditor-General with the accounts and the returns which are required by the Act to be submitted. The Auditor-General is directed to send in his report as soon as possible after he has received these documents; but, of course, until they are supplied to him, he cannot complete his report. He has to certify that the payments have been made, and correctly made, and that proper vouchers have been produced; and generally to report on the financial position of the Commonwealth, not, of course, from a party point of view, but for the guidance of members of Parliament. It is very unfair that members should find themselves confronted with the Treasurer's statement, and with the necessity of voting large sums, without having had the opportunity of knowing authoritatively how the previous votes were expended. The whole safety and the whole value of the Auditor-General is that he can exercise supervision in this direction. He examines the documents, and gives his certificate as to whether he has found everything in order or not; and if he finds anything out of order it is his duty to call the attention of Parliament to that fact. When it is provided with his report, it has the report of a man who is under the control of neither Ministers nor the Opposition. He has been placed in an independent position, and is called upon to discharge his duty independently. He recognises the importance of his position.  His  salary is provided by Statute, in order that he may occupy this independent position ; and I recognise that invariably he so discharges his duties. I hope that Ministers will take steps to urge upon their colleagues that Parliament - at any rate, a large section of </para>
          <para class="block">Parliament - is not satisfied with the delay that occurs year after year in connexion with the presentation of this report. </para>

My remarks are applicable to Ministers generally. I hope that Parliament will see that the Auditor-General has a full opportunity to prepare his report in good time, and that we shall not be called upon to vote money for another year without having any knowledge or an opportunity to obtain knowledge as to the expenditure of the votes for the previous year, or as to how Ministers have discharged their duties. We ought to be in a position to determine with our eyes open what money we shall vote, and to satisfy ourselves as to the way in which the votes of Parliament were distributed during the preceding year. </para>

I have looked up a concrete instance, which will make clear to the Government, and also to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie,</inline> what is meant by our contention. The Treasurer's statement for the year ending 30th June, 1910, was ordered to be printed on the 5th September, 191 1. Without going into the question of any sectional aims or views, honorable senators will all agree that the Treasurer's statement for the year ending 30th June, 1910, should have been presented long before the 5th September, 191 1. I wish to ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> to explain, if he can, in Committee, what is meant by sub-section 2 of the proposed new section  63A.

            <para>. - I should like to emphasize the necessity for the presentation of the Auditor-General's report to Parliament at as early a date as possible. I have some particulars which I think honorable senators will admit justify our contention as to the unsatisfactory position in which we are placed by the lapse of time which is permitted to occur between the receipt of the Treasurer's statement and the presentation of the Auditor-General's report. I give the date on which the Treasurer's statement was received by the Auditor-General, each year, from 1902 to 191*1. That for the year ending June, 1901, was received by the Auditor-General on the nth August, 1902. The date on which the statement for 1901-2 was received by the Auditor-General is not available. In 1903, the Treasurer's statement was received by the Auditor-General between the 20th October, 1903, and 21st January, 1904 - others in February, 1904. The statement for 1903-4 was received, part on 18th November, and the' balance later in the month. That for 1904-5, on the 28th November, 1905. For 1905-6, on the 18th September, 1906. For 1906-7, on the 5th December, 1907. For 1907-8, on the 10th December. For 1908- 9, 1st and 7th December, 1909. For 1909- 10, on the 10th March, ipu, and the Treasurer's statement for the year ending 30th June, 1911, was not received by the Auditor-General until the 30th April, 1912. It will be seen that the interval between the delivery of the Treasurer's statement and its receipt with the necessary accompanying vouchers by the Auditor-General has, year by year, and especially of recent years, been increasing. If this is to continue, the result will be that Parliament will not have an opportunity to consult the Auditor-General's report in order to make their criticisms of the Treasurer's statement effective. I hope that some action will be taken to remedy the existing state of affairs. </para>

With respect to the delay which has been com plained of in the presentation of the Auditor-General's report, honorable senators must bear in mind that the Commonwealth is very different from any of the States. The delay referred to arises from the fact that adjustments and re-adjustments have to be made in connexion with accounts from different places in all of the States. The Auditor-General is supplied with the figures from the Treasury, not <inline font-style="italic">en bloc,</inline> but as they come in, and even during the present year, when a special effort is being made, it wilt be impossible for him to have his report ready before some time in November.

The honorable senator should know that all the information does not come into possession of the Treasury at the same time, but as it comes in it is forwarded to the Auditor-General without delay, and everything is done to facilitate the work of the Auditor-General's Department. </para>

              <para>- The honorable senator ought to know that, though everything is done to expedite the balancing of the finances up to the 30th June of each year, it is only after that date that the  figures can be forwarded to the Auditor-General. He has then to verify statements and accounts from all the States. He is admittedly a careful man, and will not accept responsibility except on reports of his confidential officers. I am informed that it would be impossible for the Auditor-General to have his report for this year ready before November. But every effort will be made to lay it before Parliament before' the close of the session. I do not think it is necessary to wait until we get into Committee to explain the matters referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons.</inline> If the honorable senator had a copy of the principal Act before him he would see that sections 33 and 34 apply to officers on land in touch with the Treasury. Naval officers being employed at sea move about from piao* to place, and the regulations which apply  to land officers cannot be applied to them. With respect to section 46, it is provided that vouchers shall be given for every payment, but we propose in this Bill to enable captains to pay their men without getting receipts. The Auditor- General will still have a sufficient check upon the vouchers presented by captains, because they will know the ratings of all the men. </para>

          <para>. - The request of the Minister places honorable senators in a rather awkward position. 1 am sure there is a very general desire to pass into law as speedily as possible those altered provisions in our Defence Act having reference to defaulting cadets, so as to put the Department in the best possible position to overcome the difficulties which have arisen. But I say that the amendments which we are now asked to swallow, without being afforded an opportunity of thoroughly understanding them, are of a totally different character from those which have been under review in this Chamber before. The first one, for example, relates to the date upon which certain officers completed an examination for promotion. In view of statements which have been made to me, that amendment opens up a very debatable question indeed. The Minister will recognise that whilst we have every desire to help forward that poi tion of the Bill which has behind it the general sympathy of honorable senators, he is asking rather much. He requests us to suspend the Standing Orders, and thus depart from the usual safeguard which they provide, for the purpose of dealing' with matters the purport of which is not at all clear, and which to my mind are highly contentious. </para>

        </list><para class="block">The facts are these : A number of officers had gone up for examination under conditions prescribed prior to the passing of the Act of  1 9 10.  They had passed the prescribed course then laid down under the regulations, but for various reasons had not been promoted. Thus, a man might pass his examination and fulfil all the conditions ; but a vacancy might not exist, and he would therefore have to wait before he could be promoted. A number of officers, as I have said, had passed the prescribed examination and fulfilled the conditions. Then the Act was amended, and a new prescribed course came into existence. The question came up very shortly afterwards, when vacancies arose, as to the officers who had passed the prescribed course under the old Act, but who had not passed the prescribed course under the new Act. The Chief of General Staff, the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Hoad, brought the question before me, and recommended that a regulation should be passed accepting the passing under the old Act as an equivalent of passing under the new. That is to say, the regulation would legalize and recognise the former pass as a pass under the new Act. </para><interjection>

            <para>- Yes. I approved of the regulation, and under it a number of officers - I think about ten' - have been promoted from the rank of major to lieutenant-colonel. That procedure was believed to be legal, and the Department continued to think so. There remain only about four officers holding the pass under those conditions who have not been promoted. A case arose in New South Wales recently where two officers were competing for the command of a regiment. I do not. desire to mention names, but I can give them to honorable senators if desired. One of" the two officers held the pass under the old Act. The other officer had gone up for his pass under the new Act, but had failed. </para>

            <para>- I believe he had. But this was the first time the position had been challenged. I felt that it was a serious matter, which ought to be cleared up, and referred it to the Crown Solicitor, who gave it as his opinion that the Act did not give us power to recognise the pass under the prescribed course under the old. Act; in other words, that the action that had been taken by me, under the advice of the Chief of General Staff, was <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires.</inline> This amendment of the law is brought forward in order to recognise as legal the promotions that have been made under the method I have described. The matter ought to be set at rest. I give the Committee the undertaking that the case of the two officers whom I have mentioned will not be affected, because I have decided that the officer who has previously failed shall be given an opportunity of going up for his examination again under the new Act. It is true that he has already had an opportunity and has failed, but I think that under the circumstances it is fair that he should be given another opportunity, and he is going up for examination again at an early date. Should he pass, it will be for the Military Board to recommend as to which of the two officers shall hold the command of the regiment in question. </para>

            <para>- According to the Crown Solicitor's opinion, he is .not qualified, but under this clause he will be qualified. I think it would be unfair to regard him as qualified under present circumstances. It would be passing an Act of Parliament to give him an advantage which the Crown Solicitor advises he has not at present. The other promotions were made in ignorance. We did not know that we were transgressing the law. Our eyes having been opened. I do not think that we should make the promotion until the other officer has had his opportunity, and then the Military Board, on the advice of the Inspector-General, will have the right to decide which of these officers shall hold the command. </para>

            <para>- It is meant for general application - that is to say, to ratify what has been done, and to enable us to recognise those who have passed the prescribed examination under the old Act. Of course, it is not an easy situation. It is not satisfactory by any means. I am asking the Committee' to make this alteration in the law on the one hand to legalize what has been done, and, on the other hand, to recognise those, who hold passes under the old Act. As I have said, they do not exceed four, but those officers have not had an opportunity of promotion, and ought to be in the same position as others in regard to their eligibility. </para>

They are these : A number of officers have passed an examination which, at the time they passed it, was what the law required. They had qualified themselves for promotion. The Minister proceeded to promote some of them to higher positions. But one of them, who had qualified and applied for promotion, has been held down until another officer is given, not one, but three, opportunities of qualifying, to enable him to come into competition with the gentleman who is denied the promotion which has been given to other officers similarly situated. </para>

Am I not justified in assuming that there has been some special influence or favouritism in this case? A number of appointments have been made under exactly similar circumstances. The officers so treated are now in possession of higher positions. Does the Minister propose to say to them that they shall vacate their positions and stand down, in order that other officers, who have passed later examinations, shall come into competition with them ? </para>

            <para>- I have not the slightest doubt that there are men who will say that if the Minister will treat them in the same way as he is treating this particular officer, and give them a chance to qualify, they will start to do so. All that I ask for is absolute fairness to an officer who has qualified, and who, but for the discovery of a defect in the law, would have received an appointment. Why should he be penalized1 when other officers, who are no more highly qualified than he is, are not interfered with ? Why should this special and tender consideration be shown to an officer who has twice failed to pass the examination ? It is carrying favoritism to one man to such an extent that it represents a gross hardship to the other officer who is concerned. </para>

          <para>. - It is quite obvious that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> is in a very difficult position. He has been advised by the Crown Law Officers as to this case. But let me point out that one of the most elementary maxims of law is that ignorance of the law does not excuse. The Minister asked just now, " What am I to do? I made a certain appointment in ignorance of this defect in the Act. It has now been suggested to me that I should make another appointment with full knowledge of that defect. There is a difference in my position." I would point out to the Minister that, legally, there is no difference. He cannot shield himself by the statement he has made. That position is absolutely untenable. If he is anxious, as I am sure he is, to do equity; if he is satisfied that the man who has passed this rigid examination is well qualified to hold a better position, he ought to make an appointment, and let this validating Bill cover that case, as well as previous cases; because, in the eyes of the law, there is no distinction between the act of a Minister with knowledge and the act of a Minister with ignorance. I know that the Minister does not like the position, as it is most invidious, unpleasant, and difficult. But what is he going to be confronted with? He will be confronted with this statement, that this man, who is qualified under the original Act, is not going to get certain advantages which were given to other officers who were appointed before this defect in the law was discovered. The Minister is in that position. </para>

            <para>- I should say that the Minister win have a complete answer. He can say, " I appointed these men believing that the examinations which they had passed fully qualified them to hold the position. I placed them on that footing. I am going to place this other man on the same footing, and I intend to validate the whole of the appointments. I shall not discriminate between D and those who have gone before D, and certainly  1  am not going to put myself in the awkward and invidious position of saying that, because E., intimates that he will again endeavour to qualify for this appointment,  1  shall do an injustice to D, as I would do if I acted in that way." That is his clear position it seems to me. I know nothing about the circumstances of the case, or the names of the individuals, concerned. ] merely recognise that the Minister is in a dilemma, .and I put it to him as a matter of equity and fairness, having regard to the maxim that ignorance of the law does not excuse any man, that his best way out of the difficulty is to do what is suggested. To my mind, it is the only equitable course to take. </para>

          <para>. - Like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons,</inline> I know nothing of the circumstances of this case, or the names of the parties affected. On the statement of the case which has been made to the Minister I certainly think that he is following the right course. I should be very sorry, indeed, to see him, or any other Minister, fully conscious of the fact that he was going to make an invalid appointment, deliberately do so in anticipation of a validating Bill being passed. The position appears to be that these two competitive applicants had their applications under consideration by the Military board, and that the Board decided to recommend one as against the other, apparently on the sole ground that one had qualified for appointment and the other had not. The latter, whose non-qualification is undoubted, raised the legal objection that the applicant who had received the recommendation had been recommended on the ground that he was qualified, whereas, in the opinion of the objector, he was not legally qualified. For the first time a suggestion came before the Department that what had been deemed a qualification was not so in law. The opinion of the Crown law authorities was taken, and it coincided with that of the objector, and at once the Department found that there were a number of appointments which had been made on what were assumed to be qualifications, and which were consequently invalid. The appointments of these men stand in a totally different position from the case of a man whose appointment is recommended and under consideration. This validating legislation confirms them in their positions. He is in a totally different position from those who have been acting in the offices to which they were appointed, although invalidly. I think that there is a clear distinction between the two kinds of cases. Immediately this validating legislation is passed for the first time the recommended applicant will become qualified for appointment, and inasmuch as the other officer offered himself for examination and raised the objection to an appointment, I think that the Minister is entitled to consider his position. </para>

            <para>- Not necessarily. It may be that when this man presented himself for examination he entertained the opinion that the passing of the previous examination was not a qualification, and would not give the other competitor any advantage over him when it came to the test. Any way, as soon as' this legislation is passed, the recommended competitor will become qualified for appointment, but there is to be no appointment made until the other candidate has had an opportunity to present himself for examination. Assuming that he qualifies, it will not follow, as a matter of course, that he will be appointed to the position. </para>

If the non-qualified candidate qualifies at a subsequent examination it will remain for the Military Board to make a recommendation. They will have the opportunity, after considering all the circumstances, of determining whether he is the better qualified of the two. Previously they could not consider his application at all. </para>

The Minister said a little while ago that he would have made the appointment some time since, but for the timely discovery of a defect in the law. Was he doing that himself, or as the result of a recommendation of the Military Board? </para>

            <para>- The honorable senator is 011 the horns of a dilemma. He said a little while ago that he was satisfied that this major was qualified for promotion, and that he was about to make the appointment. Surely the reasons which induced the honorable senator to consent to make the appointment, which was frustrated only by the discovery of a defect in the law, must operate to induce him to go on and make the appointment the moment the defect in the law is remedied. The position almost suggests that the opportunity to remedy the defect in the law is being seized upon as an excuse to give an officer who failed twice to qualify for promotion a further opportunity to qualify for the position in competition with an officer who has previously qualified. </para>

            <para>- I cannot be said to be guilty of anything in connexion with this matter. Assuming that the defect in the law is remedied, what is there to prevent the Minister giving effect to a recommendation upon which he would have acted but for the defect in the law ? I cannot too strongly emphasize the fact that we have been informe'd that the Minister satisfied himself either directly or by reports from the proper officers that a particular gentleman was qualified for the position, and he was on the point of putting his name to a paper authorizing the appointment, when suddenly a legal point was taken that there was a defect in the law. The Minister proposes, by this Bill, to remedy that defect, and I ask what ought to be the natural and just consequence when the defect is remedied? Surely it should be for the Minister' to give effect to the decision at which he had previously arrived. </para>

The Minister brought this case forward as one of the reasons for the introduction of this new clause, and, with all respect to you, sir, I think I am entitled to discuss the bearing which it may have upon the case brought forward by the Minister as a justification for it. I can quite understand the honorable senator proposing to follow the advice pressed upon him, as we all know him to be a busy Minister; but I say that statements have been made here to-day which will justify him in reviewing the whole position. When viewed from different stand-points, the same matters wear different aspects, and <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> to again consider the position in which he is placed. A little time ago he was prepared to make this appointment, and he then discovered a defect in the law. He proposes now to remedy that defect. But what for? Surely it is in order that he may carry out the intention at which he had previously arrived. </para>

            <para>- I accept the Minister's statement on that point ; but I can inform him that there was a good deal of correspondence, extending over three months, and probably it never reached head-quarters in Sydney. An appointment of a qualified officer, which should have been made long ago, was kept back for one reason or another, in order to give his competitor a further chance ; and the Minister is now proposing, not to carry out the original intention, but to use this Bill as an excuse for tying the matter up to give a non-qualified man a further chance in competition with a man who has been qualified for many months. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir JOSIAH</inline>SYMON (South Australia)  [11.52]-  - This discussion has been valuable to many of us who are not familiar with the details of military administration. It has revealed an extraordinary situation; and I am sure honorable senators would like to assist in extricating the Minister from what is undoubtedly a difficult and delicate position. As the debate has proceeded, I have come to the conclusion that .the p'oint of view just put with so much force by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> is the true point of view from which we ought to approach the consideration of the amendment of the law now proposed. Its object is to remove a defect 'n the law under which these officers were examined for promotion. Three officers, who passed examinations which have turned out to be, in some respects, irregular, were actually appointed. The effect of this Bil), so far as they are concerned, will be, as it ought to be, to confirm their appointments. Nothing has been said on this side in opposition to that. The Minister, in dealing with a very complicated system, which, perhaps, no one else has more thoroughly mastered, has committed an unintentional error which any one might commit, and which is entirely excusable, because it arose from an incorrect interpretation of the law by his officers. At the time the discovery of the defect in the law was made, as the result of an objection taken by an unsuccessful candidate, a recommendation existed for the promotion of a particular officer who was, subject to the defect in the law, considered to be absolutely qualified. The Minister tells us that the appointment of this officer would have been made but for this interposition on the part of an unsuccessful candidate. The effect, in all fairness and justice, ought simply to be to suspend the consideration of the recommendation until the defect in the law is remedied, in order that it may subsequently be given effect to. I venture to say that it is not a mere matter of administration, as suggested by the  Chairman,  which arises under this clause, but a question  whether an injustice may not be done. We should hesitate about passing a clause which may have that effect. This Bill certainly ought not to be used in order to bring, as a competitor against an officer who has already been recommended for a position, a man who has failed twice in the examinations necessary for promotion, and who, apparently, is to be given a third opportunity to qualify. I think that the amendment of the law had far better be withheld, until the Minister is in a position to tell us, as I think his sense of justice would induce him to do, that the recommendation which has been in suspense will be given effect immediately the defect in the law is remedied. The Minister has properly put the obverse to that, and says that he might be accused of having sought to pass legislation for the benefit of a particular individual. </para>

            <para>- I do not think so at all. The Minister has one object with two results. The object is to remove a defect in the law. The two results are: first, to confirm those things which were do.ne irregularly under the law as it stands; and, second, to enable the Minister to give effect legally to a recommendation for promotion in favour of an officer who is absolutely qualified. And I say that that ought to be done in justice and fairness, without bringing into competition with him an officer who has tried twice to secure qualification, and has failed on both occasions. We ought to look at the amendment from the point of view of the justice or injustice which it may work. 1 think it will work absolute justice and fair play, if applied, as I have respectfully suggested; but it will work the grossest injustice if it is applied with the result of cancelling a recommendation which is only in suspense, and enabling an unqualified person to come into competition with the officer recommended, for promotion. </para>

          <para>. - I am rather surprised at the direction which the debate has taken. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has introduced a personal element into the discussion, and we have been getting away from the clause. Too much stress is being laid on what it is anticipated the Minister will do if the clause is passed. That should have no weight with the Committee. I assume that the Minister will do the fair thing when the clause is passed. The object is to validate certain acts which have been discovered to be illegal. From the hints and insinuations which he threw out, the Leader of the Opposition evidently believes that some obstacles have been placed in the way of the gentleman who was recommended for this appointment. Those obstacles, I take it, have been interposed by the Military Board. </para>

            <para>- It appears to ;me that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> is more anxious to get from the Minister an expression in the nature of an assurance that the friend for whom he is fighting will get the appointment. I am of opinion that the whole of this discussion would have been at an end, if the Minister' had announced that he intended to make that appointment. I am rather pleased, with the way in which he has acted. He has told us what is the intention of the clause, and what he proposes to do under it. I take it, too, that the Military Board is a fair-minded body  which will not hold up the appointment of a man who is entitled to the position. If it does so, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> can bring the matter before the Senate, and it can be discussed upon its merits. The clause is designed to remedy a defect in the principal Act. Let us remedy that defect, and trust to the Minister to do the fair thing to the person who has been recommended for this appointment. I take it that it is not a fair thing to hold up that gentleman until somebody else has an opportunity of qualifying for the position. I am perfectly satisfied that as soon as the Military Board possesses the legal power, they will do the right thing. </para>

            <para>- It is very hard upon the gentleman who was recommended for the office that the Government could not legally appoint him. But there is an old maxim that " hard cases make bad laws," and I am glad that on this occasion the Minister is sticking fast to the letter of the law. I shall not be pleased if after the Military Board have made a recommendation which they have the right to make, the appointment is held over until somebody else has an opportunity of qualifying. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> is evidently well posted in this matter. He knows the case from ont side. I hope that the Minister will adhere to his position, and that the Military Board, as soon as it can legally recommend this gentleman for appointment, will recommend him. But, as far as keeping this debate going until there has been a surrender of opinion on the part of the Minister, I hope that we have not yet reached that stage. </para>

            <para>- As soon as this Bill becomes law, the Minister will have a recommendation sent to him By the Military Board - a recommendation which he was prepared to approve. It will be extremely difficult for him to convince himself that he ought to wait until an examination has been held in order that somebody else may have an opportunity of becoming a competitor. Why should he do so? I cannot discover any reason in the world why he should. He is armed on all sides. If he makes the appointment, I venture to say that he will occupy a perfectly invulnerable position. I should be the first to resist any attack which was afterwards made upon him on the ground that he did not wait for an examination to be held months hence in order that somebody else might become a competitor. I had intended to ask him a question, but I will not do so, because if I did, I recognise that be would be justified in refusing to reply to it. I think that the Minister has abundant warrant for saying, " I will make no promise of any sort." I merely wish to say that, directly we validate this proposed appointment, I hope he will make it. </para>

          <para>. - The tone of the statements which have been made by Senators Clemons and Symon are distinctly helpful to one in this difficult matter. I am sorry that I cannot say the same for the statements of the Leader of the Opposition. The veiled insinuations which he made are quite unworthy of him. He ought to look at the position from this stand-point. Here was an appointment about to be made. A man who was interested in that appointment raised a legal objection to it, which was then disclosed to me for the first time. I forwarded it to the Crown Solicitor, and the Crown Solicitor said that he was right. Then if I come to Parliament, and endeavour to get an amending Bill passed to legalize what would have been an illegal appointment, if it had been made, am I not open to a» charge by that man ? Could he not say : " You would have appointed this officer illegally. When I showed you that his appointment would be illegal, you immediately rush a Bill through Parliament to enable you to do a legal thing for his benefit." That was the position in which I found myself, and that is the way in which I viewed the matter, notwithstanding the innuendoes which have been indulged in by the Leader of the Opposition. But the arguments of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> have brought to my mind a .different, view. They have raised the question of whether I would be justified in holding up this appointment until another officer had an opportunity of going up for examination. I say frankly 'and honestly that the other view which I put was that which was previously in my mind, and to which I could not find any adequate answer. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> must admit that I did not attempt to disguise what the" clause meant , although I could, if I had chosen to be so unworthy, have said that its object was merely to validate what had been done. The honorable senator did not know of this particular case until I brought it forward. But I thought it right to let honorable senators know, not only that the clause would validate what was at present invalid, but that it would have an important effect upon an appointment which is now pending. I could have got the clause passed without letting the Senate know that. But I would have been dishonest to do so. Consequently, the Leader of the Opposition was ungenerous in the statement which he made. I can assure him' that I have endeavoured to do the fair thing. </para>

            <para>- Another statement which was made by the Minister was not correct. He affirms that I knew nothing of this particular case until he informed the Senate of it. That statement is best answered by the fact that when he moved to suspend the Standing Orders this morning, I specifically asked about this clause, knowing very well that there was a case of this kind pending, and that the clause would have some bearing upon it. At the same time, I did not suggest that I suspected the Minister would have sought to get the clause through by unfair methods. But I did know the purpose of the clause. Now, I wish to come back to the matter which we were debating. I accept fully the reasons which the Minister says induced him to take the action which he did. I have no fault to find with him for bringing forward this clause. The whole point of my argument is that when this Bill has become law, the Minister will be in a position to appoint a legally qualified officer to a certain position. He has intimated what his attitude will be. "I am not going," he says, "to make that appointment until some other person has had a chance of qualifying for it," which will mean for an indefinite period. </para>

            <para>- Some time ago a certain standard of examination was held to be sufficient. Under a later law, I understand that the examination has been stiffened somewhat. This particular officer qualified under the earlier law, and but for the fact that no vacancy occurred then, would have received promotion. But when a vacancy did arise, it was found that there was a defect in the law. Consequently, the appointment was not made, although a number of officers who were similarly qualified had been appointed to positions which they are filling to-day. </para>

            <para>- I do not mind that a bit. My objection is that the Minister intends to delay the appointment until men who to-day are unqualified have been afforded an opportunity of becoming qualified. The Minister's remarks in answer to the arguments of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> almost convince me that he recognises there is an element of unfairness in this case which he will remedy immediately after this Bill becomes law by appointing the officer who is admitted to be qualified, and whom the Minister tells us he would have appointed if an objection had not been raised. He induces me to hope that he will not carry out his intention of holding back that appointment further in order to give somebody else a chance of trying to qualify for it. If the Minister will say, " I propose to call for a further recommendation from my advisers," I shall have no objection. That disposes of the idea that I am particularly concerned about one particular officer getting the position. All that I ask is that, after this Bill Becomes law, the Minister will proceed to act under it. Let the Military Board make their recommendation as to men who are qualified. But the Minister should not hold the new law in suspense until somebody who is not qualified to-day, and who has failed to qualify on previous occasions, is given a chance of qualifying. </para>

          <para>. - I am sorry that the Minister takes things to himself so much. There is, no doubt, some dissatisfaction with the action of the Military Board in other arms of the Service. It seems peculiar that, we cannot find out these defects in the law until somebody is hurt. I know of another arm of the Service in which the regulations have distinctly been broken, and an officer has been appointed to a position to which he is not entitled. I intend to bring under notice the case of an officer who has been appointed lieutenant, a. position to which he is not entitled under the regulations.I know nothing about the present case, but it seems to me that some amount of undue influence has been brought to bear in certain quarters. </para>

            <para>- When a cadet is committed to a place of military detention, he will usually be committed to an area office or drill-hall in charge of an Area Officer. If there are a number of the cadets to be so treated, they will be compelled to attend at 8 or 9 o'clock in the morning, and will be kept there until the evening. They will be liable to turn up the next day until the time they have to serve is completed. While there they will be drilled, or set to clean rifles, or to clean the drill-halls until the number of hours is completed. </para>

I would like to ascertain how it is going to be recovered, because the duty of enforcing the penalty rests with the Court which imposes it. It is an extraordinary thing, indeed, it will be a most oppressive thing, that cadets, after they are fined in a Court, are to be brought into another Court and made the subject of a civil action to recover the amount of the penalty. </para><interjection>

            <para>- I think it was a very great mistake that the provision relating to Children's Courts was introduced. It is an absurd piece of unnecessary sentiment in regard to hearing a case of this description against a cadet in what is called the Children's Court. The Children's Court is not meant for that sort of thing. It is more detrimental to a cadet to be brought before the Children's Court, as it has to do with incorrigibles and children beyond the control of their parents. </para>

            <para>- The ' proposed new sub-sections will harass a man twice. If a penalty is inflicted upon a parent it is recoverable in the ordinary way. There is complete machinery for the purpose of enforcing it in the Magistrate's Court, where the penalty is imposed. Why he should be subjected to another proceeding in a Civil Court I cannot understand. In the case of a cadet it would be absolutely ineffective. I do not see how a child of tender years could be sued in a Court. It is not an action for a wrong. I know of no process which would enable it to be clone, and to merely say that it may be recovered in any Civil Court of competent jurisdiction would not make the lad liable, and, if he was liable, how are we going to get the money ? He has no furniture which can be seized under an execution. If there is a fine inflicted everybody must agree that it is desirable that the youth should not be sent into the common gaol in the first instance. That is one way of enforcing the penalty. The Minister has, I think, with great tenderness, provided that the enforcement of the penalty is to be by the sending of the young cadet into the custody of the authorized officer. If the lad does not turn up to perform the work set him by way of punishment he should be sent to goal for disobeying the order of the Court. Surely that is enough? It is the proper means of enforcing the penalty. Suppose that an ordinary soldier or grown-up person who does not attend to his drill is brought before a Court and a penalty is inflicted. He is ordered into custody if he does not pay the penalty. But I think that a soldier would laugh at the idea of being made subject alternatively to civil action for the recovery of the penalty in a Small Debts Court. I think that the provision has been put in inadvertently, and I suggest to the Minister that it should be disagreed with. </para>

          <para>. - Suppose that action is taken under the Act against a parent, a monetary penalty can be recovered in two ways, namely, by imprisonment or by execution. We do not want to put the man in gaol, and he may have no goods. The third alternative is to garnishee his wages or salary; and in order to do that it is necessary to have this power to proceed in a Civil Court. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir JOSIAH</inline>SYMON (South Australia) [12.41]. - This is going a very long way for a very small result. If the object is to eventually secure a garnishee order and an attachment on the petty wages of a lad, I think it is a blemish on these proceedings. It ought to arouse a good deal of resentment amongst parents and cadets. Without something more in the Act an action cannot be brought, because it does not create a debt. We all know that persons under the age of twenty-one years are not liable to be sued on debts or contracts. A penalty is not a tort or a wrong in that sense. To say the very least of it it is extremely doubtful whether any such proceedings can be taken unless we add some words to declare the penalty to be a debt recoverable against the person upon whom it was imposed, just as though he were twenty-One years of age. </para><para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lt.-Colonel Sir ALBERT</inline>GOULD (New South Wales) [12.42].- It is undesirable to make a pecuniary penalty against a lad between the ages of twelve and eighteen years recoverable as a debt. We have already determined that these youths shall not be liable to be sent to gaol if they do not attend their drills, but shall be sent to a place of military detention. I asked the Minister to tell me what would happen in the event of a cadet being allowed to go home at night, and refusing to return next day, really treating the order of the Court with contempt, and he told me that the lad could be prosecuted. </para><continue>

          <para>. - I join in the protest against this proposal. It should be borne in mind that there is a difference of opinion amongst the people of the Commonwealth with respect to the compulsory military training system, however unanimous we may be in this Parliament in favour of it. There is outside a reaction against the system because of the publicity recently given to the many hard cases which have resulted from the imposition of these fines. I had to. bring one case under the notice of the Minister, the particulars of which were widely circulated in my district, and have done an immense amount of harm. In the case to which I refer, the father of a lad actually handed him over to the officer in command, but, unfortunately, the lad did not subsequently put in the necessary number of drills, and a fine was imposed. The particulars of that case have been circulated, as I have said, and people are beginning to look upon the military authorities as monsters. Those who believe in compulsory military training ought to be very careful to do nothing which might create a prejudice against it. There are not many desperadoes amongst the boys of Australia, but, if there be even a considerable number of unruly lads, we might establish something in the nature of an industrial school to which they could be committed. </para>

            <para>- I do not think so ; but I do not think there would be the prejudice against it that there is against the garnishee system. There is no reason why a sentence against an offender should not be made indeterminate, so that he need not be discharged from such an institution as I suggest until he has made himself efficient. I sincerely hope that no action will be taken to further prejudice the system of compulsory military training in the eyes of the public. </para>

The difficulty might be overcome by having some place of military detention to which an offender might be committed for the period he was sentenced to serve. We cannot permit the lads to defy the law, and I do not think they should be sent to an ordinary gaol; but there is no reason why they should not be kept in some place of detention where they could be put through a proper course of military training. </para>

            <para>- The Vice-President of the Executive Council stated that while we have an overflowing Treasury, we should embrace the opportunity to erect all the buildings we may deem to be necessary in the interests of the Commonwealth. I need scarcely point out that if we have an abundant revenue, and if we expend it upon public works, we must necessarily provide a large measure of employment for the people. But private individuals are also desirous of laying out their capital to advantage, and of doing so with a view to making themselves secure when the lean years come round. This policy inevitably increases the cost of construction in every direction, and the cost of construction is an element which must be taken into consideration in connexion with the cost of living. By the expenditure of large sums upon public works, at high rates of wages, fictitious conditions will be established, which will only serve to accentuate the trouble we shall experience when that expenditure has to be curtailed in times of depression. It would be far better, I contend, if, instead of spending so largely in periods of prosperity, we made provision for carrying on a fair amount of work in the country during periods of depression, thus affording employment to the people. We must recollect, too, that in times of adversity, we cannot raise additional revenue by means of taxation. In saying that, I am merely repeating what has been the history of Australia since its earliest settlement. Years ago it used to be our boast that Australia was one of the lightest-taxed countries in the world. What do we find to-day? The reverse of the picture is becoming very apparent. If honorable senators will refer to the Budget-papers, they will see that the estimated revenue for the current financial year is <inline font-style="italic">£4</inline> 7s.per <inline font-style="italic">capita,</inline> as against <inline font-style="italic">£4 10s.</inline> last year, and <inline font-style="italic">£4</inline> 5s. the year previously. Those three years represent the period during which the Labour party have been in power, and if honorable senators will take the trouble to compare those figures with the figures relating to previous years, they will find that while there has been an enormous increase in our revenue <inline font-style="italic">per capita,</inline> taxation is higher to-day than it ever was before. </para>

            <para>- I will give the Vice-president of the Executive Council the benefit of that. The postal revenue <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> for the current year is estimated at 17s.103/4d., and from coinage, at 73/4d. These two items make a total of 18s. 61/2, which has to be deducted from the <inline font-style="italic">£4</inline> 7s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita,</inline> of which I have spoken. When that deduction has been made, it will be seen that an enormous amount of money will still have to be extracted from the people of this country. We must recollect that that taxation is not calculated upon the basis of the heads of families. It includes both the tiny infant and the old-age pensioner, who do not contribute to the revenue. This expenditure has to be collected from less than 1,000,000 heads of families. Consequently, it requires to be multiplied four or five times over if we are to ascertain, approximately, the amount which the bread-winners of the Commonwealth have to contribute. In this connexion we have also to consider the taxation which is levied by the State Governments upon their citizens. What that taxation averages I am not aware. But I do know that in New South Wales it is very much higher than it has hitherto been. In conjunction, Commonwealth and State taxation represents an enormous impost upon the people of this country. The question, therefore, naturally suggests itself, " Shall we be able to raise an equivalent amount during the lean years which we must experience sooner or later?" </para>

            <para>- When the Liberal party were in power, they had not anything like the revenue which the Commonwealth is collecting to-day. I recollect one Minister of the Crown who used to declare that the Commonwealth Government were the meanest Government he had ever known, because of the small amount which they expended upon their various services. In the early days of the Federation the Commonwealth was accustomed to return to the States large sums in excess of its constitutional obligations, and in that connexion it committed a very serious mistake, because many of the works which are now so urgently required might well have been undertaken then. </para>

            <para>- I neither advocated nor dissented from it. But whether I advocated it or not, I am perfectly free to admit that we made a serious mistake. It was not only a serious mistake in the interests of the Commonwealth, but also of the States themselves, because it induced them to spend money much more freely than there was any necessity to do. I should like honorable senators to look also to the large amount of revenue from Customs and Excise. It totals something like  £14,000,000.  Then there is the revenue from land tax,£1,400,000, derived from a very limited number of taxpayers. We cannot expect to obtain large sums from taxation always. We shall have good seasons and bad seasons. During good times taxation is not felt to be so oppressive as it is in bad times. The probability is that the revenue from land tax will diminish in consequence of the decreased value of lands available for taxation. If the policy of breaking up large estates be successful, the revenue from land tax will be small. We have to consider whether, in view of such contingencies, we can meet the expenditure with which we are faced. It is a wise thing for a country to exercise its taxation powers within reasonable limits. If the country were faced with a grave crisis such as war, our expenditure would naturally increase materially, and we ought to have such a reserve power of taxation as would enable us to raise money in an emergency. Otherwise, we are living in a fool's paradise. We seem to be spending money in every direction without considering whether the whole of the expenditure is justified, and without regard to the advisableness of distributing it over a number of years. If honorable senators take the trouble to read the literature regarding the finances of the Commonwealth, they will realize that we are pledged to enormous commitments. We do not even know what some of the works will ultimately cost. Over and over again, so many thousands are put down " towards cost of construction " of one work or another; but no intimation is given as to how much money will be required in the total. I have an instance in my mind regarding a public work that it was considered desirable to carry out, and which would probably cost£70,000 or£80,000. The sum put down was simply "towards construction" £  18,000  or thereabouts; and there was not a single word to show what the work would ultimately cost. </para>

            <para>- The Government may have an estimate of their own, but they do not furnish such information to us. Why have not members of Parliament particulars of these works in order that they may know to what we are committing ourselves? At some time we shall have a change of Government. The history of parliamentary government shows that the strongest party is always eventually sent into Opposition. It will be the ' same here. It will be a  nice  state of things for the Government that succeeds the present one to find itself faced with large commitments and an empty Treasury. I am reminded that in the case of the Western Australian railway we have no information as to how long the work will take to complete. </para>

            <para>- We have had no satisfactory information on the subject. The most definite thing that we know about the financial policy of the Government is that they are determined, as far as they possibly can, to pay for works out of revenue; and, if necessary, to impose extra charges upon the people to do so. Take the Defence expenditure. I am prepared to. support any reasonable policy to put this country in a proper state of defence. We have entered upon a national training system, and a na val defence system, which, speaking generally, I support; but it is alarming to contemplate the commitments we have in hand, and which are to be paid for out of current revenue. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> told us that we had spent last year£1,108,171 on naval construction, and that there is £1,196,829 at the disposal of the Government towards the construction of ships taken from the surplus revenue of last year. That money is to be provided out of current revenue for services the payment for which might very well have been spread over ten or twelve years. It would be far wiser to spread expenditure in that way. I admit that when it becomes necessary to add to our Fleet, we may have to take stock of the position afresh. In the early days, it would have been a fair and reasonable thing to distribute expenditure over a term of years instead of taking the money out of current revenue. It may be said that that policy involves borrowing money and paying interest. But the principle that I lay down is that when money is borrowed provision ought to be made for writing off the debt by annual sums with an amount added to provide for repairs. Under the heading of Home Affairs Department, an expenditure of <inline font-style="italic">£609,099</inline> is provided for defence purposes; under the heading of Defence Department a further sum of  ,£900,925  is provided ; while the cost of Defence administration runs up to  £2,869,693.  In other words, it is contemplated that the expenditure during the current year for Defence will be upwards of  ,£5,500,000.  While I want to see our Defence policy pursued efficiently and effectively, I also want it to be carried out on the most reasonable terms possible. When I recall the time - a comparatively few years ago - when it was laid down as a dictum by the Labour party that  £850,000  ought to be an ample sum to spend annually on the defence of this part of the Empire, and find that they are so largely increasing the annual expenditure, I pause to ask myself whence comes, this great change of opinion on their part. </para>

            <para>- I am glad to have the interjection, because it shows that our honorable friends opposite have realized the great necessity there is for defending the country. T give them all due credit for that. If we could afford to do it, it might be wise to expend twice the amount which they propose in any one year. I realize to the fullest extent not alone the advantage it is to us to protect ourselves, but the duty that devolves upon us to do what we can to assist in the defence of the Empire generally. And, of course, every citizen has a stake in the country, and an interest in its defence. I was very pleased to see the reply which the Minister of Defence gave to a deputation the other day when he reminded the gentleman who had said that a certain class had nothing to defend, that they had a great deal to defend. </para>

            <para>- I am not here to defend what other persons have said. But apart from that, I would point out to my honorable friends that the freedom which we enjoy is absolutely dependent upon our being able to maintain our policy by force of arms, or entirely dependent on the great old Mother Country, which has made it possible for a great free Australia to exist, and for the ideals of the people of this country to be carried into effect, although those ideals are felt by foreign nations to interfere with what they believe they ought to have the right to do. Were it not for that fact, mv honorable friend's ideal of a White Australia would be gone to-morrow. Their ideal of freedom, reasonable hours of labour, and reasonable rates of pay, would- go by the board if we had not the advantage of the protection of the Mother Country. Probably these Estimates contain very many items which might well have been allowed to stand over for another year. I know that where the revenue is limited, very frequently Governments have to decline to carry out many works which they consider would be to the great advantage of a particular district, or a Department. They have to cut their coat according to the cloth. We have to look to the possibilities of the future, and we should not rush into a great expenditure when we might obtain the same results on more easy and equitable terms to the taxpayers. I do not want to be misunderstood in the matter. We should consider where we are being led by these items. When I turn to the Estimates for the Postal Department,. I find large commitments, but I recognise that it is a Department which must be carried on, and is, to a certain extent, revenue producing. </para>

            <para>- How can I say where that should be done? In these Estimates, I find an item for a drill hall here," or a post-office there. What knowledge have I to enable me to say that the proposed expenditure should stand over till next year? I assume that the Government always make proper inquiries,, but I want them to realize that with an overflowing Treasury there is a great tendency to expend the money right away, irrespective of what may happen in The future. Then we want to know what is the policy of the Government, and in what circumstances these moneys are to be expended. Are fair opportunities to be given to everybody in the country? Are these public works to be carried out under a system of preference to unionists alone, or are they to be carried out under a system of open competition? It has been laid down by our honorable friends on the other side that preference to unionists should be observed, and we know, too, from reports or articles which we have read that a special provision was made a little time ago that when tenders are called for preference shall be given to unionists in all cases. I contend that the Government of the day have no business to advantage one portion of the community at the expense of the other. The Government of a country whether returned by a Labour or a Liberal party owe a duty not merely to the party by which they were returned, but to the people of the country, and they should give equal opportunities to every man in it. It is not for the Government of Australia to say that no one but unionists shall be permitted to earn any of the money which for public purposes is taken out of the pockets of the people who are unionists and non-unionists. The policy of the Government should be to know no person or persons in a matter of this kind, but simply to say, " There is public work to be done. It is immaterial to us whether it is done by unionists or non-unionists, so long as it is done honestly and fairly, and at a reasonable rate, and we get value in return." When my honorable friends say, as has been said, that preference is to be given to unionists, they are introducing in the most vicious way imaginable, the principle of " Spoils to the Victors." To-day, the Labour party happen to be on top. If they intend to expend the public moneys amongst their friends alone, then they will do a gross act of injustice to the people of the country, and will not be true to their position of trust. </para>

Is there any justification for saying that the unionist shall obtain- the Government money as against the non-unionist?

Two men are equally competent to perform a particular work, but the Government who have the public money to expend, say, " We are going to give a preference to the unionist, because he is just as good as the other man." I have no objection to an honest, straightforward trade union, but I do object to a political trade union in which a man has to abandon his political views and principles in order that he may have an opportunity of earning a crust for himself, his wife, and his family. That is one of the grossest injustices of which unionists are guilty. </para>

            <para>- If the honorable senator, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> and I were in a trade union, and some matter cropped up on which the honorable senator entertained a very strong antagonistic opinion, would he think it fair if we made him pay a third of the cost of carrying our view into effect? That is where it is unfair. If men want to band themselves together for the purpose of obtaining reasonable rates of wages, and reasonable conditions of labour, let them do so. I do not object to their action, but I do object to the other thing. However, I have been carried away from the point that I want to make, and that is that the policy of this Government has been, and is, preference to unionists. What have unionists done that, so far as earning wages is concerned, several millions sterling should be expended for their benefit alone? Again, take the question as it affects contracts. Why should there be a provision as to preference at all ? I can understand a provision that a man who receives a contract shall pay a reasonable rate of wages, but I do not understand this provision. Then I should like to know how much of this work is to be carried out by day labour. </para>

            <para>- There has been a great deal of outcry with regard to " The man on the job," but up to the present the Government have given no answer to the charges. If they could be disproved by the production of departmental documents, and we find that those documents are not produced, we are justified in assuming that there is a great deal more than a vestige of truth in those charges. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> will only use his influence with the Government to have the official documents produced we shall learn whether the charges which have been made have any foundation in fact or not. I am sure there is no one in the country who would not welcome a complete refutation of those charges. They have been made publicly by a reputable newspaper which has held a position of respect in the community for a great many years. It may be that honorable senators opposite do not believe in the policy of that newspaper, but that is no reason why they should treat charges made in it with contempt, particularly when they have been backed up in the way these charges have been. Statements have been deliberately made in another place that certain reports have been sent in to the Government. Is it not a very simple matter to ascertain the truth of those statements. The Prime Minister was invited to place the whole of the official documents on the table in another place. Has he done so? We know that he has not. A charge is made against a member of the Ministry, not that he has been corrupt, but that he has been hoodwinked by men who are not doing a fair day's work for his Department. It is said that supervising officers have sent in reports complaining that men employed by the Department have not been doing their duty. That is a definite statement. Another statement made is that the men can get the ear of the Minister, whilst superintendents and overseers are not given the same opportunity, and there is now such a reign of terror in the Department that responsible officers dare not make reports as to laxity in the work done by the <inline font-style="italic">men,</inline> or make them at their peril. </para>

            <para>- It is the duty of the Government to give the fullest possible information to Parliament. Why do we sit on different sides ? We are separated by certain political principles, but no matter what Government may be in power all their acts of administration should be of such a character that if any charges are made against them, it should be possible to refute them by the production of documents which could not have been prepared for a special occasion. No one would more gladly welcome than I should a complete refutation of these charges. </para>

            <para>- I have no objection to criticisms by the newspapers if they think we. are doing wrong. I hope that whatever may be the result of the charges made as to the way in which public works are being mismanaged the Government will, sooner or later, be in a position to refute them. I challenge them now to produce documents which will refute the charges made. If they are prepared to remain under the stigma cast upon them, and propose to suppress these documents, that is a matter for them to consider, but it is also a matter which the people will have to consider at an early date. </para>

            <para>.- Whilst giving the Government every credit for the expenditure of money in certain directions, I must take exception to the proposed allocation of the vote for new works for the Postal Department in Victoria. I find that a sum of  .£36,950  has been set down for new works in Victoria for the Postal Department ; but I very much regret to say that it is proposed that no less than  £28,800,  or about  66  per cent, of the vote, shall be spent in Melbourne and the metropolitan area. It is proposed to erect twenty new post-offices, in this State, and of that number nine are to be erected in the vicinity of Melbourne, and only eleven in the rest of the State. In the circumstances I am of opinion that the Government are not dealing fairly with the toilers of the country districts, who are after all the backbone of the State. </para>

              <para>- I am very pleased to know that they have the cash. They have not to resort to the borrowing policy to which my honorable friends opposite would like them to resort. They have the cash, and, therefore, do not require credit. I think that the Government have been wrongly advised by their officials, seeing that they practically affirm that out of  every £3  expended upon postal works in Victoria  £2  shall be spent in Melbourne and only _£i in the country. I have nothing to say against Melbourne. Indeed, I am rather proud of it. But it is not the hub of the universe, or even of Victoria ; and, although more than half the population of this State is settled in it, that is no reason why  66  per cent, of the money to be expended upon postal works in Victoria should be spent in this city. I am strongly opposed to centralization. I hold that the Government are spending too much in the metropolis, and are thereby inflicting a wrong upon the country. I would prefer to see a greater amount upon the Works Estimates for expenditure in other portions of Victoria rather than such a large sum for expenditure in Melbourne. </para>

              <para>- Where half the people are. If the Government, had proposed to expend in Melbourne one-half instead of two-thirds of the money which appears upon these Estimates for postal works in Victoria, it would not have been so bad. But when they propose to expend two-thirds of the money devoted to postal works in Victoria upon half the population of this State, they are doing an injustice to the country districts. Under the division " Telegraphs and Telephones," I find that  £60, 1 50  is to be spent upon the " construction and extension of telephone lines, instruments, and material, including construction of conduits and placing wires underground." If we are to attach any importance to the remarks which have fallen from the lips of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould,</inline> we must come to the conclusion that out of this expenditure of  £60,150,  possibly  £150  will be spent upon postal works, and  £60,000  upon the upkeep of the man who is loafing on the job. I, for one, repudiate the statements which have been made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> to-day, and on a former occasion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon.</inline> The allegations that the men who are employed by the Postal, </para>

              <para>- They are not. If a single charge can be proved against any man employed in a public Department which the Government have to administer - I do not limit my statement to those who are employed in the undergrounding of our telephone wires - that individual should be reprimanded, and, if the necessity arises, should be dismissed from the Service. I am not here to advocate the claims to special treatment of any person in the Service who happens to be in sympathy with the views of the Labour Party. Neither am I actuated by any bias towards the individual who may be an opponent of that party. I merely say that, irrespective of their political opinions, the Government should pay a fair wage to the men they employ, and should expect a fair day's work in return. </para>

              <para>- In my opinion, the  Deputy  Postmaster-General would not forward to the head of any Government a report from one of his subordinates which was nothing more nor less than a' tissue of lies. In my opinion the whole of these villainous charges which have been made about "the man on the job" have absolutely failed, just as have other charges which have been made with the object of injuring the Government. The accusations in regard to the appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> as an engineer on the transcontinental railway broke down in very much the same way. That, also, was a mare's nest. The evidence shows that the appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> was not only thoroughly justified, but that, if everybody had his due, he was entitled, by reason of his abilities and character, to be, at all events, second in charge, if not, indeed, principal engineer of the line. </para>

              <para>- I observe an item of£312 set down for the construction of drill halls in Victoria.. That sum is totally inadequate. Recently I had the pleasure of introducing to the Minister of Defence a deputation from representatives of various public bodies in Warragul, in Central Gippsland. They pointed out the difficulties and disadvantages under which youths are receiving their military training in that part of the country. These youths are absolutely imbued with the spirit of patriotism and are keen to participate in the defence of their country. At present, however, they are deterred owing to the difficulties under which their training is undergone. The climatic conditions of the part of Gippsland where they reside, the state of the roads, and the distances to be traversed, are in themselves handicaps ; but, in addition to that, there is a serious want of proper drill halls. Under existing circumstances, the youths are not doing justice either to themselves or to their Area Officers. With all respect to the sympathetic administration of the Minister, I do not think that £312, the amount set down on page 9 of this Bill, for drill halls, can be anything like adequate. It is only a drop in the ocean. Requests will come in from various parts of the country, as well as from the metropolitan districts. I give all credit to some public bodies, especially at Footscray, Victoria, as well as other towns that I could instance, in loyally coming to the assistance of the Government in placing at our disposal public buildings for drilling purposes. </para>

              <para>- Certainly; because they realize that however little they may have to lose, they have a common interest in defending this country, and warding off risk of attack by a foreign foe. I am very pleased that the Minister was so emphatic, definite, and logical in the answers that he made to a deputation of worthy people, representing a certain body, that waited upon him during the last day or two. He pointed out that every man, woman, and child in Australia has something to defend. Those of us who have not property have our liberties, our hearths, and homes, and our native land. I know that I am not appealing to deaf ears when I make this appeal to the Minister, and point out that  £312  is a paltry and utterly inadequate sum for drill halls in Victoria. </para>

              <para>- I am very pleased, indeed, to know that there is another vote under another heading. I have absolute confidence in the Government, and was satisfied, from the sympathetic attitude of the Minister, that the amount which I have called attention to could not be the total. I thought it was either a clerical or typographical error. I also feel keenly as to the determination of the Defence Department to deprive certain worthy citizens of this community of the right to wear a certain uniform when they join the Defence Forces. I refer to the kilts of the Scottish Regiment. There is not a drop of Celtic blood in my veins, as far as I am  aware, and I have no especial reason for appearing here as an advocate for the canny Scot But I recognise that it has come down as a tradition that one of the factors which has made the British Empire what it is to-day is the fighting power of the Scotch, and one of the things that the Scotsman loves almost above everything, else - next, indeed, to the diabolical bagpipe - is the kilt. I honour the Scot for his reverence for national tradition. I sympathize with him in that respect. I see eye toe ye with him, though I am not, so to speak, ear-to-ear with him in respect of the barbarous sounds emitted from the bagpipe. I do trust that the Minister of Defence will give careful and deliberate attention to the request that has been made that he will not abolish from our Defence Forces that picturesque garment which' the Scotch, perhaps in their folly, regard as essential to the maintenance of a spirit of military ardour within them. Some of my friends who are keenest in the defence of Australia, and in their love of our military system, have the greatest adoration for the dress of their forefathers. </para>

              <para>- I will say a word or two about the Northern Territory.  1  observe that the sum of <inline font-style="italic">£2,000</inline> is set down for artesian water bores and dams, and similar purposes. I am pleased at that, because it is a useful vote. I am afraid that this sum will not go far in the direction of boring for artesian water, but after having had the pleasure of listening to Captain Barclay, who pointed out how essential to the development of the eastern portion of the Northern Territory, between .the Macdonnell Ranges and Borroloola, was a full and adequate supply of . water, I thoroughly realized how necessary it is that efforts should be made in this direction. It is also necessary, in my opinion, that adequate railway construction should be undertaken for the development of the Northern Territory. For that reason I hail with delight the sum of money put down for the survey of a railway line from Pine Creek to the Katherine River,  ,£4,200.  That amount will not go far, but it is a start. As one who has recently travelled between Pine Creek and the Katherine River, I am convinced that, no matter how much opinions may differ with regard to the connexion of Queensland with the Northern </para>

              <para>- It is. Even if it is decided afterwards not to continue the railway southward through the Macdonnell Ranges - if we carry the  Tine  over to Camoo-weal - the little piece from Pine Creek to the Katherine River' must be built. I an glad that the Government are showing that they are earnest in their desire to link up the empty north, the Achilles' heel of this continent, with the great, populous districts of the south. I trust that mining grants will be given to the Northern Territory. I am even pleased to observe a vote  on  these Estimates for a steam laundry, £1,000. It may seem a peculiar item - ' rather childish to some, perhaps - but those who have been north, and have seen that the only means of getting clean linen is at the hands of the " yellow agony " - which means getting under the thumb of our almond-eyed Mongolian friends - will welcome this vote. Unfortunately, at present the white race of the Territory are too much dependent upon the other races, who may contaminate their clothes with diseases peculiar to yellow men. </para>
