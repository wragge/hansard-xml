                    <para>- In making the statement in the Senate on  17th  July, which gave a personal affront  to  Colonel Ryrie, I was incensed at the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report  of  his speech  of  the  5th  July, which I considered contained a reflection  on  my personal honour. As members of my party Have assured me that  Colonel Ryrie  did not intend to reflect upon my personal honour, in these circumstances I unhesitatingly withdraw my offensive expression towards him. </para>

                        <para>. - I freely admit that it is within the right of any honorable senator to challenge any regulation or Ordinance which may be tabled here, and when that course is taken the rest of the business of the country must be set aside, so far as the Senate is concerned, till the challenge has been dealt with. Nearly the whole of yesterday&#39;s sitting was occupied by  a  challenge of this description. Although  I  have no desire that the discussion on the Crown Lands Ordinance for the Northern Territory should be limited, yet I hope that it may be finished to-day, so as to allow the other business on the notice-paper to be proceeded with. I think that in challenging the Ordinance, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> was really more opposed to the leasing principle which has been adopted by the Government, and embodied in an Act of Parliament, than to the Ordinance itself. Some time ago we passed an Act for the administration of the Northern Territory. With the concurrence of both Houses of this Parliament, the leasehold principle in the Northern Territory was adopted in preference to the freehold system. I wish to point &#39;0111 that when clause 11 of the Bill was under discussion in this Chamber, the Leader of the Opposition raised no objection to that principle, but seemed to agree with it just as did honorable senators upon this side of the chamber. </para>

It is true that in Committee Senators Gould and Walker, in their usually mild manner, entered a slight protest against the principle ; but their protest had <inline font-style="italic">no</inline> effect, and the leasehold principle was adopted by Parliament, and embodied in the Act. It is too late in the day now to challenge that principle. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know what influence a discussion of this kind can have on a future election, seeing that the leasehold principle has already been adopted. The only way in which that system could be altered would be by an amendment of the Act. I wish now to point out the conditions&#39; which obtain in connexion with the Ordinance made under the Act in respect of leasehold land. A great deal was said by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> in regard to the immense areas which may be held under lease in the Territory but he was particularly careful not to disclose the full facts in any reference which he made to that subject As a matter of fact, provision is made in the Act for the classification of the land into pastoral, grazing, and agricultural areas, or into grazing and mixed farming lands and agricultural lands. The pastoral areas are divided into three classes. From division1 to division 3 the area which may be held by a lessee is multiplied by six. In the first division of pastoral lands, a lessee may hold up to a maximum of 500 square miles. Of course, the Classification Board and the Director of Lands, in considering the allotment of leases of that description, need not grant an area up to 500 square miles ; but that is the limit to which they may go. Of second class pastoral lands a lessee may take up to a maximum of 1,000 square miles, so that these holdings may range between 500 and 1,000 square miles. In the third class of pastoral lands a lessee may hold under this Ordinance, and under the Act which authorizes it, a maximum of 3,000 square miles, or six times the lowest maximum. I have heard some honorable senators say that that is too much. I am not going to say whether it is too much or too little; but honorable senators must recognise that we have accepted the responsibility of administering an enormous territory - a territory which is practically unexplored up to the present time. </para>

                            <para>-We will talk about that at a later stage. The Leader of the Opposition, in his usual clever manner, attempted to make it appear that great danger is likely to arise out of the privileges conferred upon lessees under this Ordinance; but, as a matter of fact, a very large portion of the Territory is not only unoccupied, but unexplored. What is 50,000 or 100,000 square miles out of an area of 500,000 square miles ? The honorable senator will see that, although there are large areas held under lease under the South Australian law, there is an enormous tract of country which is still unoccupied, and which is likely to be unoccupied for many years. If we look at the history of settlement of other parts of Australia, we shall find that, although all the States have been under some form of government for nearly 100 years, not one of them is occupied or developed up to its full extent. It is conceivable that circumstances may arise in connexion with the administration of the Northern Territory which may render it advisable to lease far-back portions of it in areas up to even 3,000 square miles if anybody can be found willing to take them. When we look at the vastness of that Territory, when we consider the short time that it has been under the control of the Commonwealth, and when we realize that this legislation is to a very great extent of an experimental character, we must admit that we should endeavour to do something to make its occupation possible in the near future, and to give the greatest latitude to those who are prepared to settle there, particularly to those who are willing to settle in remote portions which at the present time are inaccessible to ports at which the settlers could ship their produce. The Government have been careful to select men to administer the affairs of the Territory who are in sympathy with the leasehold principle which is laid down in that provision of the Act to which I have already referred. While I am on the matter of classification I may as well deal with the classification of agricultural land. Agricultural lands in subdivision A, cultivation farms, are divided into two classes. In the first class an area may go up to a maximum of 640 acres. That is to say, a lease may be given for any area up to that limit, which, in the opinion of the Classification Board, is sufficient to maintain a family or to reward those who may take up land. In the next class the maximum is four times 640 acres - that is to say, 2,560 acres. Land of that class can be held for agricultural purposes under agricultural conditions, and at an agricultural rental. Under subdivision B, mixed farming and grazing, the maximum  in the first class is  12,800  acres. In the second class the maximum goes up to five times that area, namely, 64,000 acres. So that honorable senators will see that those who have, up to the present time, had the administration of the Territory, and who have been advising the Government, have submitted suggestions which have been embodied in this Ordinance. When we take into consideration the enormous area and the variety of classes of land, we must realize the advisableness of trusting the Classification Board and the Director of Lands to do a fair thing with respect to the development of the Territory. </para>

                            <para>- There are principles on which advice can be given without examination on the spot. I will next refer to the subject of reclassification, which is dealt with in clause  8.  As I have already stated, we are in an experimental stage, and it is necessary that the Classification Board should have the power of reclassification in the future. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> argued that there was an absurdity in providing for reclassification when neither rental nor area could be interfered with. We cannot interfere with area, because that will be specified in the lease, and we cannot interfere with the rental until the next appraisement, because that also will be specified in the lease. But when we can interfere with the conditions under which land is held, there should be reclassification. Land which ought to be regarded as a grazing and agriCultural area might be classified as a purely agricultural area. The lessee might hold up to  12,800  acres. That would be held under different conditions than would apply in connexion with an agricultural area. In the same way, if in the near future accommodation was provided by means of railways and other conveniences for those occupying pastoral lands, those lands might be reclassified by being brought into the class of agricultural and grazing lands. </para>

                            <para>- We tell the lessees at the start what the conditions are. But all the conditions that a lessee has to abide by are contained in the lease, and neither the area nor the rental can be altered till the next appraisement. The intention is that land shall not be continuously held in enormous areas for purposes which the Almighty never intended. Land should not be held  in  enormous areas for pastoral purposes, when reclassification might show that it ought to be regarded as agricultural. In a new country like the Northern Territory it cannot be said that the principle of reclassification is wrong as long as the tenant knows in advance that reclassification can be effected. Suppose that a lessee holds  12,800  acres under a grazing and agricultural lease, and that in a few years that land is reclassified and brought under purely agricultural conditions. Although the authorities could not alter the rent, and could not affect the area till the next reappraisement, yet the conditions in connexion with fencing, stocking, cultivation, and all that kind of thing would be entirely different, and as soon as the reappraisement was made the rent would be put up in proportion to the true value of the land. That is simply safeguarding the interests of the community, while we are dealing with matters from an experimental point of view. We must all admit that whenever the Leader of the Opposition speaks on any subject he has the ability to put his case in the most favorable light, and from the most advantageous point of view. There is a possibility that by not revealing the whole truth about a matter he may, in some instances, mislead those who have not taken the same interest in it as he has done himself. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, people like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> who are naturally innocent and unsophisticated, though I know some questions as to which it would be as difficult to deceive the honorable senator as any man in the Senate. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> raised a serious objection to the provision in clause16e for the limitation of use. Has the honorable senator ever considered the conditions imposed in private leases? I never saw a private lease in which there was not a condition as to limitation of use, and peremptory conditions as to improvements, maintenance, and a dozen other things. In limiting the use to which lands may be put under a lease, we wish to provide that, for instance, factories shall not be built upon agricultural land. </para>

                            <para>- It is because we have faith in the Board that we give them these elastic powers. If we had no faith in them we should make this Ordinance so rigid that the Board could turn neither to the right nor the left, and would have to administer a hide-bound and cast-iron set of rules. As this is largely experimental, it is necessary that the Ordinance should be elastic. The object is to give the Classification Board and the Director of Lands an opportunity to determine whether lands granted under lease are being put to the best use, or to the use for which they were granted. Whenever, in their opinion, land may be put to a more profitable use, they have the power to reclassify it, and, while giving the lessee good conditions, which will enable him to make a good living, and, probably, an independence in the future, will be able to do something to protect the interests of the general public. That is the purpose which members of this Parliament will have in view in consenting to elastic provisions in an Ordinance of this description. Apart from the provisions for the limitation of use, the Leader of the Opposition took serious objection to the additional conditions provided for. He attempted to argue that, after a lease had been granted in the Northern Territory, new conditions never previously imagined by the lessee might be introduced into the lease. </para>

                            <para>- There are many additional conditions which it may be found necessary to impose in future leases. When a lease is granted to an individual, it represents a contract with the Administration of the Northern Territory, and no one can alter the terms of that contract until the time for re-appraisement arrives, when it can be altered only in respect of the rent, or until the land is reclassified or resumed, and the lessee is already notified of these contingencies in the Ordinance. All these things are provided for. The additional conditions referred to in clause  31  have nothing to do with the conditions of a lease already granted, unless by mutual consent; and we know that where there is mutual consent, the terms of any agreement may be varied. There is, therefore, nothing in the honorable senator&#39;s argument in opposition to the additional conditions,. </para>

                            <para>- Another very mild complaint was made with respect to miscellaneous leases. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> seems to imagine that some injustice may be done because provision is made for the issue of miscellaneous leases, not by the Classification Board or the Director of Lands, but by the Administrator of the Territory. It is necessary to remind the honorable senator that this provision is included in the Ordinance to enable leases to be granted for the removal of bark or timber, or for the erection of factories, and a number of other similar purposes. As these will involve matters of policy rather than of land administration, it has been thought by those who are responsible for the Ordinance that it is better that they should be left to the Administrator than to the Classification Board or the Director of Lands. Honorable senators will admit the wisdom of placing the issue of these miscellaneous leases under the control of the Administrator. The next objection of a serious character which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has taken to this Ordinance is in connexion with the terms of resumption. Honorable senators on this side will be agreed that the terms of the resumption will prove a safeguard against the continuance of the occupation of great areas which it may be found necessary at the inauguration of settlement in the Territory to grant to individuals. When it is thought advisable to resume any area already granted under lease, the lessee will be placed in no worse position than that in which a freeholder has always been. The only difference will be that we set out in the Ordinance that the authorities of the Northern Territory have power to resume lands held under lease, and the lessees will know that before they take up their land. </para>

                            <para>- I do not agree with the honorable senator. Under a perpetual lease, the lessee will have a better guarantee of permanence of occupation than he could have under a terminable lease. Under a terminable lease he might not be able to secure his land again after re-appraisement or reclassification, but under a perpetual lease he will continue his right to occupy the land, under the new conditions decided upon. It may be some years before the necessity for a resumption may arise, for in such a large territory it will be rather tedious work of development to provide railways and communication of &#39;that description. Under the terms of the Ordinance, no lessee will be able to claim compensation for the value which has been given to the lease by any expenditure incurred by the Commonwealth. All the compensation that a lessee will have the right to claim will be the value which he has given to the land he holds &#39;apart from any work which has been done by the Commonwealth with the people&#39;s money. Seeing that all this is clearly set forth in the Ordinance, a lessee will be in no worse  a  position than an ordinary freeholder has been in up to the present time. When an honorable senator bought land years ago, probably he had no idea at the time that  a  law would ever be passed enabling either a State or the Federal Government to resume freehold land under certain conditions of arbitration or agreement. If we object to the resumption of leasehold land we should also object to the resumption of freehold land, but <inline font-style="italic">we</inline> have freely assented to the resumption of freehold in the Lands Acquisition Act. Consequently, there is nothing serious in connexion with the terms of resumption which would place a lessee in the Northern Territory in a worse position than a freeholder in any other part of Australia. Seeing the favorable terms which they will get, no persons will, I feel sure, object to taking up leases in the </para>

                    <para class="block">Northern Territory. Another objection raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> to the Ordinance was that the consent of the Director of Lands is required to the transfer of  a  lease. Is there anything unreasonable in that requirement ? I feel sure that any honorable senator will say that the consent of the Government should be obtained in a case of this kind. Have honorable senators ever known the same provision to be contained in leases granted by private enterprise? Nearly every lease of private land contains a condition that the lease shall not be transferred without the consent of the owner. How can such a condition in  a  Crown lease be objectionable when it is clearly in the public interest ? Suppose that there are a dozen applicants for a lease, and that the land is leased to what the Board considers the most suitable applicant. If the Ordinance did not contain this provision, the lessee could turn round and transfer the lease to a person who might be considered by the Board to be unworthy or unsuitable to get any land. Honorable senators will surely see, not only the advisableness, but the great necessity, for requiring the consent of the Director of Lands, or other authority, to the transfer of the lease to be obtained. </para>

                            <para>- If a lessee dies intestate, and has no heirs, the lease will lapse; but if he leaves any heirs they will make a claim, and, no doubt, it will be fairly adjudicated upon.

The men whom we have appointed to administer the Northern Territory are supposed to be sensible men, who will deal with the tenants of the Crown in a reasonable way. If evidence can be shown that a transfer to  a  certain person is necessary or advisable, it will be granted at once, but if it is a case where the lessee is prepared to transfer the lease to Tom, Jack, or Harry, whether he is a suitable person of5 not, the Director of Lands, or the Board, ought to have the right to refuse the application.

                            <para>- The provision does not apply to a case of that kind. It applies to the case of a lessee who, because the climate or the conditions do not suit him, or for some family reason, finds some person to whom he can transfer his lease, very probably for a consideration. He will have to get the consent of the Director of Lands or the Board to a transfer. It is a wise provision, because those who will have to administer the land must see that the future occupier, or the person to whom the lease is to be transferred, will be as good or as satisfactory a tenant as the original lessee. There is nothing unfair in the requirement at all. In everyday life throughout the world, this condition is put in private leases. It may be objected by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> that the obtaining of this consent will not have the effect of preventing aggregation. </para>

                            <para>- Oh, yes ; but in my opening remarks I pointed out that the Ordinance was made elastic for the purpose of overcoming difficult situations which may arise in the experimental stage. There is no doubt that after we have had a little experience a Land Bill will be brought before this Parliament, probably dealing with all these subjects, and finally dealing with them so far as future leases are concerned. If any leases are granted before its enactment, they will be issued under the provisions of this Ordinance. I do not think that any human ingenuity could devise anything which would conduce more to the possibility of settlement than will this Ordinance at the present time. I think that those who have the interests of the leasing system at heart will admit that the Government have tried to get men whose sympathies are with the leasehold principle, and they, knowing the policy of the Government and their supporters with respect to land aggregation, will be very careful in dealing with the transfer of leases to see that no large estates or large interests are created. </para>

                            <para>- I am not dealing with the Administrator, as the Government have settled that question. We did our best to get the most competent men available - that is, men who have some belief in the leasehold principle, and no belief in the aggregation of large estates. Another objection raised tq the Ordinance was that it dealt with the manner of cultivation, and it was contended that there should be no supervision of the treatment of the land of the Crown. A leaseholder might desire to cultivate a description of grass or herb, which, in his opinion, would be all right, but which, in the opinion of the rest of the community, might be all wrong, and do great damage to the settlement in the neighbourhood. It is right in contracts of this description to have a condition that the cultivation shall be carried out in the interests of, not a single individual, but the whole community. </para>

                            <para>- In legislation, the practice is to take the widest powers, but it is not always found wise to exercise them .in an extreme manner. If, in the opinion of the Director of Lands, or those in authority in the Northern Territory, it would in any locality be better to cultivate certain articles than something else, they ought to have the power to direct that that should be done by the lessee. Thousands of persons will, I hope, go to the Northern Territory, many ot whom will have had very little experience of tropical cultivation. It is wise, therefore, to declare in an Ordinance of this description that something of that sort shall obtain. When the time arrives for a comprehensive Land Bill to be brought before the Senate, honorable senators will be afforded an opportunity of looking into the matter, with a view to insuring that no damage shall be done. As to fencing and other conditions appertaining to die different classes of leases, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> stated that settlers might be compelled to put up extraordinary kinds of fences every six months. </para>

                            <para>- He meant that the authorities might compel settlers to erect unnecessarily elaborate fences, and force them to alter or remove them at short intervals. But I would remind him that the conditions relating to fencing, so far as agricultural blocks are concerned, differ from the conditions relating to fencing in connexion with larger areas. Under the different classifications of land for which provision has been made, it is necessary to embody fencing conditions in the leases, and to administer those leases in a reasonable manner. In connexion with the smaller areas, conditions may be imposed rendering it obligatory on the part of lessees to fence them within a shorter period. But in respect of the larger areas no regulation has yet been framed for that purpose. When a regulation is framed in connexion with boundary fences, no doubt it will be submitted to Parliament, so that every honorable senator will have an opportunity of discussing it. From my point of view, the whole of the objections which were urged against this Ordinance were of a trifling character. I was sorry, indeed, for the Leader of the Opposition, because he always makes the very best of any subject which he takes in hand. However, on this occasion his premises were palpably weak, and, consequently, his arguments were of a very feeble character. The next objection which he raised had reference to the maintenance of the South Australian laws in the Territory. Now, before the Commonwealth took over the Territory, the South Australian laws were operative there. So far, we have passed only two Acts dealing with the Northern Territory, namely, the Northern Territory Acquisition Act and the Northern Territory Administration Act, under which this Ordinance has been framed. Do honorable senators imagine that it is possible, with our short experience of that country, to provide for every contingency that may arise there? We have merely declared - as has been declared in hundreds of Acts of Parliament passed by the States - that, where certain conditions have not been provided for by Statute, or Ordinance, or regulation, the South Australian law shall prevail. What did the States themselves do when they commenced to enact legislation? If a suspicion was entertained that that legislation was not complete, a clause was always inserted in it affirming that where that condition did obtain the common law of England should prevail. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> knows - and probably <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> knows, too - that sometimes even the Statute law of England was made to prevail in the legislation enacted by some of the States. </para>

Of course, enormous areas have been granted by the South Australian Government in connexion with pastoral lands in the Northern Territory. They have granted areas of 10,000 and 20,000 squaremiles. </para>

                            <para>- Does not the honorable senator know that when any of these lease-holders apply to convert their holdings into perpetual leases they will have to comply with the conditions laid down by the Classification Board in the Northern Territory ? If they desire to obtain a perpetual pastoral lease in class I. country, they will be able to secure a maximum of only 500 square miles. Similarly, in class II. of pastoral country, they will be at liberty to take up a maximum of only 1,000 square miles, whilst in class III. they will be able to secure a maximum of only  3,000  square miles. So that if these lessees think they will be better off with a perpetual lease of from 500 to  3,000  square miles than they are with a terminable lease of 10,000 square miles under the South Australian law, that is their choice. Is there anything wrong in that ? </para>

                            <para>- If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> wishes to substitute a terminable lease for a perpetual lease, he merely differs from the advisers of the Government. Under the powers of resumption to which I have referred, there can be no danger of the aggregation which has occurred in the different States, and which has rendered necessary the imposition .of a progressive land tax. It is with a view to making the conditions of the Territory as acceptable to its future inhabitants as possible that we are offering these liberal conditions. The next objection urged by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> had reference to the provision requiring an applicant to produce a medical certificate of physical fitness. I do not think there is anything very serious in that objection, because the strongest advocates of immigration in Australia are prepared to subject every intending immigrant to a medical examination before permitting him to come here. It will also be remembered that in our Immigration Restriction Act we .have laid down conditions with a view to preventing persons suffering &#39;from certain complaints from gaining admission to the Commonwealth. We provide that they must be shown to be honest, healthy, and intelligent individuals before they are allowed to land here. In connexion with the Northern Territory, we must recollect that the Board who will have the selection of its settlers will never see them. The latter will probably make application from New South Wales, South Australia, India, England, and New Zealand. Surely the Board who will be responsible -for the settlement of this country should take some precautions to see that only wholesome, healthy citizens are settled in the Territory. There is no suggestion that that country is unsuitable for persons of weaker physical constitution. </para>

                            <para>- Certainly. Although there is nothing in the climatic conditions of the Northern Territory calculated to impair the health of most people, yet a new country like that will be much more effectively developed by strong, healthy citizens who, before they go there, have been certified to be in good health, and to be possessed of sound constitutions, than it would be by weaklings. I wish honorable senators distinctly to understand, however, that the production of this certificate will be required only when asked for. When the Director of Lands or the Land Board consider it is necessary that the certificate should be produced, it will be asked for. But when it was not considered necessary, it would not be asked for. It is in the interests of the development of the Territory that this regulation is made. Another condition objected to by the honorable senator relates to the obtaining of confidential information. </para>

                            <para>- What is confidential information but secret information? I suppose the honorable senator is endeavouring to do the same thing in connexion with the leasehold principle as his friends used to do with the Labour party. We have always called ourselves a Labour party, but our opponents tried to make out that we were anarchists, nihilists, and I do not know what else. These epithets were applied as though we were persons to be dreaded. The same tactics are being resorted to in connexion with the system of administration that we are carrying on. It is sought to make it appear that there is something sinister and reprehensible in this policy - something that&#34; ought not  to be tolerated by the country. As I have said, the Board will have very little opportunity of coming into personal contact with many of the applicants. Consequently, it is necessary that information should be obtained about them. When that information is given, it is to be regarded as confidential. Naturally, the Board will endeavour to obtain information from people who have no interest in endeavouring either to exalt the virtues or exaggerate the vices of applicants. But the information is required so as to enable the Board to come to a conclusion as to the merits of intending settlers. There is nothing wrong in that. It would be a good thing if a system of the same kind were adopted in connexion with the allotment of land by Land Boards of States. Frequently, these Boards take evidence which is not given on oath, accepting the statements of individuals who have an interest in misrepresenting people and lying about them. Under that system, land has been allotted to persons who ought never to have got a foot of it, and who never intended to cultivate it. </para>

                            <para>- No ; we are only making an honest attempt to obtain the best kind of settlers for the Territory. As the Administration and the Board cannot be expected to come down from the Territory and interview applicants personally, they have to do the next best thing. We have a right to protect those who give information to assist the Government in the selection of settlers for the Territory. The next objection raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> was in connexion with clause  20  of the Ordinance. It relates to the period of reappraisement. I do not think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> would be intentionally unfair, but there was no justification for endeavouring to make the Senate believe that reappraisement would take place every month or so, or as often as a new building was put up in proximity to a holding. </para>

                            <para>- I cannot say that the honorable senator knows his statement to be incorrect, but he knows that there is no probability of anything of the kind being done. Suppose that a lessee takes up a town block, which is subject to re-appraisement, in any case, every fourteen years. He gets the block at a certain rent. As Government money is spent, the value&#34; of land is increased. The holding of a settler whose case I am supposing may be .&#39; increased in value from &#163;100 to &#163;1,000. Ought the occupier of the lease to be the only person to benefit from that expenditure of public money ? This clause gives an opportunity for re- appraisement in the event of the expenditure of public money increasing the value of holdings. But if nothing of the kind is done, there can be no re-appraisement for fourteen years. </para>

                            <para>- We hold that, when a block of land is increased in value by the expenditure of public money, the lessee of the block should be expected to pay more in consequence of the increase. If not, who should bear the cost? Should we down here do so? Should other citizens in the Northern Territory bear the whole expenditure on account of public works in Port Darwin? The principle of re- appraisement at other times than- the fourteen years&#39; period stipulated is a fair thing. The individual affected may not like it, but the rest of the community will think it fair; and we must have regard to the interests of the community as a whole. Another objection raised was in connexion with the forfeiture of leases when conditions are not observed. Under such circumstances, somebody ought to have the power to forfeit a lease. A similar condition applies in every private contract. </para>

                            <para>- This is not temptation, but a necessary provision. A Board would be much more cumbrous to  move. This provision is elastic. If the lessee whose lease has been forfeited thinks he has been unfairly treated, he can appeal to the Administrator, and the Administrator may restore the lease. I am afraid that the honorable senator has been looking for mares&#39; nests in the  Ordiance,  but he has found no eggs yet. It is considered by the Government that it is better, in the interests of the individual whose lease may be ^forfeited, that he should appeal to the Administrator than that we should work through a Board. That is my opinion also. I do not know why the honorable senator should cast suspicion on the Administrator, and suggest that he would not hold the balance evenly. </para>

                            <para>- No doubt, the honorable senator means that he would give a person looking for land the option to choose the terms he thought best. But we are not proposing anything of that kind. We submit to intending settlers in the Northern Territory certain definite conditions. They have been set down in the Act to which I have already referred, and are further developed by this Ordinance. I have already stated that this question, as dealt with by the Leader of the Opposition, is the question of leasehold <inline font-style="italic">versus</inline> freehold. The leasehold system has been adopted by this Parliament, and the honorable senator never questioned it when the matter was before the Senate. We are endeavouring to carry out the leasehold system in the. best manner that can be suggested by an efficient staff of officers, and the intelligent consideration of the members of the Government. </para>

                            <para>- If the honorable senator&#39;s statement is of any value, he must know well how to draw up a land Ordinance, and if he can do it better than any one else, I shall recommend him to the Attorney-General for the work when it is necessary to issue another Ordinance of this kind. The honorable senator is not the only experienced land administrator in Australia. There are others who know a little-&#39; about land, as well as the honorable senator. I am sorry that the position of Director of Lands is filled, because, from his own showing, and according to the opinion of some of his friends, the honorable senator would be an admirable person to fill that position. But he expresses so much suspicion of the officers who have already been&#39; appointed to deal with these matters in the Northern Territory, that I am afraid he might be -equally suspicious of applicants for agricultural, pastoral, or grazing leases,  and would find very few settlers who could satisfy him. I have endeavoured, to the best of my abilities, to explain away the difficulties of the honorable senator. If I have not been successful I must, I suppose, admit that my experience has not been as extensive as that of the honorable gentleman ; but, seeing that I was digging potatoes from the time when I was ten years of age, I ought to know as much about land as some people. I have no wish to curtail the privileges of any honorable senator. I could not do so if I had, nor would I do so; but J hope that, in order that the rest of the business of the country may be  proceeded  with, the debate on this Ordinance will be reasonable, and will be terminated as soon as possible. </para>

                        <para>. - I am in agreement with very much; that the Vice-President of the Executive Council has said. I was pleased to hear the effective answer he was able to give to the greater portion of the criticism of Senator Millen. But, notwithstanding all that has been said, since we cannot deal with this Ordinance in detail, I shall vote against it, and chiefly on the ground of the enormous areas of land which may be leased under it. I am surprised that such proposals should have been made in connexion with a new territory, in which we might bring into existence ideal conditions, and in dealing with which we should be guided by the experience, and bitter experience, of the whole history, of settlement, not in one, but in every State of Australia. If there is one thing which, more than another, has retarded the development of this great Commonwealth, it has been the mistakes made in the early days by people who believed they were doing the right thing in granting land in huge areas. They entirely overlooked the interests and requirements of generations to follow. With all this experience before us, and a knowledge of the bitterness engendered in the fight which men who wanted land have had to make to secure it, because it had been granted in huge leases such as this Ordinance provides for, it is difficult to imagine the application of a worse system of land administration in the Northern Territory than is proposed by this Ordinance. I suppose it will be contended that, because the leasehold system is on the platform of the Labour party, we must accept it under any conditions. But, to my mind, there is very little difference between giving a man a freehold and giving him, as this Ordinance provides, a perpetual lease, not of a reasonably, but of an unreasonably, large area. </para>

I recognise that, in view of the hugeness of the territory, the fact that the land was unclassified, and the almost impossibility of handling it properly, there was some justification in the early days for the granting of land in large areas. </para>

If the lands are so inferior that such areas are necessary to induce people to take them up, it would be a great deal better, in my opinion, to grant only areas of a reasonable size, and leave what is not taken up under those conditions as common lands in the hands of the Government, to meet the requirements of advancing settlement. It should not be forgotten that every man placed in the possession of a huge area of country is an enemy of closer settlement from the day on which he secures possession of it. </para>

                            <para>- It is a part of the history of land settlement everywhere. A man once in possession of a huge area of land becomes an enemy to closer settlement. I know that in New South Wales, where a big pastoral holding was divided, and the land thrown open under the improvement lease provisions, the pastoral lessee, who was a straightforward man, gave evidence on oath that the land would not produce wheat, and yet a man who had secured an improvement lease of some of the land swore that he had got twelve bushels an acre from it. The pastoralists honestly believed that the land they held was not suitable for farming. </para>

                            <para>- My experience of Classification Boards has not been such as to induce me to repose very much confidence in them. As late as. 1895 the New South Wales Government, in dealing with what were believed to be inferior lands, heavily timbered, and requiring the expenditure of large sums of money before they would be fit for farming purposes, threw them &#169;pen under improvement lease conditions. The result was that the country was immediately subdivided into huge areas under improvement leases. There was then an outcry about the huge areas that were being leased under leases for twenty-eight or forty years, and  in less than ten years it was discovered that these areas included some of the best farming lands in New South Wales. I can refer to one of these leases, known as Wingadee, which came under the purview of a Royal Commission, and when it was thrown open to settlement  600  persons made application for the land in farming blocks of about  1,000  acres each. Ten years&#39; experience and knowledge had made it plain that the Parliament and people who consented to the granting of this land in large areas had made a mistake. I venture to say that if, in the Northern Territory, any effective remedy against the tick were discovered, the value of the lands there would be enhanced by many thousands of pounds. If it were found that cattle grazing could be carried on as successfully in the Northern Territory as in what are at present healthier parts of Australia, what would then become of the proposed third class grazing areas? </para>

The huge areas proposed to be granted under this Ordinance are to me entirely objectionable. I do not object to reasonable rewards in the shape of big areas of land being granted to the pioneers of a new country who are willing to undergo risks. But I do object to locking up land of which we know very little at the present time in the way proposed by this Ordinance. I admit that there is a provision for the resumption of land on the payment of improvements. I suppose that/ in the beginning, the land will be taken up chiefly by companies. 1 can go back to the Land Act of  1 86 1  of New South Wales, when <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Robertson made provision for free selection before survey upon land granted in areas such as are proposed in this Ordinance to men who received their grants before constitutional government was established in New South Wales. </para>

                            <para>- Before constitutional government was established in New South Wales, land had been granted in huge areas, and I can remember the great change which took place when the old cry of free selection before survey was raised. There was then nearly a revolution in the State. We had on one side the landed classes, backed up with the money they had at their disposal, fighting the people who wanted to pioneer and develop the country in the proper way. Even when that Bill was passed, and the squatters found themselves beaten at the polls, what did they do? They simply put dummies on the land from one end of the State to the other, and still aggregated big estates. This Parliament was engaged a year or two ago in imposing a land tax to compel these landowners, if they would not sub-divide their holdings, at any rate to pay a fair share towards the government and defence of the Commonwealth. With ideal conditions obtaining in the Northern Territory, and with our eyes wide open to the bitter experience of a century of land settlement in Australia, the Government are proceeding along the same blundering lines as were followed in New South Wales. I do not care how democratic, good-hearted, intelligent, or straightforward the members of the Classification Board may be, if we lead the Board to believe that we think that an area of  1,920,000  acres of third class land is a reasonable pastoral lease, and some person shows that he has the necessary capital at his back to work that area, I do not see how they can refuse to grant a lease of that enormous area. In confirming this Ordinance, we are virtually saying to the Board, &#34; Handle this land to the best advantage to the Commonwealth. We know that you offer every inducement to men to come, but so far as leasing is concerned, do not give any one a lease of an area larger than  1,920,000  acres.&#34; </para>

                            <para>- I should be prepared to grant an area of a reasonable size.  and also to allow the lessee the right to use other land for grazing purposes till it was taken up ; because no great revenue is likely to be derived from the leases. If the land is so inferior that nearly 2,000,000 acres are needed to make a holding, how much rent is the Government likely to get from a lease? I doubt if they will get enough to defray the cost of collection. </para>

                            <para>- I quite agree with the honorable senator. I recognise that there is means provided for taking the land back from a lessee if settlement and development should take place. If, for instance, gold were discovered on leased land, as was done in Western Australia, that would immediately make the land very valuable. Suppose that a man is pioneering, that gold is discovered on his leasehold, and that within a few months a town is established in the centre of a block, say, 55 miles square, for which he is paying a fraction of a penny per square mile, and has under lease for all time. What compensation is he going to get when this land is suddenly boomed from being worth a fraction of a penny to perhaps &#163;100 a foot for street frontages ? </para>

                            <para>- I am almost inclined to argue no farther, for the simple reason that I recognise that there is quite a number of methods by which land can be taken back from a lessee. I admit that to the utmost of their foresight the Government have made provision in that regard; but I object to land being leased in these huge blocks. 1 venture to say that the greater portion of the Territory is third class pastoral land. How many individuals will it need to form themselves into an exploring and prospecting company to take up pretty well the whole of the available land? What will happen if ten men come together and take up pastoral leases ? </para>

                            <para>- I think that the Director of Land will conduct the business as a sane man. If I owned all the land in the Northern Territory, and I wired1 an instruction to my agent, &#34; Lease land under these conditions, but take care, in the case of third class land, you do not give leases of more than 1,920,000 acres,&#34; I take it that, as an intelligent man, he would believe that his instruction was that if a suitable man came along he was to give him a lease of that area of land. I admit that the greater portion of the land in the Northern Territory will be classified as third class land. On the well-watered rivers and the low-lying country you may have rich farming land, and also cane land. Then we get the different belts. We have only to look at the bulletin issued by the Department of External Affairs as to an exploration party which covered many miles of the country to see the daily record of individuals who are on the spot. We have to face this fact: that the greater part of the Northern Territory is third class pastoral land, and that, as such, it may be taken up in areas which should stagger the community. I shall not submit to .this provision without a protest. No doubt, the Vice-President of the Executive Council will say that I have been misled by the sophistries of the other side. I have tried to watch the development and settlement of land with a degree of fairness. Whenever a few years&#39; experience has brought about altered conditions, I have not been one to say that things have been done in a dishonest way. We should not only look at matters as they are to-day, but should be guided by the experience of the past. We should try to put ourselves in the place of those who went before us in the State, fifty, or twenty, or ten years ago, and in the light of their experience to make better conditions for land settlement than they did. </para>

                            <para>- My idea would be altogether out of touch with the area allowed in the Ordinance, so far as regards  land which is fit for settlement and likely to bring people to the Territory. So far as farm land is concerned, the area proposed is not  only a fair, but a liberal one. The idea of a grazing block 55 miles square, speaking roughly, is ludicrous. Why, a lessee would have to ride  220  miles to go round his boundary. If the land is of such poor quality that a grazing block 55 miles square is considered a living area, what is the use of trying to secure settlement on land of that character under any conditions? </para>

                            <para>- That is the old story. I am anxious to save the Commonwealth from scandals such as have arisen in New South Wales. Within  10  miles of the Carcoar and Millthorpe railway stations a huge area was granted under an improvement lease. It was inferior land, being only fit for grazing, and could not be used for farming except after a large expenditure. Within ten years from the issue of the lease a portion -  10,000  acres - was divided, and the biggest area which they offered to the farmers was a  900-acre  block. </para>

I have endeavoured to confine my objection to the enormous areas comprised in the leases which the Government are prepared to grant. &#34; I venture to say that a Committee of this Parliament, with the evidence which is at their disposal in our public Departments, would be able to produce an Ordinance which would provide for the taking up of land by leaseholders in such areas that very little objection could be urged to them. I shall vote against the Government upon this question, but not from any fiendish desire to thwart them. Only last night I was compelled to vote against them, and, as a loyal supporter, 1 protest against continually being placed in the position of having either to vote against them or to register a vote for which I should be sorry all my life. </para>

                            <para>- When I speak of a &#34; living area,&#34; 1 mean an area which will enable a lessee to acquire a competence before old age overtakes him. I believe that the large areas set out in this Ordinance are bad for the Commonwealth, inasmuch as they will delay rather than accelerate the development of the Territory, and bad for the individual. If there is one thing which has injured the occupying class of Australia more than another, it is the fact that they have hitherto held more land than they could manage to the best advantage. Even in the district in which I reside at present - a fruit-growing district - there are men who could do well on 10 acres, but who are trying to become possessed of 40 acres. In the wheat-growing areas, too, individuals who could make a good living upon 300 or 400 acres are anxious to procure not less than 1,500 acres. Here we are asked to perpetrate a similar evil, because I cannot conceive of any individual requiring close upon 2,000.000 acres to make any effective use of it. What will be the consequence if such huge areas are taken up? A lessee, if he makes any improvements at all, will be tempted to spread them over a large tract of country, whereas be would probably obtain better results if he confined them to a smaller area. lt seems to me inconceivable that land which is worth occupying requires to be taken up in areas of 2,000,000 acres to satisfy the wants of one individual. The only answer made by the Vice-President of the Executive Council to criticism of this sort is that the power of resumption will enable these lands to be reclassified, and the areas to be reduced, as settlement advances. I have looked carefully through the resumption clauses, which certainly provide that in assessing compensation for dispossessing an owner, the latter should receive no consideration in respect of improvements effected by public expenditure, or by proposed public expenditure. But no provision whatever is made in respect of the improved value which will arise from settlement and private expenditure. </para>

                            <para>- I do not wish the Minister of Defence to misunderstand me, nor do I desire to misunderstand him. I am not finding fault with the period of reappraisement. I recognise that settlers in a new country should not be disturbed very frequently in regard to the land which they hold. It would not be fair to subject them to short periods of reappraisement. Such conditions would militate very seriously against the taking up of the landa of the Territory. In a new country we must offer much more liberal conditions than are offered in older and more settled Countries. I do not wish to adhere to <inline font-style="italic">doctrinaire</inline> theories in regard to matters of that kind. But when we offer these Liberal conditions we should not offer lessees such enormous areas. The Vice-President of the Executive Council has emphasized the fact that we have intelligent men charged with the administration of the Act - men who will not grant these large areas unless they see it is advisable to do so. But as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> has pointed out, whenever they can obtain a suitable applicant under this Ordinance, they will have power to grant him up to the maximum area in the various classes. If the Leader of the Government in this Chamber is prepared to say that in no instance will such large areas be granted, it is clear that there is no necessity to permit them to be granted. </para>

                            <para>- A man is foolish to think that he can garner wealth from exceedingly large areas, no matter how poor in quality they may be. I do not think that we should minister to that mentally-diseased state. It seems to me that by placing the maximum, area which a lessee may hold so high, we are attempting to discredit the leasehold system. In my opinion there is no land, however bad, that 500 square miles of it, which is the maximum area provided for under Class I. of this division, would not be sufficient as the maximum area under Class III. The powers of resumption do not meet the case. Suppose that the Land Board finds it impossible to personally acquaint itself with the character of every square mile of land which it has to administer. Suppose that after one of these huge areas has been divided up, and is carrying a big population, gold or other minerals are discovered. One can easily imagine that areas which are . now practically wildernesses would become the centre of considerable townships. </para>

                            <para>- Just so. There is a fanciful business about this. Every day in this country lands are being increased in value in districts which some years ago were practically wildernesses. That is being done by the mere aggregation of population, whilst-, of course, public improvements, more or less, add to the process. If you could separate the value that is given to land by public improvements on the one hand, and the added value that may be attributable to private improvements and settlement on the other hand, I have little doubt that in many, instances the improvements not due in any way to public improvements would far exceed those which could be attributed to such agencies. If this Ordinance could be amended in two respects, many of the other matters alluded to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> might be regarded as of minor importance. If we could make the resumption clause include, not merely the added value given by public expenditure, but the added value given from all other causes as well, except the individual&#39;s own improvements; and if also the area could be reduced in such a way that in no case would the area permitted, even in class 3, exceed the maximum proposed in class 1, it would be an improvement, although I should say that even such areas would err on the side of being too large, rather than too small. </para>

                            <para>- Can an individual be disturbed if improvements on land round about his holding increase its value? I know of a man in New South Wales who obtained an ordinary conditional-purchase selection of 90 acres. He was very sore at the time on account of his ill-luck, because some of the other allotments were much larger. A village had been laid out adjacent to the land which he obtained. But he was a very shrewd man, and he managed, practically, to constitute his 90 acres the village. Thereby this individual was able to prevent settlement taking place on the adjacent reserve, and to induce it to take place on his area. The result was that he made a fortune out of a block which he took up as farming land. </para>

The combined cleverness of a number of land-holders can generally out wit any Board I ever heard of. I feel sure that if this Ordinance had been going through the Senate as an ordinary Bill, instead of coming before us in the way it does, the Vice-President of the Executive Council would never have been able to justify the enormous areas proposed to be permitted; nor would he have been able to justify the resumption proposals submitted here. There seems to be too much of the trail of the professional man over this Ordinance, and not enough of the work of the practical man. </para>

                            <para>- I mean that there is too much of the official, and not enough of the work of men of practical knowledge. It seems to me to be a great pity that we cannot have such an important Ordinance, which is really a Land Bill, passed through Committee in the Senate, and considered in detail. Then it could be framed in accordance with our views. In the multitude of councillors there is more wisdom than in the work of two or three individuals. I feel sure that some of the more objectionable features of this Ordinance would not be tolerated by a democratic House of Parliament if they came before it in the form of a Bill. Unfortunately, a Government feels impelled to regard an Ordinance of this kind as though it were a sort of gospel, something so perfect as to be incapable of improvement. </para>

                            <para>- Then I hope that the Government will alter the Ordinance by reducing these maximum areas. It will be nothing less than a public scandal if we allow a condition of things to come about by which one individual can, under an Ordinance passed by a Labour Parliament, led by a Labour Government, be allowed to occupy close upon 2,000,000 acres of land in one block. There is no limitation under this Ordinance to the quantity of land that one person can control. I am credibly informed by some of those who have been in the Northern Territory that under the South Australian administration of it some clever individuals have obtained leases which have been so selected, north, south, east, and west, as to enclose and include art enormous area of land, for which they pay nothing. That process was resorted to in my native country, New Zealand, under the <inline font-style="italic">regime</inline> of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Hall. There was a regulation in force at one time that not more than a certain area of land could be purchased in freehold. But certain persons got the best of the surveyors in some way, and had areas of land surveyed in alternate blocks just below the amount that could be purchased in freehold. They then bought the other blocks, and had the use of the blocks which were not purchasable, because no one else could get them. That process was known as &#34; gridironing.&#34; In some Australian States large areas were obtained by dummying without any regulation being actually broken at all. By their ingenuity these men were able to get the better of the regulations made for the control of land settlement. No doubt, the men who drew up the land Ordinances and regulations under which these things took place were clever clerical men, but they were outwitted by the landholders. This Ordinance is vitally defective in what it omits, as well as in what it includes. I do not expect that anything I can say will influence the Government to alter it; but I enter my protest in the most emphatic way I can against granting lands in such enormous areas under a system which takes no note whatever of the immense values which may accrue from other than public improvements, whilst imposing no limit to the number of separate holdings which a person may have and still comply with the Ordinance. </para>

                                GOULD (New South Wales) &#91;4.50&#93;.- This debate has indicated that- honorable senators are not satisfied to deal with the Ordinance under consideration in the manner in which we are called upon to consider it. Even the Minister, to a certain extent, apologized for the way in which the subject comes before us. He told us that in the course of a few months, after gaining experience, the Government will probably be able to come to Parliament with a Land Bill.

                            <para>- It is a very serious proposal to grant the lands of the Northern Territory in such large areas. Honorable senators opposite are professedly anxious that the Territory should be settled as closely as possible, having regard to the climate and other conditions. We have professed to regard the Northern Territory in its unoccupied condition as a menace to the safety of Australia. It has been contended -that, for this reason, we should settle there as large a population as we can. To do so we must be very careful with regard to the situation and extent of the areas we throw open to pastoral occupation. I admit that there will be small holdings in the townships and villages and for agricultural purposes, as well as for mixed grazing and -agriculture; but we have a right to consider the possibilities under this Ordinance. We have before us the experience of all the States of Australia in connexion with land legislation for the last half-century. No man who has followed the history of land legislation in New South Wales since 1861, when free selection before survey was introduced, can overlook the serious troubles and difficulties that had to be faced to keep up with the progress of settlement, and <inline font-style="italic">10</inline> check the attempts made by people from time to time to frustrate the intentions ot Parliament in passing progressive land legislation. The Government appear to have been blind to all this experience. Probably it is because it has been too close to them that they have been unable to take advantage of it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> attempted to belittle the arguments of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> and challenged his knowledge of the land laws of Australia. I believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has a more intimate knowledge of our land laws than has any -other member of the Senate. If there are -other honorable senators who think that, in saying that, I do them an injustice, and who can claim an equal knowledge, we are fortunate in being able to command their advice. I admit that I have not half the knowledge of land legislation in New South Wales that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> possesses, though I have been a resident of that State during the whole of the time it has been dealt with. Supporters of the Government condemn the huge areas provided for, and other provisions of this Ordinance, and, although the Government may be able to carry it through, it will, I think, be very much battered before it is finally dealt with by this Parliament. Whether the freehold or leasehold system be adopted, it will be necessary, in order to settle the Northern Territory, to offer attractions to settlers, while having due regard to the interests of the community at large. Many attempts have been made to settle which up to the present time have been without success. It was a source of enormous expense to South. Australia during the many years she had control of it. There was no year in which South Australia was able to show a credit balance in the administration of the Territory. We cannot doubt that South Australian Governments did their best to make the administration a success, but it had to be recognised that the work was too great for an individual State, and, consequently, the Commonwealth has taken the Territory in hand. I am not one of those who believe that it is valueless, though it may not be as valuable as are certain other parts of Australia. I would ask honorable senators to say whether they believe that the provisions of this Ordinance will be considered attractive by the smaller settler. Pastoral lessees will be able under it to secure enormous areas in perpetuity at a low rent, subject to periodic appraisement. There will probably not be a sufficient revenue realized from the rents of these pastoral holdings to meet the cost of their administration, and the policing of that portion of the Territory in which they will be situated. That may continue for years, unless some great movement of population takes place, and then I admit that, under the Ordinance, the Government will have th&#171; power to resume the pastoral leases, but they must pay for that resumption. We are told that conditions may be determined upon which do not appear in this Ordinance; but if such conditions are imposed, those who take up the land under the provisions of this Ordinance will be entitled to compensation for any loss they may sustain from, the imposition of new conditions. It has been pointed out that a gold-field might be discovered upon a pastoral holding. While it is true, as the Vice-President of the Executive Council has said, that the lessee would be unable to work his land for minerals, since minerals will be reserved under the lease, he would, in my opinion, be entitled to receive the material benefit which would arise from the fact that, by the discovery of a gold-field, he would have a market close at hand for stock. If he is to be treated honestly, he should receive this benefit, and if his land is resumed, he should receive adequate compensation. In addition to the instance referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae,</inline> I might quote the case of the Wyalong gold-field. It was discovered on the selection of some people named Neild. The place, instead . of being an ordinary free selection held for grazing purposes, became at once a valuable property, on which a town was established. All the neighbouring pastoralists participated in the benefits accruing from the establishment of the Wyalong gold-field. If we are to adopt the leasehold system in the Northern Territory, it would, in my opinion, be better to provide for terminable leases for a reasonable period. The South Australian Government considered a forty-two years&#39; lease a reasonable period, but we might consider that the lease should be for twenty or twenty-one years, and that such a lease would induce settlement. The great thing in inducing settlement is to let the intending settler know that he will have security of tenure and conditions for a fixed period. In my opinion, it would be much better to give a settler security of tenure and conditions for a limited period than to offer him a perpetual lease with varying conditions. At the close of a terminable lease the land would revert to the Crown. The probability is that steps would be taken a few years before the termination of a number of leases to formulate a scheme for dealing with the land when those leases had expired. The new conditions being made known, it is possible that the existing tenants would agree to continue the occupation of their holdings for another period. Where freeholds are granted, of course, the value of the land is received in the first instance by the Grown, but if- terminable leases are granted, the Crown will secure the improved value of the land at the close of the lease. In any case, a man would not care to take up land under the apprehension that he might be interfered with in some material way before his lease expired. We have determined for the present to grant lands in the Northern Territory only upon a leasehold tenure. That may be wise in dealing with a new territory the future of which is,, to a certain extent, obscure ; but we must all recognise that the desire for a freehold1&#39; is inborn in men. There is scarcely any man who does not desire to have a home of his own, and to be able to say, &#34; No one can now interfere with me ; I am absolutely protected.&#34; Of course, the holder of a freehold must pay taxation, but he is tied to the country, and may be looked to for its defence, and to do what he can to advance its. prosperity. </para>

                            <para>- I recognise your ruling, sir, and have no desire to transgress it. As I am. prevented from pointing out the value of a freehold to an individual, I say that, while dealing with small holdings on the leasehold principle, we might charge a peppercorn rent, and give a lease for 999 years.. That would be equivalent to a freehold. Individuals who took up land under such conditions would be able to regard it as theirs for a thousand years, and&#34; a holder could then say that when he passed away his son would come along and the property would remain in his family, unless the Government should consider it necessary to terminate the lease in the interests of the public at large, when,, of course, they would have to pay reasonable compensation.&#34; Every argument which can be urged in favour of a freehold tenure can be equally urged for a tenure of 999 years under the conditions mentioned by me. Under our Act it is within the power of a Government to propose that, instead of giving leases in perpetuity, subject to periodical reappraisements, they shall be given for a fixedterm. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, because it will interfere materially with the use of the land. My argument is that security of tenure and security of conditions are primary inducements to people to settle in the Territory. A man would sooner take up land for twenty-one years, provided that he had security of tenure and security of conditions, than he would take up land in perpetuity which was subject to re-appraisement, not only at the end of twenty-one years, but whenever the Government might make public improvements which would be considered as having added to its value. With regard to agricultural lands and lands to be used for mixed farming purposes, there is the power to re-appraise at the end of fourteen years, and also at any time when improvements are effected in a locality which have enhanced the value of the properties. Therefore, a man who takes a lease of this land can have no security or certainty in regard to the conditions under which he is going to live. There is a further condition which, I think, is rather a mistake, in view of the peculiar conditions which prevail in the Territory, and that is that a man shall reside on his leased land. An agricultural lease must contain - </para>

                    <para class="block">The Government will probably attempt to defend that condition on the ground that they want men to settle, and not to take up land for speculative purposes. The condition in regard to improvements I do not take exception to. A man should be -under a condition that he shall effect certain improvements and do -certain work on the land ; but these conditions should not be made too onerous. As regards the condition of residence, it : should be borne in mind that the Territory has not yet attracted the people whom we want to go there. None of the people in the settled districts of the Commonwealth nave shown any disposition to reside in the Territory for the purpose either of farming or mixed farming and grazing. -The reason for this reluctance is very evident. There are so many more attractions in the more settled portions of Australia that, naturally, these persons are not likely to go to another place where they will be tied up in this way. If the Government would give men an opportunity to occupy the lands of the Northern Territory, and bring them into cultivation, and promote settlement without imposing too restrictive and onerous conditions, they would be much more likely to attract population from the settled districts than under the condition of residence. In New South Wales, not long ago, a. system of homestead selection, with perpetual residence, was adopted ; but it was whittled so far down that men were able to apply to convert their selections into conditional purchases, which only&#93; entailed residence for a limited period.&#39; These men said, &#34; We want, not merely the right to hold a lease subject to periodical re-appraisement, but also the right to convert the property into a selection, arid ultimately into a freehold.&#34; A little while ago the present Government proposed to repeal the legislation which was enacted at the instance of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wade,</inline> to enable the conversion to take place. In the first instance, no power of conversion was given ; but when the opposition of the people to perpetual residence and periodical reappraisement and the other conditions was disclosed, the provision in the law was changed. When the McGowen Government took office, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nielsen,</inline> the Minister of Lands, thought that the power to convert should be taken away. This led to a great outcry, and the Government said that they would not interfere with any persons who chose to make an application to convert the holding within twelve months after the passage of the law. The result of the agitation, however, was that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nielsen</inline> left the! Government, and they found themselves obliged to accept the law as it then was. If the Commonwealth Government had provided in this Ordinance that perpetual leases could be converted into leases for  999  years, they would have found that the same feeling would operate in the Northern Territory as did operate in New South Wales. Let me direct honorable senators&#39; attention to what is now happening. The other day I had the privilege, with some other honorable senators, of going to Yanco and seeing <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Griffith turn on the water on the irrigation settlement established there. </para>
                    <para>One of the conditions of a lease there is that the lessee shall reside on the land, and shall be subject to periodical reappraisements, which are to be made at rather distant periods. I do not believe that there is a provision that, apart from such re-appraisements, a re-appraisement shall be made when the Government effect valuable improvements. The Government have laid out villages on the property, and, of course, imposed conditions with regard to rentals. </para>

                    <para>GOULD. - Yes, times are specified in the law. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Griffith</inline> has intimated lately that when there are lands available which have not been applied for under the conditions attaching to land at the present time, he will be prepared to allow those lands to go on freehold terms. Victoria is bringing out settlers from America, and so is New South Wales, in order to create irrigation settlements. I do not know whether the settlements in Victoria are subject to periodical re-appraisements. We have to learn not only by the mistakes, but also by the successes of our neighbours, what is the best field for us to occupy; and I think that we should limit the leases of pastoral, agricultural and mixed lands in the Northern Territory to - twenty-one years, if you like, but we should give security of tenure and security of conditions, and perhaps require a premium before a man could take up a lease. The Government have recognised that, to a certain extent, there will be some difficulty in getting persons to take up land, because the Ordinance contains this provision -  ln the case of the first five thousand blocks of agricultural lands taken up on perpetual lease after the commencement of this Ordinance, no rent shall be payable for the period of the applicant&#39;s life, or for a period of twenty-one years from the commencement of the lease, whichever period is the longer. </para>
                    <para class="block">It is perfectly clear, from that provision, that the Government apprehend some difficulty in getting people to take up the agricultural land. The inducement held out to them is the use of the land for a period of twenty-one years without the payment of any rent whatever. But after the first 5,000 blocks have been taken up, these lands will be subject to the ordinary conditions of rental and periodical re-appraisement. </para>

                            <para>- The Ordinance provides that before a lessee can be settled in the Territory he must obtain a medical certificate of physical fitness. Probably the reply of the Government will be that they do not. want men to go there and lose their lives as the result of bad climatic conditions. To my mind we should do much better in the matter of securing the settlement of the Territory if we were to offer settlers security of tenure. There are a number of conditions set out in the Ordinance with which I do not propose to deal. They have been elaborated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> who, I think, urged very material objections to them. If the Government had adopted a different course of procedure - I admit that it would have taken time - by submitting for our consideration a Bill setting out the whole of the conditions relating to land tenure in the Northern Territory, it would have been very much more satisfactory. I know that there are many honorable senators who support the Government who would like to see the Ordinance substantially altered, but who do not feel themselves justified in voting for its rejection. To my mind, however, it would be far better to disallow it, because the Government must have derived benefit from this discussion, and as a result would be able to frame an Ordinance which would tend more to the settlement of the Territory than would all the experimental legislations that may be introduced from time to time. It is acknowledged that we have to learn a great deal before we can lay down permanent lines for its settlement. In my opinion it would have been much better to have submitted a tentative measure. </para>

I have merely pointed out the advantages attaching to a lease of 999 years without harassing conditions, as against a perpetual lease which is subject to improvement conditions and to periodical reappraisements. </para>

                        <para>.- The Senate is indebted to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> for having brought this question forward. I quite agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> that we have not any reason to be proud of the land legislation of Victoria or of some of the other States. That legislation has always been of a tentative character, just as this legislation will be. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> was at some pains to stress the fact that it is not wise to allow persons to get a grip upon large areas. We have seen the evils of that policy in Victoria. At one time, the Mallee was regarded as being unsuitable for settlement, and large areas were therefore let at peppercorn rentals for a period of twenty years. I was not in the Victorian Parliament at the time, but my father was, and he fought strenuously against the adoption of that course. What happened? Before the leases had expired, it was found that the land was valuable. The lessees were able to sublet to persons who paid them from 5s. to 10s. an acre. In another instance, in Victoria, there were large areas of country which could not be utilized, and these were sublet under section 32 of the Land Act. I was in office just before those leases expired, and it was my intention, upon their expiry, to throw them open for settlement. But when they fell in I was not in office. As a result, those who had held them secured practically every one of the blocks. I am afraid that with the large areas which can be taken up under this Ordinance, and under the South Australian law, the same sort of thing will happen again. I recognise that the taking over of the Northern Territory was the most momentous step which this Parliament will be called upon to take for scores of years. Consequently, we require to act with the utmost caution. In assuming control of this enormous Territory of 523,000 square miles, we have loaded ourselves with a very heavy liability. The public debt upon it is  &#163;2,748,062; the deficit is &#163;779,734; the cost of the existing railway is &#163;2,242,343 ; so that, altogether, we have taken over a burden of &#163;5,770,139. The railway from Oodnadatta to Pine Creek, which will have to be constructed at an early date, will cost &#163;4, 500,000. In other words, we are shouldering a liability of &#163;10,270,139, and the annual cost to the Commonwealth will be more than , &#163;500, 000. These facts are important. The Territory is being specially favoured in that it must be developed by the rest of Australia. The other States have had to find the money for their own developmental purposes, but the Northern Territory will be developed at the expense of the Commonwealth, and, therefore, it is our duty to be exceedingly careful in all that we do. How are we to meet this liability ? By peopling this immense tract of country. The peopling of it was the one great reason which induced us to take it over. It was regarded as the danger zone of Australia. It was recognised that unless we filled its mighty spaces, it would be open to an enemy to gain admission to our shores there, and to work great disaster. Now, the only way in which we can people the Territory is by popularizing land settlement. Section 11 of the Act of 1910 reads - </para>

                    <para class="block">Any fight as regards land tenure should have taken place upon that measure, and should not be revived upon the present occasion. Personally, I recognise that under the leasehold system what has happened in other countries will happen in the Territory after the lapse of a certain time. In other words&#39;, when the settlers there are strong enough, they will secure the freehold of their lands, just as the settlers have done in New Zealand. Consequently, I am just as well content to see its lands taken up in the first instance upon the leasehold principle. Every step that we take to popularize land settlement in the Territory is of importance, and especially so is our first step. I do not approach, the consideration of this matter in any party spirit. Honorable senators upon both sides of the Chamber should be desirous of doing the best that they can to settle this Territory. To my mind, it is a pity that the Government have discarded the services of men who have known it for many years. I refer to such men as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. David</inline> Lindsay and Captain Barclay, who have travelled all over it. I say that the Ministry would have acted wisely if they had retained their services to the Commonwealth. These men would probably have helped us to overcome very many difficulties. Personally, I think that it will never prove satisfactory to manage this Territory from one central office. The Territories of the United States have never been managed from Washington. A Governor and Secretary were first appointed, and then the Central Government allowed the people of the Territories to have one-chamber Houses, by means of which they practically managed their own affairs, whilst, also, they were allowed to have one representative in Congress. The bureaucratic management of the Northern Territory by officials will break down. The Minister of External Affairs, with the enormous matters with which he has to deal, will never be able, to give much attention to the Territory, and within a comparatively short time we shall find ourselves in the position of having to give a measure of local government to the people. The Government have no reason to complain of the speech made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen.</inline> He has indicated a great many defects in the Ordinance; which, although it may be carried at the present time, will, I am satisfied, have to be altered in the near future. I join with others in expressing regret that a proper Land .Bill was not introduced. This Ordinance is really a Land Bill, and we ought to have been able to discuss it clause by clause in Committee, so that the wisdom and experience of honorable senators generally might be invoked to make it as perfect as possible. We find that the pastoral areas allowed are to have a minimum of 320,000 acres, and a maximum of nearly 2,000,000 acres; agricultural areas,. 640 acres to 2,560 acres; farming and grazing areas, from 12,800 acres to 64,000 acres. The great blemish with regard to the Ordinance is. the insecurity of conditions imposed by it. There is power to be for ever altering the terms and condi-tions during the operation of the lease. We ought to allow a lease to run for a time prescribed - fourteen or twenty-one years - and &#34;should not interfere with the conditions during that time, unless some extraordinary circumstances should arise. A man should know in what position he stands, and not be subjected, at the whim or caprice of any official or Board, to have his conditions of tenure altered- We are told that the land will be subject to reclassification. That is an unfair provision,, and imposes another element of uncertainty that will be very hard on settlers. Moreover, it will tend to deter investors from going into the Territory. The Minister of External Affairs has said that he does not: expect rich men to go there. He wants to&#62; attract poor men. But I point out that it is .only those who have a backing who will be able to face that country. No poor man could possibly go there and expect to earn a living. If the Minister does not expect rich men to go to the Territory, he will find that none at all will go. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> that giving grazing, holdings under perpetual leases is a very unwise step. We shall find that nearly the whole of the country will be mopped&#39; up in large areas, and the very object which we have in endeavouring to people the Territory - because we recognise that it is our danger zone - will fail to be accomplished. In my opinion, when people go out into the back-blocks, and face the hard&#39; conditions that prevail there - face flood,, drought, and bad seasons - special consideration ought to be given to them. I have represented pioneers for many years,, and know what their troubles are. If the whole of the unearned increment is to betaken away from rr-op&#39;e who are willing to undergo special risks, it will tend to discourage settlement. Those who go to a country of this kind first, and tear the greater part of the hardship entailed in pioneering, ought to be treated in a liberal manner in regard to the unearned increment. </para>

                            <para>- That is what the Ordinance proposes, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> even advocated that we should go further. The question of compensation is extremely important. If people find that they are only going to get the bare value of their work, and that when public works have created improvements in values those values will be taken away from them, the effect will, be to deter people from settling the Territory. They will not be content to go to a country which is hundreds of miles away from civilization to obtain merely the bare result of their labour, when they could obtain greater advantages under more comfortable conditions. The present time is very favorable for inducing land settlement in the Northern Territory, if suitable attractions are held out. The land at the disposition of the United States Government is nearly all taken up. It is only a question of a very few years when there will be no Government land available in that country. Settlers will then have to buy land either from private owners or from railway companies. Therefore, the time is opportune for the development of a liberal land settlement policy whereby we might attract cultivators who have been used to dry districts to settle in the Northern Territory. In the United States of America, settlers have been able to get 360 acres - in some cases smaller areas - absolutely free, and without being subjected to the restrictions that this Ordinance sets out. </para>

                            <para>- I do not say that. I rather welcome this experiment. I recognise that it is a tentative system, and that it is only a matter of time when the leaseholds will be converted into freeholds. Another important matter is that an enormous area is locked up under leases granted by the South Australian Government while it had charge of the Territory. The dates of unexpired leases run from 1935 to 1945, and until those periods expire we cannot interfere with the lands so held, except by paying heavy compensation. I understand that 82,687,920 acres are held in this way. That is an enormous area. We may be sure that the holdings do not represent the worst part of the country. We shall find that the eyes have been picked out, and that the best land will not be available for settlement. These areas are held at rentals running from 6d. to is. per square mile, or about id. for each fifty-three acres. The revenue will not by any means cover the cost of government, and these conditions will act as a drawback to settlement for many years to come. I think it is absurd to put in regulations as to the examination of settlers to prevent diseased persons going to the Territory. A man would not be likely to want to go there unless he was in good health. A person with a serious complaint would not be likely to take a wife and family there. The provision is a cruel one, and should be struck out. I think the clause regarding the obtaining of confidential information is a mistake, and should be eliminated. I believe in all inquiries of the kind being conducted in open court by a Board. A person should not be allowed to make a statement to the detriment of an applicant for land unless the statement is made in public, so that the press can report it, and the person affected can hear ft. I hope that this provision will be reconsidered. Moreover, I am of opinion that the government of the Territory should not be concentrated in the hands of a few officials. The people ought to be allowed to govern themselves in their local affairs. I realize that a matter of this kind ought to be considered without party bias. If the Ordinance were rejected, it would not be a stab to the Government, because no party issue is involved. It should be rejected in order that a more satisfactory condition of affairs may be established. </para>

                        <para>. - It is as well that this discussion should have taken place, because, although the subject of the debate is called an Ordinance, it is really a law ; and this is the first Federal law affecting the Northern Territory with which we have had an opportunity of dealing. In this matter we have had to be guided by the experience of the different States. Although &#34; the conditions of the Territory and of the States are not exactly similar, there are portions of some of the States where the conditions approximate to those existing in the Northern Terr tory. It would be foolish to say that this Ordinance should stand for all time. No doubt the conditions in the Northern Territory will change. The very success of this Ordinance, if it is a success, will give rise to changes which will necessitate alterations of the law from time to time. Many different methods of dealing with the question might be suggested, but he would be a very rash man who would dogmatize upon any one of them. We must all admit that in the Northern Territory we shall be, to  a  great extent, experimenting. </para>

                            <para>- I refer to State experience of the settlement of waste lands. I have not yet come to the question of perpetual leases. There are, in all the larger States, at any rate, areas of land which, notwithstanding all our advance in scientific discovery, are to-day, comparatively speaking, worthless. There are areas bordering upon these which are of some commercial value for pastoral purposes ; only there is in connexion with them an element of risk, in the shape of drought and other causes. As we approach the rainfall belt the areas increase in productive value and in certainty of production. It has always been the case for a Government dealing with such varying conditions to grade the land, in order to induce settlement. It is recognised that where settlement is more risky, and the promise of return less, very large areas should be allowed, to encourage people to take up land which would otherwise remain entirely unproductive. </para>

                            <para>- I am not doing so; but 1 intend to say what I have to say in my own way, and not in the way in which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> desires I should say it. What I have said applies to New South Wales, Queensland. Western Australia, and South Australia. I can remember the time, in my early days in South Australia, when vast areas of land were taken up which, apparently, promised adequate, returns, and to-day much of that land is abandoned. There was a time when greater areas were abandoned, and in recent years some of that land has again been taken up. It is idle to say that we should apply to all lands the same condition as to the area to be granted. It follows, therefore, that we must classify our land; and this Ordinance provides for classification. It provides for the classification of pastoral lands into practically five grades - two of mixed farming and grazing, and three of purely pastoral lands. The areas proposed range from 20 square miles - which is the maximum, it should be understood: - for class I., mixed farming and grazing, up to  3,000  square miles, the maximum of class III. pastoral lands. It must be obvious that the land classified as class  111.  pastoral lands must be the very worst land in the Territory. A Land Board has been appointed, which, the Government contend, consists of men who not only have a knowledge of the quality and capacity of land, but who are in sympathy with the desire of the Government to have closer settlement in the Northern Territory to the greatest extent possible. To this Land Board is committed the problem - and it is a serious problem - of going through the country and classifying the lands, always having in view the securing of the greatest amount of settlement possible, with a successful use of the land. Honorable senators have criticised this Ordinance as if practically the whole of the pastoral lands of the Northern Territory were to be let out in large blocks of  3,000  square miles each. That is not a reasonable construction to put upon the Ordinance. That would mean that all the pastoral land of the Northern Territory would be graded as of the very worst quality. I have not visited the Territory myself, but from what I have read of it, and especially of the Barklay Tableland, I think there is good reason to believe that a considerable area may be classified as mixed pastoral and grazing. </para>

The only reason why the gold-fields of Western Australia are not today the greatest wheat belt on the continent is that the rainfall there is deficient, and not that it does not fall at the right time of the year. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lindsay</inline> said that a few experimental blocks and experimental sowings of wheat throughout the year would demonstrate whether the Barklay Tableland country is not capable of being put under cultivation. </para>

If <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lindsay&#39;s</inline> description of the Barklay Tableland be correct, it would be very rash for any honorable senator to say that the whole of that laud will &#62;be classified as third class pastoral land. The probability is that  the  bulk of  the  Barklay Tableland will be classified as mixed farming and grazing land, or,  at  least, as first class pastoral land, and  the  maximum area of such land which can be taken up by any person under this Ordinance is 500 square miles. </para>

I am not at liberty to discuss now what the Government propose to do in that direction, but the Estimates and the Budget speech of the Treasurer disclose the fact that we have already begun to take action to improve the means of communication in the Territory. It is singular that during this discussion we have had honorable senators expressing conflicting ideas, and yet supporting each other. Honorable senators opposite are, of course, against this Ordinance because it embodies the leasehold principle, but Senators Gardiner and Rae support the leasehold principle. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think so. I agree with Senators Gould and McColl that these leases are not rigid. I consider that one of their virtues. The statements which have been made about the Barklay Tableland show how careful we ought to be not to injure, under either a leasehold or a freehold system, the prospects of the development of that country. </para>

                            <para>- I have always held the opinion that, while for that purpose a perpetual lease can be made as bad as a freehold, from the community point of view it can be made as good as a short lease. That is all determined by the conditions which are attached to the resumption of the lease. First it has to be remembered that pastoral leases will be granted for specific purposes, as set out in the Ordinance, and that is for pastoral purposes only. An honorable senator, I do not remember on which side of the Chamber he sits, argued as if pastoral leases conveyed the whole freehold and the right to the lessees to do as one can do with a freehold, but they do nothing of the kind. All minerals are reserved. Even the right to cut timber is reserved. The Crown reserves the right to allow a person to go on the land and cut the timber, and also the right to go on the land and mine for minerals. There is a prohibition upon the tenant to use the lease for any other purpose than that for which it is granted, that is, for either pastoral purposes or for mixed farming, or for agriculture. Senators Gardiner and Rae, who were alarmed at the rigidity of the conditions, referred to the possibility of a. gold-field being opened up. But they overlooked the fact that the Ordinance itself contains a provision to meet that case. If a gold-field should be opened up on land held under lease, the Government will have the right to proclaim a town site. These honorable senators spoke as if the holder of the lease would get the benefit of the increased value which might arise from the town site being proclaimed. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator loses sight of the fact that it will not be necessary to resume land for that purpose, because the Crown will have the right to issue miners&#39; rights straight away. The mineral rights are reserved by the Ordinance to the Crown, and the lessee has no right in them. The right of resumption is clearly given there, on payment of compensation. Now the question arises, What have we to pay for when we resume the land? The question is argued as if we had to pay for the increased value of the land, but that is not correct. All that we shall have to pay for, in addition to the improvements, is the increased value of the lease as a pastoral lease. Now what is the increased value of a lease as a pastoral lease from the fact of a town site being proclaimed on the lease? </para>

                            <para>- According to the size of the township, the pastoral lessee may be provided with a market alongside his door; but what is the value of an ordinary township, with 150 inhabitants, to a pastoral lessee ? The value of the meat which the townspeople will eat during a year will be insignificant compared with the quantity of meat which will have to be grown on the leasehold before it can be made a payable proposition. The compensation to tie paid to the holder of a pastoral lease is not the community-created value, nor is it the added value given by public works. </para>

Otherwise, he has no right, other than the Crown has granted him. He can have no other legal claim against the Crown. I think that in this Ordinance we have made a good start on safe lines. I admit that the Ordinance, of itself, will not settle the Northern Territory. We all recognise that pioneering will have to be done in other ways. We have to create an interest in the country, to attract people there, to assist them to get on to the land, and help to keep them there. That is, perhaps, more important than the issue of the Ordinance. Still, the Ordinance, I contend, contains nothing which will check settlement, but everything which will tend to promote it. </para>

                        <para>. - I do not pretend to be able to follow, and I have not followed, the discussion in detail with regard to this important Ordinance as to land administration. I recognise the long and valuable experience which the Leader of the Opposition has had with regard to land tenures of every description in New South Wales. That he was perfectly competent to deal with this Ordinance is admitted on both sides of the Chamber. In his characteristic way, the Minister of Defence dwelt upon some points which arise out of the Ordinance and have no direct relation to the criticism of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen.</inline> He has delivered, as he frequently has had to deliver, a lecture to some of his own supporters with regard &#34;to the misrepresentations which they have got hold of with regard to one aspect of land settlement, and that is the grant of perpetual leases. That fact, in itself, is a sufficient reason why from time to time, and more often than we have done in the past, land administration in the Northern Territory should be carefully considered here. There are two or three honorable senators, including <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> who are thoroughly familiar with every form of land administration. Recently, a Labour Government came into power in New South Wales. Notwithstanding that the members of that Government had for years proclaimed that they would establish the leasehold system, the moment they came into power they abandoned it. That is a matter of political history. I emphasize the point because it leads up to a matter of grave principle, to which I desire to direct attention. The Vice-President of the Executive Council cannot, by argument or joke or by any other means, dispute the fact that although in New South Wales the leasehold principle formed a plank in. the platform of the State Labour party, the moment that party came into power it abandoned it. </para>

But I am at liberty to refer to the perpetual lease which is mentioned in this Ordinance, lt is the bastard offspring of freehold tenure with all the vices and none of the virtues of its parents. I take it that the Ordinance, in its application to the Northern Territory, has received the closest scrutiny at the hands of honorable senators opposite. Consequently, when I attack it, I am attacking the essential point of the most important portion of the administration of the Territory. Section 15 of the Ordinance reads - </para>

But, in many instances, we know that a re-appraisement would mean, increasing the rent. That has been the case in Queensland, which, in many respects, is very analogous to the Northern Territory. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> has pointed out, by way of interjection, that frequently the reappraisement of values by the Land Courts has been followed by a reduction of the: original rent. </para>

Legislation has been passed to guide them in detail. It , may be my fault- </para>

                            <para>- Probably I differ from my honorable friend in this respect - that I have nothing to be ashamed of. Section  15  of the Act under which this Ordinance is made provides, with regard to the appraisement of rent, that provision may be made for &#34; any special case at the periods prescribed by the regulations, or provided for in the lease.&#34; I turn to the regulations on that point. The only provision I can find bearing upon it is headed &#34; Application for a perpetual lease of town lands.&#34; This clause provides that the applicant shall undertake &#34; to perform- the covenants and conditions &#34; of the lease. But 1 find nothing to guide me as to what is meant by &#34; special case &#34; in section  15  of the Act. If I turn to the provision with regard to improvements and their effect upon appraisements, I find nothing there. It provides for what the incoming tenant is to pay to the outgoing tenant, but the principles upon which even that is to be determined are vague. The part of the Ordinance dealing with perpetual leases contains the important words &#34; appraisement of rent &#34; ; but I cannot find anything to guide a tribunal in determining what that term means. A big principle is involved, because the perpetual lease is being offered by Socialists and Labour parties throughout the world as something better than an equivalent for a freehold. . In order to do justice both to the man who wants to use a piece of land, and the community, it is said that side by side wilh the grant of a perpetual lease you must have machinery for the appraisement of rent. But when you come to inquire what &#34; appraisement of rent &#34; means, you can wander through the whole of this Ordinance and find no satisfactory definition. </para>

                    <para class="block">Macaulay, who was continually finding fault with the Ministry of the day. Lord Melbourne said, &#34; If I could only be as cocksure of anything as Tom Macaulay is of everything, I should find the position of Prime Minister quite an easy one to hold.&#34; Using very small names in place of very big ones, I find myself in the same relation to the Vice-President of the Executive Council as Lord Melbourne did to Macaulay. But the term &#34; appraisement of rent &#34; is a vital one in this relation, and I want to know what it means, and the conditions under which it is to be applied. The occupant of a piece of land governed by this Ordinance has a right to know definitely, clearly and accurately, how the appraisement is to be determined ; what is its incidence, and how it will affect him. He will want to know what the Government are going to take from him under cover of this term. The Honorary Minister talks of taking the community value. From whom? From the occupant of the land. Surely the occupant wants to know what is to be taken. I therefore ask for a clear and distinct statement from the Government as to what these terms mean, and must request them to come out of the clouds and cease using phrases which they cannot define. It is the duty of the Government to put the intention clearly and definitely before the people. Possibly the Vice-President of the Executive Council may be able to blow my argument to pieces. Let it be blown to pieces- if I am wrong; but let us get away from cloudy generalities. I find two grave difficulties in connexion with the first point with which I deal, and those difficulties are simply intensified by the interjections which have come from the opposite benches.. It is the duty of the Government to come down to practical business in relation to the settlement of the Northern Territory. I turn to the question of re-appraisement in regard to other cases. Rightly or wrongly, I hold that the greatest inducement to agricultural settlement is a freehold tenure. It may be assumed from this Ordinance that it is the intention of the Government to substitute for a freehold tenure a perpetual lease as a means of attracting agricultural settlers to the Northern Territory. . Intending settlers, whether in Australia or outside of it, will no doubt discuss the advantages and attractions offered for settlement in the Territory. Their first question will probably be, &#34;What land can we get, and how are we to go about getting it?&#34; If they consult this Ordinance, they will find that from the point of view of the Government, a perpetual lease is put forward as something as good as, and possibly better, than a freehold, as a means of attracting settlers. They will discover that if they desire to apply for land in the Northern Territory, they will have to sign an application form in these terms - </para>

                            <para>- That is just my point. The intending settler may be desirous to secure agricultural land, and in this Ordinance the Government have confused the two things. By a reference to this Ordinance an intending settler will find that it will be possible for him to obtain a perpetual lease of town land. It may be that &#34; town land &#34; as used here does not bear the ordinary meaning of the term, and may cover land, comparatively remote from a settlement. It is to be regretted that the Ordinance should be so unfortunately worded, and I fear that it will defeat for some time the object we all have in view, to promote as speedily as possible closer settlement the Northern Territory. The Ordinance embodies a principle to which I ani absolutely and irrevocably opposed. As under your ruling, sir, I have been unable to deal with the merits of the freehold principle as opposed to the leasehold principle, I have contented myself with references to the provisions of this Ordinance for perpetual leases, which I consider dis close grave defects, and will be likely to retard the settlement of the Northern Territory by our own kith and kin. </para>

                            <para>- I say it would b&#171; the grossest misuse of the English language to describe the honorable senator&#39;s speech in any other way. I shall not discuss it any further. To come to the matter before the Senate, I wish, first of all, to say that this appears to me to be the most unsatisfactory method which could be adopted for dealing with a matter of this kind, and for this reason : Honorable senators must agree with the Ordinance as a whale, or turn it down as a whole. With the main principle of the Ordinance, in common with every other honorable senator on this side, I am in perfect agreement, but there are some things in it with which I am not in accord. I am obliged, under the procedure adopted, either to vote against the whole Ordinance, and so do violence to my conscience by voting against an important principle in which I believe, and against the Government of my own party, or I must vote for the Ordinance as a whole, and thus approve of some things in which I do not believe. No matter what vote I give upon the motion, I am compelled, by this method of procedure, to do violence to my conscience. I wish, in my criticism, to dissociate myself altogether from the main reason which has actuated the party opposite in their opposition to the Ordinance. Their chief reason for opposing it is that it gives legislative effect to the system of leasehold as opposed to the system of freehold. </para>

                            <para>- I acquit <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> of the main portion of that charge, but I understand that he is in favour of  the leasehold system as applied to pastoral areas only. I believe that he does not approve of the application of the principle to agricultural areas or town lands. If he will assure me that he does, I shall be most happy to give him credit for it. From listening to many of the honorable senator&#39;s speeches on the subject, I have come to the conclusion that he is in favour of leaseholds only for pastoral areas. If honorable senators opposite were sincere in their advocacy of freeholds as opposed to leaseholds, they would be in favour of freeholds all the time. But it is only when they find that the people are the landlord that they are in favour of freeholds. When a private individual is the landlord, they have not a single word to say against his leasing his land and fleecing his tenants of the last farthing.&#39; </para>

Where the whole people are the landlord, and may be relied upon, through the Parliament, to give the fullest possible measure of justice,, and treat their tenants with generosity* then honorable senators opposite are opposed to leasehold all the time. </para>

                            <para>- It is nothing of the sort. Everybody knows that it is only when the State is the landlord that honorable senators opposite are continually up in, arms against the principle of leasehold. We have never yet, in the halls of any Legislature, heard a word from any one of them against the system of leasehold when a. private individual is the landlord. I want to get right down vo my principal objection to this Ordinance, because I have a very decided objection to some of its provisions. T may say, at the outset, that the balance in favour of the Ordinance is so overwhelming that I shall be compelled to vote with the Government if a division is called for, and that is why I am complaining of the unsatisfactory way that <inline font-style="italic">we</inline> have of dealing, with the&#39; matter. , &#39; </para>

                            <para>- I hope that the criticism which has come from both sides of the Chamber may have the effect of inducing the Government to modify the law at the earliest possible opportunity. The system of perpetual leases - the basic policy on which the Ordinance is framed - is very good for certain descriptions of land ; but to go on the supposition that it is good for all descriptions of land is one of the most indiscreet acts which any Government could have been guilty of. I think that it must have been entered into without due consideration. Why do we adopt a land policy for the Northern Territory ? It is to get the lands occupied, and to get them occupied as closely as we can, so as to turn the Territory to profitable use. If that is so, we should only give a perpetual lease where it will not interfere with the future occupation of the country. </para>

                            <para>- I shall come to that matter directly, if the Minister will give me a little time. A perpetual lease in  a  town is all right, Because a man will only get as much land there as he  can  legitimately use. It is all right, too, in agricultural areas, because a man will only get a lease of what may be called  a  living area - that is, an area which he can reasonably use to make a living for himself and his family. A perpetual lease in these  , cases  cannot, and will not, block settlement, and, therefore, there can be no objection to it. But when we come to a perpetual lease of an enormous area of pastoral land, we are right up against a proposition which will be the most * effectual block to the future closer settlement of that country. It is useless to talk to me, or to any man who understands the pastoral conditions in Australia, about it being essential that  a  man should have 3,000 square miles of country. There is no one who has any idea or knowledge of the full possibilities of Australia. I know of country in Queensland, which, though described and regarded as desert country for many years, was found by the squatters in the  1902  drought to be splendid relief country, and was utilized by them for the saving of stock in the most disastrous drought that we ever had in Australia. That country, which, at one time, was looked upon as a desert, has become most useful country in  a  time of disaster. It is useless for anybody to tell me what the possibilities of this great country of ours are, because no one can really know. Again, much of the country in Australia, which, in former years, was unavailable because of the distance which cattle had to travel for water, is now first class pastoral country, through the discovery of artesian water. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator is quite right. Through the discovery of artesian water, country which was formerly regarded as of very little value has become some of our best and most useful pastoral country. To give a perpetual lease of so enormous an area as 3,000 square miles of country, which may at the present moment be regarded as comparatively valueless, is a suicidal policy, because no one can tell me how that land may be regarded in forty years. Further, I would like to point out that land which will not now pay for occupation in any form, simply because of the almost impossibility of getting access or communication, may, if the Commonwealth pursues a proper railway policy, become very valuable, because then it will be accessible ; and, instead of many pastoralists being compelled to lose cattle through having no means of shifting them, they may be able to do as the pastoralists in New South Wales and Queensland can do - get cheap fares on railways to carry cattle to relief country. In that way this country would become valuable. When we look ahead more than forty years, we are doing something which no persons of our limited intelligence should be given any warrant to do in the way of giving a perpetual lease, because, be it remembered that is a lease for all time. The Honorary Minister interjected a little while ago that we have the power of resumption. That power is reserved in the Ordinance, but it will always carry the right of compensation. A system could be pursued which would give the authorities the right to resume land when it was required for settlement without having to pay compensation for that resumption to which the pastoralist is not, and should not be, entitled. </para>

                            <para>- As I have pointed out, the value of a lease may increase enormously as years roll by, and then we are going to give the pastoralist compensation to which he is not entitled. The system which I think should have been adopted is to fix a limited period to leases of very large areas ; in fact, to all pastoral leases. My suggestion is that at the utmost forty years is all the tenure that should be given, even for land which is now regarded as of little value. In  1884  the Queensland Government of which <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Walker Griffith was the Premier, and in which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dutton</inline> was Minister for Lands, introduced and passed what, to my mind, was the best Land Bill that has ever been passed in any country in the world. </para>

                            <para>- The trouble into which we were landed was that every succeeding Ministry did their best to discount and discredit the Act by bad administration. Interested persons laid themselves out to amend the Act in their own favour in every direction, and it was never given a decent show. It provided a means by which land could always be available for occupation as it was wanted, and that is a great defect in this Ordinance. Under the Act the pastoralist was given a full title to his leasehold for a limited period - forty years, I think. At the expiration of the lease, the run had to be divided. One-half was to be retained by the squatter, and the other to revert to the Crown, and to be known as the resumed half. The squatter had a definite title for the portion which he held, and was given an occupation licence from year to year for the resumed half. The Act also provided that, as the land became more accessible, and a demand arose, that area should be available for grazing farms, comprising from  5,000  to  20,000  acres. That was a good policy. It is infinitely better for a country to have fifty grazing farms on an area of land rather than one big squatter, because the country will be more productive, and carry a far larger population. The people will live close together, and there will be a sufficient number of children to justify the building of schools. Social conditions will be created, and that will certainly be better than living in the wilderness, with one person here and another  50  miles away. That is the sort of settlement we want in Australia. The Queensland Act provided a reasonable means by which the land would be ready for occupation when it was wanted, but this Ordinance does not provide anything of the kind. The Minister says that the land can be resumed. Of course, I know that ; but it can only be resumed by the Crown by paying to the pastoral  tenant compensation to which he has no right, were it not for the fact that the State gave him something at the commencement which he had no right to receive. </para>

                            <para>- There is no use in the Minister trying to misstate the facts. It is best to state them fairly. If the land is required for settlement, and it is resumed and compensation is paid by the Government, what will be the result? In order to recoup themselves, they would have to exact from the incoming tenant, be he a grazing farmer or a pastoralist of any other description, a sufficiency in the way of rent to recoup the Government for the compensation paid ; and he will be handicapped, because he will have had to pay compensation for a thing which represents no value to him. In that way, we shall do something which will handicap and block settlement. I know as well as anybody else that the figures which are given here are only the maximum areas. It .is well known that when we make a maximum of that kind, every person will apply for the maximum. </para>

                            <para>- They can point to us as having given them the right to do these things. They will point to our action as their justification for the most extreme course which they may adopt. No injustice would be done to the squatter if he&#34; were assured of a lease for a fixed period of forty years. If a provision were inserted in the Ordinance declaring that, at the end of forty years, which is the full length of a generation - and none of us is entitled to look further ahead than that - he should be compelled to surrender one-half of his run, and be granted an occupation licence over the other half, we should have land ready for occupation at all times. If the Government do their duty, the Territory, in the near future, will have railways running through it ; it will be a more pleasant place to live in ; so that, by-and-by, there may be a rush to it of persons anxious to take up grazing farms ranging from 5,000 to  20,000  acres. That is the policy which we want to encourage; but if this Ordinance be carried, we shall not have land available for settlers when settlers are available for it. For that reason, I have a decided objection to the Ordinance. However, I am placed in the position of being obliged to assist in giving effect to a pernicious system or of turning down a principle which I believe to be good, and of voting against the Government which I support. It is grossly unfair that I should be put in that position. The Ordinance, I contend, will prove a block rather than an encouragement to settlement. We were told by the Minister of Defence that it was not an experiment - that we had the experience of all the States to guide us in this matter. That is quite true; but my contention is that the Government have not profited by that experience. In the  1884  Land Act of Queensland a policy was laid down, which, with a few modifications, would have been admirably suited to the needs of the Northern Territory. I do not propose to weary the Senate by dealing with the objections which have been urged to the regulations under this Ordinance. I know that there are other speakers to&#34; follow me, and I understand that it is the desire of the Government that we should arrive at a decision upon this question to-night. The only matter which I have to consider is the Ordinance itself, and not any regulations which may, or may not be made under it. If the law itself is based on a pernicious principle, any regulation which may not be bad, cannot remedy the position. I am opposed to the Ordinance in so far as it permit&#39;s of the granting of perpetual leases to big pastoralists over enormous areas. I do not object to perpetual leases being granted in the case of agricultural lands. </para>

                            <para>- No; I do not call that an agricultural farm. I would not grant a perpetual lease to a block of land of more than  20,000  acres, except in a purely grazing area. There is a happy medium in this matter, by which the Government should have been guided. If, instead of seeking for blessed uniformity by making the one law applicable to every class of land in the Territory, they had acted on a different principle, they would have been wise. The town lands require different treatment from the pastoral lands, and the pastoral lands require different treatment from the agricultural lands. I am sorry that, upon this occasion, I am compelled to vote for something in which I decidedly do not believe. </para>

                            <para>- I admit that that provision settles the question of whether the freehold or the leasehold system should be established in the Northern Territory. Although I do not believe in universal leasehold, I take it that this is not the time to argue that matter. I do not blame the Government for the action which they have taken, but I do blame them for the way in which they have dealt with this leasehold question. I believe that much of the land in the Territory for many years to come will be best managed by the adoption of the leasehold principle. There are other parts of that huge Territory where, I think, the freehold system might very well be allowed. I do not condemn the Government for endeavouring to give effect to the Act which we passed last year. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. But 1 do object to the way in which that has been done. I do not think that it ought <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> have been done by means of this Ordinance. It ought to have been done by submitting a Bill to Parliament, so that every honorable senator would have been afforded an opportunity of discussing its details, and of endeavouring to modify them. As it is, we have either to swallow this Ordinance <inline font-style="italic">in globo</inline> or to reject it entirely. If we could discuss it clause by clause, and modify it in any way, the position would be very different. I repeat that a Bill should ha.ve been introduced setting out the whole of the details of the leasehold system. The Government themselves would then have been in a better position than they are, because there are some of their own supporters who believe m that system, but who disagree with this Ordinance. Both Senators Givens and Gardiner object to the size of the pastoral leases which it is proposed to grant under it. If We had .been afforded an opportunity of discussing a measure clause by clause, they might have succeeded in obtaining some modification of those areas, which would have made the Government proposals acceptable to them, instead of which they have now to swallow something which they do not like, so as to avoid throwing out the Ordinance altogether. Honorable senators ought not to be placed in that position. We ought to have had an opportunity of agreeing with the provisions in which we believe, and of disagreeing with those in which we do not believe. Personally, I do not believe in perpetual leases. They may become an evil, because people can traffic in them just as much as they can in freeholds. </para>

The Minister of Defence stated that these perpetual leases could be so conditioned that they would be just as good as short leases. If that be so, why not adopt short leases straight away? I take it that if the Northern Territory is going to be developed,  a  great number of people will find their way there, so that in time it will become a State of the Commonwealth. When that day arrives, I think that the residents of the Territory should enjoy just as much liberty to manage their own State as do the residents of any other State of the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- Whilst I think that a great deal of this land would be better leased than sold, I do not believe in perpetual leases; and even where, in some parts of the country, I should like to see men get freeholds, if they want them, 1 point out that the Government would still have control over any alienated land by means of taxation, especially if they adopted a proper system, so that there would be no harm done. With regard to the matter of resumption, I find that, under clause 35 of the Ordinance, the lessee is entitled to be paid compensation for improvements; and improvements are denned as meaning &#34; improvements of a permanent nature reasonably adapted to the use of the leased lands for the purposes of the lease.&#34; This applies to town lands, as well as to other lands. Suppose that a man had a block of town land, in which he had invested his capital, and had built up a business upon it. The Government could come in and say, &#34; We want this land i&#60;&#171;r public purposes, and will give you simply and solely the value of the improvements, and nothing more.&#34; The man may have spent half a lifetime in building up his business, and yet not a. penny-piece would the Government give him for the goodwill. </para>

                            <para>- Not under this Ordinance. There is another peculiar thing with regard to the matter of regulations. Usually a regulation which is made under an Act has to come before Parliament, and may be allowed or disallowed before it has the force of law. But under clause  42  of this Ordinance the Administrator is given power to make regulations, which must be notified in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette,</inline> a copy of which is to be forwarded to the Minister. The Minister may then, by notice in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette,</inline> disallow any regulation, and it shall thereupon cease to have any effect. So that it is within the power, not of the Executive, but of the Minister alone, to allow or disallow a regulation made by the Administrator. These regulations ought to be in the same position as any other regulations made under an Act of Parliament. Why should they not be laid upon the table of the Senate, in order that we may have an opportunity of saying whether we think they should be enforced? Why put the whole power in the hands of the Minister, who may do as he pleases? Inasmuch as Parliament has decided to adopt the leasehold system, there are some things in this Ordinance for which I should be prepared to vote, believing them to be right. But there are other things in it which I should desire to strike out. But I cannot do that, because the Ordinance is not submitted to us in the form of a Bill, as it ought to have been. We should have been given an opportunity of going through the Ordinance clause by clause. Because I do not believe in some of the clauses in it, I shall vote against the whole Ordinance. </para>

                        <para>. - I wish to give a general support to the Ordinance, whilst, at the same time, I have to say, incidentally, that it brings before us a difficulty which I have mentioned previously. I hope the day is not far distant when we shall legislate directly for the important Territory which we have in the north, and the development of which is of great importance, not only to Australia, but to the Empire. I hope, also, that we shall have a Minister appointed to administer the Territory who will spend a fair proportion of his time there, and be responsible for legislation submitted to Parliament for its purposes. </para>

                            <para>- We have quite enough to do with the Northern Territory at present. The reason why I give  a general support to the Ordinance is that I believe .it represents a genuine attempt on the part of the Government to deal with probably the largest problem facing Australia to-day. Though there seems to be a contradiction in terms in using the words &#34; perpetual lease,&#34; still we have the same difficulty with regard to freehold. </para>

                            <para>- I admit that. The limitations of the term are clear; but a man in possession of a freehold, so-called, may find that his property is compulsorily resumed by a State for public purposes. The term may not be quite correct technically, but it is, nevertheless, expressive of the underlying intention of the Ordinance, that a perpetual lease may be given, subject to certain modifications. It might be correct to describe what is intended in such terms as those, but they would be rather cumbersome. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> has expressed a fear that under the Ordinance the Territory will be secured in very large sections by a few individuals. </para>

                            <para>- Certainly ; but can we get twenty men to go&#39; upon country which is held by one man in that Territory to-day ? The object of the Government is to apply the lands of the Northern Territory to the fullest possible use, and to have it occupied by the largest population they can induce to go there ; but it is evident that for some years we shall have only a small population there. If the community does not want to use the land that is available, what objection can there be to a few individuals using a large proportion of it until such time as it is wanted by a larger number? </para>

                            <para>- I have looked through the Ordinance to see whether there is any justification for the fears of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens,</inline> and I fail to see that there is. It seems to me that the resumption provisions are all right, as long as they are honestly administered. We are trying to induce settlers to go to the Territory. Suppose that a man takes up land there, and becomes a cattle king. Suppose that there is an important mineral development in the middle of his run. A second Broken Hill might be discovered. A large portion of his land would be immediately required for township purposes. A city might grow up. It would then be the duty of the Government to resume the area. It might be necessary to compensate the man and to get rid of his stock at once. It would be possible to get rid of him on giving <inline font-style="italic">two</inline> years&#39; notice. </para>

                            <para>- We need to offer incentives to people to go to the Northern Territory. I hope and believe that the inducements offered under this Ordinance will be sufficient to attract a large population to the Territory, and that there will be a land scramble in the anxiety which people will display to establish homes there. We shall preserve the right of the community to the unearned increment of land there, and the people will be the gainers thereby. I do not know whether I shall be in order under your ruling, sir, but I wish -to indicate the possibilities of the leasehold system through the expenditure of public money and the settlement of a large population. To do so, I propose to quote the unimproved land values of New South Wales. Taking the municipal valuations, so far as they have gone, I find that the total unimproved value of land in New South Wales is ^156, 000,000. In Sydney, the unimproved value of land per head is .&#163;158 ; in the suburbs of Sydney, ^49; and in the metropolis, as a whole, ^72 per head. In the country municipalities it is ^43 per head; in the shires, ^148 per head ; in the Western Division, the valuation, which I understand is only an estimate, is put down at ^492 per head. Now as to the valuation per acre. The unimproved value of land in Sydney is ^6,002 per acre; in the suburbs, ^225 per acre, which I consider a very low valuation ; and for the metropolis as a whole, .&#163;456 per acre. Under this Ordinance there is more than a reasonable hope that this unearned increment, instead &#34;of going into the pockets of the private land speculator, will go into the coffers of the Commonwealth Treasury. </para>

                            <para>- It is a question of interpretation. However, I am more particular &#39;about securing the rights in the town blocks or mining centres, which I hope to see developed in the back country, because I realize that population is the cause of the unearned increment. In the country municipalities in New South Wales it is ;&#163;io 17s. 4d. per acre, in shires 14s.. 4d., and in the western division 2s. 6d. That is an indication that the unearned increment in that State has grown far and away beyond the dreams of any of the earlier settlers. As we are about to settle the Northern Territory on a different basis, namely, that the unearned increment shall go directly to the coffers of the State, it is a big experiment. However we may differ as to details,  1  think that at this stage we can congratulate the Government upon having had the courage to put into operation a system which I believe will operate to the great advantage of the Commonwealth in the future, and also promote settlement. </para>

I do not think that the Commonwealth, or its people, desire to do an injustice to any man. I hope that the individual case will be considered whatever may be the development ot the Territory, and that the whole idea at the back of die administration will be to attract population, to get the land settled, to do justice to every settler, and, at the same- time, to preserve the right of the Commonwealth to the unearned increment which the community, and the community alone, creates. </para>

                        <para>. - I must admit somewhat to a feeling of disappointment at the course of this debate. I had hoped that there would have been a more genuine inclination to take part in the discussion, and that the invitation which, to the best of my ability, I extended both to the Government and to their supporters, to regard my motion as entirely free from any party significance, would have been responded to a little more generously than has been the case. In view of the defects which are admitted to exist in  the Ordinance, I felt bound to bring the matter under the notice of the Senate, lt is not my fault that these proposals are embodied in an Ordinance, nor is it my fault that under our rules I am not able to submit the Ordinance so that it could be dealt with as the Senate would deal with an ordinary Bill. If that course had been open to me, I should have welcomed it, because I approached the matter with the sincere desire to prevent the Northern Territory being committed to what I regard as a very grave mistake, involving very serious consequences. I took the only course which was open to me. I brought the matter forward with a frank declaration that I was merely concerned to amend the Ordinance, and not in any way to make the position difficult for the Government. I had hoped that the Vice-President of the Executive Council would have recognised the statement which I then made, and left it easier than he did for honorable senators on his side, who are disinclined to indorse the Ordinance, to join with me and others who wish to see it amended. 1 get one cause of satisfaction out of the debate. 1 do not believe that to-day there is -a member of the Senate but who is prepared to frankly admit that he regards legislation by Ordinance as a most undesirable and imperfect method of procedure. The debate has done at least this good - that it has brought before honorable senators the fact that by means of an Ordinance, and behind the back of Parliament, legislation, for which I venture to say there is no general approval in the Chamber, can be placed upon the statute-book, and it will be as effective there1 as if it had been passed by the two Houses. </para>

                    <para>I should like now to summarize, as far as I am able to do, the conclusions which one is entitled to draw from the remarks made during the debate. I am pleased to find that, at any rate, on some of the matters there need not, in future, be any difference of opinion as to what the Ordinance means. The Vice-President of the Executive Council has practically admitted, that, first of all, with regard to clause 8, dealing with classification. In introducing this matter, I pointed out that the clause was the subject of two limitations, and my honorable friend has stated plainly what it means. It is well that those who are to be invited to go to the Northern Territory should understand the terms and conditions under which they will take up their land. I specially direct the attention of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> J. Russell to clause 8, seeing that he concluded his remarks &#39;by expressing the hope that it would, not be long before, under the generous terms of the Ordinance, streams of settlers would be going there. I invite him, whenever he is on the platform, directing the attention of land-seekers to the Northern Territory, to draw their attention to the fact that, although they can take up land under one set of conditions, as set out in the Ordinance to-day, under clause 8 it will be competent for the administrators to shift their land out of that set of conditions and put it under&#39; another set whenever it suits them. That is the position which should be stated if we want to deal honestly with people who are thinking of going to the Northern Territory. We ought to tell them that, although they may take up a pastoral, or grazing, or farming lease, it will be within the competence of the Classification Board to say to them later, &#34; Although you acquired the land under these terms and conditions, we can now., by the exercise of our power under clause 8, reclassify the land, and put you under an entirely different set of conditions.&#34; </para>

                            <para>- I want to direct attention to another admission, or, if the Minister objects to that word, to his agreement with my interpretation of the clause under which power is taken by the officials to direct the manner in which a man shall cultivate his land. The honorable senator said that it was right and proper - and he defended the provision - that the Crown should have the power to tell the lessee, not merely what he should not plant on his lease, but what he should plant. These are admissions which came from the Minister. </para>

First of all, there is the Ordinance, which states that the Crown reserves to itself the right to direct the manner of cultivation, and. not merely the area of land to be cultivated - the right, not merely to give a general direction that a man is to cultivate and put under agriculture a certain percentage of his holding, which would be a fair and proper thing to do, but also to direct the manner of his cultivation. </para>

                            <para>- Only to-day I have heard suggestions which I do not regard as reasonable. It is entirely a matter of opinion. The Minister of Defence referred to the possibility of growing wheat in a district in which he admitted that the rain does not fall in what is ordinarily regarded as the wheat-growing period. Now suppose that some enterprising official entertained the view that it might be possible to discover a wheat which would grow in that district under the conditions which obtain there, and that he instructed the lessees to carry out certain experiments with that end in view. Suppose, for example, that he ordered one farmer to sow wheat in January, another to sow it in February, and a third to sow it in March. Those experiments would be very proper and desirable ; but as they would be for the public good, obviously they ought to be carried out at the public expense. It ought not to be within the competency of the Director of Lands to order lessees to carry out experiments at their own expense. I am glad that the Minister agrees with my reading that the Director of Lands under this Ordinance has a right, for what he regards as a breach of the conditions, to forfeit a lessee&#39;s holding; but the Minister and I differ when he asserts, as he did to-day, that a right of appeal is provided. I say that there is no right of appeal. It is true that the Administrator may, if he thinks fit, review the position ; but there is no machinery by which a lessee can prosecute an appeal. What the provision means is that if the Director of Lands chooses to consider  that  there has been a breach of the conditions, he may direct the forfeiture of a lessee&#39;s holding; and the Administrator may, if he likes, reverse that forfeiture. But there is no machinery by which a lessee, if he feels aggrieved, can call in question&#34; and submit to cross-examination, the statements of those upon whose word the Director of Lands has probably acted. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know the conditions which obtain in Western Australia, but I do know those which obtain in three of the States. I say that if a lessee&#39;s property is involved, he should be afforded a reasonable opportunity in some Court of making his case clear; but under this Ordinance the matter is left to one individual acting behind the closed doors of his office. The Minister of Defence spoke of the Government having had the advantage of the experience of the other States; but, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> reminded him, they have not profited by it. We tried this one-man business in. New South Wales, and what happened ? From the force of a painful experience not infrequently associated with scandals, the public of that State were gradually driven to recognise the great value of a Court of public inquiry in dealing with these matters. Not long ago we know that trouble was experienced over land matters there. In every one of those cases, the trouble arose out of particular leases being dealt with behind the closed doors of the Minister&#39;s office. All the things which were called scandals were done in his office. But we may search the records of that State as closely as we choose, and we shall find1 that where lessees have had the protection of an open inquiry there has never been the slightest suggestion of any impropriety. </para>

                            <para>- If one can imagine a public work being completed, or even proposed, once a week, it would be competent to have a re- appraisement once a. week. But the Vice-President of the Executive Council knew perfectly well that I was speaking figuratively. Although the Ordinance professes to give the lessee of a town block a perpetual lease with a reappraisement every fourteen years, there is in the lease itself a provision by which the authorities can come along and call for a reappraisement of it as often as any public building is erected which is likely to influence the value of the block. Take the case of Port Darwin. Let us suppose that as the result of the advent of the Commonwealth, applications are put in for a number of town blocks there by persons who desire to erect business premises thereon. Is it unreasonable to suppose that during the next fourteen years fourteen public buildings will be erected there. I can mention almost fourteen buildings which will have to be erected. </para>

                            <para>- No; but in this matter my honorable friends cannot refine their theories down too closely. If we nominally grant a man a lease of fourteen years, subject to a re-appraisement at the end of that term, and yet claim the right with every expenditure of public money to re-appraise his block, we put him in an extremely embarrassing position. If I desired to erect a business establishment in a town like Port Darwin, I would not be anxious to put up a galvanized-iron shanty costing, perhaps,  &#163;50.  I would want to put up substantial premises. But what security would I have under this Ordinance ? None at all. I would be liable to have my lease re-appraised every year. </para>

                            <para>- But he will not get a lease for fourteen years. The Ordinance states that the lease of town lands shall be in perpetuity, subject to a reappraisement every fourteen years. But the lease itself contains a proviso that the Crown may at any time, if it has reason to think that any work which has been carried out by the expenditure of public money has added to the value of the town blocks, subject them to a re-appraisement. We shall not get business men to put  &#163;3,000  or  &#163;4,000  into store premises unless they have fixed terms for a reasonable period of years. </para>

                    <para>I wish now to turn to the painstaking effort which was made by the Vice-President of the Executive Council and the Minister of Defence to justify the areas which are provided for in this Ordinance. They pointed out that in other parts of Australia there are very large areas of lower grazing capacity.. But the question of area is not the only matter for our consideration. When he was speaking, I asked the Minister of Defence how he could dissociate the question of area from that of tenure. He replied, in that lofty tone which he can assume at times, that Ee would deal with the matter in his own way. But he conveniently forgot to touch upon it. I would have no objection to leasing for six months to-morrow the whole of the unoccupied portions of the Northern Territory to a single individual if I could get rent for them. But that is a very different matter from granting a perpetual lease over those portions of the Territory. If the Minister of Defence will look at the history of our land legislation, imperfect as it has been, he will find that the larger the areas which have been leased, the less permanent has been the tenure. In that respect we have always differentiated, which is just what this Ordinance fails to do. An effort has always been made in our State legislation to differentiate between holdings which were permanent and those which were temporary. In all these big pastoral holdings in Queensland, South Australia, and also in the Northern Territory itself, there has been this sharp distinction: that, where lands were held for pastoral purposes in big blocks, they were held on, comparatively speaking, short leases. </para>

                            <para>- I am trying to sa.ve the Northern Territory from the mistakes into which the States have allowed themselves to fall, and one of the chief of these is the mistake of allowing big aggregations to go on. The States have made the mistake, which this Ordinance seeks to perpetrate, of applying the same tenure to small permanent homes as to large temporary holdings. This perpetual leasehold principle, which may be an extremely valuable system when applied to small residential farms, becomes quite a different thing when applied to big pastoral holdings. My fundamental objection to this Ordinance is that it does propose to grant these big pastoral holdings under perpetual leases. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell,</inline> and others who have spoken, seem to overlook the fact that if the Northern Territory is to be half as valuable as they think it will be, it will not be very long before some of the land which is now leased will have to be resumed - and it will not be very long after that before the land which will be leased under this Ordinance will also be required for subdivision. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> goes a long way round the compass in speculating about gold-fields being opened up. There is no need to suppose that such, things will happen. We need only point to what has occurred in some of the States to show that land that is held to-day in holdings of 500,000 acres for pastoral purposes will be required, not for agricultural or mining purposes, but for pastoral purposes in small areas. That has been the experience of Queensland, and is the experience of my own State - certainly of that large portion of New South Wales of which you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> have some knowledge, namely, the Western Division, embracing, roughly speaking, a third of the State. Ten or twelve years ago, owing to a series of bad years, and also to some faulty legislation, that division of New South Wales became practically bankrupt. With the desire to prevent the abandonment of a large portion of it, legislation was passed which was extremely liberal in its character. It gave forty-two years&#39; leases for holdings in that Western Division. But, although only a. few years have passed since that was done, there has been a. general demand for resumption, not for agricultural or mining purposes, but for the purpose of smaller pastoral areas than were provided for by the existing law. No one pretends that it is farming land. The land is wanted purely for pastoral purposes - for diminutive squattages, if honorable sena..tors like to use that term. The same is going to happen in the Northern Territory. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> has made a claim for honesty on the part of his party. I do not want to question it now. But where is the common sense of granting to-day leases in these large areas, with the practical certainty that the land will have to be resumed for subdivision within a few years? Let us proceed on the reasonable assumption that the average areas for the holdings already taken up give us some idea of what the average areas will be when the remaining area is taken up. </para>

                            <para>- It is not that. The Government are not in a position to compel people to take up land in the Northern Territory. You have to consider what people want, and what they will expect to get, when you invite them to go there with their lives and their money to develop the Territory. It is not altogether what this Parliament wants. Parliaments have  adopted that policy before, and, in consequence, have continually had to alter their land legislation. What we may assume is that to-day the best pastoral country in the Northern Territory is occupied in areas which average a quarter of a million acres in extent. There are 256 holdings embracing something like 103,000,000 acres, an average of 270.000 acres. We may assume that that represents the best land. If that be so, we can clearly see that the land which lies behind these holdings, in a country less generously treated in the matter of rainfall, will not be held in smaller blocks on the average. Is that position going to continue for ever? If that is so, it means that 700 or 800 people will occupy all the purely pastoral country in the Northern Territory. We may be quite sure, however, that there will be a demand for the subdivision of these large holdings. People will say that the time has gone by when they should be allowed to continue, and that the time has come when younger men should have an opportunity of making a start for themselves, as their forefathers had. It appears to me to be monstrously foolish to give any one a title to occupy large areas on perpetual lease. It is nonsense to say that you cannot get the Northern Territory occupied otherwise. All experience shows that you can get it occupied under a terminable leasing system. A third of it is now occupied under laws passed by the Parliament of South Australia. It is evident that if it was possible to secure the occupation of so much of the country while it was under South Australian administration, we shall have no difficulty in securing occupation when the Commonwealth administers it. The Commonwealth, as shown by the policy which it has initiated, is determined to help forward the Territory and to develop it. But surely we are not going to try to settle it on terms less favorable to its permanent development than those granted by South Australia. Hitherto the leases granted have been for twenty-one, thirty, and forty-two years, the latter being the longest term allowed anywhere in Australia for pastoral country. Those terms have proved sufficient to attract enough people to take up a third of the Territory. The Commonwealth has now come along, and is prepared to spend money to build railways and to facilitate settlement. But  although  a term of forty-two years has been effective in a short space of time in securing settlement, we are asked to believe that we can only settle the remaining portion of the area by adopting the perpetual leasing system. In regard even to so long a term as forty-two years, there comes a time when a lease falls in, and when land again comes into the hands of the Crown. The Crown can then do as it likes with it. If the Crown desires to resume before the forty-two years&#39; period is up, it has to pay so much according to the value of the term that has still to run. . But with interminable leases the only  way in which the Crown could resume would be by compensating the leaseholder on the basis of perpetual holding. We are told that the Government have had the benefit of the experience of the several States. If that be so, I wonder who has been advising them, in this matter, because it seems to me that the experience of the States has been completely ignored. The statement has been made that it does not matter about granting perpetual leases, because we can resume at any time. It is quite true that we can, but I am trying to point out that under this Ordinance that resumption would cost a good deal of money. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell, Senator Findley,</inline> and others have tried to suggest that we should only have to pay for the improvements. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> thinks a little he will see that that would be a monstrously unfair thing to do. In fact, the Ordinance does not propose to do it. A man who goes into a concern of this kind has to devote a few years to developing it before he gets any return. It certainly would not be a fair thing simply to pay him the value of his improvements alone and turn him out. Under the laws of all our States the mere fact of forcible, dispossession entitles a man to compensation. But let us look at what the Ordinance does. </para>

                            <para>- He would under this Ordinance. The only thing that is barred to him under it is the value which springs from the construction of public works. But there is a community-created value quite apart from&#39; that. Take a pastoral holding in an agricultural district. The run itself may be regarded as outside the agricultural zone. But by degrees settlement commences to flow -on until it laps up to the boundary of the holding. Has not that added a value to the holding? Of course, it has; and the holder  would be entitled to collect that increased value. In Part IV. of this Ordinance, -dealing with resumptions, it says that the lessee shall be entitled to the value of his improvements, and then it goes on to provide that -  the lessee shall also be entitled to be paid compensation for any depreciation in the value of the lease by reason of any resumption, such compensation to be determined in the same manner as compensation for improvements. </para>

The Ordinance, first of all, provides for compensation for improvements, and goes on then to say that the lessee shall &#34; also &#34; be paid something else. What is that something else ? It is of no use for Ministers to say that it does not mean the community-created value. The only thing barred to the lessee by way of compensation is that special portion of the community-created value which springs from the construction of a public work. </para>

I am protesting against the granting under perpetual leases of these large squattages, which will inevitably, in the course of time, have to be taken back by the Government under the resumption clause of this Ordinance providing tor the payment of compensation. If we are going to grant a perpetual lease, we should grant compensation if the land is resumed; but I say that it is entirely foolish to make grants of large squattages under perpetual leases when we know that sooner or later we shall require the land for public purposes. </para>

If we are, <inline font-style="italic">we</inline> should certainly go slowly. We should not tie up the lands of the Territory in these big areas in perpetuity. The honorable senator admits that we should feel our way in this matter with great caution. I am not only surprised, but extremely disappointed, that there has not been, from both sides, a strong protest against the granting in this blindfold fashion of big squattages under perpetual leases. I should have thought that honorable senators would have welcomed an opportunity to give perpetual leases for residence areas, and, it may be, for the smaller blocks, but that with respect to the big grazing areas, under which a great portion of the Territory must be held for many years to come, they would have insisted upon fixing a definite period for the lease,* so that the lands might come back to the Crown, when required for closer settlement, free from all the complications and expense of compensation to the lessee. </para>

They have all, by subsequent legislation, been compelled to try to minimize or remedy the mistakes made in the past.. Those mistakes are being repeated here today in making provision for a perpetual right of occupancy of large areas of country in the Northern Territory. The one cry which the Labour party raised a few years ago was that Australia was suffering from land monopoly. They are trying now to bring about another kind of land monopoly. I admit that it will not be as dangerous as a freehold monopoly, because the amount involved in resumption will not be so great ; but the principle is just the same. </para>

                            <para>- That is rather a. novel statement. The honorable senator asks how there can be a monopoly if the land belongs to the people. How was it that there was a land monopoly in Victoria when the land belonged to the people ? The reason why it was a monopoly is the reason why it will be a monopoly in the Northern Territory, and that is that the land will belong to so few people. If there were no other means of settling the pastoral areas of the Northern Territory except by granting perpetual leases, I should say grant them, because the first business is to secure the occupation of the land. But when we may secure the occupation of the Territory under leases which every day will become shorter, and may thus leave a future generation and a future Parliament free to deal with the lands in the light of the experience which will then have been gained, I say it is not merely foolish, but it becomes a national crime if we attempt by means of this Ordinance to lock up the lands of the Territory in the way proposed. </para>
