                        <para>- I was under the impression that, perhaps, I was a little below normal, so far as hearing is concerned, but when I discovered that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Buzacott</inline> was in a similar position I began to think about things. I hope that Ministers will be kind enough to raise their voices just a little. I know that each of them has something of a voice when he likes to use it. If they do not use their voices, so that I can hear them I shall be under the painful necessity of finding out in some way or other, what the business of the Chamber is, what papers are presented, and what is being done. This whispering to you, sir, and across the chamber is most deplorable. It ought not to be carried on in a place where national business is transacted, and Ministers have no excuse, because this is a very small chamber, and any man with a very ordinary voice can make himself heard. I trust that Ministers will consider the convenience of, honorable senators, and try to make themselves heard. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> has been long enough in Parliament to know the practice to which I have referred. The honorable member who moved this motion in another place with respect to the division of Queensland into two States apparently did not arrange with any honorable senator to take charge of the motion in the Senate, nor did he communicate with the Government on the subject. When the  President  read out the message, as he did in his usual tone of voice, it must have been distinctly audible in every part of the chamber. I naturally looked to Senators Stewart and Givens to see if they were going to take any action. After a pause of some seconds, and in order that the message might be dealt with, I suggested to the Vice-President of the Executive Council that he should take the action he did. There was only one course which he could take, and that was to move that the message be taken into consideration on the next day of sitting. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> displays an anxiety to belabour the Government on any pretext, whether there is any foundation for his complaint or not. </para>

                <para class="block">Givens has himself, and quite recently, protested against what he described as the " sneaking in " of business. It was to prevent that practice that our Standing Orders have been so framed,; but the honorable senator is to-day lending his patronage to the process of "sneaking in" which he so much reprobates when applied to other business. I hold the opinion that the message before us ought not to be considered to-day, or at any time, first of all because the motion did not obtain a majority in another place. It was carried only because there was not a quorum of honorable members available, and if a division had been called for the proceedings of that Chamber would have been brought to a close. Then I say that honorable senators are not prepared to discuss the big problem raised by this message. I certainly decline to consider it until I have been given: some opportunity to make myself seized of the facts which should determine one's judgment on so important a matter. </para>

I think that the difficulty is that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> is getting too old. Consequently his hearing is bad, or else he has let his hair grow too long. For any of these things I am not accountable. When the message was read, I had no intimation as to the course of action I should take.I interfered out of deference to the mover in another place, who is a particular friend of mine. I waited to see whether any honorable senator from Queensland would take the question up. It will be" recollected also that when I rose, I asked leave of the House to submit my motion, because I had no right to move such a motion without leave. Then when Senators Givens and Stewart rose in their wrath, I asked leave to withdraw the motion in order that the business might be transferred to them. But the Leader of the Opposition saw fit to object to that, as he had a perfect right to do. </para>

                            <para>. - This is a most important motion, dealing, as it does, not only with our national defence, but with the question of the influence of national sentiment, and national feeling in regard to it. I am informed, and believe it is true, that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> himself belonged to the Citizen Army of Australia at one time, and occupied a high and honorable position in it. It is, I understand, only because of the honorable senator's modesty that he is not addressed as the " honorable and gallant <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Major McDougall."</inline> The fact that he takes a very great interest in the Defence Forces has been shown by the speeches and questions he has addressed to the Senate on the subject. It is evident from this motion that he is keenly interested in the encouragement "of national feeling and sentiment amongst our citizen soldiers. The Australian Citizen Army cannot be Australian and national 'un less it is entirely Australian. The honorable senator says that it should be administered, trained, and led by officers raised from its ranks. It cannot be a purely Australian Army if the officers are not also Australian. I ask whether it is not desirable that our Citizen Forces should be officered by men culled from the ranks who have shown special capacity. There is no man in Australia who will deny that -we have here sufficient talent to raise officers for our own Army. It is most desirable that our citizen soldiers should feel as the soldier of the French army felt in the days of Napoleon, namely, that he had a marshal's baton in his knapsack. That is the way to foster, not only a national spirit, but that <inline font-style="italic">esprit de corps</inline> that will redound to the credit of our young Army, and make for its efficiency. Some people have the idea that a military officer to be efficient must have been born with a silver spoon in his mouth. In great Britain, in order that the Army may be kept in the hands of the titled, wealthy, and aristocratic classes, matters are so arranged that it is impossible for a young man to be an officer and live on his pay. I am assured that, in some regiments, he must have a private income of about <inline font-style="italic">£600</inline> a year. </para>

                            <para>- I give the Minister full credit for that. I believe that no one is more heartily in sympathy with the idea that every man should have an equal opportunity to rise in our Citizen Army, and no one has a deeper contempt for the feeling in the Old Country which would preserve officerships in the Army for the sons of the titled, the rich, and the aristocratic. History shows that some of the world's greatest generals have risen from the ranks, and had no pretensions to aristocratic birth or wealthy connexions. Such was the' case with Napoleon. Yet he proved his wonderful abilities above all the dukes, barons, and princes who were pitted against him. . He led his victorious armies from one end of Europe to the other, and it was only by a combination of circumstances, and the fact that France had been desolated by continuous wars that he was at length overthrown. Some of the greatest generals in the Grand Army, men whom history regards with the greatest admiration, rose from the ranks. The soldiers of Napoleon positively adored him and obeyed his commands with unquestionable loyalty. Yet he did not belong to the aristocracy, nor did he gain his position by wealth or family connexions. I hold in my hand a copy of the Australian Navy list. I do not question the Minister's loyalty to the principle to which he adheres, but I must point out that this list contains the names of scores of officers of all ranks who have been lent to us by the British Navy. Perhaps that policy had to be followed in the beginning in order that we might have officers to train our young men. But I trust that the Minister will give the matter his serious attention, and as our own officers become trained and capable will, as far as possible, discontinue the practice of importing British officers. I give the motion my hearty support. </para>

I make no apology for anything that I said in submitting the motion. I am satisfied that what I said was correct, and am prepared to repeat every word of it. I am pleased to know that the Minister is in sympathy with the motion. I have received letters from numbers of people, some of them in high places, thanking me for bringing the matter forward. One letter, which is a sample of many, has come from an Inspector of Schools in New South Wales, who tells me that he, as an ardent and aggressive Australian, with a full faith in the efficiency, ability, and energy of his fellow countrymen, agrees heartily with the motion that I have submitted, and considers that I hit the nail right on the head. I have also received a letter from an officer in our Army, standing high in the service, expressing his approval of the action I have taken, and appreciating what I said in submitting the motion.

                        <para>. - It will be readily admitted by those who listened to his speech that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> made out an excellent case for the establishment of a Commonwealth-owned line of steamers between the mainland and Tasmania. He gave facts and figures to show that such a Commonwealth enterprise would be highly remunerative to the taxpayers of Australia, while it would, at the same time, give the residents of Tasmania greater facilities for communication with the mainland than they have at present. Another strong argument in favour of carrying this motion has been put forward by a Committee which was appointed by the Tasmanian Parliament to deal with the matter. The following is an 'extract from a Melbourne newspaper - </para>

                        <para>The committee was appointed as the result of long-standing complaints and dissatisfaction with the present shipping services. The committee took evidence in all parts of the State, and, at the request of the Premier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Soloman),</inline> information was obtained regarding the policy  adopted by the Japanese Government -for the development of its mercantile marine. </para>
                        <para>The committee states that the matter of maritime transport with the other States is a many-sided one, and that the greatest difficulty was experienced in making recommendations. The committee believes that such a magnificent harbor as Hobart should possess docking facilities. </para>

                        <para>That, in the interests of the tourist traffic and the full development of Tasmania's trade resources, the Government should open up negotiations with the Commonwealth Ministry, with a view of ascertaining the largest amount of subsidy that will be paid to the State of Tasmania in the event of the Tasmanian Government deciding to build two vessels of modern type to trade between Northern Tasmania and Victoria, and that action be taken according to the nature of the replies received to the above questions. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">I may state that the Committee was not composed of a majority of members' of the Labour party, who are supposed to be in favour of the nationalization of steamer services between one part of the Commonwealth and another. The majority of the Committee was composed of followers of the present Government of Tasmania, which is generally opposed to nationalization, and the fact that the Committee made such a strong recommendation regarding the desirableness of the State Government seriously considering the question of running a State service between Tasmania and the mainland shows that there must be very urgent necessity for some alteration in the existing service. The Committee proposed that the Commonwealth Government should be approached, with the view of finding out what subsidy it would give the State of Tasmania, in the event of the State instituting a service. The Committee have not quite the same idea as is conveyed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> in this motion, but it emphasizes the urgent necessity that exists for improving the service between Tasmania and the mainland in the interests, not only of the people of Tasmania, but of those on the mainland. Speaking from a long experience of the difficulties and disabilities which Tasmania labours under, through its present inadequate service, I believe that there is a better chance of a Commonwealthowned service being more remunerative than a State-owned service, and I favour the proposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> rather than the recommendation of the Committee appointed by the Tasmanian Parliament. There is ample precedent for the Commonwealth entering into this undertaking. It has already undertaken an enormous liability in connexion with the railway between Western Australia and the eastern part of the Commonwealth, and the reason why the Commonwealth entered into that liability was on account of the comparatively isolated State of Western Australia. Although that railway will involve the taxpayers in a loss for some years after it has been running, the majority of members in both Houses willingly voted the money, because they considered that the circumstances justified them in doing so. </para>

                    <para>SenatorO'KEEFE. - From a number of aspects. One of the strongest reasons which impelled me to change the views I held for a number of years, and to eventually vote in favour of the construction of that railway was that, from a defence aspect, the early construction of the line was necessary. A splendid case has been made out . for the establishment of a Commonwealthowned line of steamers, and when the Commonwealth Government is approached 'by the Tasmanian Government, as it will be very shortly, with a view to ascertaining what subsidy the Commonwealth will grant to a State-owned service, I ask the Government to seriously consider whether it would not be better for the Commonwealth itself to establish a line of steamers between Tasmania and the mainland. </para>

                        <para>- Before putting the question which winds up the session I must thank honorable senators on both sides of the chamber for the courtesy and consideration which have been extended to the Chair during a fairly long session. I do not expect that any occupant of the chair can so manage things that some one will not feel a bit ruffled now and again. </para>

                            <para>- As regards being impartial and giving a fair deal to honorable senators on both sides, that has been my endeavour from the very beginning, and I believe that I have succeeded, at any rate to a considerable extent. I wish to thank the officers of the Senate for the work which they have done in very difficult circumstances. We have been unfortunate. At the beginning of the session <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Boydell</inline> himself was not too well ; then <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Upward</inline> took ill almost as soon as he returned from a furlough, and we had to do without his services in the chamber for a considerable time. The  Speaker  has asked me to thank the members of the Library Committee, and to specially mention <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> who, with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Glynn,</inline> has undertaken the work of advising him in the selection of books. He desires to acknowledge that he has received a considerable amount of assistance from those gentlemen in the performance of his duties as  Chairman  of the Library Committee. As regards the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff, I know that on quite a number of occasions they have been rather hard pushed, because they have had sickness in their ranks, and it has not been easy on occasions to get men who were competent to sit down at the table at a moment's notice, and do the work in an efficient manner. We are endeavouring to see that arrangements will be made, at any rate before the opening of another session, which will enable some relief to be given to the members of the staff in the event of such long sittings occurring again. I thank honorable senators for their courtesy and consideration, and wish them the compliments of the season. </para>
