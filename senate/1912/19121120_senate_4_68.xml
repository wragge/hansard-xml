          <para>That the Senate places upon recordits appreciation of the great public services of the late Justice of the High Court of Australia, the Honorable R. E.

        <para class="block">I am surethat honorable senators, especially those who had experience in connexion with the early history of the Commonwealth, must admit that great praise was due to the late Honorable <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> R. E. O&#39;Connor for the admirable work he did so far as Federation was concerned. He was a Federalist from the beginning. He was also a member of the Federal Convention, and took a prominent part in the framing of the Constitution. He was a member of the first Federal Parliament, and a distinguished member of the first Federal Government. We all realize that the country has suffered agreat loss by the death of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. JusticeO&#39;Connor,</inline> and although no man or woman in the Commonwealth may have the same feelings of grief as the wife, the family, and the intimate &#34;friends of the deceased gentleman yet every man and woman in Australia must regret the passing away of so eminent a citizen. The influence of his work &#34;in connexion with the framing of the Constitution has been, and will continue &#34;to be, felt, and every one who was associated with him here in the early days of -this Parliament could not but recognise his gentleness, his ability, and his greatness as a statesman. Therefore, we all deeply deplore the great loss which the Commonwealth has sustained, and sympathize sincerely with those who feel the bereavement most. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator MILLEN</inline>(New South Wales)  X3.5&#93;.  - By the motion which the VicePresident of the Executive Council has submitted, and which I desire to second, the Senate will place on record its great appreciation of the public work and the personal worth of  a  distinguished citizen, rand also mark its sense of the national loss ^occasioned by his untimely death. The late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O&#39;Connor</inline> was one whose per.sonal acquaintance most of us here could  Claim,  and in claiming it, I think that we laid claim to that which we regarded as a privilege indeed. We can look back  to  the time when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O&#39;Connor</inline> served his country  in  very many capacities, but no -matter how varied were the demands which were made upon him1, his work was always marked by unselfish loyalty and unostentatious singleness of purpose. These qualities were particularly manifested in the early days of the Federal movement. Before  it  stirred anything more than the most languid interest in the public mind, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr</inline> O&#39;Connor was devoting himself with more than missionary zeal &#34;towards the consummation of Australian Union, and he continued his magnificent record in season and out of season until he was able, as he was rightly en- - titled to do, to share in the rich harvest which he had done so much to promote. We in this Chamber will probably remember him more closely, and I venture  to  say more affectionately, by reason of the intercourse which many of us were able to enjoy when he was called upon to lead -it, and to lead it at  a  time of particular -difficulty and trial. It is, I venture to say, quite enough on that point if I mention that his leadership, though never .=pen was, as occasion required it, always :felt. Perhaps no greater tribute could be -desired or tendered than the  fact  which was admitted then, and which I re-state to-day, that his departure from this Chamber stirred as much regret both on public and personal grounds in the hearts and minds of his political opponents as it did in the hearts and minds of his political friends.  His  great ability, his high character, his lofty sense of public duty, his sensitive regard for the best traditions of public life - these qualities, added to the personal charm of a manly and generous disposition, enabled the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O&#39;Connor</inline> to win a high place in the roll of Australian public men, as I feel sure he has won an enduring place in the hearts and the memories of his countrymen. </para>

          <para>.- As one who, during the term of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor&#39;s</inline> office, was perhaps brought more closely into association with him politically than any member of the Senate today, I may be permitted to add a few words. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>When I first entered political life, as the youngest member of this Parliament, from the very outset it was my unique privilege and honour to be brought into an association of political intimacy and confidence with that honorable gentleman that endured until the day he departed from the Senate. To all those who knew him, it must be evident that such an association as that would beget, and must have engendered in me, apart altogether from any political relationships, a personal feeling of affection, esteem, loyalty, and confidence that has deepened, if possible, with every day that has since passed. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O&#39;Connor</inline>was the first leader of the Senate, and those who were members of the Chamber then realized, as perhaps no others do, how difficult was the task intrusted to him. The Senate was then, as it were, feeling its feet as an integral part of the Government under our new Constitution. Honorable senators were just becoming personally known one to the other. The States themselves, through their representatives, were beginning to become acquainted in the new work on which they were entering in a cooperative spirit, and it required tact, ability, wide experience, profound knowledge, thoughtfulness, courtesy, and many other qualities to enable anybody to successfully lead a Chamber constituted as this then was. But, throughout, I think on all occasions, to all persons, and in all circumstances, the then leader of the Senate ever manifested gentleness, courtesy, tactfulness, firmness, and purposefulness, and he was able, through the manifestation and exercise of these qualities on all occasions, to achieve very much of the programme that had been laid down for him by himself and his colleagues in connexion with the development of Australia. </para>
        <para>It is quite true, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> said, that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O&#39;Connor</inline> left the Senate with the regret of, not only his political friends, but also those who, in the circumstances of politics, had been thrown into conflict with him. He left these halls, I venture to say, with the regret of many outside the Senate, and even outside the other Chamber - of many under this roof with whom he came into daily contact - and it is not too much to say that, when he did leave, there were many in whose breasts was surging the sentiment, if it were not expressed, that he was a man who, take him for all in all, we should not look upon his like again. So far as concerns his qualities, as manifested in the Senate, those who knew him best well know that he brought those qualities to play, and manifested those attributes in every relation of his life. And knowing that, we realize what a severe blow his removal must have been to his wife and his family, with whom we are now sympathizing. The Senate he left a distinct loser by his departure ; the High Court he ornamented, and he was an acquisition to Australia in his capacity as a Judge in that high and important tribunal. We personally were the losers; the Commonwealth itself was not the loser when he was transferred from this to another sphere of activity ; but, as we were the losers then, the Commonwealth, as a whole, is .a loser now by his departure; and it is not too much to say that Australia will be indeed fortunate if Providence in its wisdom sends her many sons of the stamp of R. E. O&#39;Connor, who will serve as dutifully, as faithfully, as single-mindedly, and as unselfishly as he did the country of his birth. </para>

          <para>-  With every word that has been uttered by previous speakers I thoroughly coincide. I may mention that, in the absence of Senators Symon and Fraser, I am the only representative here of the Federal Convention which met in Sydney, Adelaide, and Melbourne It may, perhaps, not be known to many honorable senators that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O&#39;Connor,</inline> in conjunction with <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Downer, was one of the three gentlemen who drafted the proposals in the Convention which led to the opening debate. That was a compliment deservedly paid to their legal knowledge. But, irrespective of that, those who had the privilege of enjoying a close intimacy with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O&#39;Connor</inline> know that he was one of the most perfect&#39; examples of a gentleman that the world has seen. I join with others in expressing deep sympathy with the widow and the family of my old friend. </para>

          <para>. - I should not like this motion to pass without saying a fewwords to express my personal sympathy.; There were several, especially on this side of the Chamber, who entered Parliament when the first Senate of the Commonwealth&#39; assembled. They will remember that, although we did not all agree with the deceased&#39; gentleman politically, he was one of those who took a keen interest in the young members of Parliament. My honorable friends will remember how frequently he invited us to meet him in the Ministerial room, at the back of the chamber, and how, without any ostentation or assumption of superiority, he would give us the benefit of his ripe experience and his advice. I know that I felt the benefit of that experience and that advice, and I venture tosay that there are other of the younger senators, who entered their first Parliament on that occasion, who, like myself, benefited. It was an instance of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O&#39;Connor&#39;s</inline> generous nature and wide sympathy that he was, amidst all the stirring party conflicts of those days, able to give that advice and experience to those of us who were younger and in need of guidance. It is because of that that I have somewhat broken the rule usually observed where another Minister has submitted a motion, to place on record my appreciation of the personal assistance and benefit which. I derived from the gentleman who is now gone from us. </para>

            <para>- I desire to ask the Minister of Defence whether it is true that Charles Melville MacNaughten, adjutant of the 25th Battalion, appeared as a solicitor at the Central Police Court, Sydney, on Friday, 15th November, and conducted the prosecution of a number of cadets, who were fined various amounts, with 21s. professional costs? Did this officer who was appearing as a solicitor receive those costs, and, if so, was he justified in so doing? </para>

              <para>- This matter has already come under my notice, and I have given instructions that an inquiry shall be made. Some time ago I issued an instruction, which was circulated throughout the Commonwealth, that no solicitors were to be employed without Ministerial authority in any cases of prosecutions against cadets. As I have said, I am causing inquiries to be made as to how it was in these cases that a solicitor was engaged, and why costs&#39; were debited against the cadets. I will let the honorable senator know the result of the inquiries as soon as information is to hand. I will also inform him as to the action I propose to take. </para>

The desire of this deputation representing the press of each State was. that urgent press messages should be transmitted at double the ordinary press rates.

        <para class="block">Clause 193 defines the surveyors referred to in clauses 191 and 192. It relates to surveyors who carry out any surveys for any business or commercial purposes ; that is to say, marine surveyors in private practice for insurance purposes as distinct from official surveyors. The clause has evidently crept into the Bill by inadvertence. There is no desire on the part of the Government to interfere with these particular surveyors. We therefore propose to eliminate the clause. </para>

          <para>. - Is it the intention of the Government, by this Bill, to take away the rights that are at present enjoyed by marine and engineer surveyors ? At the present time, these men are licensed by the various State Governments. As far as I can make out, the omission of the clause means taking away their livelihood ; or, at all events, it leaves it absolutely open for the insurance companies to engage any person they choose to give a certificate. Take such a case as has arisen at the Wonga Shoal. That is not a matter for a Government inspector. It does not become a matter for Government inspection until the ship in question is prepared to go to sea. But for the purposes of the survey of the ship to furnish information to the Court, an inspection would, in the ordinary course of things, be made by a private surveyor, whose certificate would be accepted by the Court. I take it that the purpose of omitting this clause is to abolish the certificates of these private surveyors. </para>

            <para>- I admit that certain clauses dealing with surveyors have been postponed. Under one of the postponed clauses, any man who has held a surveyor&#39;s certificate for three years is entitled to a certificate under this measure. But those clauses having been postponed, we do not know what will happen to them when they come up for consideration again. I am rather inclined to think that the Minister would be well advised if he postponed this clause along with the others, because it is connected with them. To abolish the certificates of these surveyors would be an injustice. We do not want to take away rights which any one has previously enjoyed.; and if we omit this clause, I take it that the effect will be to take away rights which at present exist. </para>

          <para>. - If I were to agree to the postponement of this clause I should be creating in the minds of honorable senators the very impression that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> seems to think that we intend to create by omitting the clause. We do not propose to deal with licensed surveyors at all. We propose to eliminate everything in the Bill that affects them. These surveyors are licensed to-day under various State Acts, just as are dentists, land surveyors, and other people. Questions of insurance, purchase, compensation, and other matters will be dealt with by State Courts and under State laws. These surveyors are recognised by the laws of the States under which they are called in to assess damages or to give opinions. It is entirely unnecessary that we should deal with them. The only surveyors with whom this Bill is concerned are surveyors for the purposes of the measure, and they are dealt with under clauses which have been postponed. This clause does not deal with them. It deals with an entirely different class. Licensed surveyors have no duties whatever imposed upon them under the Bill. As I said in my opening remarks, the clause evidently crept into the Bill inadvertently. Possibly it was copied from some State Act, together with other clauses dealing with surveyors. It ought not to have been here, and there is no object in retaining it. There is no ground for its postponement. To postpone it would be to admit that there is some connexion between these licensed surveyors and surveyors for the purposes of the Bill, which are dealt with in the postponed clauses. The Bill does not affect the licensed surveyors in any way. The State legislation dealing with them remains, their powers and usefulness will remain as before, and as there is no object to be served by postponing the clause, I ask the Committee to accept the amendment. </para>

            <para>-  The clause as it left the Senate contained certain restrictionswhich are not contained in the clause as amended in another place. It was because of those restrictions that it was necessary in the clause as passed by the Senate to include the provision referred to safeguarding the interests of State surveyors. As the new clause submitted by the House of Representatives does not contain the restrictions referred to, the provision safeguarding the interests of State surveyors has become unnecessary. </para>

        <para class="block">Clause  196  required steam-ships over five years old to be surveyed once every six months. As no Imperial certificates are issued half-yearly provision was made in clause 208 for the acceptance of certain certificates issued by approved associations as equivalent to our official survey. The House of &#39; Representatives has amended clause 196, so that surveys are required only every twelve months. There is consequently now no necessity for part of the special exemption provided for in clause 208. It is considered desirable to limit its exemption to cargo ships only as Imperial official certificates are issued annually for passenger vessels. If the Committee agree to the amendment of the House of Representatives, as made in clause 196, it will become imperative as consequential upon that, and as really part of it, that clause 208 should be amended by the insertion of the words referred to in my motion, because it is desired to limit the exemption in clause 208 to cargo ships only, since Imperial official certificates are issued annually in the case of passenger vessels. This is a consequential amendment which was overlooked by the House of Representatives when clause 196 was amended. As the two clauses deal practically with the one subject, I think it is competent for the Committee to make the consequential amendment in clause 208 in the way I propose. If there is any question as to the competency of the Committee to deal with the matter in this way, I prefer that it should be raised now, before I deal with the merits of the amendment made by the House of Representatives. </para>

            <para>- This clause has been the subject of much discussion in the Senate, in the press, and in correspondence with the Board of Trade. The latter body raised strong objections to the requirement that a vessel over five years old should be surveyed once every six months. Upon careful inquiry, the Government have been convinced that in ordinary circumstances there is no necessity for more than an annual survey thoroughly carried out A good overhaul once a year is better than a perfunctory survey once every six months. It does not follow that every ship surveyed under the clause will get a certificate for twelve months. The duration of the certificate will depend upon what the survey discloses, the trade in which the vessel is engaged, and the cargo she carries. For instance, if a ship has frequently to pass over a sandy bar, or is trading in rough waters, or carrying cumbersome cargo likely to move about in her hold, the certificate may be granted for any period less than twelve months before a re-survey. Again, if any circumstance arises which indicates the necessity for an additional survey, even though a ship is given a certificate for twelve months, the Minister may, before the expiry of that time, order a fresh survey. Clause 208 provides <inline font-style="italic">inter alia</inline> that a steam-ship in respect of which a prescribed classification certificate granted by any corporation or association for the survey and registry of ships, approved by the GovernorGeneral, has been issued, shall, whilst that certificate remains in force, butsubject to the provisions of sub-sections 3 to 5 of clause 208, be exempt from survey under the Act. The effect of this provision is practically to provide that ships surveyed annually at Lloyd&#39;s and other ap proved associations shall not be subject to the Government survey. This will exempt probably from 80 to 90 per cent, of British and Australian shipping trading to our ports. To give an idea of the proportion of shipping, British and  foreign, classified under Lloyd&#39;s, the British Association and the Bureau Veritas, two associations of practically equal merit, it may be mentioned that, in 1911, 772 vessels of an aggregate tonnage of 1,883,884 tons were built in the United Kingdom for British and foreign owners, and of these no fewer than 547, of an aggregate tonnage of I,250,753 <inline font-style="italic">tons,</inline> were built under the inspection of Lloyd&#39;s surveyors with a view to classification and registry. </para>

If we insisted upon a survey every six months of unclassified ships over five years old, all that respective owners would have to do would be to take out a Lloyd&#39;s certificate and so obtain exemption. The reason for the amendment I have proposed is that there is no necessity for the whole of the special exemption provided for in clause  208.  It is proposed to limit it to cargo ships only, as Imperial certificates are issued annually for passenger vessels. I trust the Committee will accept the amendment made by the House of Representatives, as, in the opinion of the Government, it meets all requirements and fully safeguards the interests of those who go down to the sea in ships. </para>

            <para>- Yes. For the safety of the travelling public, vessels should be surveyed every six months. Such a provision has been in operationin New South Wales for many years, and it has: not caused that anxiety, trouble, and inconvenience to ship-owners which we wereled to believe it would. It has beenproved there, on inquiry, that six monthswas much too long for a great number of the vessels&#39; trading on the coast of that. State to go without a survey. I have knownvessels travelling over the bar harbors tohave their bottoms worn out in less thansix months. Even while a vessel was lyings in dock awaiting inspection the donkeyboiler blew out, and a man was scalded todeath ; and I proved to the satisfaction of a coroner&#39;s jury that laxity of survey wasthe cause of the accident which led tohis death, so much so that the companywhich owned the vessel immediatelysought to make terms with the widowrather than allow her to take a case intoCourt. Evidence taken by the NavigationCommission shows that there were vesselsin Sydney Harbor undergoing a six months&#39; survey which were absolutely unfit to* carry passengers. There was a timet when I thought it was unsafe to travel in that harbor on a number of these vessels.

        <para class="block">The Minister has stated that the Government have made careful inquiries as to why these certificates should be extended from six to twelve months. They could not have made many inquiries or considered the evidence given before the Navigation Commission or they would not have thought of recommending the adoption of this amendment. This is one of the clauses which the Senate put in the Bill to safeguard the lives of passengers and crew, who might not know the risk they were running by going to sea in a vessel with weak parts, both above and below water. Now that we are getting steel vessels of a much lighter build this clause is much more necessary than ever it was, and I trust that the Committee, in its good sense, will adhere to it. </para>

          <para>.-!-No question occupied the attention of the Navigation Commission more closely than did this survey question, and it has occupied the close attention of the Government since their report was submitted. In Australia, for the last thirty years, we have had a half-yearly survey of ships, both passenger and cargo. </para>

            <para>- It was only in 1908 that New South Wales extended the period for a survey from six to twelve months for the reason that the ship-builders and repairers in that State found that the work was going to Victoria. Great Britain has legislated for an inspection, but not for a survey of a ship carrying less than twelve passengers. Do not &#34;honorable senators think that the lives of the- two men who were lost by the destruction of the lighthouse near Adelaide were not just as valuable as the lives of any passengers who ever sailed salt water ? ls not the life of Jimmy Ducks on board a ship of as much value to the community as that of a lord or a duke who is travelling as a passenger ? </para>

          <para>Over-insurance of vessels is not exclusively .1 private matter between insurers and insured. There are other parties affected whose interests are not protected, and whose lives may be endangered, viz., the members of vessels&#39; crews. Where a vessel is over-insured, one of the most powerful incentives for keeping her in good condition and seaworthiness is removed, and overinsurance also offers a dangerous temptation to persons and the agents of persons who may gain by the loss of vessels. Whether lost through negligence, unseaworthiness, or  foul  play, the lives of the crews are imperilled.

There has been considerable correspondence between the Board of Trade and the Commonwealth Government on this matter. The first communication was in November, 1907. Clause 225 of the Bill of 1907 laid down a special rule for ships loading coal, and the Board of Trade considered that- </para>

        <quote>
          <para>As a matter of fact, where a vessel has a certificate granted in England, such ship would not be required, unless under very peculiar circumstances, to be re-surveyed, and the current certificate would be accepted, as a matter of course. There is not the slightest idea of ignoring a Board of Trade certificate - quite the contrary. But the case is easily conceivable where, although a ship might have a. certificate, yet from occurrences subsequent to its issue there would be good reason to suppose that her equipment or machinery was not in the same condition as when the certificate was issued. In such case power must be given to re-survey in the public interests. However, there would be no objection to meeting the wishes of the Board of Trade to this extent :  - </para>
          <para class="block">The following words or equivalent to be inserted at the commencement of the section :  - &#34; In every case where a certificate has been granted to any steam-ship by the Board of Trade of the United Kingdom, and remains still in force, it shall not be requisite that she shall again be surveyed under this Act; and in cases where the Minister is satisfied, in regard to any British steam-ship not registered in Australia, or any foreign steam-ship, that the requirements of this Act have been substantially complied with, he may - <inline font-style="italic">&#34; (a)</inline> Dispense with any further survey of the steam-ship ; and &#34; <inline font-style="italic">(b)</inline> givea certificate which shall have the same effect as if given upon survey under this Act. &#34; Provided that the Governor-General may direct that this section shall not apply in cases where it appears to him that reciprocal treatment is not given to steam-ships registered in Australia. &#34; (2) Any person authorized in writing by the Minister may, at any time, inspect any British or foreign steam-ship, a survey of which has been dispensed with under this section, and shall report to the Minister the result of his inspection: &#34; (3) The Minister may, upon such report, suspend the operation of any certificate issued or given in respect of the steamship. &#34; (4) Upon each suspension the ship shall become liable to survey.&#34; </para>

          <para>The proposal to accept classification certificates under this clause will, it is hoped, enable a satisfactory arrangement to be made as regards the principal point at issue in connexion with the survey of steamers, but as classification certificates as such are not officially recognised by the Board of Trade, the wording of subclause (1) of the clause appeared open to objection, and the Board of Trade therefore proposed two alternative methods of amendment. One of these was to specify in the Act the names of the classification societies whose certificates might be accepted. A precedent for this will be found in section 33 of the New South Wales Navigation Act of 1901, as amended by the Act of 1908. The second alternative was to embody in the clause an amendment providing for the exemption from survey of steamers in respect of which certificates had been issued by classification societies approved by the Commonwealth Government. Power could also be taken to prescribe the conditions of exemption in such cases. If this proposal were adopted, the arrangement would be similar to that in force in the Dominion of Canada. The Board of Trade would be happy to advise the Commonwealth Government as to the classification societies which might be approved for the purpose of the clause. </para>
          <para>In view of the urgency and importance of the matter, the foregoing suggestions were communicated to the Governor-General by cable from the Secretary of State. </para>
          <para>A subsidiary question relating to this clause remains to be dealt with. This question is as follows :  - It is observed that the exemptions allowed under sub-clause (1) of this clause are subject to the provisions of sub-clauses (2)-(5), but it is not quite clear how the provisions of sub-clause (2) can be applied to the cases dealt with under sub-clause (1). </para>
          <para>It is understood that vessels holding certificates of the kind mentioned in sub-clause (1) will be, <inline font-style="italic">ipso facto,</inline> exempt from survey, subject to the power of the Minister to order an inspection under sub-clause (3) in special cases. </para>
          <para>The purpose of sub-clause (2) seems to be to provide additional powers of exemption, exercisable in cases which cannot be dealt with under sub-clause (i). These two sub-clauses, therefore, seem to be parallel and independent, and the subordination of sub-clause (1) to sub-clause (2) expressed in the clause is possibly due to an error in drafting. </para>
          <para>The point could be dealt with by substituting the words &#34; provisions of sub-sections (3) to (5) &#34; for the  words  &#34; succeeding provisions.&#34; </para>
        </quote>
        <para>The suggestion was accepted and embodied in the Bill of 1908 by the omission of sub-clause 2 of clause 220. The Deakin Government again on the 28th October, 1-908, recommended to Parliament a modification. The whole position regarding the matter is this: Australia in the past has been in advance of Imperial legislation. Honorable senators a few days ago, by their votes, considered that it was not necessary to improve on Imperial legislation in a matter which involved the penalizing of seamen. I ask the Committee now to improve on Imperial legislation, to provide effectively for the safety of seamen, and to adopt the legislation which has previously existed in Australia. </para>

            <para>- I know that it is so, and if necessary I can quote the Act. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> that we can safely say that vessels under five years of age trading Inter-State may -be exempt from the half-yearly survey. It will be sufficient to survey them every year. What will happen under this Bill will be this : There will be a surveyor-general stationed at head-quarters. He will have a staff in each of the States with whom&#39; he will be in direct communication. When a vessel comes into the port of Melbourne he can order that part of her machinery shall be examined. When she touches at Adelaide another part of her machinery can be examined. If she then goes to Fremantle, the examination of the machinery can be finished. On the return trip, as she calls at various ports, her boilers can be examined, and so much of her hull as is above water. But it will not be possible to inspect her bottom or her tail shaft. It is unfortunate that the greatest number of accidents we have had at sea have occurred through mishaps to the tail shaft. </para>

            <para>- There is no dock at Fremantle or Adelaide. There is not much danger in the case of ships under five years of age, and I am prepared to agree to a twelve months&#39; survey for them. But for all other ships, we should require a six months&#39; survey. I believe that the Board of Trade will give way, as far as Australian vessels are concerned. Whether they will be prepared to give way as to ships coming from abroad I do not know. </para>

            <para>- Does the honorable senator think that it is a fair thing that the local ship-owner should be placed at a disadvantage in competition with a ship belonging to an owner domiciled outside Australia, which will be able to come here and compete with our vessels? I am now asking that every ship that comes into the Australian trade should be subjected to exactly the same conditions as apply to Australian ships. That is a fair proposition. I do not think that we have power to deal with a ship that merely comes here, discharges her cargo, and leaves again, unless there is something radically wrong with her to cause a survey to be necessary. I do not think that we can enter upon a ship that has a certificate from Germany, France, or any other foreign country. We have to accept such a certificate in good faith, as long as other countries accept ours. I hope honorable senators will realize that it does not matter how few may be the passengers that a ship carries. We have a right to protect them, and we also have an absolute right to protect the crew of a ship that carries no passengers at all. </para>

          <para>- - I have been endeavouring to ascertain the merits of the proposal now before the Committee, but I am a little bit fogged as to which way the judgment of honorable senators ought to go. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie,</inline> I am sure, will accept my assurance that I am as desirous as he is that the safety of human life should be regarded as the primary consideration. But, whilst putting that as our starting point in this matter, there ought not to be any unnecessary attempt to interfere with shipping in respect to surveys. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> has made some quotations from an Imperial document which conveyed to me an entirely different impression from that which they evidently made on his mind. I presume that he made the quotations in order to show that if there had been new surveys on the vessels to which he alluded the fatalities would not have occurred. I want to show that the question of survey had nothing to do with them. In one case mentioned the vessel was not twelve months old. It was built and lost within a year. </para>

            <para>- I say, with the greatest surprise and regret, that, reading these reports, one is compelled to come to the conclusion that in these cases there were deliberate attempts made to lose the vessels referred to. There is another case mentioned of a vessel to which it is said an accident happened. The evidence as to what it was is entirely conflicting. &#34;The suggestion of the captain was that she had struck a rock, but the Court said that it could find no evidence of that, and a suggestion was made that some explosion took place which blew a hole in the bottom of the vessel. No survey by Lloyd&#39;s could meet a case of that kind. </para>

          <para>. - The discussion has proceeded rather upon the merits of a six-months&#39; survey as against a twelvemonths&#39; survey, but, unfortunately, we are not in a position to consider the question from that point of view. In clause208 we recognise two things. A certificate of survey granted by. the Board of Trade, which is for twelve months, or a prescribed classification certificate, granted by any corporation or association for the survey and registry of ships approved by the GovernorGeneral. We provide that, in the case of a steam-ship in respect of which any of these certificates have been issued, the certificate shall remain in force for not less than twelve months, subject only to the provisions of sub-clauses 3 and 5 of clause 208, which give the Minister power to send an inspector to report as to whether it is necessary in any case to re-survey a ship. What I wish the Committee to realize is that clause 208 applied to Australian registered, British, and foreign ships. If we make provision in clause196 for a sixmonths survey, all that we shall do will be to give the owner of an Australian registered ship two options. He will be able to obtain his certificate of survey for six months under that clause, or a certificate from Lloyd&#39;s surveyor in Australia under paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> of sub-clause 1 of clause 208. I suppose that it will be admitted that the Governor-General will recognise Lloyd&#39;s certificates ? </para>

            <para>- They are recognised the world over, and it is not likely that the Commonwealth Government will refuse recognition of Lloyd&#39;s or any other reputable association. At any rate, it is a reasonable assumption that Lloyd&#39;s will be recognised. If we reject the amendment of the House of Representatives, a shipowner will not be compelled to have his ships surveyed every six months, as he may go to a Lloyd&#39;s surveyor in Australia and get certificates which will exempt his vessels from survey for twelve months. </para>

            <para>- They do not differ on this point. The honorable senator may read clause 208 for himself, and he will be unable to put any other interpretation upon it. If the Governor-General in Council approves of any of these associations, their certificates will be recognised for the term for which they are issued, and that term is twelve months. We might provide for a three-months&#39; survey under clause 196, but, under clause 208, a shipowner would be able to secure a certificate for twelve months. </para>

            <para>- The Government would have to decide whether it would be wise to accept the certificates of such an association if it were formed. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie&#39;s</inline> long speech, intended to show the advantage of a six-months&#39; survey as against a twelve-months&#39; survey, was quite beside the question, because if we provide for a six-months&#39; survey under clause 196, we shall only compel ship-owners to have recourse to the provisions of clause 208. So far as ships trading between New Zealand and Australia are concerned, it is obvious that they would never register in Australia at all, but in New Zealand, in order to get the advantage of the twelve-months&#39; survey. The consequence would be that, not only would the survey be carried out there, but all repairs recommended as the result of the survey would also be carried out there. That was what the New South WalesGovernment found out when they made provision for a six-months&#39; survey, and notwithstanding <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie&#39;s</inline> statement, Victoria had made provision for a twelve-months&#39; survey. Shipping companies that had registered their vessels in New South Wales registered them in Victoria, and surveys and repairs were carried out in Victoria. The result of that experience was that the New South Wales Government reverted to the twelve-months&#39; survey. We have agreed to clause 208, and I am asking honorable senators now only to bring it into conformity with clause 196. I should like to refer to some very rash statements which have been made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie.</inline> He said that the <inline font-style="italic">Papanui</inline> could not have been detained under this Bill, but I point out that under clause 213, it is provided that - </para>

That statement has been exploded, and the honorable senator has admitted that it was the rule only in South Australia. The honorable senator also said that vessels would obtain certificates that were not entitled to them. Apparently the inference was that vessels that could not obtain certificates in Great Britain would come here, and obtain certificates under clause 208. </para>

            <para>- No; we are not bound to accept it. We are bound to accept a Board of Trade certificate under paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> of sub-clause 1 of clause 208; but under paragraph * power is given to the Governor-General in Council to recognise the certificates of certain associations. My statement is that one association that will be recognised is Lloyd&#39;s. They have their surveyors in Australia. They issue certificates for twelve months, and it is reasonable to assume that the Governor-General in Council will recognise Lloyd&#39;s certificates. There are two classes of certificates, with a twelve-months&#39; currency, provided for under clause 208. As regards the New Zealand trade, if the amendment be not agreed to, it is clear that vessels engaged in that trade will in future be registered, surveyed, and repaired in New Zealand. The Committee will accomplish nothing by&#39; rejecting the amendment, and I ask honorable senators to accept it in order to bring clause 196 into conformity with clause 208. </para>

          <para>- The  provision* for a six months&#39; survey in New SouthWales was altered because vested interests, desired to have an annual survey all over. Australia. It was considered that one State or one shipping company should not get an advantage over another in the matter of survey, but that does not prove that the provision for an annual survey was right. In their report, the Navigation Commission did not say that it was right; on the contrary, they said that it was wrong. Now the registration of a ship by Lloyd&#39;s need not be recognised. No vessel can goto sea hereafter unless she has a certificateunder our Navigation Act. I do not intendto say very much, because the decision is. a foregone conclusion, but I shall continueto raise my voice in favour of what I think, is right and proper for the benefit of pas~sengers. Twelve months is absolutely toolong to allow boats and haulage gear togo without a survey. There was evidence given before the Navigation Commission by an expert that the boats of a vessel ha  ti  not been shifted out of the chocks for twelve months, and that when they were put over the side, they sank. As regards; the gear which is necessary for the saving of life at sea, twelve months is, I repeat, too long a period to pass without an inspection being made. On this subject, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Travers,</inline> a practical shipwright, gave, this evidence - </para>

          <para>There is another matter which seems to be of very great importance, viz., the life-saving apparatus, which, unless it receives special attention, all the survey in the world would beutterly useless without it. Possibly a vessel would go to sea quite seaworthy, and through* bad weather spring a leak and founder ; the.  only means of saving lives would be to take tothe boats. In many cases the boats them selvesare perfectly watertight and seaworthy, but theappliances for getting these boats into the water are often in a very bad and serious condition. I remember being at work here about nine years, ago on the A. U.S.N. Company&#39;s steam-ship-  <inline font-style="italic">Rockton.</inline> I was engaged to put a piece of belt- - ing amidships, about 30 or 40 feet long,  which necessitated  using the davits and tackle falls... We had to get the boat overboard. After getting.  her over the side she sunk. It took about two&#171; or three hours to get her out. I do not  think she  had been out for years before. The tackle falls were all swelled in the blocks; the boat.-., absolutely stuck to the chocks. Our contention , is that no matter how sound the boat may be, . unless there is a regular inspection of the gear- to get the boat out, that a serious accident may  arise at any time. This is one matter which came under my own notice, although I haveheard of a good many. I must say (hat sincethe passing of this Act in I 90I the system of &#39; survey here is very much more rigid than itwas. I am not here to find fault with it. I.&#39; believe it has been improved fully 75 per cent, on what it was before; still, I think there is room for much improvement. </para>

        <para class="block">That evidence was given by a practical man concerning a vessel, which is running on the coast to-day. In my opinion, six months is a short enough period for a vessel to.be inspected by a practical and competent surveyor. I have given instances of vessels running in Sydney Harbor, which, before the end of six months, were not safe. I believe that an injustice is being done by providing for a yearly survey. I do not say that New South Wales was right in 1908 when it reverted to a twelve months&#39; survey, but it simply brought its law into line with that of other States. The ship-owners said, and the secretary to the Ship-owners&#39; Association gave evidence, that it was desirable to have a half-yearly survey. So far as clause 208 is concerned, it will not be necessary for the Minister or the Governor-General to accept a certificate from any association unless he thinks fit. </para>

            <para>- The Conference was held for the purpose of coming to a common understanding as to what shape the navigation laws should take for the selfgoverning Dominions as well as for the British Empire, and it unanimously suggested that the Board of Trade should issue a certificate to every steam-ship whether it carried passengers or not. If, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> says, the Board of Trade has not adopted the suggestion, it leaves the ground open to serious objection. Suppose that a ship did arrive here from the Old Country carrying twelve passengers, or less, and having no certificate. There is ample power reserved to the Minister, I understand, to cause an inspection of the vessel, and if she is found to be not in a seaworthy condition, he can deal with her otherwise. </para>

            <para>- Having regard to* the improvement in steam machinery generally, it seems anomalous to stand by a. practice which was in vogue when the steam; pressure on ships was no more than 60 or 80 lbs. to the square inch. To-day, thereare steamers on this coast pressed up to 80 and 100 lbs. Indeed, some steamers are pressed up to 180, some to 200 lbs., and*, some, I believe, even beyond that. It. ought to be plain enough to the ordinary understanding that a practice which wasquite good enough when steel plates were.not subject to steam pressure to the extraordinary extent to which they are to-day is altogether inadequate now. At thesame time, since  the shipping companies can have their ships inspected! and surveyed by other means, whichmay only provide for annual certificates, I do not see that any good will be.served by insisting upon Australianownedor registered ships submitting to a bi-annual)-, survey. It is with much reluctance that Iagree to the clause as it stands, because I: think it is about time that we did away with a practice which was introduced whenthe knowledge of machinery was not quiteso extensive as it is to-day. Since shipowners can get their steamers classed and inspected by Lloyd&#39;s, and need not comply with a provision for a half-yearly surveyas proposed, I accept the proposal very unwillingly. </para>

            <para>- I think that twelve months is too long for a vessel to go without a survey. Irrespective of where a vessel comes from or is registered, it -carries a crew if it does not carry a passenger. I have had some experience in connexion with the building of vessels. I contend that a survey ought to include everything on a ship, from the keel to the truck - every rope, every block and tackle, every bucket, ought to be included. I think it would be wise to restore the original provision passed by the Senate. </para>

            <para>- Some of the experts say that it does not. It is necessary, for instance, that every fire-bucket should be an good order and kept filled in a handy place, so as to be available in case of emergency. Will any one say that the boats are not the most essential part of the equipment of the ship, even though she does not carry a single passenger? Are the lives of the crew to be regarded as of no consequence? . Is not life-saving apparatus to  be supplied to them ? Should not every ship be compelled to carry a certain proportion of boats according to the number of souls on board? It is necessary, therefore, that the boats should be efficiently surveyed. I have heard to-day the most extraordinary argument in favour of the amendment which has ever been adduced by a .member of a progressive party - an argument which would justify any villanous legislation if heed were given to it. That argument is that, because something may be done somewhere else, we here in Australia, having the power to order our own household in our own way, should not do the right thing for fear of forcing shipowners to go elsewhere. I have heard that argument put forward by members of Tory parties in other Legislatures in favour of the most reactionary legislation. I have heard it used as an argument against antisweating legislation. It was said that if such legislation were passed, manufacturers would go to other States, where they would be able to sweat their workpeople as they liked, and to manufacture under their own conditions. That is the argument now put forward by those who are in favour of retaining the House of Representatives&#39; amendment. </para>

            <para>- They are. The argument is, that because something is done elsewhere we should not do the right thing here. We have not the power to regulate the households of other countries, but we have the power to regulate our own affairs. We have only to consider what is the right thing to do, and should proceed to do it, though the heavens fall. It has been contended by the Minister that because one clause in the Bill provides for a certain, thing in one way, and another clause is not consistent with it, we should make the two provisions consistent. It is held by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> and others, who know a great deal more about this matter than I do, that the clause under consideration, unamended, adopts the right course. Instead of altering the clause, then, as suggested, other clauses should be altered. We should refuse to do the wrong thing merely for the sake of keeping something else in countenance. </para>

We do not want to lay down the. law for them, but we do want to legislate for shipping affecting Australian interests. We have a very great interest even as regards ships that carry no passengers. We have an interest, in the enormous cargoes that leave Australia, and an interest in Australian citizens who may be on board those ships as members of the crew. Is it too much to expect that such vessels shall be surveyed once in six months? It is a well-known fact that almost every steamer trading on the Australian coast is docked at least once . in six months. She has to be put in dock for a general overhaul. Would it involve a great deal of extra expense to have an additional survey officially made? </para>

          <para>. - There seems to be some misunderstanding regarding the difference between inspection and survey. An inspection is made by an inspector, who reports to the Minister. But a survey is a compulsory examination of a ship, including every bit of her equipment. While <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> was speaking some honorable senators interjected that a survey did not include the inspection of ropes, sidelights, and everything else laid down as part of a ship&#39;s equipment. As a matter of fact, all such things have to be surveyed, and the surveyor has to make a statutory declaration that he has examined them. </para>

            <para>- They are not correct. An inspection and a survey are two different things. An inspection can take place at any time. An inspector can go on board a ship and say that certain things ought to be done. The master need not comply unless he likes. But when a survey takes place, every rocket, every sidelight, every fog-horn that a ship is compelled to carry has to be produced, and the surveyor has to make a statutory declaration that all the equipment is in good order. No sworn declaration is made regarding an inspection. Under the Victorian Act there was a penalty on any person who issued a certificate of survey if he was not appointed by the Marine Board. The surveyor under that measure did not receive a single penny for his work. The principal things to be looked to when a survey takes place are the ship&#39;s bottom, her stern-bush, and her propeller, which cannot be surveyed unless she is docked. It has been said that the Victorian Act did not provide for a six months&#39; survey. I say that it did provide for a survey of all non-condensing engine steamers every six months. </para>

I know that the Board of Trade have put up a strong fight regarding this matter. Great Britain has not come up to line with Canada and Australia, but the time has arrived when an endeavour ought to be made to bring the Board of Trade up to our standard in the matter. I am not going to fight any longer about it. </para>

        <para>This clause is redundant, as, if a vessel&#39;s certificate has expired, she will not be permitted to leave. See clauses  200  and  415  as amended. The clause is also faulty in that it only refers to vessels which &#34; return&#34; to Australia, that is to say, vessels that have been here before. It would not cover vessels arriving here for the first time. For these reasons it is best to omit the clause altogether. </para>

A Committee presided over by Professor Biles, who, by the way, is, I believe, the naval authority who planned our torpedo destroyers, has been appointed by the Board of Trade to inquire into the whole question. When thereport is made available, we shall receive a copy. The first amendment will leave it open to us to prescribe either transverse or longitudinal bulkheads, or both, or watertight decks, or any other kind of partitions that may be desirable. The second amendment is to make it clear that any sort of double bottom will not do; but that they must conform to the standard which willbe laid down. It will also enable us to take into consideration the different requirements of different trades, and to prescribe accordingly. </para>

        <para>The clause, as it stands in the Bill, deals in a somewhat involved way with several distinct matters. The amendment makes provision in one clause for two distinct, but related, offences, and provides in a separate clause for the discharge of seamen from ships found to be unseaworthy. In this latter connexion the application of the provision is restricted to British ships. It is very doubtful, indeed, whether the Commonwealth has any power to release seamen on foreign ships from agreements entered into by them in accordance with the laws of their own countries, and, at any rate, it is not considered desirable to do so. </para>

          <para>. - I do not think the Committee should be asked to take this course. It seems to me that it should be possible to submit reasonable evidence to show whether a master knew whether his ship was unseaworthy or not. It is unreasonable to provide that a master should be guilty of an indictable offence for taking an unseaworthy ship to sea, though there may be no proof that he knew she was unseaworthy. </para>

          <para>. - I thought the Minister would accept my most reasonable amendment. What is the guarantee to the crew that a ship is seaworthy? In the signing of ship&#39;s articles the master always signs first, and it is recognised in the history of British shipping that a master takes the risk of his ship, and is the last man to leave her. This is so, because it is assumed that a master knows his ship. Under the clause, as submitted by the House of Representatives, the onus would be thrown upon the Crown of proving that when a master took his ship to sea in an unseaworthy condition, he knew that she was unseaworthy. How could that be proved? A master ought to know the condition of his ship. </para>

            <para>- I believe that &#34; every person &#34; would include the master. There might be very good reason for excluding the master, because a man may be asked to take charge of a ship at the last moment before she sails owing to the sudden illness of the previous master of the vessel. How could the new master know the condition of his ship? The hanging up of a ship for twenty-four hours may result in considerable expense to the owner. Ships have often to leave a port at a certain time in order to reach another at a convenient state of the tide. It would be possible under sub-clause 2 to proceed against the master. </para>

It would be ridiculous to take a master out of his ship and detain him for trial by jury simply because his ship had been under detention for some minor difficulty, and he had, notwithstanding, taken her away to sea.

        <para class="block">It is thought that, to guard against the lodging of frivolous and vexatious complaints as to unseaworthiness, at least three of the crew should be required to subscribe to a complaint before being relieved of the necessity to give security. This is considerably more liberal than any other British legislation on the matter. The Merchant Shipping Act  1894,  section  461,  provides for complaints as to unseaworthiness being made by &#34; one-fourth, being not less than three of the seamen belonging to the ship.&#34; In a fair-sized passenger steamship, with a large number of stewards, &#38;c, one-fourth of the crew might mean anything from twenty upwards. This, it is thought, is an unduly high number; but it is considered only reasonable that, unless at least three seamen concur in the complaint, the complainant shall give security for the costs of any detention. In actual practice, if the complaint was made at a reasonable time before the ship&#39;s projected time of departure, so as to admit of the Government Surveyor making an inspection without detaining the ship, the costs would be but small, perhaps a pound or two. Of course, in any case where the complaint was found to be well-grounded!, the complainants would not be called on to pay any expenses whatever. These would, in such a case, have to be paid by the master or owner of the ship. </para>

        <para>These amendments are designed to exempt small limited coast-trade craft under  50  tons gross register, also river and bay ships, from the necessity of being marked with deck-lines and load-lines. As pointed out in connexion with an earlier amendment,  a  vessel of  15  tons gross would measure about  40  feet long,  12  feet wide, and  5  or  6  feet deep. One of 50 tons gross would be, roughly, 70 feet long, 17 feet wide, and from 5 to 6 feet deep. With regard to the river and bay ships, it may be pointed out that the conditions under which these run are so dissimilar to those of seagoing vessels that requirements absolutely essential in the case of the latter would be quite inapplicable to the former. River and bay ships, as a general rule, trade only in smooth, or comparatively smooth, waters, and within easy reach of land should the weather at any time become rough. </para>

          <para>. - The proviso to clause 225 has been the subject of as much discussion as has possibly any other provision of the Bill. The proposal to treat coal cargoes as more dangerous than ordinary mixed cargoes, and to require for them a corresponding higher freeboard has called forth strong opposition from all quarters. It will be remembered that the fixing of the Winter load-line for coal was based very largely upon the assumption that when vessels so laden left here in the summer they would round the Horn, and run into the winter season in the Atlantic before reaching Europe. Investigation has shown, however, that no coal whatever is exported from Australia <inline font-style="italic">via</inline> Cape Horn. This is borne out by the official records. Expert seamen are. also fairly unanimous that coal when properly stowed and ventilated is not at all bad cargo. Clause 262 gives ample power to control the stowage and ventilation of coal cargoes. As there was a largely preponderating weight of opinion against this particular provision, so far as coal was concerned, it has been decided to limit the application of the clause to dead-weight cargoes other than coal.

I do not know that the arguments which have been adduced so far have been of such a character as to show that coal is exceptionally safe as against any other kind of dead-weight cargo. According to a circular which has been distributed, a great deal depends not so much upon the deadweight as upon the proper stowage of cargo. </para>

            <para>- That is, I admit, a great point in connexion with coal. I notice that at the Navigation Conference a good deal of consideration was given to the question of dead-weight cargo. It was pointed out at considerable length that the great point was first to see that the cargo was properly stowed. It was also pointed out that our ships do not get into the same class of weather as is provided for by the Winter North Atlantic load-line for sailing ships, and that in these cases we were practically losing a considerable amount of cargo carriage. I think it was stated that nearly a couple of hundred tons was lost in the case of a large ship. I believe that the difference in the load-line is 3 inches, which considerably alters the carrying capacity. That, of course, adds to the cost of carrying these freights. However, I recognise that, in view of the amendment which has been made elsewhere, it is not possible for the Committee to again get on to the other question of ordinary dead-weight cargo, or the omission of the latter portion of the proviso -  or in the case of sailing ships, the Winter North Atlantic load-line, and in the case of ships so laden the provisions of this Act shall have effect as to that line or mark as if it were drawn through the centre of the disc. </para>

        <para>Were that portion of the clause still open to consideration, I should be prepared to submit an amendment. But 1 think it is just as well, in passing, to point out that we are unduly hampering the carrying capacity of many sailing ships. </para>

          <para>. - I do not think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> quite realizes the position. All that the clause does is to put vessels carrying deadweight cargoes that are going from Australia in exactly the same position as vessels coming from England, and we know that there is a possibility of meeting with winter weather, not only at Cape Horn, but in the Western Ocean. So far as &#34; coal &#34; is concerned, the other House has thought fit to take out the word, and, as we are not exporting coal from Australia <inline font-style="italic">via</inline> Cape Horn. I do not see any great danger in leaving out &#34; coal,&#34; at any rate at present. The question of stowage is an important one, but no matter how a ship is stowed, if she is made too deep, she is uncomfortable and unsafe. I think that with the clause as.it stands, we are just at the margin of safety. </para>

          <para>With regard to sailing ships coming from Australia homeward, the Cape Horn route has always been chosen even since I can remember as the better route, the more favorable route, and the safer, because there we get what seamen call the brave west winds of the Southern Ocean - not necessarily gales - but west winds that blow with almost uniform force between the parallels of 55 and 60 south, and the only danger is from drifting icebergs. That is the reason that that route has always been chosen in preference to the Cape of Good Hope - and it is quite my own experience. I have circumnavigated that part five times; once from Fremantle I came back on a sailing ship <inline font-style="italic">via</inline> the Cape of Good Hope, and we wished we had gone the other way. The reason the Cape Horn (route has its bad name is from ships outwardbound going to ports of the West Coast of America, and there for a radius of about 100 miles you get what we call the &#34; storm area.&#34; But even then the danger is confined to losing masts and spars. We have never had a record of any complaint from want of freeboard. </para>

          <para>. - I want the Committee to amend the proposed new clause by leaving out sub-clause 3, and inserting a new sub-clause, and also by adding a new sub-clause. The amendments which I desire to be made to the amendment of the other House are in print, and have been circulated. The provision as to wireless telegraphy has always been regarded by this Parliament as a very important one. The original provision was first inserted by the late Government in its Bill of 1908, clause 230, &#39;and was, I believe, the pioneer suggestion of compulsory wireless. In 1910 a Wireless Telegraph Installation Bill was introduced in the House of Commons, but was not proceeded with ; and in June, 1910, the United States adopted the compulsory principle in the Wireless Ships Act 1910. But I believe I am perfectly correct in saying that the honour of making the first move in this direction belongs to the &#34;Parliament of the Commonwealth. There is at the present moment every indication that wireless in stallation on passenger ships will be made compulsory by all the leading maritime nations.

        <para class="block">The Government have also been advised by cable that a Bill on the subject is now being drafted. This will, possibly, be considered during the next session of the Imperial Parliament. The march of events, since the matter was first dealt with in the Navigation Bill, has rendered the original proposal somewhat inadequate. The amendment made, by the House of Representatives, together with the further amendment which I intend to move, and which will be found in the printed notice of amendments, will expand the original clause in several directions. The principal alterations are as follows: - (1) Provision is made for the carrying of one or more skilled operators. (2) The times of attendance at the. instruments are to be as prescribed by regulation. (3) Accumulator batteries are to be provided so that the efficiency of the installation will not be dependent solely upon the ship&#39;s engines, but will be maintained for at least six hours after their going out of action. (4) Power is taken by regulation to adopt the provisions of any International Convention to which the United Kingrom becomes a party, either in addition to or in substitution for the provisions of the section. (5) The exchange of messages between ships and other ships or stations must not be dependent in any way upon what particular systems are in use by these other ships or stations. In view of the somewhat strained relations at present existing between this Government and the managements of certain commercial systems, it has been deemed essential to embody this in the Bill. The same principle, it may be mentioned, exists in the American Act, and in the British Bill previously referred to. </para>

Honorable senators and the Australian travelling public will be interested to learn that a large number of vessels trading to Australia, as also those running on our coast, are already equipped, or are being equipped, with wireless installations.

We all recognise the great importance of having an efficient system of wireless telegraphy installed in our ships.

            <para>- It would be better to embody the time in a clause. At present, we do not know what time will be allowed. Unless dissented from by Parliament, regulations passed under this measure will have the force of law. I notice that subclause 5 of the new clause provides that the provisions are not to apply to ships plying exclusively between ports in Australia less than 200 miles apart. It would be within the power  of  the Minister to prescribe that the clause should apply to ships, although they were only plying to places quite close to one another. Again, I notice that the clause is to apply only to ships carrying a certain number of passengers. Another question is whether 100 miles radial capacity for the installation, as provided for, is sufficient in ordinary circumstances. </para>

The distance between Tamar Heads and Port Phillip Heads is 197 nautical miles. The question arises - What is a &#34; port &#34; ? In the sub-clause the term &#34; between ports in Australia &#34; is used. It may be desirable to have thepoint settled.

Its passage will be practically a notice to the shipping world. There will be a lapse of time before the Royal Assent is given. It is obvious that the Bill will have to be sent to Great Britain, where it will be examined by the Board of Trade officials, who will advise the Imperial Government, who, in turn, will advise  His  Majesty. Consequently, some time must elapse after the passing of the Bill before it comes into operation. Ship-owners will have ample time to make arrangements. In the majority of cases, arrangements for the installation of wireless telegraphy have already been made. </para>

I gave as an illustration the instance of Melbourne and Launceston. The distance between the cities is 277 miles, but the distance between Port Phillip Heads and Tamar Heads is only 197 nautical miles. It is proposed to provide that wireless apparatus shall not be necessary in the case of a steamer trading between two Australian ports less than 200 miles apart.

The honorable senator will- see that &#34;except as otherwise prescribed,&#34; the provision is not to apply: to steamers trading between ports less thai* 200 miles apart; but it is intended, if thisBill becomes law, to prescribe that tha. trade between Launceston and! Melbourne shall come under this provision, the reason, being that a vessel midway between Tasmania and Australia is out of the ordinary trade route, and is as much isolated as it she were in the Indian Ocean.

        <para class="block">This clause laid a statutory obligation upon all ships to be provided with an independent chain connexion with the rudder body ready for immediate adjustment. Under modern conditions, there is really no necessity in many cases for this independent chain connexion. In the first place, there has been great improvement in recent years in rudder construction, and it is a most unusual occurrence for a rudder&#39;s stock to carry away. Some years ago, this was by  no means an uncommon occurrence. A considerable number of steam-ships are provided to-day with multiple screws, and so are able to steer without the assistance of the rudder, if necessary. There may be cases in which the chain connexion is necessary, and the House of Representatives have made an amendment which will permit of a regulation being framed so that, in cases where it is necessary, this safeguard may be provided. The penalty is proposed to be left out because there is a general penalty provided for breaches of the Act. </para>

          <para>. - I think the amendment needs to be still further amended. It is proposed that regulations may provide that any ship shall carry these chains attached to the rudder. That is a good provision in the case of a ship with a single screw ; but power is not taken under the clause to provide that the chain shall be of sufficient strength to work the rudder. A shipowner, to show the ridiculous nature of the amendment, explained to me the other day that he could put his watch chain on board one of. his ships. The regulation should make provision for an independent and efficient chain connexion. </para>

            <para>- No. Power is taken only to prescribe that ships shall carry a chain, without saying what sort of a chain it is to be. I can inform the Committee that the same difficulty arose when the Plimsoll mark was first provided for by legislation. There was no provision made as to where the mark should be placed. The penalty was incurred if the mark was submerged, and some ship-owners put the mark on the funnels of their vessels. I notice that in this case the penalty for not carrying an independent chain is to be struck out. </para>

Surely <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> is aware that, if power is given to prescribe that a chain connexion shall be provided, that involves the power to say what sort of a chain shall be provided.

            <para>- If the regulations are not made, we shall be in a helpless position. &#91; think I had a little to do with the inclusion of this provision in the first instance, as the result of the teaching of that hardest of schoolmasters, personal experience. I was on a ship on one occasion that carried fifty or sixty people, and the rudder was carried away flush with the deck. There was a howling south-sea island gale blowing at the time, and we had no independent chain connexion such as I wish to sec ships provided with. I wish to prevent a similar occurrence in the future. If a hurricane is blowing, a steamer with only one screw is perfectly helpless, no matter how powerful her engines may be, if her rudder-shaft is carried away. It is true that if a ship has more than one screw it is possible to steer her safely by manipulating the screws,. </para>

            <para>- I refer to the <inline font-style="italic">Birksgate.</inline> We had two small sticks across the mainmast which were dignified by the name of yards, and they helped us to keep the ship&#39;s head fairly to the wind until men had time to carry out the perilous work under such conditions of attaching chains to the rudder body. It will be seen that my desire is to put beyond all doubt the possibility of any steamer or ship on our coast falling into a similar plight as we did on that occasion. The only thing which saved us was the use of the two spars which were on the mainmast; otherwise, I might have been playing a harp now. We should adopt the clause in its original form, not in its mutilated form. The better course, I think, would be to omit &#34; may,&#34; and insert &#34; shall.&#34; </para>

            <para>- I take it, that this Parliament cannot control future Ministers, hut only present Ministers. The amendment will be a clear direction to future Ministers as well as to present Ministers. Why do we pick out certain ships? Because it is obvious that if the rudder body carries away they are helpless. Why do we not apply the provision to other ships? Because it is known that twin or triple screw steamers have other means of steering. It is the intention of the Government, if the amendment is carried, to apply the provision to that class of ships which, in the event of the rudder body carrying away, would not be able to steer. </para>

          <para>.- After hearing the Minister admit that a future Minister might not carry the provision into effect, I would sooner see the matter dealt with in the Bill than be left to regulations. I am entirely opposed to leaving such things to the discretion of the Minister, because Governments change. ft would be a very good thing, I think, to retain the clause in its original form. If this attachment is necessary to insure the safety of the public, it should be provided for in the Bill. </para>

          <para>.- The object of the first amendment is to make it clear that the clause does not apply to foreign ships. The Commonwealth may have power to make laws which will have the effect of annulling agreements between the masters and seamen of these ships. There is considerable doubt about it. At all events, it would be very unwise to attempt to do so, for it would inevitably result in considerable international friction. Under this Bill, &#34; dangerous goods &#34; mean goods which have been proclaimed to be dangerous. Under the Merchant Shipping Act, which we will probably follow, a large number of common commodities, such as matches, kerosene, &#38;c, are classed as dangerous. Other goods so classed are, however, of a highly dangerous character, such as dynamite, gunpowder, benzine, &#38;c. This will make it clear that we do not intend to apply these provisions to foreign ships. I move - </para>

        <para class="block">This amendment is proposed&#39; in order that by regulation there may be some differentiation between the classes of dangerous goods. Take the case of matches. They are commonly carried, and with proper precautions with regard to packing and stowing there is very little danger from them. It should not be a sufficient ground for a seamen to leave a ship that is carrying a few cases of matches which are properly stowed. Under the regulations, precautions will be taken for the carrying of such goods in small quantities. That is the reason why  the House of Representatives propose to insert the words &#34; the regulations or &#34;. It is intended to meet the case of the carrying of small packages of matches, such as are frequently conveyed around our coasts. No honorable senator would say that the carrying of a few cases of matches should need a special stipulation in an agreement with seamen, failing which they should be able to leave the ship. We know that matches as made nowadays are fairly safe, and if properly stowed there should be no danger from them. </para>

          <para>. - If this were merely a question of the carrying of a few cases of matches there would be nothing in it. But what it means is this : Suppose that a seaman has made an express stipulation with the master of a ship with regard to the carrying of dangerous goods. She may be carrying dynamite or gelatine. Provision is made in the agreement with seamen for the carrying of such goods. Carrying them means greater risk and more pay. When an agreement has been made between the master and a seaman, there ought not to be a regulation overruling that agreement. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para class="block">Once the agreement has been made, no regulation should interfere with it. The owner of the ship is perfectly at liberty to say, &#34;I am going to carry certain goods.&#34; He makes his agreement with his men accordingly. The men have a right to say, &#34; We agree to carry those goods.&#34; Every month shiploads of explosives are brought to South Australia from the Cape. In one case, not long ago, a ship took fire in Port Adelaide. Naturally, the crew left her as soon as they could. It will be unfair to make regulations interfering with agreements made between seamen and masters of ships for these purposes I hope we shall stick to the clause as it left the Senate, and strike out the words inserted by the House of Representatives. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lt.-Colonel Sir ALBERT</inline>GOULD (New South Wales)  &#91;8.57&#93;. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> wants to leave out the words &#34; the regulations 01 &#34; so as to leave matters in regard to the carrying of dangerous goods to be a matter of express stipulation between seamen and shipowners. I do not think that the clause as amended would be as objectionable as he seems to think. I take it that the regulations will not interfere with an express agreement between parties. But there may be other goods which are very dangerous, and for which the regulations should make provision. A ship may carry a general cargo of goods which is absolutely safe, and may also include a small quantity of lucifer matches, which may be classed as dangerous. Why have an express agreement with regard to the carrying of them? If the matter had to depend upon express agreements, it might be that men engaged upon ships, if they found that a small quantity of matches were being carried would turn round and say, &#34; This ship is carrying dangerous goods, and we claim to have our discharge.&#34; There are many cases in which the regulations would probably be of great service, and at the same time would do the seamen no harm whatever. I shall support the insertion of the words proposed by the House of Representatives. In any case, I think the clause is a dangerous one, for many reasons; but it has been modified, and we are not now in a position to vary the text of. it except to the extent of making consequential amendments. </para>

There is, first of all, the provision as to an express stipulation ; and then there is the provision as to regulation. I cannot conceive any set of conditions under which a Minister would, by regulation, override an express stipulation contained in an agreement made between the master of a vessel and the seamen employed upon it. No. Minister would be foolish enough to issue a regulation overriding an industrial agreement. . </para>

          <para>. - The Board of Trade regulations, which, I presume, will be followed to a large extent in the regulations issued under this measure, prohibit &#39; the carrying on board passenger ships of methylated spirits, rubber solution, and rags. Suppose that seamen enter into an agreement with the master of a vessel that is about to carry cargo of that character. Why should a regulation override that agreement? Why should not these matters be left between the ship-owners and the seamen? Many honorable senators do not know anything about regulations issued under Acts of Parliament, and how can a seamen who spends his life at sea, and does not even see the daily newspapers, know what the regulations contain ? </para>

            <para>- I do not think that that is a fair interjection. Such things would be better left unsaid. The Minister must know that dangerous cargo is, to a very large extent, carried on ships. The seamen know that such goods are carried, and enter into agreements accordingly. The words proposed to be inserted by the House of Representatives are .unnecessary when there is an absolute agreement made by both parties interested. I trust that the Committee will see their way clear to retain the clause. as it left the Senate. </para>

Surely, then, we can afford to go a little further and allow the Department to make regulations as to the kind of dangerous cargo that shall be carried, and how it shall be carried. </para>

            <para>- That is a two-edged sword, and cuts both ways. If a seaman saw that highly dangerous or explosive cargo was to be carried, and was being stowed in the wrong way, he would have a perfect right to leave the ship ; but, at the same time, we can imagine a seaman erroneously supposing dangerous material to be carried, and leaving the ship without having reasonable excuse. I think we should take into account the seamen who do not know, as well as the large body of men who do know, the risk they are running. We should insure, as far as possible, the protection of men who go to sea in blissful ignorance of the dangers they run on ships carrying explosives. There is no chance to safeguard the interests of such men unless by the regulations which the clause proposes. On the Australian coast men enter into agreements that are well-known, and these cases govern, perhaps,  90  per cent, of the carrying trade on our coast. In the other  1.0  per cent., men who have not a strong union behind them, or who are new to the country, may, through ignorance, take the risks which they should not be allowed to take. The only way in which to protect them is to set down in black and white what sort of cargo shall be carried, and how it is to be carried. </para>

          <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> has missed the point in connexion with this clause. It does not give any power to make regulations, but it gives a ship-owner the power to say to seamen, &#34; You must goto sea in this ship because the regulations say so,&#34; and, if that fails, to say, &#34; You must go to sea in this ship because the stipulations of your agreement say. so.&#34; I do not see that the seaman should be burdened with regulations as well as with his agreement. I should not care which of the two courses is followed, but our position is that we can only amend by striking out the provision for regulations. </para>

        <para class="block">This and the next two amendments deal with the questions of salvage and damages. Since the Bill was last introduced into this Chamber, an International Conference has been held in Brussels for the purpose of unifying the law in regard to collisions and salvage at sea. At that time there were in existence some twenty different codes of law on the subject, many of them widely conflicting in principle. The Conference, after discussion, drew up a Convention on the subject, which has since been adhered to by practically every maritime nation. Amongst others, Great Britain has become a party to the Convention, and this Government has intimated its intention, so soon as the Navigation Bill becomes law, of also giving its adherence to the same. In pursuance of the terms of the Convention, Great Britain last year brought her legislation on the subject generally into line with the principles laid down. This was done by means of the Maritime Conventions Act of  191 1.  To bring the Navigation Bill into line with this Imperial Act, and in anticipation of our adherence to the Convention, it has been decided to omit clauses  264  and  265  of the Bill, and to substitute therefor new clauses  263A, 263B, 263c, 263D, 264, 265,  and  265A.  These are based, without any material variation, on the provisions of the Imperial measure just referred to. </para>

          <para>. - Any person familiar with the law relating to salvage will admit that the Act passed as the result of the Convention referred to by the Minister embraces beneficial improvements of the law with regard to definitions and facilitating proceedings in Courts. Section 422 of the Merchant Shipping Act of 1894 is the section corresponding to the clause now under consideration, and I wish to say that I notice in that section a provision in case of collision that each master shall give to the other the name of his ship, the port from which it came, and its port of  destination,  which seems to have been omitted from this clause. I direct the attention of the Minister to the matter, for the reason that the information thus supplied is very necessary in order to start proceedings in a Court of competent jurisdiction. As the Government have taken very great care in connexion with this Bill, I anticipate that there is some reason for the omission of such a provision, if I have not overlooked it in some other part of the Bill. As one who has had some experience in these matters, I am able to say that the provision referred to was found to be of considerable convenience in facilitating Court proceedings, and protecting the interests of owners and masters of colliding ships. </para>

          <para>. - The provision which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger has quoted from the Merchant Shipping Act was not in this Bill as it left the Senate, and we could not insert such a provision at this juncture. But whilst that express provision is not contained in this Bill, the Merchant Shipping Act will apply so far as British ships at sea, and not under our immediate jurisdiction, are concerned. As regards ships under our immediate jurisdiction we have power under clause 263 to make rules for the prevention of collisions at sea, and to prescribe what lights and signals are to be used by ships, and under the new clause 265A inserted by the House of Representatives, it is provided that the master or person in charge of a vessel shall, so far as he can do so, without serious danger to his own ship, her crew and passengers, render assistance to every person, even if such person be a subject of a foreign State at war with the King, who is found at sea in danger of being lost, and failure to render such assistance renders him liable to be charged with an indictable offence. There never was any provision in this Bill to compel a master to give the name of his ship or of the owners to the master of a ship with which he collided, and though such a provision is contained in the Merchant Shipping Act of 1894, my statement in submitting the motion still remains true, that these new clauses are based, without any material variation, on the provisions of the Maritime Conventions Act to which I have referred. </para>

          <para>. - I notice that before a master of a ship can be charged with failing to give aid to a ship or a person at sea it is necessary to prove that the person or the ship was in danger of being lost. I think it is necessary to go further than is proposed. A case came under notice recently, which in,dicates, to say the least of it, a very glaring disregard for human life on the part of those in charge of some steamer or steamers. It occurred on our western coast in connexion with the steamer <inline font-style="italic">Polynesian</inline> only a few weeks ago. I quote the following from the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> of 24th October. of this year. The statement was telegraphed from Albany - </para>

          <para>The French mail steamer <inline font-style="italic">Polynesien,</inline> which was towed into port last evening by the Federal liner <inline font-style="italic">Essex,</inline> was brought into the harbor this morning. It is the vessel&#39;s intermediate pressure crank shaft that is broken. She left Fremantle for the eastern States on Friday afternoon, and ran into bad weather. She was 155 miles east of Albany late on Saturday night, and a heavy southerly sea was running when the accident happened. All the passengers were in bed at the time. </para>
          <para>The vessel was hove to, and as she was in the track of steamers no anxiety was felt. The next day passed without a ship being sighted, but at 9 o&#39;clock the lights of a steamer were seen approaching. </para>
          <para>The <inline font-style="italic">Polynesien</inline> is without wireless apparatus, and she had to speak to the other steamer by means of signals. The attention of the newcomer was attracted, but, to use the expression of one of the French officers, &#34; they were unable to come to terms,&#34; and the vessel passed on without making her name known. Later the lights of what evidently was a small steamer were made out in the distance, but the signals put out by the Frenchman failed to elicit any response. </para>

        </quote>
        <para class="block">Here was a disabled steamer on the high seas, with a complement of 300 souls on board, which signalled to another steamer in the distance to come to her assistance; but because satisfactory terms could not be arranged, the latter cast away and did not even make her name known. These clauses apply exactly to a situation of that kind. But we should go a little farther than merely insist upon proof of a ship being in danger of getting lost at sea before we allow the clause to pass out of our hands.  1  suggest to the Minister the insertion of &#34; helpless &#34; before the words &#34; or in danger of being lost &#34;. Unless such an amendment is made, a loophole will be left to the master of a steamer to clear out and leave another vessel in the lurch as the <inline font-style="italic">Polynesien</inline> was left on that- occasion. </para>

            <para>- A failure to come to terms should not be an excuse, in any circumstances, to the master of any steamer to leave another vessel in the lurch.  His  first duty should be to save the vessel and the lives on board, and afterwards, if there were any damages or compensation to be secured, let it be sought in the law Courts, where the amount could be properly assessed. I think I am right in saying - and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger will correct me if I am wrong - that if a person on land in ordinary circumstances failed to save human life, although he was not an accomplice to the act or the design, he would be an accomplice before the fact. </para>

            <para>- It is our duty to see that a person who is so situated as the master of the <inline font-style="italic">Polynesien</inline> was in the case I referred to, shalT be helped at any cost, and that a person who refuses to render assistance shall be placed in the dock and charged with murder, or manslaughter, as the case may be. It is the darkest and most criminal offence of which a person can be guilty, and the clause ought to be made wider so as to minimize the risk of a person who is on board a. stout, wellequipped ship, failing to go to the assistance of a ship unfortunately situated like the <inline font-style="italic">Polynesien</inline> was only a few weeks ago. I ask the Minister to consider the advisability of putting in some words to obviate the danger of such a person escaping the penalty of his refusal to bear down and render whatever assistance lay in his power to bring the castaway or derelict into har bor. I think that the word &#34; helpless &#34; would be a very good one to insert, because any ship which would be cast away and have machinery thrown out of action, could well be described as helpless. </para>

            <para>- Suppose that a ship is helpless, even if the,re be a calm at the time, there is no guarantee that withintwelve hours a storm may not arise, and in that case she would be in grave danger of being lost. The case, I think, is covered by the provision. Furthermore, this question has to be dealt with somewhat carefully, because in the circumstances which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> indicated, a ship may be in the position that the captain may refuse to give reasonable terms. Surely, if a ship is disabled, and calls upon another ship to tow her into harbor, the latter is entitled to reasonable compensation? That has always been recognised. The master of a vessel is not entitled to force his assistance upon a disabled vessel. Suppose that, in the case of the <inline font-style="italic">Polynesien,</inline> the other ship asked for terms which the French captain thought unreasonable. If he had acceptedtowage, he could still have asked the Court to adjudicate as to whether the termsimposed upon him were reasonable. I believe that there is such a thing as equity in bargains of this kind. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch.</inline> knows that in Western Australia recently <inline font-style="italic">a.</inline> promissory note for a very large amount was signed by a person under threat of personal violence. The person who got the promissory note proceeded to recover the amount, and the Court held that as it had been proved that the note had been signed under threat of personal violence, it had no force in law. Whilst we want to safeguard human life and property, at the same time we know that in many cases the charge for towage is a matter of adjustment between the parties ; and we should not enable one party to extort from the other unfair terms. If, on the one hand, the captain of a vessel which was asked to render assistance were under a penalty for refusal, the master of the disabled ship might offer some ridiculous terms for a tow, and use as a lever to obtain that tow the threat of laying an information against the master of the other ship, and get him prosecuted for an indictable offence. </para>

It is always a disadvantage, therefore, to insert other or additional words unless there are strong reasons for doing so. In confirmation of what the Minister has said, I may mention that in <inline font-style="italic">Abbott&#39;s Law of Merchant Ships and Seamen</inline> there are some cases cited on the very point which has been referred to. In one case, there was an attempt made to have an agreement set aside, but the attempt was not successful - </para>
        <quote>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Dr.</inline>Lushington  decided that those who were attempting to set aside the agreement had failed to prove either that it was improperly obtained or that it was grossly exorbitant. And, in another case, the same learned Judge declared, on setting an agreement aside as against the salvors on the ground of exorbitancy, that, although indisposed to set aside the bargains which had been made, the Court would, where they are proved to be inequitable, be just as ready to protect the rights&#39; of salvors as of those -whose property has been salved. In that case an agreement made Between a master of the salved ship and the salvors was set aside, on&#187; the ground,- apparently, that their master bad recklessly consented to pay a sum wholly unreasonable for the services rendered. &#34; I think,&#34; said Lord Esher, &#34; the old rule of Admiralty ought not to be lightly encroached upon, viz., that where there is an agreement made by competent persons, and there is no misrepresentation of facts, the agreement ought to . be tipheld, unless there is something very strong to show that it is inequitable.&#34; </para>

        <para class="block">There, are further references to the position of a person who saves a ship and of the owners, and it is shown that where an agreement is entered into, and an exorbitant demand is made, the Court will set it aside. The Court also recognises the further principle that the captain of a ship which is in danger of being lost is compelled, practically, to accept any terms which are offered to him; but if. they are exorbitant, inequitable, or .unfair, the Court will set them aside and only award what is a reasonable amount of compensation; of course, always keeping in view the danger the ship was in, the value of the cargo salved, and the number of lives which might have been lost. </para>

            <para>- Possibly that is the explanation of the matter. <inline font-style="italic">Prima facie,</inline> when a section is not expressly repealed, it will apply. There is a section in the Imperial Act which excludes the application of the amending Act dealing with salvage and collisions&#39; from Canada, Australia and other Dominions. .That, of course, leaves those Dominions free to embody the provision in their legislation whenever they choose to do so. It has occurred to me that the Imperial Act, after all, followed very largely the decisions given by the various Courts of Admiralty in salvage and collision cases. Section  422  is really declaratory of the law which has been laid down from time to time, and possibly that very useful provision still holds good. </para>

          <para>. - This is rather an important amendment. It provides that adequate hospital accommodation shall be provided on board foreign-going ships trading regularly with the Commonwealth, and on Australian trade ships on voyages between consecutive ports which exceed a prescribed distance. It is deemed essential for the proper safeguarding of the health of passengers and crews of vessels that adequate and properly equipped accommodation for patients suffering from communicable diseases shall be provided. 1 think that some honorable senators recently had an experience in travelling round the north of Australia which will enable them to speak feelingly on the subject. </para>
