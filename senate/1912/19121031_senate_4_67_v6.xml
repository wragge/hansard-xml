                        <para>- My attention was incidentally called to some remarks by the Leader of the Opposition, but &#39; I think he conveyed an erroneous impression. When the Northern Territory was taken over by the Commonwealth, there were nine Chinese employed by the Government of South Australia, and that number has been reduced to six. There are four Chinese employed in the hospitals, namely, a cook, a dough-boy, a messenger, and a warder. Two Chinese are employed on the railway, namely, a carpenter at1s. 4d. an hour, and a sanitary employ&#233; at  15s.  a week. No extra Chinese have been employed since the Commonwealth took over the Territory. </para>

                <para class="block">On reference to section 112 of the Trade Marks Act of 1905, honorable senators will see that the first part of the amendment of  the other House makes very little difference other than that it adopts the language of the provision in the Imperial Act of 1905. Section 112 of our principal Act was copied from the famous Imperial Act of 1853. The new provision adopted in 1905 by the Imperial Parliament means the same thing, but it is , put in a different way. The object of proposed new clause 30 is to bring section 112 of the principal Act. into conformity with the latest Imperial Act. The object of proposed new clause 31 is to amend section 113 of the principal Act for the purpose of putting the Arms of the Commonwealth in the same position as the Royal Arms. That is, I think, a very wise thing to do. If there is no objection I should like the amendment to be dealt with in one motion, but, of course, if any honorable senator wishes to submit an amendment I shall ask the Committee to deal with the several paragraphs- separately. </para>

Is it contemplated that the Bill will be reserved for the Royal assent, and that we shall have to wait until it has been considered at Home before it will be possible to proclaim the date upon which it shall come into force, or is it considered that the Government will be able to obtain the Royal&#34; assent to the measure in the ordinary way through the Governor-General?

In simple language this means, I understand, that any such legislation may not be assented to by the Vice-Regal representative in the Dominion, but must be reserved for the Royal approval. The matter has -been the subject of some correspondence between the Imperial authorities and this Government, and it, has been suggested to us that such a qualification is - desirable to obviate the possibility of the Navigation Act being declared invalid by reason of its omission. </para>

                        <para>- No, according to the Acts I have quoted, the measure is one which must be reserved for the assent of the King, and could not be assented to by His Majesty&#39;s representative in the Commonwealth. While no delay will be involved, I should like to say that the Government do not agree with the contention that the general power of this Parliament with regard to navigation is derived from the Merchant Shipping Act, and not from our own Constitution. It is quite possible, however; that power is conferred under the Merchant Shipping Act to regulate the coasting trade to a greater extent than may be done under the power conferred by the Constitution. We have power under the Constitution, to regulate shipping trading Inter-State and with foreign countries, but the power conferred under the Merchant Shipping Act is not subject to any such limitation, and might be construed as giving us power to control shipping engaged in trading between port and port anywhere along our coast, including shipping trading within the limits of a particular State. Our power under the Constitution enables us to control Intra-State shipping to the extent of imposing upon it obedience to such- rules of the road as may be necessary to insure the safety of Inter-State and  foreign-going ships using the same waters, but under the Merchant Shipping Act power is given to regulate wages, discipline, salvage, and such matters, which could . not be regulated in the case of Intra-State shipping under the- power given by the Constitution. The amendment practically means that the Bill Shall not come into operation until His Majesty&#39;s assent thereto has been proclaimed in the Commonwealth. </para>

                <para>SenatorLt.-Colonel <inline font-weight="bold">Sir ALBERT</inline> GOULD (New South Wales)  &#91;2.58&#93;.-  I thank the Minister for the explanation he has given. The contention of the Government is that, so far as Australian shipping is concerned, we have power under the Constitution to deal with it, irrespective of the provisions of the Merchant Shipping Act, but that the moment we go beyond those powers it is necessary for us to take further steps to get the assent of the Imperial authorities to the measure we have passed. We are really dealing with a Bill of a composite nature. So far as one portion of it is concerned, it is entirely within our powers under the Constitution. Another portion of this measure deals with shipping trading beyond the Commonwealth, and the Government are in doubt as to -its validity. If it were to be declared <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires</inline> of the Constitution, the whole measure would be destroyed. That difficulty would have been avoided if the Government had been content to deal solely with Australian shipping in Australian waters. . We are passing a law intended to apply to Australian ships engaged in trade or commerce with other countries or amongst the States. . We propose that certain rules shall be applicable to such shipping which we are unable to make applicable to ships that are not Australian ships, but which may trade between Australian ports as well as with ports beyond the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth. In this way we place Australian-owned ships at a disadvantage as compared with the ships of other nations. We may deal with that matter more fully when we come to consider the next amendment of the House of Representatives. One portion of the Bill is clearly within our powers, and the validity of another portion will depend upon the view which the Imperial, authorities will take . of the powers we propose to exercise. I remind honorable senators that, although the Imperial authorities may not withhold assent to the measure, and may say, &#34; We do not wish to interfere in any way with what you propose to do in the case of Australian ships,&#34;- the provisions of the measure may still be held to be <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires,</inline> because the owners of the ships will have the right, if they see fit, to claim that the restrictions placed upon them are. beyond our powers under the Constitution, and they may be determined to be beyond our powers by the High Court, whose decision might be upheld upon appeal to the&#39;Privy Council. It might be held that such provisions could not be enacted unless by the Imperial Parliament. </para>

                    <para>- An exceedingly interesting point has been raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould,</inline> and the explanation given by the Minister of Defence indicates an extraordinary state of affairs which I do not think honorable senators were generally aware of. The honorable senator&#39;s explanation seemed to indicate that this measure may be unconstitutional in some of its provisions, unless it is approved by the Imperial authorities. That, to my mind, supposes a serious limitation upon what I believe to be our powers of self-government. From what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> has said, it would appear that it was possible for us to legislate in this matter beyond the powers conferred upon us by the Constitution, provided that we secured Imperial sanction. </para>

                        <para>- I understand the- contention now. It means that whether this amendment be made or not, the assent of the King to this measure will be necessary, and sp there cannot be, because of the amendment, any additional delay in bringing it into force. I hold that what has been said indicates that there is a serious limitation upon our powers in . dealing with this matter which affects . the interests of the Commonwealth. That should make those people, who have hitherto opposed the extension of our powers, repent . even at the eleventh hour. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not like this- amendment, and I think that the interjection of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> supports the contention which I am about to make. That is, as to the danger that may accrue by the owner of Australian vessels registering outside Australia, and nullifying absolutely the legislation which we are passing in the interest of the Australian people to govern Australian shipping. That is the danger which I see in the amendment. The object of this measure, which has engaged the attention of the National Parliament for the last eight or nine years, is to place the condition of Australian seamen on the highest plane, and at the same time to conserve the interests of the owners of ships, and safeguard those who travel by sea ; but if we calmly submit to this amendment, which provides that the measure shall only become law after the assent of the King has been given, our work for the last two years goes absolutely by the board. It will be wise for the Committee to consider the effect of the House of Representatives&#39; amendment before assenting to it. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae,</inline> that if we carry the amendment we shall be recognising the supremacy of  His  Majesty, and the Imperial Parliament, upon a matter over which we ourselves ought to have supreme control. </para>

What we want to do in this Bill is to provide, as far as our coasting trade is concerned, that our ships shall conform to Australian conditions. The question is whether we are not going . beyond the powers given to us by the Constitution. We have to turn back to the Merchant Shipping Act to see if it will help us in any way, and we find from it that we have no power to deal with anything beyond our own coasting trade.

Whether I am correct in my contention or not, I hold that under our powers we cannot deal&#39; with matters the effect of which is to alter the Merchant Shipping Act, even with regard to our own coastal, trade, until approval has been given by the King. It is abundantly clear that we are tampering with questions with &#39;respect to the accommodation to be given to sailors, and a multiplicity of other matters provided for in the Merchant Shipping Act, in such a way as to require the assent of the King to the legislation which we propose to enact. .

However much we may flatter ourselves that we are a growing nation, we are a subordinate authority as far as Imperial jurisdiction is concerned. The Imperial authority might, if it were thought fit, render any other Acts nugatory, though, of course, it would not do such a thing. </para>

The correspondence . on this point will be found in a printed memorandum containing -the suggestions of the Board of Trade on the Navigation Bill. The memorandum shows that the Commonwealth law officers are distinctly at variance with the Board of Trade on this point, and the- Commonwealth has never wavered in its view of its powers in this respect. &#39; Perhaps it may be well to- again read section 736 of the Merchant </para>

                    in respect to this amendment. Really the view which the Minister has put makes it quite clear that, instead of causing delay, the amendment may cause very great expedition. It may facilitate the Bill being brought into operation without any question which may require to be dealt with by a tribunal. To begin at the beginning, the whole underlying principle is that no country has the right to legislate directly in respect to any other shipping than its own. In the first instance the Imperial authorities had to legislate in respect to, not merely the shipping immediately connected with the British Isles, and trading from that centre, but what might be called Imperial shipping throughout the Dominions of the Crown. As various Colonies were established, power was given to enable them to legislate in a particular way, and within certain restrictions. Of course, the Imperial Act is, in regard to the British Dominions, a code governing all shipping flying the British flag. Then, in order to facilitate, commerce, and incidental to the creation of the self-governing Dominions, came the provisions empowering colonies to legislate in a particular way within the restrictions which the- Minister has quoted. &#39; &#39; Whilst that enabled the outlying portions of the Empire to legislate in order to facilitate trade, &#39; it led to the possibility of legislation assuming a form which might interfere with the general law of British shipping and produce practically chaos. These restrictions were not made with the view of diminishing the self-governing power of any Dominion, nor is it intended by this amendment to cast a doubt on. the national power of the Commonwealth. It is a measure of precaution. It is to prevent the possibility of international difficulties and, it may be, .great confusion in regard to the shipping of the British Empire itself. It is a perfectly reasonable amendment. It does not call forth the condemnation which
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline>
                    threw upon it, as though it were an assault upon self-government in Australia. It is nothing of the kind.

                        <para>- It will get over it to the extent that it cannot be said that we have not complied with the provisions of the Merchant Shipping Act. Our authority to legislate is derived from the Constitution, which is an Imperial Act. We must legislate within the Constitution, and no approval of -His Majesty can make that valid which does not come within the authority given to us by the Constitution or the Merchant Shipping- Act. But there is a limitation. Under the Merchant Shipping Act, if that is our authority for any legislation, we have to get the approval of His Majesty before the Bill can come into operation. This is a salutary amendment, which, instead of causing delay, may save 1 great deal of litigation and delay. At any rate, it anticipates an objection which may be made by the Imperial authorities, and which it is just as well to meet beforehand. </para>

In the Constitution, the Imperial authorities gave us absolute power over all British ships which have a port of entrance and a port of clearance within the Commonwealth. Why should. we reserve the Bill for the King&#39;s assent? Is it intended to ask the Board of Trade - the most Conservative institution in Great Britain, as has been lately shown by the <inline font-style="italic">Titanic</inline> inquiry - to deal with matters over which the Constitution gives us full power?&#34; I recognise, of course, that it is another matter when we deal with foreign ships. I asked <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> to cite a provision in the Bill&#39; dealing with foreign ships -which were not engaged in the Commonwealth trade, but he could not do so.. Unless a&#39; ship goes- into the Commonwealth trade, the Bill will not affect her. A ship coming here from England will not be subject to our survey or manning scale or food scale ; in fact, to any of the conditions contained in the Bill until she enters into the Commonwealth trade. </para>

                        <para>- Then we ought to be ! I say that we have power to do as the Imperial authorities have done. They have defined their coasting trade as extending beyond Great Britain to the River Elbe, along the coast of Holland and France, down to Brest. What difference would it make if we extended our coasting trade in the way I suggested ? It would be in favour of the Commonwealth as against the outsider. I do not think that the reservation of the Bill for the Royal assent matters twopence. lt may mean a delay of six months in bringing it into force&#39;, but we have been considering it now for ten years, and an additional six months is a trifling matter. If, when the measure is referred to the Imperial authorities, there are objections to it, the Commonwealth will have to get up on its hind legs and fight them. Now is not the time to consider possible objections. The memorandum placed in the hands of honorable senators shows that we have dealt with all the objections raised by the Board of Trade. We should agree to this amendment now, and it will be time enough to deal with new objections by the Board of Trade when any are raised. I know that in the case of State legislation affecting outside countries it was necessary that it should be reserved for the Royal assent. I took charge of a Bill in 1892 in the South Australian Parliament, dealing with the load-line, before ever the Imperial Parliament dealt with the subject. The measure was sent Home, . and the Board of Trade advised  Her  Majesty to refuse the Royal assent, and so the Bill failed, but in the very next year the Imperial Parliament passed the very same provisions. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> altogether misunderstood my contention. If it will facilitate the bringing of this Bill into operation, and insure the validity of its provisions, I have no objection whatever to the reservation for the Royal assent. My contention was that, on the argument put forward by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould,</inline> we are restricted in dealing with trade other than Australian coasting trade, and under the Constitution are subject to restriction in dealing with purely Intra-State trade. We seem to have our wings clipped in both directions if we are to accept <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould&#39;s</inline> argument. Our legal friends, Senators Symon and Gould, tried to explain away another point, but they have not answered the contention that if our powers are more extended under the Merchant Shipping Act than they are under our Constitution, they cannot be contained within the four corners of the Constitution. I am well aware that both the Constitution and the Merchant Shipping Act are Acts of the Imperial Parliament, but I say that if we can exercise powers of legislation under the Merchant Shipping Act which we could not exercise under the Constitution it is clear that an Imperial Act other than the Constitution, may incidentally increase the powers vested in us by the Constitution. </para>

                        <para>- But if that be so, the converse will also hold good; and an Im- . perial Act other than the Commonwealth Constitution may incidentally limit our powers under the Constitution. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> has raised the point that the Imperial Parliament has defined the coasting trade of Great Britain as meaning something wider than the interpretation placed upon such a term under this Bill. While we all recognise that the Imperial Parliament can do as it wills, and we can only  do what we are allowed to do, I should like to know if there is anything to prevent us enacting a definition of our. coasting trade which would cover shipping between Australia and New Zealand and Australia and Fiji. If we -are not in a position to say that vessels registered in Australia, and trading with New Zealand, shall conform to the conditions prescribed for vessels registered in Australia, and engaged in the Australian coasting trade, it is possible that some companies may remove the registration of their vessels from Australia to New Zealand to escape the provisions of our law. </para>

It has been pointed out more than once in both Houses that the constitutional difficulty is always before us in connexion with this legislation. It arises, not from the Constitution, but out of the very nature of the subject with which we are dealing. I agree, to a large extent, with the explanation given by the Minister of Defence. The honorable gentleman was historically correct in saying that there has been a conflict of opinion on this matter between the law officers of the Commonwealth and the Board of Trade. </para>

                        <para>- It seems to me that they are obvious. I thought that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> had made the matter clear. If he&#39; has not, it will probably be impossible for me to do so; but I, might refresh the memories of honorable senators, or explain. the matter in my own way. In dealing with navigation, we have to make provision for two classes of ships, those which are on our own register, and trading exclusively in our own coasting trade, and foreign ships, which are not registered here, but which come to the  Commonwealth with goods from other countries and take our produce to other countries. It is axiomatic that we have not the same power to deal with ships on a foreign register, trading with Australia, that we have to deal with our own ships engaged in our own coasting trade. Some distinction must, therefore, be made in the legislation applicable to the two classes of shipping. Another point might be referred to which arises in connexion with this subject. If the most extreme unificationist on the other side could give the Commonwealth Parliament all the powers he could imagine, it is clear that there would be doubt as to our power with regard to foreign shipping trading with Australia in only a partial way. The Merchant Shipping Act was designed in order to assist the  self-governing Dominions with a power which only an Imperial Act could give. We could not expect to pass legislation so perfect that conflict could not possibly arise in connexion with the treatment of complex questions. The Merchant Shipping Act was never designed to restrict the self-governing powers of the Dominions, but to assist them, and I believe that it does so in a way that is highly beneficial to the Commonwealth, by enabling us to deal with, not only our own shipping, but, to a certain extent, with foreign shipping. I am glad that this clause is to be amended in the way proposed. I think that, on a previous occasion, when the matter was under consideration in the Senate, I pointed out that a similar provision was to be found in the Canadian Navigation Act; and I asked why the reservation for the King&#39;s assent was not included in this Bill. After careful consideration, the Bill comes up to us now from another place with the provision of the Canadian Act to which I directed attention in its forefront. </para>

                    <para>. - The question with which we are dealing is a very complicated one. It is complicated by the doubts which have been expressed as to our constitutional powers ; but. the Government have throughout made it clear that they believe we have full constitutional powers to deal with anything pertaining to the coasting trade of Australia. We do not assume to have full power to deal with foreign ships, but we have always assumed that we have full power to legislate for Australian shipping in whatever way we please, whether as to labour conditions, the seaworthiness of the vessels trading, or any other conditions. The matter becomes complicated when we come to deal with foreign ships that are not British ships; but we hold that when they come into competition with Australian ships it is fair to insist that there shall be no violation by them of the conditions which we apply to Australian ships. But when it comes to a question of seaworthiness we are dealing with a much wider matter, and one that is open to all kinds of complications. The various nations of the world have different standards of seaworthiness, and different ideas as to how it should be measured. For instance, Great Britain leads the way as far as loadlines are concerned. Other nations take other means of determining when a ship is seaworthy and when she is not. France, Germany, and the United States, to single out three countries, have every right to enforce their own ideas of seaworthiness in regard to their own ships, and to a certain extent we respect their conditions. But there are limitations. For instance, we would not allow even a French or a German vessel to leave an Australian port if we were not thoroughly convinced that she was seaworthy. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so. and we would not allow her to leave Australia for her home port if it were considered that human life on board was placed in imminent risk owing to the unseaworthy condition of the vessel. It will therefore be seen that there are degrees of control even in regard to foreign shipping. In the present instance we are taking only a reasonable precaution against further delay. If there is one Commonwealth measure more than another as to which there has been delay it is the Navigation Bill. We have had it before Parliament year after year since 1904. Are we to run the risk: of having all our work hung up because there may be in the Bill some provision to which exception is taken? I consider that the Government have adopted a wise precaution in the present instance. If we attempt to make hard and fast rules when we are not quite sure of our ground, we may cause further delay. I do not think that we should be wise in delaying any further a Bill for which the country has been asking so long; and it is because of that that 1 consider that the Government have acted wisely in inserting the amendment before us. Although we may appear to express some doubt as to our constitutional powers, we do so in such a mild form that we can very well allow the amendment to go, knowing that by so doing, we are securing a sure and quick passage for this Bill. </para>

                <para>SenatorLt. <inline font-weight="bold">-Colonel Sir ALBERT</inline> GOULD (New South Wales) &#91;4.15&#93;.- This is rather an important amendment. If honorable senators turn to the Bill they will find that an Australian trade ship is defined as including - every ship other than a limited coast-trade ship or river and bay ship) employed in trading or going between places in Australia, and every ship employed in trading between (a) Australia and (*) territories under the authority of the Commonwealth, New Zealand, or the islands of the Pacific. </para>
                <para class="block">So that an Australian trade ship is denned in the first instance as being a ship trading between various places in Australia and New Zealand or the islands of the Pacific ; and then we have a new clause which practically deals with an Australian trade ship which may be trading elsewhere. In other words, the effect is that an Australian trade ship is defined as a ship trading between the Commonwealth and any part of&#39; the world.&#39; Say that a .ship is registered in Sydney, and is trading to the islands and to London. She becomes an Australian trade ship ; and we then provide that she shall be subject to this measure. That seems to be a strange way of determining the matter. I do not know the object of defining an Australian trade ship, unless by way of limitation. If we said that an Australian trade ship was any ship registered in Australia, I could understand it at once. But we say here first that an Australian ship is only to be a ship trading between certain ports, and then we provide that the term is to be applicable to a ship trading between Australia and other countries or among the States. </para>

I should like the Minister to explain in the first place why it was considered necessary to introduce this amendment, and, in the next place, what was the use of introducing it? It would appear that the Government are doubtful as to our rights and powers in this respect, and that, therefore, they have inserted the following extraordinary provision : - </para>

                        <para>- It is doubtless in consequence of that action of the High Court that the provision which I have quoted has been inserted. We must all be in sympathy with the desire to build up an Australian trade, but we must at the same time take care that we do not put people who engage in that trade in a very unfair position in competition with those foreign shipowners who trade with Australia. We provide in the new clause that Australian trade ships, when trading with other countries in competition with foreign ships, are to adopt certain scales of manning and accommodation, together with a multiplicity of other requirements. That is to say, we are going to put up these ships in competition with foreign ships with which we cannot interfere, and expect them to compete satisfactorily under such a handicap. I can quite understand a provision reserving the coasting trade for our own shipping, and setting out that if foreign vessels wish to participate in it, they shall conform to the conditions prescribed by our law. But here we are going beyond that in providing that a ship going abroad shall be bound by the conditions applicable to our coasting trade, although she will have to compete with foreign ships that are under no such obligation. Evidently, we are placing our shipping in a very unfair position. In clause 286 of the Bill it is provided that - </para>

                <para>I assume that when making a provision in regard to our coasting trade, we are acting within our competency. But it is a difficult matter when we insert a provision affecting Australian trade ships engaging in trade or commerce with other countries. Take a foreign ship trading between Australia and Fiji.

But here we are foolishly and unfairly harassing ships registered in our own country. It would be far better for them to register in some other part of the world than here. Indeed, it is much more satisfactory for shipping companies to register their vessels in England than in Australia. Some of our Commonwealth lines of steamers are registered in London. </para>

                        <para>- They do that in order to get cheaper labour to enable them to compete with other British ships on more favorable terms. Under this Bill, Australian trade ships would certainly not be able to compete against such vessels. If honorable senators are going to take this line of action, they will prevent our vessels from competing with foreign ships. We ought to consider very carefully to what extent we should place harassing restrictions upon our shipping, and whether it would not be much better to place only such restrictions upon it as may- be regarded as fair and reasonable, taking into consideration the nature of the trade and the. competition. We should not attempt to destroy the building up of a mercantile marine, because the great protection of any country is to have a mercantile marine which is not registered in other parts of the world, but in its own ports. Our duty is to consider carefully the competition our ship-owners have to meet ; they cannot keep the trade entirely to themselves, but must share it with other nations. Apparently, honorable senators on the other side desire to place the trade under such conditions as will render it impossible for a firm whose ships are registered in Australia to compete with the foreigner. </para>

                        <para>- Perhaps not. We can only legislate for the shipping of our own country. We cannot shut out the foreign competition  between Sydney and Fiji ; therefore, we ought to take such steps as will enable our ship-owners to meet that competition on the best possible conditions. If we handicap our own shipping, we cannot possibly build up a mercantile marine. We know that the Powers which are attempting to rival Great Britain subsidize their ships very largely. Our ships do not receive any subsidies, but they have to fight foreign competition in the best way they can. As the competition they have to meet is very unfair, I appeal to honorable senators on the other side to not make the position more difficult for them by imposing on them a further handicap. </para>

As regards the trade to Fiji, if it is an Australian-trade ship, it comes under the conditions of the Bill laid down for Australian-trade ships ; if it is a British ship, it comes under the conditions of the Bill laid down for British ships ; while if it is a foreign ship, it can only be controlled by the Bill in so far as it purports to deal with foreign ships. We know that in regard to foreign ships there is a serious limitation which the Bill does not  purport to overcome, and cannot overcome. Therefore, the possibility of competition between foreign and British ships does arise, but will not arise because of the passing of this measure. It exists to-day, and always has existed; but, nevertheless, British ships have been able to hold their own, and may continue to do so. I ask the Committee to agree to the amendment, because it clarifies the position. </para>

                        <para>- It deals with the accommodation for seamen, and their victualling. Now, these provisions are, to a certain extent, handicaps upon our ships, and we should do the best we can to minimize them to the utmost possible extent. Take, for instance, the question of accommodation. In our measure we require 140 cubic feet of space to be provided for each seaman. The British Act, 1 think, required 7 2  feet  until the space was increased. The Bill which was introduced here some years ago provided for increased accommodation. I forget whether it provided for 100 or 120 cubic feet. Certain ship-owners who were going to trade with Australia made provision accordingly, but now they find themselves confronted with the necessity of providing 140 cubic feet for each seaman. That is only one instance showing how the expenditure is being piled up against our own ship-owners. It would be far better, I think, to limit the Australian trade to Australian-trade ships within the waters which we may regard as our own. In Great Britain they have increased the accommodation considerably. A great deal of evidence was given some time ago as regards the necessity for that increased accommodation, and it was the extreme space which the Commonwealth Government adopted. Whilst I believe thoroughly in building up an Australian marine on fair and reasonable conditions, at the same time I do not want to handicap our own ship-owners when they are attempting to compete with foreign ships in waters where we have no authority. </para>

                        <para>- As regards the question of accommodation, would the honorable senator like to live, as the Imperial Act and some foreign laws lay down, in 72 cubic feet of space? He kicks up row enough now when he has to travel from Melbourne to Sydney in 200 cubic feet of space, and that for one night only. Fancy a man being cooped up in a compartment measuring 3 by 3 by .6 feet for three months. Not only has a sailor to sleep in 72 cubic feet of space, but he has to take his meals there, and do everything else that may be necessary. It is said that we are handicapping our ship-owners bv requiring them to provide 140 cubic feet of space. The statement is absolutely preposterous. We merely say to the shipowners &#34; If you treat your men decently we will give you some rights; we will reserve the coasting trade for you.&#34; I shall cordially support a provision that not only every coasting ship, but every ship which engages a man in Australia, shall have the benefit of the conditions laid down in the Bill, or better if possible. I do not think we are asking too much. In fact, the shipowners have virtually conceded everything which is provided for in the Bill, and a bit more. The food which is supplied to-day on our coast is worth 50 per cent, more than the food provided for in the Bill. I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> will help me to keep competitors off who are paying low wages, feeding the men badly, and providing bad accommodation.I shall give him an opportunity to say whether he is prepared to keep the trade for Australia, or to allow Dutchmen to come in and take our trade from us. I think that the Minister has satisfactorily explained why the clause is worded as it is. I realize the danger of passing the Bill without such a provision. When the first case was heard under the Seamen&#39;s Compensation Act, the Act was ruled <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires,</inline> on the ground that we had exceeded our constitutional power in one small particular. I think that the Government are wise in providing that if an unconstitutional provision is found in this measure of nearly  500  clauses, not the whole Act, but only that part shall be held to be invalid by the High Court. </para>

                    <para>. - Viewing this matter superficially, it is not difficult to understand the objection raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould,</inline> because an Australian-trade ship has to be viewed in two aspects. A ship may be engaged in trading between Australian ports, and between Australia and New Zealand or the Islands of the Pacific, and the same ship may be engaged in trading to other countries from Australia. Honorable senators will recognise that it may be necessary, on occasions, to extend the provisions of this Bill to an Australian-trade ship trading with other countries. We have examples of Australian ships finding profitable employment in taking miners from Australia to Klondike. To exclude an Australian ship, under such circumstances, from the operation of this Bill would be decidedly unfair to the Australian seamen employed on board the vessel. The company owning the vessel undertakes the voyage because it pays them well to do so; and it is only fair that the Australian seamen on the ship should derive some benefit from the profits which the owners expect to derive from such a voyage. We know that profitable charters can be obtained from Australia, and they are taken up by Australian-trade ships. It is not unreasonable that the Australian seamen engaged upon them should share to some extent in the profits reaped by the owners. </para>

                    It is entirely wrong to say that Australian- trade ships will be required to give only the same accommodation, rates of wages, and food as are supplied by foreign-owned ships. I think I made it perfectly clear, when contending, that we should not unduly handicap our ships, that if they were exempt, under certain conditions, from the provisions of this Bill, they would come under the Merchant Shipping Act, and so would be obliged to provide accommodation, rates of wages, and conditions very much better than those provided by foreign-owned ships.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline>
                    told the Committee that there is not a single clause in this Bill dealing with the question of wages. If he will look at the provisions affecting the coasting trade, he will see that before a ship can get a licence the seamen employed upon her are to be paid the wages ruling in Australia for seamen employed in the coasting trade ; so that we clearly do provide in this Bill for the payment of an Australian rate of wages to seamen engaged in vessels trading along our coast.

                <para class="block">This is consequential -upon amendments already agreed to substitutking 50 for 15 tons gross registered tonnage. The amendment is consequential upon one proposed to be made in clause 44. It is desired to permit a seaman on a river and bay ship, and a limited coast-trade ship of under 50 tons gross register, to be engaged by the master on board the ship, as is done at present, without having to go before a superintendent. The present system has worked well in the past, and,&#39; so far as is known, has never been abused. There is really no difference between the engagement of these men and the engagement of workers on shore, and there is consequently no necessity for the supervision and sanction of a superintendent. Provision is made in the Bill to prevent the practice of crimping, or shanghai-ing, by which men are signed on illegally for deep-sea ships. That is prevented by requiring their engagement to be made before a superintendent. It was never contemplated that such a provision should apply to river and bay ships. The amendment I am now propos-&#39; ing will exempt the small ships referred to from that provision. </para>

                    <para>. - I hope the Committee will not agree to the proposal. We have established a shipping office under this Bill for the protection of seamen, and if the amendment now proposed be agreed to, we might as well abolish shipping offices throughout the Commonwealth, and so effect a very considerable saving. The provision we have made for the protection . of seamen is necessary for every seaman who has to go to sea. </para>

                        <para>- Some of them will. A limited coast-trade ship may have a voyage of 400 miles, and men on board may be away from their home port for six months. I think that it is absolutely necessary that those agreements should be witnessed by a Government official. What is proposed now is that these men shall sign their agreements on board the ship. They will be witnessed by a clerk, or some agent of the ship-owner, and, though the men will be bound by them, the ship-owners will not. When we have established shipping offices, we should make use of them. It must not be forgotten that we impose a tax upon seamen in connexion with these agreements. A seaman must pay is. every time he signs on, and is. for every, discharge. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator&#39;s interjection has no application to what I am saying. We are dealing now with ships engaged in the coasting trade, and I believe that the proposal is suggested by the Free Labour Association, who want to employ men at their own offices, and&#39; prevent them being signed on at a shipping office. I may say that, so far as I can discover, there is no power under the Bill to compel a man to go before a superintendent. That has, in some way, been omitted, and an amendment in that direction is absolutely necessary. We make provision for a superintendent, but what he is to do I do not know. We should see that men sign articles before a superintendent who can properly explain to them the nature of the agreements they sign. </para>

Many of the men who sign on at Newcastle are foreign seamen, who do not understand the English language. They sign on for deep-sea ships, and may be taken advantage of, and it is right that their articles should be signed before a superintendent. In the matter of intelligence they are generations behind the Australian seamen. The case of -Australian seamen engaged in the restricted Australian trade, with which we are dealing in this clause, is quite dissimilar. </para>

                <para>This amendment is to remedy an omission in the Bill, The clause at present provides that the master may engage substitutes in the place of&#39; seamen who fail to join at the time specified in the agreement; that, is, newly engaged men ; but no provision is made for the engagement of substitutes in the place of any seaman already belonging to the ship who deserts at the last moment. The alteration, proposed is on the lines of the Imperial Merchant Shipping Act  1894,  section  115,  the New Zealand Shipping and Seamen Act1908, section  42,  and the Canadian Shipping Act  1906,  section  156. </para>

                    <para>. - Why this amendment should have been inserted I cannot understand. It is true that there was a similar provision in the Imperial Act of  1854,  but it was designed for sailing ships.  The  wages of the men were dependent upon the earnings of the ship, and they had to remain until the cargo was out. Sometimes men had to wait six months before they got their wages. But the present conditions are entirely different. When a seaman reaches the home port he can nowadays leave by giving twenty-four hours&#39; notice, whether the cargo is or is not out of the ship. The question of cargo has nothing to do with the right of the man to leave the ship. </para>

                        <para>- No ; this Bill prevents him, and says that he shall not discharge the cargo. I cannot for the life of me understand why the amendment was inserted. Just as a seaman can leave by giving twenty-four hours&#39; notice on reaching the home port, so the master can discharge a seaman by giving twenty-four hours&#39; notice. But under this amendment the master will be able to say, &#34; As the cargo is not out of the ship I cannot give you your discharge,&#34; and before twenty-four hours have expired the ship may be at sea again. The Committee will be &#39;well advised to reject the amendment, because I do not see any necessity for preventing a man from getting his discharge until the cargo has been removed from the ship. Under present circumstances, freight on cargo is generally paid as soon as the stuff is put on board. </para>

                        <para>- It was an award of the Court which provides that a seaman shall&#39; be entitled, in the home port, to be discharged upon giving twenty-four hours&#39; notice, whilst the master also can discharge a man by giving the same notice. There is not a word about cargo in the award. The form quoted is being used in shipping offices in Melbourne, and is to-day obsolete. Such a condition ought not to be put in. A seaman is entitled to his discharge, quite irrespective of whether the cargo is in the ship or not. Take the case of . a ship coming to Melbourne with a cargo of coal. Say that the owner thinks that it would be to his advantage to keep the coal in the ship for three or four weeks. Is he going to keep the crew three or four weeks before he discharges them? The award of the Court makes no reference to the discharge of cargo, but simply provides that a man shall be entitled to his discharge by giving twenty-four hours&#39; notice. </para>

If we are going to put into this Bill something which the Court has not included in its award we shall be overriding the award. </para>

                    <para>. - A definition of &#34; proper authority &#34; has been inserted in clause 5. It will be seen from the definition that where there is a superintendent - and there will be one at every port in Australia - he is the proper authority. Where there is no superintendent, as in foreign ports, it will be the British Consul, and where there is no British Consul it will be any reputable British merchant. This amendment will bring the clauses into agreement in that respect with the Act. It seems to me that it is the best arrangement that can be made, because it is obvious that we cannot appoint superintendents in foreign countries. I move - </para>

                        <para>. - The clause imposes a most unnecessary burden upon the masters of coasting ships. The Bill elsewhere requires that a change of crew shall, whenever possible, be made before a superintendent, and that returns shall be sent in of any substitutes engaged at the last moment, so that full information will be made available in regard to -these matters. We can safely make the amendment, and relieve ship-masters of an unnecessary hardship, because we shall have in the Bill the necessary safeguards on behalf of the seamen. </para>

                        <para>- I am getting the information in driblets. Further, why should there not be a proviso, similar to that which appeared- in . the original Bill, as to ships engaged in the coasting trade? Take the case of a vessel which leaves Melbourne for New Zealand. If changes are made in the crew, and a wreck occurs afterwards, with loss of lives, the relatives of those who shipped on the vessel - perhaps at the. last moment - will, seeing that no record is kept, be at a loss to know what has become of them. It is not right, I think, to deprive any persons of the possibility of identifying those who have gone to sea in a ship, no matter how small she may be. </para>

                    <para>. - If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> will read clauses 44, 45, and 46, he will see the exact process which is adopted in regard to all ships. He will find that an agreement has to be signed before the superintendent, and a record kept. And if he will refer to clause51, he will find that the agreement has to be exhibited, and that under clause 52, the master of a foreign-going ship is required, within 48 hours of his arrival in an Australian port, or upon the discharge of his crew, whichever first happens, to deliver the agreement of the superintendent, including any alterations which may have been made. Frequently changes occur just before a ship leaves on a foreign voyage. A desertion may occur, perhaps, when the tug is going off ; and then the information can be sent to the superintendent by the pilot. But if a ship clears out without her master furnishing the information, the ship can only be dealt with when she comes back. Like the provision in the Customs Act requiring the lockers on a ship to be sealed while she is within our jurisdiction, this provision cannot be enforced if the master of a ship breaks it just when he leaves port and never comes back. </para>

                    <para>. - I see no necessity for this clause or the proposed new sub-clause. If the master can make an agreement with a seaman for the allotment of the whole of his wages, it is unnecessary to put a provision to that effect in the Bill. The point is that the Bill will not compel the master to do so. If it did I should have no objection to it. It may be that a master will not agree to make any such allotment. A seaman may be engaged for a voyage which will occupy six months or twelve months, and if the master does not consent to make an allotment of his wages, his wife and family will have to wait for his money until his return. </para>

I take it that half of the seaman&#39;s wages is retained as a security that his agreement will be carried out, but under the clause it will be optional for the master to consent to an allotment of the whole of the seaman&#39;s wages. </para>

                <para>These amendments are designed to protect seamen in regard to deductions on account of moneys advanced and goods sold by the master. &#39; Unfortunately, there is reason to believe that unscrupulous ship-masters have sometimes practically forced men to desert, leaving a considerable amount in wages due to them. The masters have then manipulated the stores&#39; accounts and advance notes in such a way as to divert the wages due to the seamen into their own pockets. The &#39; amendments are calculated to prevent a continuance of such practices. </para>

                    - Insert the following new sub-clause :  - (1a) In cases where the seamen are engaged on time or running agreement on an Australian-trade or limited coast trade ship, all wages earned shall be paid monthly not later than the first day of each month, or thereafter within twenty-four hours after the ship first arrives at any port in Australia at which there is a bank.

                <para>The object of this and the following amendment is to make our intention more clear. Clause 76 is being omitted and inserted as a sub-clause of clause 75, to which it properly belongs- It is recognised that the various capitals of Australia are connected by telegraph, and banking facilities are available at many ports, and there is no reason why provision should not be made for the regular payment of wages on ships going round the coast. </para>

                    GOULD (New South Wales) &#91;6.10&#93;.- I find that wages are to be paid, monthly, and not later than&#39; the first day of each month. Under the clause which it is proposed to omit, provision was made for the payment of wages not later than the first or second day of each month. It is doubtful whether it is desirable to make the proposed amendment A ship may arrive at a port on the afternoon of the first day of the month, and there may be no opportunity for the master to obtain money to pay wages-

                    <para>. - I am afraid that Senators Chataway and Gould misunderstand the intention of the amendment. It simply prescribes the time within which wages may run. It is not a question of fixing a payday so much as fixing a period between one pay-day and another. It is usual on the Australian coast to pay seamen&#39;s wages monthly, and sub-clause 2 provides a reasonable time after the first of the month. </para>

                        <para>.- It is a little over two months since this motion was moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway,</inline> and during the day I have read the speeches made by himself and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley.</inline> My idea is that not enough precautions are taken in distributing the old-age pensions, especially in the larger towns. It is not so much the case in the bush. I do not blame the Government, but the system under which the money is handed over to the individuals, or to some persons whom they have selected for the purpose. There is no supervision as to the expenditure. It is the business of no one to see that the best use is made of the money. A great many of the pensioners are practically too old to be able to look after themselves. They have no friends or relatives, and very likely before the close of the day the money is gone, and they are in as bad a state as they were when it was paid to them. I suggest that the Government should inaugurate a system under which pensioners who are old or infirm could be assisted to look after themselves. Some pensioners are either broken down in health or their minds are not too strong, and the pension is wasted. Very often pensioners are found lying dead. It would not cost the country much to inaugurate a system under which a person would, upon the payment of the pension, undertake to provide the pensioner with food and look after him. </para>

                            <para>- No. In the press I read a report as to a publican who was brought before the Court. The evidence showed that the old-age pensioner used to hand over his money to the publican as soon as he received it, and drink in the hotel until the money was exhausted, and he was left without a shilling to look after himself. That is not what we want to occur. </para>

                            <para>- I know of scores of cases where it is not done. Under the Amending Act I believe that some reformation can be made, and the old people can be looked after better than they have been hitherto. The Government should, I think, take an interest in the old-age pensioners, and see that the money is really spent to their best advantage. It would be a boon to many recipients of a pension if my suggestion were adopted. I have read a report, I believe by the Commissioner of Police in Melbourne, in which it was stated that a number of old-age pensioners had been picked up dead, or dying, in the streets. My suggestion, if adopted, must tend to reduce the number of such occurrences, which really are a blot on the present system. Many old-age pensioners do not get value for the money, because they lack the ability to do so. I do not blame the Government for an unwise expenditure of the money in many cases, because they cannot foresee everything, but we have all seen proof of the folly of letting many old- age pensioners do what they like with the money. Many persons between seventy and eighty years of age are of weak mind, and cannot look after themselvess. At Dunwich Benevolent Asylum, in Queensland, there are generally from 1,200 to 1,500 persons. If they were let out and handed 10s. a week, what use could they make of the money? </para>

                    <para>Senators SAYERS. - A great many of them could not help doing so. I know of many cases of the kind. I do not suggest that these persons intend to make bad use of the money ; but they have not the will or the ability to spend it wisely. I have filled in the forms of many persons who cannot get the pensions simply because the police have reported that they have some means of subsistence. In one case, a man, whom I knew, brought me letters from the Mayor of the town, and -several persons who had known him for years, stating that because the old man still possessed an old rattledown buggy and a horse be could not receive an old-age pension.I  do  not think that that was the intention of the Government. It is the administration that is faulty; all these matters, however, could be rectified. The Government could possibly make an arrangement, preferably with some people outside, or, if necessary, with some institution, where an old man or an old woman could be looked after, well clothed, and given decent food. I believe that every member of Parliament would be pleased if old people, who have borne the heat and burden of the day, were granted the boon of entering either a private home or a well-managed institution. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. If a couple not quite so old, or some institution, agreed to look after an old-age pensioner, the Government should hand them the pension, and take steps, through the agency of the police, to see that the money is spent in the pensioner&#39;s interests. If a suspicion that the money was not being wisely spent should arise, the police could make an inquiry, and the Government could, if needed, direct a change of the arrangement. I believe that the method I have suggested would meet with the approval of the people of the Commonwealth, and every member of Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- I know of cases where an official has asked that the money should be paid into an institution, but that is not done. There is a sort of clashing. Prior to the enactment of this principle, every State was provided with an institution to which persons could be sent, but they were not allowed to stray away and return when they liked. A good many old people did not care to go into the institutions. I feel satisfied that if the Government will carry out my suggestion, they will fill a long- felt want, certainly in Queensland. I do not think that any one could . object to the inauguration of such a system. </para>

                        <para>. - There is not one member of the Senate who would offer a word, against the main idea underlying this motion, but certain considerations lead me to think that even if carried it would be practically useless. The Act contains some very wise provisions for the pensioners. Where pensioners have relatives, those persons are naturally regarded as their guardians. I know of a good many cases where the old-age pensioner is very well looked after indeed; but in the case of a pensioner without relatives we are up against another set of circumstances. Many men do not like to go into an institution, and feel quite vigorous enough to look after themselves outside. They believe that they are fully justified in using the pension just as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers</inline> and I consider that we are entitled to use our monthly allowance. I think that the pensioners have a right to feel that the money is theirs, and that they are at liberty to use it as they choose. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers</inline> desires that incapable pensioners should be cared for. We all desire that. The first step to take in caring for them is to see that they secure their pensions. If they are unfitted to be at large by themselves the Commonwealth is not in a position to enforce the law upon them,  because the police are servants of the States. The State authority is the one to set the police in motion. </para>

                        <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers,</inline> in speaking to the motion, has claimed that the Government should do certain things under the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act. I sympathize with the desire expressed by Senators Chataway and Sayers to protect improvident persons in receipt of invalid or old-age pensions. If provision had not been made in such cases under the Act the motion would have been more worthy of attention. I suggest to Senators Sayers and Chataway that they should read the Act. If there has been any laxity in connexion with this matter it is not the fault of the Act, because it sets out in the clearest of language what should be done in such cases. If Senators Sayers and Chataway are aware of any laxity of administration it would be better that they should direct the attention of the authorities to it, &#39;&#39;o that the provisions of the law may be fully enforced. Section 43 of the Act provides - (1.) Whenever the  Deputy  Commissioner is satisfied that, having regard to the age, infirmity, or improvidence of a pensioner or any other special circumstances, it is expedient that payment of any instalments of the pension be made to any other person, a warrant to that effect shall be issued by the  Deputy  Commissioner, and transmitted to the person authorized therein lo receive payment. (2.) Subject to the regulations and to the directions and limitations, if any, contained in the warrant, the person named therein shall be entitled on its production to receive payment of the pension. </para>

                            <para>- That question has nothing whatever to do with the motion before the Senate. I am aware that there are old people who are unable to fill in the form of application for a pension, and they have to get assistance to do it. But. I understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers&#39;</inline> complaint is that some improvident pensioners spend their pensions in a way in which they should not spend them. Some protection should certainly be provided for such persons, and it may be provided under the section of the Act which I have quoted. </para>

I have had considerable experience in connexion with the matter in Western Australia, and I know that pensioners have nominated other persons to receive their pensions for them in order that the money may be judiciously and wisely expended for the benefit of the pensioners. If the Act is not working well in Queensland, it would have been better for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers</inline> to make representations to that effect direct to the Commissioner in Melbourne. The Act is not as perfect, perhaps, as we could desire; but under section 43, provision is certainly made for the protection of improvident -and incapable pensioners. </para>

                        <para>. - The motion introduced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger last Thursday was to many of us like an old friend, because similar motions made their appearance in the Senate very frequently some time ago. In the early years of Federation, there was no more fruitful subject of discussion than the question of how we should deal with the State debts, and a number of interesting schemes for the purpose were proposed. We were accustomed to go into figures to estimate the savings that might be made by the consolidation of the State debts, lt was estimated that by a saving of 1 per cent, we should be able to wipe out the whole of the debt of Australia in a given number of years. We indulged in these fanciful pictures for a long time; but it has remained for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger to paint even a brighter picture than any which has heretofore been presented to the Senate by schemers, if I may so call them, because quite a number of schemes were brought under our notice. Notwithstanding the terms of his motion, and the reference to State debts which it contains, the honorable senator commenced with a declaration to the effect that there is no such thing as State debts in Australia. He quoted as an authority for that remarkable statement the present Premier of Victoria, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt.</inline></para>

We are told that it is nonsense to say that the various States of Australia have borrowed something like ^250,000,000, and are paying between ^8,000,000 and ^9,000,000 in interest upon them. It is all moonshine to say that the State of Victoria, in fifty years of self-government, has borrowed ^50,000,000, and has paid something like ^50,000,000 in interest upon&#39; that money. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator&#39;s reference to the matter may have been simply a little bit of legerdemain that he was playing on us, but he certainly painted a rosy picture - one, indeed, almost as rosy as his own complexion ! There is no getting away from the reality of the debts question. It is a very substantial one. . I regret that more has not been done towards the consolidation of these obligations. But we have to remember that the fault does not lie with the Federal Parliament. The Commonwealth is but one of two parties in this affair, and before a scheme can be propounded the other party will have to consent. Until the States move, and show an earnest desire to solve the problem, the Federal Parliament can do no more than has been done. If we turn to the reports of Conferences of State Premiers, we shall find that the matter of the State debts, if referred to at all, was mentioned in such a way as to put it into &#62;the background of the proceedings, and to leave it there. At the Brisbane Conference in  1907,  the Premiers objected to the State debts question being dealt with at all. </para>

                            <para>- If there were strong reasons, I fail to understand what they were. Certainly, those reasons do not exist to-day, because the Customs and Excise revenue matter has been settled pretty well for all time - at all events, for such a time that we may very well say that there is now plenty of opportunity for giving attention to other financial issues. In  1909,  a Premiers&#39; Conference was held in Hobart, when the State debts matter was not even mentioned. Towards the end of the same year there was another remarkable Conference held in Melbourne - a Conference which will go down to history as, perhaps, the most remarkable that has ever taken place in any country. Certainly, it - was the -most peculiar Conference ever held in Australia.. The Fusion party was the outcome of it. Not only did it bring the Fusion party into existence, but I think it was responsible for raising a question which was one of the factors in -driving the Fusion out of office. I am unable to say with certainty what was done regarding the State debts question at that Conference, for the simple reason that the proceedings took place behind closed doors. </para>

                            <para>- I am unable to say what was done. We were afterwards told that certain arrangements were arrived at, and I have no doubt that section  87  was dealt with. But, in regard to other subjects, we were totally in the dark.. The public were informed that the records were burned. Even the blotting pads were destroyed, in order that not the slightest atom of information should leak out to the public. </para>

                            <para>- There is no destroying of records or sitting behind closed doors at &#39;our Conferences. We publish reports, and at some of our Conferences even the reporters of the press of our opponents are permitted to be present. At all events, there is no getting away from the fact that at these Premiers&#39; Conferences the State debts matter was riot dealt with seriously. The next Conference was held at the beginning of this year, in Melbourne. The question was not even touched on that occasion. Nothing, therefore, has been done by the Premiers to bring this question forward. That being so, we must conclude that the Premiers had no desire to do anything to bring about a settlement. </para>

                            <para>- We have, as far as the Constitution can give us that power, but a great deal more than that is required before a satisfactory settlement can be effected. Surely the honorable senator would not say that, because we have power to take over the debts, we should proceed to do so without taking some power over the assets which the debts represent. These are considerations which can only be resolved upon by the people who owe the money, and who are responsible for paying it. They have the assets which the debts represent; and until they are agreeable to meet the Commonwealth and come to an understanding as to what assets we are to control to represent the debts for which we assume responsibility it is impossible for us to attempt to settle the question. </para>

It was not a new financial scheme as far as they were concerned. It was not originally proposed by them. It was proposed by the Labour Conference at Brisbane. A number of financial schemes were submitted to Parliament before that. Indeed, there was hardly a man in this Parliament laying claim to some knowledge of finance who did not propound a scheme. Proposals were put forward by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Harper, Mr. King</inline> O&#39;Malley, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knox,</inline> amongst others. But the only scheme propounded on the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> basis, and worked out clearly, was the scheme of the Brisbane Conference. </para>

                            <para>- Every one of the previous schemes which were condemned differed from the scheme ultimately laid before the people, and I repeat that it was the Labour Conference that propounded the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> scheme, and even went to the length of mentioning the sum of 25s. per head, which was ultimately adopted. The Premiers&#39; Conference, at Hobart, a few months later, adopted the Labour Conference scheme practically holus bolus. Really <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger should be more cautious in the claims which he makes for his party. He has no right to claim for them schemes which were put forward by others. It is true that his party was in office long enough. Some of its members posed as being great financiers. They used to lecture the unfortunate Labour party, and to refer to us as knowing nothing of finance. We could not, they said, be expected to propound a financial scheme for the Commonwealth. Nevertheless, I must insist, it was our party which brought forward the scheme which settled the question that has been referred to to-night. In submitting this motion <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger has occupied the time of the Senate to no very good purpose. </para>

He tells us that the question of the consolidation of the State debts, although mentioned in the Governor- General&#39;s Speech at the commencement of the session, cannot be dealt with until the States take action. Consequently, the reference in the Speech meant nothing. I have always been under the impression that when a Government submits its programme at the opening of a Parliament, the matters mentioned therein are considered to be subjects for legislation with which the Government is prepared to deal if time and opportunity permit. They are not supposed to be merely placards - things put in the shop windows - for the purpose of attracting attention. Apparently, however, the Government only included the paragraph in the Governor- General&#39;s Speech for the purpose of reminding somebody else of a power which exists in the Constitution. I do not know that

                        Ledger need be called upon to apologize for directing attention to the matter in what is practically the only way within the competency of one in his position. We know perfectly well that it would not be possible to deal with the question effectively by means of a Bill, and it is not within the competency of a private senator to submit a measure that would have any effect whatever.

We have had projects by individuals considered one after another. I believe that a proposal was made by a &#39;Labour Conference. Proposals have been submitted, first by one person, and then by another - with what effect? They have been submitted with no effect. Simply because not one of them has been regarded as a practicable proposal. What more reasonable, then, than that an honorable senator, in attempting to set forth his own scheme for the consolidation of the State debts, should say, &#34; Let a Royal Commission be appointed to inquire into the whole subject, and deal with the mass of valuable material which is now available&#34;? </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator raises another question when he asks what advice 1 would give. When the acceptance of the Constitution Bill was under consideration there was much argument used to the effect that, by consolidating the State debts, a great deal of money would be saved to the States in the way of payment of interest. If that saving will be effected, then a consolidation of the debts &#39;must be beneficial to every State. </para>

                            <para>- No doubt that statement was made. I have heard honorable senators talk of the Commonwealth consolidating the State debts and getting the whole of the money at  3  per cent. ; but, in my opinion, that is a dream; it is not practicable. We all know that to-day there would be  very little chance of consolidating the debts on anything like favorable terms to the States. It was only the other day that a State found, when it went into the market, that it could not&#39; get the money it wanted under  4  per cent. I know of a &#34; great municipality which, quite recently, found itself compelled, when it attempted to raise a loan, to pay over  5  per cent. The States find that, at present, they cannot borrow money on anything like as good terms as those on which the existing debts were incurred. We know that in the past States have borrowed at  3&#167; , 31,  and  3^  per cent. One can buy British consols to-day at such a rate as will give him from  31  to  4  per cent, on the money which he outlays. When we find that the British Government, with a first class security, cannot borrow money at a low percentage, we may depend upon it that the Australian States, whether they consolidate their debts or not, will not be able to borrow money on more favorable terms. We shall always have to pay a higher rate of interest than the British Government have to pay on their first-rate security. </para>

                            <para>- Yes; but my contention is that money has never been so cheap that there has been an opportunity to consolidate the State debts on a  3  per cent, basis. When the British consols were brought down to a  21  per cent, basis, it was not long before an investor could get <inline font-style="italic">&#163;100</inline> for his consol, which, at that time, was, possibly, a much&#39; more favored investment than it is in existing circumstances, because it belonged to a very limited list of securities in which trust moneys could be invested. The alteration of the law, and the consequent enlargement of this list, has been the means of deteriorating the value of British consols. I know that a dear old friend in the Senate has talked about Australian stock on a 3 per cent, basis; but my opinion  is  that if we attempted to convert at present any of the State debts into 3 per cent. Australian consols they would be found to sell at a very low price indeed ; and, instead of having to raise about ^250,000,000, we should probably have to raise about ^300,000,000. In such circumstances, there is no opportunity to do anything practical or valuable in the way of conversion. Another point to be considered is what debts is it proposed to convert. Originally the Constitution only empowered Parliament to take over from the States their public debts as existing at the establishment of the Commonwealth, and, consequently, debts subsequently incurred could not be taken over. But, as honorable senators will remember, the Constitution has been amended to enable the Parliament to deal with an additional amount of the State debts. Large  Bums  have been borrowed since that time, and I cannot say, off-hand, whether the Constitution would permit  us  to deal with those borrowings. </para>

Is it proposed to say to the States : &#34; In the future you shall not be permitted to borrow without the permission of this Parliament&#34;? Or are we going to say to them, &#34;Although we have consolidated the whole of your old debts,, and accepted the responsibility for the payment, &#39; you are free to borrow as much or as little as you please, without consulting the Commonwealth at all&#34;? One idea of the friends of consolidation was that we would have only one Australian debt; but, apparently, we are to have, not only one Australian debt, but a number of minor debts. Again, are we to take over any of the securities for the debts, or to say to the States, &#39; &#39; You have spent the money  in  building railways and  in  effecting large public improvements ; you keep these things, and we will take over your debts &#34; ? Now, what means shall we have to pay the debts eventually? We are now making a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> allowance to the States, and  it is  suggested that that allowance will, provide more than sufficient money to pay the interest on the debts which we are supposed to have consolidated. If we have a pay-day fixed at a future time, we shall have not only to&#62; make provision for the payment of interest,, but to establish a sinking fund, by means of which the debts will ultimately be extinguished. The whole subject bristles1 with difficulties, but I by no means suggest that my criticisms cannot be met or dealt, with on a satisfactory basis. It will  not be done, however, by. the efforts of any individual. The subject calls for the close attention of the keenest financial intellects in . the Parliaments of Australia,, and even they will have to be assisted by expert advice. Possibly some Treasurer may consider that he has sufficient knowledge to enable him to deal with the whole subject, and may submit a Bill to Parliament ; but, so far, we have not found&#39; any man in a position to do that. We have found men, however, in a position to offer ideas and make suggestions as to the best-.&#39; way of working out a scheme; always assuming that the consolidation of the Statements is desirable in the interests of the Commonwealth. But even these persons admit that theirs are by no means schemes-, which are unassailable, and will not require very great consideration before they can be adopted. It is a wise proceeding on&#171; the part of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger, if he regards the&#34; consolidation of the State debts as a proper work to be taken in hand, to submit this motion to the Senate. A Royal Commission, if appointed, could formulate a scheme, or come to some conclusion ; but the subject bristles with so many difficulties that I think it will be very many years?before it is tackled in an effective manner by the Commonwealth, whatever we or the States may think. It should be remembered, too, that, eventually, we shall have to meet the investors, and consider the scheme which they are willing to accept. We cannot force any scheme upon, them. On the contrary, we shall have to persuade them that our scheme will conserve, not only their interests, but also the interests of the Commonwealth and the States. I am quite willing to vote for the motion,-, leaving it to either the present or a succeeding Government to make up their minds. as to whether they will act upon the suggestion or not. </para>
