                        <para>The Minister of Home Affairs of the Commonwealth and the Solicitor-General of New South Wales conferred with the Statistician of the Commonwealth and those of the States of New South Wales and Victoria, and it was agreed that some improvement should take place in the counting of the Inter-State migration by railway, the change being that urged some time ago by the Prime Minister on the State Premiers. </para>
                        <para>It is understood that the Statisticians of New South Wales and Victoria are conferring regarding the alleged error in the figures previously supplied by the New South Wales Government to the Commonwealth Statistician for the purpose of the migration count. Until their report has been received by the Commonwealth Statistician it is not possible to form any opinion as to the accuracy or otherwise of the Electoral Statistics. </para>

                            <para>- Arising out of the answer may I ask the Minister if he or the Postmaster-General is aware that while news as to the details of the calamity was being anxiously awaited by relatives and friends throughout Tasmania and the other States the press were unable to obtain information until very late at night because of the ordinary rule as to the priority of telegrams, and will he in furnishing a reply advert to that particular circumstance? The question is being asked because the press were unable to obtain information until about midnight. In many instances it almost prevented them from bringing out their ordinary issue, to say nothing of the fact that relatives and friends could get- no information. </para>

The post and telegraph offices in that district were duly closed then, and the only means there was of communicating with the locality was through Queenstown. That is a circumstance which does not reflect very much credit upon the Department. </para>

The procedure laid down here will cause no inconvenience, but, on the contrary, will convenience the crew. I am&#39; informed that as regards the coasting trade, the steamship companies now have a practice which will make the amendment of the other House quite practicable and easy to carry out, and that as regards ships going to other ports, they always make arrangements to enable payments to be made there, and that the provision will not involve any hardship upon the shipping; companies in its present form. </para>

The failure to join at the last minute plays right into the hands of crimps. These men are always on the watch to offer substitutes for absentees, and to pass off deserters from other ships in port, and also numbers of incompetent men who in ordinary circumstances would not be accepted. Crimps get from 10s. to&#163;5 a head for men. The occupation is therefore highly profitable, and there is a direct inducement for them to carry on this work. The drugging pf men and filling them with drink, and putting them on board in a state of semi-insensibility occurs under this practice in supplying substitutes for men who fail to carry out their agreement. The amendment before the Committee is in line with the Merchant Shipping Act, and the New Zealand Act is framed on similar lines. I move - </para>

                        <para>- Exactly.I believe that under the law such men are liable to be taken summarily before the magistrate and punished. Of course, there is a proviso here about reasonable cause, but that means a lot of litigation. I think that the interests of the seamen ought to be fully safeguarded. Any one who has read the history of the merchant service of Great Britain can come to only one conclusion, and that is that there has been a great deal of brutality and sweating from the . dawn of the industry down to the present day. It behoves us in Australia to be exceedingly careful what we do in this connexion. The interests of the ship-owners are well looked after. </para>

                        <para>- I cannot find the reference at the present moment. I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> whether I am right or wrong, and will take his word for it. What I maintain is that the interests of the seamen should be protected as far as possible. The shipping companies are perfectly well able to look after themselves. If they want to keep men in their employment there is one way of doing it, and one only. That is by paying them fair wages, and treating them as human beings ought to be treated. I remember now, where I saw the reference about the &#163;2. It was in the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> in connexion with crimping at Newcastle. It appears that the British seaman is paid the magnificent wage of &#163;4 per month. </para>

I do not blame him. Every man is entitled to get as much for his labour as he possibly can. If British ship-owners object to men leaving ships in Australian ports the remedy is to pay them decent wages, and feed them as men ought to be fed. </para>

First, I direct attention to an amendment with which we shall deal hereafter, numbered 91 in the schedule. We propose to omit clause 212 of the Bill, and to insert a new clause, the first portion of which declares that any person who sends a. ship to sea in an unseaworthy state shall be guilty of an indictable offence.

                        <para>- The consideration as far as concerns a British ship cannot be dealt with in this Bill because it relates to a British, not an Australian agreement. When that seaman comes to Australia <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> says that, attracted by high wages here, he may wish to break his agreement. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> surely does not suggest that we should, in our law, lay down conditions to enable a seaman to break an agreement into which he has entered. If the honorable senator does not suggest that, our law is sufficient, because it provides that if the seaman does break his agreement he shall be liable to a penalty. The contention of the Department of Trade and Customs, on the advice of the Royal Commission, strengthened by evidence tendered at Newcastle, and by the knowledge of what the present practice is, is that this practice of desertion, and refusing to go to sea at the last moment, plays into the hands -of crimps in regard to foreign-going ships. It was proved before the Royal Commission that these. crimps watch foreign ships particularly, and that is why they do a lucrative trade in supplying substitutes at the last moment. Whilst it is true that there is a penalty upon a seaman who breaks his agreement under such circumstances, at the same time that very practice <inline font-style="italic">has</inline> led to crimping, which is against the best interests of the seamen themselves. </para>

I -wish to give an illustration : A few years ago a ship called the <inline font-style="italic">Melville Island</inline> arrived at Queenscliff. The men on board refused to proceed to sea in her, not because of her unseaworthiness, but because of the treatment which they had received on board, and of the condition of the provisions. The men were brought before the Court at Queenscliff. There were thirteen of them, as well as a stewardess. They were ordered to go on board, but they refused. The master then brought them before the Court in Melbourne where the case was tried by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Panton,</inline> P.M. They were sentenced to various terms of im- . imprisonment ranging from ten to thirteen weeks for refusing to go on board the ship. </para>

                        <para>- If the administration can be so bad, why give a magistrate such an opportunity? These men proved before the Court, to an absolute certainty,- that the rice with which they were supplied was half maggots, and that there was virtually no beef at all. The ship left South America absolutely short of provisions. I may relate my own experience : I once left Singapore on board a ship bound for Melbourne. We had sixteen days&#39; provisions on board. We were ninety-six days on the passage. If we had put into a port between Singapore and Melbourne, should I have been justified in refusing to proceed in the ship? The decision in the <inline font-style="italic">Melville Island</inline> case was that the men were not justified in leaving. The magistrate held that even if the men were starved, they had not a reasonable excuse for leaving the ship. The case cost the men something like&#163;200 before they were done with it, which they could very ill afford. We are told that the amendment is intended to prohibit crimping. The crimp did not enter into the <inline font-style="italic">Melville Island</inline> case at all. The men believed that they had, to all intents and purposes, a reasonable cause for not going on board the ship. </para>

                        <para>- Under the same circumstances, the same results could follow under this Bill. There is nothing to prevent it. If the amendment is intended to prohibit crimping, it will fail utterly. If on shore a man makes an agreement with an employer to work on a job, and does not like it after he has had a look at it, he can leave. But it is not so with the seaman. Generally he engages before he has seen the ship. Take the case of a ship lying at Queenscliff. The master engages a crew in Melbourne. A man has no opportunity of seeing the ship. He has no opportunity of knowing those with whom he is going to work. When he gets on board, he may find that the ship is not properly found, and that the officers are men with whom he cannot work.

                        <para>- No, I do not; but I contend that a seaman who joins a ship should be able to give twenty-four hours&#39; notice that he tends to leave, and he ought to be able to leave without incurring; a penalty. That is surely a very fair position. Honorable senators talk about ships being unseaworthy. Who is going to decide whether a ship lying in port is seaworthy or not? Every one who goes on? board a ship to make a trip believes her to be seaworthy. He takes his chance. But if a seaman says, &#34; Here is a ship with a list 25 degrees to port, I am not going to risk my life in her,&#34; he ought to have the right to go out of her if he likes, without incurring the risk of going to Pentridge. </para>

                        <para>- I have imported nothing into it. Say that a man signs on a ship&#39;s articles in Melbourne, and that he has to proceed to Portland to join the ship. He has never seen her, and does not know whether she is seaworthy or not. When he gets to Portland he finds that the vessel is badly found, and that her seaworthiness is very doubtful. It is proposed to provide by this Bill that no man can raise an objection to the seaworthiness of a vessel on his own account. He must get three others to join with him in order to raise such an objection. Where, then, is the seaman&#39;s individual liberty if he is not able to say, &#34; I doubt the seaworthiness of that ship, and I am afraid of my life to go on board her&#34;? </para>

                        <para>- Why should seamen be treated differently from any one else? If I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> to take up a case for me, he has the right, when he sees the case, to refuse to do so, and I say that when a seaman sees his case - and all that he sees very often is a few yards of canvas and a fire bar to keep him down - he should have the right to say,&#34; I signed on for the ship, but I do not like her, and I intend to get out of her.&#34; </para>

That is not a fair thing, and I ask the Minister to withdraw this proposal. The Minister says that the object is to prevent crimping, but, under this provision, we shall be punishing, not the crimp, but the victim of the crimp, and that is what we ought not to do. </para>

                        <para>- It was nothing of the kind. It was refusal to obey orders, because the men were in the ship, which was proceeding on her voyage when they refused to obey orders. Their reason for refusing was that they objected to the dietary scale. There is no doubt that they had reasonable cause for refusing to obey orders, and if this Bill had been law at the time, they would not have been convicted, and if a conviction had been recorded against them in a Police Court, an appeal against that conviction would have succeeded in any Supreme Court. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> makes the most rash statements. I am sorry to have to say that, in order to prove his case, he says things which he must know are not correct. He claims that I have said that we are trying to deal with the crimp in this provision. I never said so. What I said was that the practice of leaving things to the last moment tends to make the trade of a crimp a lucrative one. In clauses 26, 29, and 30, we have dealt with the crimp, and if we have not done so effectively the responsibility for that largely lies with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie,</inline> because he was a member of the Royal Commission who investigated the question of crimping, made certain recommendations which he signed, and which are embodied in those clauses. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator said that we are trying to deal with the crimp in this provision, and that instead of doing so we are penalizing the victim of the crimp. My reply to that is that if honorable senators will read clauses 26, 29, and 30, they will see that, acting on the recommendation of the Royal Commission, we have included provisions in this Bill dealing with the crimp and making crimping an illegal offence, and we provide penalties for it. I take the case suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie.</inline> A man signs an agreement in Melbourne to join a ship at Portland. When he sees the ship he finds that the food supply is not what it ought to be. Now, I ask honorable senators to refer to clause 116, which says - 1 16. - (1.) If three or more of the crew of a ship consider that their provisions or water arc of bad quality, or deficient in quantity, they may complain thereof to a superintendent, who shall examine the provisions and water or cause them to be examined. (2.) If the superintendent, or person making the examination, finds that the provisions or water are of bad quality or deficient in quantity, he shall, by writing, require the master to provide provisions and water of good quality, o; sufficient in quantity, as the case may be, and to cease to use or supply to the crew any provisions or water found to be of bad quality, and the master shall comply with the requisition. </para>

                <para>Penalty :Twenty pounds. (3.) The superintendent or person making the examination shall enter the result thereof in the official log-book. (4.) If the superintendent or person making the examination certifies that there was no reasonable ground for the complaint, each of the complainants shall be liable to forfeit out of his wages a sum not exceeding one week&#39;s wages. </para>

I know the difficulty which was experienced by the seamen on the <inline font-style="italic">Melville Island.</inline> Why should not a seaman individually enjoy the same right as any other workman who sells his labour? It is an exploded idea that a seaman&#39;s occupation differs entirely from other avocations ; but he has always been treated differently from other workmen. </para>

                        <para>- It was an Imperial law under which the crew of the <inline font-style="italic">Melville Island</inline> were brought before the Court. The conditions on the vessel were such that they all united in a complaint when the opportunity arrived. The Queenscliff magistrate recognised the reasonableness of their complaint, and refused to comply with the demand of the captain that they should be sent on board. Not content with that decision the captain came down to Melbourne and lodged a complaint at the City Court, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Panton</inline> decided that the crew had no reasonable cause for their action, and the men were ordered to undergo certain punishment, to be incarcerated in a gaol, leaving the gaol at 8 a.m. next day, and to be delivered on the ship. Recognising the injustice of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Panton&#39;s</inline> decision, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> Wolff came to the rescue of the men, and practically took up their case, but the Governor of the gaol refused to admit him to take the affidavits of the men against their deportation. If he had not been able to secure a magistrate by 7 o&#39;clock next morning the men would have been deported, and put on the <inline font-style="italic">Melville Island</inline> against their will. </para>

                        <para>- After the crew of the <inline font-style="italic">Melville Island</inline> got the decision of the Queenscliff magistrate in their favour, they were&#39; helpless, because their wages were retained by the master. As they had not a shilling no lawyer was prepared to take up their case. During the whole of the time they were bandied about they had absolutely nothing. Suppose that ten or thirteen men cannot be brought into line, or that some influence is at work, what is likely to happen? One man may have a little more temerity than the rest of the crew. He may feel that he has no right to be subjected to a certain condition, but under this Bill he cannot withdraw from his engagement without suffering punishment and fine. </para>

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline>
                    proposes to do. We have had a long discussion, and the honorable senator has roamed all over subjects which are in no wise affected by this very simple prevision. No doubt he has instanced cases of very great hardship, both individually and collectively, but do his remarks apply to the clause?
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barker</inline>
                    has given us the history of the
                    <inline font-style="italic">Melville Island</inline>
                    case. What does it show ? It shows that the law was ample to protect the men, but that there had been a misapplication of the law by a magistrate.

                        <para>.- At the cost of a great deal of money. But no matter what law may be passed, there may be a misinterpretation or a misunderstanding of it by magistrates. Circumstances may arise subsequently which show that a mistake was made, and the case is then taken to a higher Court, which points out what the law really is. I recognise the hardship of seamen having to incur a large expenditure, being placed in a false position, and being sent to gaol even for a limited period. But can we frame a law in such a way that there can be no mistake or misinterpretation of it? No reason has been shown why we should not make provision for these cases. Take the case of a ship which has engaged her complement of seamen and is ready to go to sea at a certain hour. At the last moment two or three members of the crew say that they do not like the look of the ship or the appearance of the skipper or the mate or the boatswain or the cook, and, therefore, they will not go with the ship. Is it reasonable to allow any seaman to take up that attitude? In such a case what is the position of the master? He cannot go to sea without his proper complement and he may lose valuable engagements in consequence of the conduct of members of his crew. </para>

A ship cannot be allowed to go to sea unless the authorities are satisfied that she is seaworthy. If any seamen consider that a ship is not seaworthy they can make representations to that effect, and then the authorities will take action. They will insist, if necessary, on a survey being made before the ship is allowed to go to sea and a certificate to that effect being furnished.

It is most unreasonable for any honorable senator to take exception to a provision of this character. I think that the Minister has pointed out very clearly that the provisions of the Bill will meet the various objections raised by
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie.</inline>
                            A man who deserts is liable to a penalty, and a man who declines to join his ship after he has engaged is liable to a penalty. Why should we say that in one case the man shall be punished but that in the other he shall go free? If honorable senators can define a reasonable cause of failure to join a ship I shall offer no objection to the definition being put in the Bill. If they choose to say that if a seaman indicates that he has changed his mind, and does not want to go to sea, or that he does not like the look of the cook or the skipper, that shall be deemed to be a reasonable cause of failure to join the ship, welland good.

                        <para>- It would be absurd to strike out the clause, because then there would be no penalty provided, and a man could at the last moment, and, without any earthly reason, refuse to join his ship. This Bill is a very great advance in many ways upon the Merchant Shipping Act. Honorable senators should not consider that we have only one class in the community to deal with. We have to consider the interests of the owner and the shipper. We cannot build up a mercantile marine unless we consider the interests of all classes. I warn honorable senators that if they pass a Bill which is absolutely one-sided, they will act most unfairly, and will not do any good, because they will be destroying, instead of building up, a mercantile marine. Ship-owners will say, &#34; We will not register in Australia ; we will register in Hamburg, or some other foreign port.&#34; They will do this to get rid of many of the restrictions that are embodied in this Bill in the interests of seamen. </para>

There are many things which the Imperial Parliament might desire to enact in reference to navigation ; but they cannot do so as tar as concerns foreign shipping. We shall be committing a wrong if we legislate in such a way as will deprive this country of the opportunity of building up a mercantile marine of its own. I would sooner see ships which trade with Australia registered in Australia than elsewhere. But we cannot compel them to do so; and if we attempt the task we shall find ourselves involved in all sorts of difficulties. We may even involve the Mother Country in difficulties of which we shall have to share the responsibility. I trust that honorable senators will consider the clause in a reasonable spirit, and recognise the fact that many interests have to be borne in mind. If we allow a man to refuse to sail after engaging with a ship, and without reasonable cause, we shall make a serious mistake.

There may be unreasonable provisions in this Bill, but this amendment is most reasonable.

                    <para>. - My contention is that if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie&#39;</inline> s position were maintained, it would be a move in the direction of encouraging the breaking of agreements of any kind whatever. If a seaman is to be free to leave a ship, and the ship-owner at the same time is to be free to discharge him, I do not see much necessity for entering into agreements at all. In the present case, if a seaman does, for the reasons stated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie,</inline> leave a ship, the very best safeguard we can have is to maintain the clause as it stands. If a seaman thinks that a ship for which he has signed articles is unseaworthy, and refuses to sail in her, the matter will be brought under the notice of the Minister, who will instantly take action. But, on the other  hand,  if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie&#39;s</inline> wish is carried into effect, it may mean that the seaman who is convinced that the ship is unseaworthy will leave her, and that other seamen, not so vigilant, will be taken on board. In that case, there will be no action by the Minister at all. If we maintain the clause as it stands, the mere fact of a seaman objecting to go to sea on account of the unseaworthiness of the vessel will call attention to her condition, and the Minister will have to set the law in motion to find out whether or not the ship is unseaworthy. </para>

                        <para>- If we follow the course suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie,</inline> it simply means that a sailor who signs on a ship, and, having had a look at her, determines to leave her, will walk ashore, and nothing more will be heard about the matter. The law will not be set in motion. In that case, the master will engage the services of another man, and the unseaworthiness of the ship will not be brought under the notice of the authorities. Consequently, there will be fewer safeguards than by maintaining the clause in its present form. Therefore, the course recommended by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> would be exceedingly foolhardy. Although the clause may involve temporary hardship, it will, nevertheless, lead to calling attention to the unseaworthiness of ships, and will, in that sense, do great good. I shall vote for the clause, because I think that it will tend to prevent unseaworthy ships going to sea. </para>

                    <para>. - The whole point of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch&#39;s</inline> argument is that a seaman may object to go to sea, and that his objection may bring the unseaworthiness of the ship under the notice of the Minister. But the honorable senator forgets that the seaman will render himself liable to a penalty. The honorable senator knows perfectly well that when he himself was going to sea, the mere fact of knowing that a penalty was hanging over his head induced him to put up with things rather than face the consequences. The Minister has alleged that I made a wrong statement concerning the Imperial law. I did not. I asserted that the Imperial Act of1906 did not impose any penalty upon a seaman who refused to join his ship. The Minister asserted that there is no such provision. I say that it was the Minister who made a wrong statement. The Imperial Act of 1906 provides that if a man fails to join his ship the superintendent may withhold his previous discharge. But there is no penalty. </para>

We, however, are making provision for punishing a sailor where there may have been no misconduct, but simply inadvertence.

                        <para>- If a seaman does not pay the fine of &#163;20, what will happen? The Minister says that under this Bill we shall abolish imprisonment, but we provide for it in another way. As a rule, a seaman has no goods upon which distress can be levied, and in such a case he will have to go to prison. So that we have not abolished imprisonment. I hope that if the Minister will not withdraw this proposal altogether he will submit something in the nature of the provision to be found in the Merchant Shipping Act. </para>

                    <para>. - We have had a good deal of discussion upon a question for which I thought we had. arrived at a reasonable solution. So far as foreign seamen are concerned, I do not think that any Bill ever introduced in any Parliament contained greater safeguards than are provided by this measure. I say foreign seamen advisedly, because it is not necessary in this connexion to consider very seriously the position of seamen engaged in our own coastal trade. They will scarcely come under these provisions at all, because there is practically no desertion from the Australian coasting boats. </para>

                            says that a seaman will have great difficulty  in  getting his complaint properly stated before a Court. But in this Bill we provide that, if a man has a legitimate complaint, he has only to announce the fact to the master of the ship, and every facility must &#34;be afforded him to go ashore, and make his -complaint in the proper quarter. The honorable senator has referred to what has happened recently, but he overlooks the fact that nothing has been changed since the time the Royal Commission inquired into this matter. * What happened in the past and what happened recently occurred under laws very different from this Bill. There is as much difference Between the navigation laws existing in the various States and this Bill as between chalk and cheese, and in view of the safeguards provided in the interests of foreign seamen, I am at a loss to understand how any  reasonable  person can condemn this measure. We could scarcely go further unless we decided to wipe out all agreements between ship-owners and seamen, and, so far as I know, no such proposal as that -has ever been suggested.

Some cases have only to be stated to show that they are reasonable, but it is often difficult to prove that a reasonable case is reasonable.

                        <para>- I am not speaking to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger, but to honorable senators generally, who have more sense than the honorable senator. I can speak with wide experience, and I say that if there is an unreasonable class of men who are open to the influence of class bias, it is the magistrates of the country. So long as we have such a class administering the laws of this country, there can be no justification for putting more work in their hands than we can possibly prevent.  1  arn very glad to say that in many respects this Bill is a big improvement upon the existing State navigation laws, .but, in my opinion, it was immeasurably .better before the House of Representatives amended it. The members of the  Government in the Senate very naturally will not oppose the amendments carried in the Bill in another place. There may be good and reasonable magistrates, but -I have never had the good fortune to meet them. The magistrates are, as a class, the most objectionable I know of in this country, both honorary and paid, and I happen to be an honorary magistrate myself. Taken as a class, they have no sympathy with the poor and distressed. Whatever the facts in a case may be, where the well-fed and prosperous employer is on one side, and the needy and probably illiterate worker is on the other, the worker goes down every time. I therefore say that wherever it is possible, we should enact definitions from which they cannot escape, and wherever that cannot be done, the law should be left as loose as possible. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> suggested that we should define what is a reasonable cause, but to do so would be to exclude everything that was not included in the definition, and that might be most unreasonable. At the same time, we should take it out of the hands of the ordinary paid magistrates to decide such questions. There might not be so much objection if we had a tribunal that would know something about the shipping business. </para>

My complaint against the law is that when mistakes occur, the people in high authority never have to suffer for them. Honorable senators opposite, and, unfortunately, some on this side, tell us that it is human to be fallible, and that the poor devils of seamen will have to put up with these mistakes. They say that they should take their gruel, and say nothing about it. </para>

                        <para>- It is all very well for the honorable senator to talk about the prison population. It would be more to the point if he could say how many of those who are responsible for the prison population do not better deserve, because of their own criminal instincts, to be in prison themselves. It is impossible to draw a hard and fast line between the criminals who are in gaol and the criminals who ought to be there, but who have had sufficient cunning to escape gaol. In these cases, points might arise which could not be easily understood by persons without a personal knowledge of the shipping business, and the decision in such matters should be in the hands of persons who can at least understand what a seaman puts forward as the excuse for his action. Surely, the failure to join a ship should not, as is proposed, be penalized to anything like the same extent as desertion from a ship at any port of call, while she is on a voyage, when the difficulty of replacing the deserter might endanger the safe passage of the ship. Under this Bill, desertion is penalized to the extent of the forfeiture of a seaman&#39;s wages, or a fine up to &#163;20, and failure or refusal to join the ship is to be treated as an offence of similar gravity. That seems to me to be quite unreasonable. I think it was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> who said that agreements would be quite useless, if they might be terminated at a few hours notice by either side. As a matter of fact, an agreement might be equally valuable if it were terminable at a moment&#39;s notice, because it would prescribe the conditions under which the employment is carried on, while it continues in force. The Minister of Defence made a reference to shearers, and said that a number of them require to join in a complaint to justify them in ceasing to work. I do not recollect anything of the kind in any shearing agreement that- I ever saw. But I do know that agreements with shearers are terminable at very short notice, and employers sometimes find  no difficulty whatever in sacking men at a moment&#39;s notice, and they have not to consult anybody in doing so. </para>

                        <para>- In the practical carrying out of the agreement, there is no difficulty in a squatter or his agent getting rid of a shearer at a moment&#39;s notice, for the simple reason that, while the agreement technically protects the interest of the shearer, puts him on the same footing as the other man, yet, incidentally, through there being no standard of work fixed, he can allege that the work is not being done to his satisfaction, and the man has to go. While the shearer cannot leave without consent, the employer can discharge him without his consent or wish, in spite of all agreements or awards. Probably, under this Bill the big end of the stick will be in the hands of the employer, even although, technically, it gives the same rights to one side as to the other. If we are to have a penalty for failure to join a ship, we should have a more reasonable tribunal than an ordinary police magistrate to adjudicate. I mean somebody who is more in sympathy with and better understands the wants of the sailor. The penalty is out of all proportion to the offence, and, if it is not too late, I suggest that the amount should be considerably reduced. </para>

The honorable senator could have appealed for the protection of the  Chairman  against what he considered to be an improper imputation by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen.</inline> He did not take that course, but took a course which is against the Standing Orders. I appeal to him not to put myself and the Senate in a position which is most disagreeable. Surely he can see that he will be fully protected if he withdraws this statement, and I appeal to him to do so, otherwise I must take a certain course. </para>

I have no option but to name <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> to the Senate, and he now has the right to say whether he is prepared to withdraw the statement. </para>

                <para>In my opinion, as Chairman of the Committee, after an incident of the character that occurred has closed, the proper procedure to be followed is to proceed with the business before the Committee. I. therefore, refused to  ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> to withdraw the statement that  had been  made  by  him concerning <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> in the previous  argument,  because it  seemed  to me that if I  did  that  we  should  never  reach finality. After  an  incident of  that kind  has been  declared  closed,  and  the Committee proceeds to business, we should never get finality if any other honorable senator could get up and ask that another honorable senator should withdraw something that had been said previously. I intimated to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> that, in my opinion, it was not in order to refer to the previous incident, but I told him that if he still took exception to something that had been said by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> there was a proper and correct method of referring to it. Taking the Standing Orders generally, and interpreting them in the interest of the conduct of business, I think I was right in declaring the incident closed, and in not permitting further reference to be made to it. Standing order  419  is very brief, but at the same time very definite, on this point. It says - </para>

                        <para>-  I should like to offer a few observations on the objection to the Chairman&#39;s ruling. I am of opinion that the ruling should be disagreed with. Our Standing Orders strictly provide that when an honorable senator offends against them he may be called upon by the  Chairman  to withdraw and apologize for any expression which was out of order. Every member of the Committee of the Senate, must, therefore, look to the  Chairman  for that protection which is his due. In the dispute which occurred before the lunch adjournment, a certain statement was made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> which was resented by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae. Senator Rae</inline> not only regarded the statement as inaccurate, but characterized it by a stronger expression. When he was called upon, very properly, <inline font-style="italic">by.</inline> the  Chairman  to withdraw that expression, he said that he would do so provided that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> who made what he regarded as a very inaccurate statement also, withdrew that statement. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe,</inline> as  Chairman  of the Committee, assured <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> that he would have the protection of the Chair, but a condition precedent was that he should obey the ruling of the Chair, and withdraw his expression to which exception was taken. I agree that the  Chairman  of Committees took a very proper course in carrying out his duties. Ultimately, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> did not withdraw or apologize to the Committee, and he is now enduring the punishment meted out to him by the Senate for having disregarded the direction of the Chair. I have nothing to complain of up to that. But I want to know why, when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe&#39;s</inline> attention as  Chairman  was drawn to the matter afterwards, he did not carry out his promise, and &#34;exact the same reparation from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> that he exacted from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae.</inline> The fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen&#39;s</inline> statement was regarded as offensive by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> is proof positive that it should be withdrawn. </para>

But because <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> did not comply with the Standing Orders, is that any reason why <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> should be allowed, without punishment, to break them as he likes?

                        <para>-  I say emphatically that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> was guilty of a breach of the Standing Orders, because he made a statement which was regarded as offensive by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae. Senator Millen</inline> will not accuse me of trying to misconstrue anything he said. I listened very carefully to the honorable senator, and to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae&#39;s</inline> speech, and I say fearlessly that the construction which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> placed on the utterance of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> was a very clever and entirely inaccurate representation of what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> really did say. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> regarded it as offensive, the  Chairman  of Committees should have carried out his promise, and should have given <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> that protection which was as much his due as was the punishment imposed upon him for disregarding the direction of the  Chairman.  I hope that honorable senators on both sides will see that a fair deal is meted out to; every member of the Senate. It has occurred more than once in this chamber that insinuations from the other side, which have been regarded as insulting and provocative of a breach of the Standing Orders on this side, have been totally disregarded, and no punishment has been inflicted upon the offenders. At the same time, honorable senators on this side have had, colloquially speaking, to toe the mark, to mount the penitent stool, and endure the punishment meted out by the Senate. If that kind of thing is to continue, honorable senators on this side will labour under a sense of grievance. </para>

                        <para>-  If we are to be deprived of the protection of the Chair when honorable senators opposite make all sorts of statements about us, we shall have to enforce protection for ourselves. I am  pleading that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe,</inline> as  Chairman  of Committees was wrong in the action which he took on the <inline font-style="italic">point</inline> of order raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner. Senator Gardiner</inline> wished to know whether the Standing Orders were to be enforced with regard to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> as well as with regard to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae.</inline> I think the honorable senator took the right course in raising the point, and that the  Chairman  of Committees made a mistake in refusing to take the action which, I think, was demanded of him by the Standing Orders. .1 support the objection to the ruling of the  Chairman. </para>

                        <para>- I should like before the discussion goes further to correct what appears to me to be a wrong impression in the minds of some honorable senators with respect to a position of this kind. It is evident that some friction has occurred. There have been hot words used. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> made some remarks in his speech which induced <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> to use questionable language. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> or any other honorable senator, made any remarks which were objectionable to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae, Senator Rae</inline> should have risen in his place and called the attention of the  Chairman  of Committees to them.  I am told that he did so, but I say that that was not done until <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> had applied to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> an objectionable expression. It was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> who first called the attention of the  Chairman  to words which were to him objectionable. In the circumstances, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> was out of court, because he took the law into his own hands. My sympathy is with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> as much and more than it is with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> who generally has an advantage on account of his coolness. He does not get into such a temper as some other members of the Senate do. They lose their heads, and take the law into&#39; their own hands. </para>

                        <para>- The Vice-President of the Executive Council will no doubt withdraw the words to which exception has -been taken. But if he had said that honorable senators sometimes get excited, that would have amounted to the same thing. As objection is taken to the statement that honorable senators lose their, heads, I ask the Vice-President of the Executive Council to withdraw the statement. </para>

                        <para>- I have no desire to continue the debate at any length. I say that when an honorable senator uses expressions which are objectionable to another, the honorable senator objecting to&#39; their use should take exception to them there and then. It is not the business of other honorable senators <inline font-style="italic">to do so.</inline><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> did not take exception to what was said by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> until after he had used an objectionable expression towards that honorable senator. If he had done so before that,- he would have been in court. As he first took the law into his own hands he did wrong. If an honorable senator objects to any statement made, he should do so at once. If that course was not laid down I might, on being called to order next week, ask that some other honorable senator should withdraw something which was said last week. Such a thing would be ridiculous. I hope that in future if any honorable senator makes use of words which are regarded as offensive by another, attention will be called to the fact straight away, arid honorable senators will not retaliate upon others in their own way. Otherwise they ought to recognise that they are out of court. I hope that the little breeze which has taken place to-day will be like the recent storm, and bring about a few nice, quiet, peaceful days. </para>

                        <para>- Having taken exception to the ruling of the  Chairman,  I wish to make a statement. I have not taken this course out of sympathy with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae.</inline> but in the exercise of my rights under the Standing Orders. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> used language which, I may say incidentally, was not objectionable, but justifiable, towards <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> I rose to take exception to the language used by the latter ; and the  Chairman,  having called upon <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> to withdraw his statement, refused to hear my objection. The objection I took was that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> had used language of an offensive kind, and I wished to put that matter before the  Chairman,  but he refused to hear me, because he said that he could deal with only one matter at a time, and that was the withdrawal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae&#39;s</inline> harsh statement - harsh as some persons think, but true, as I think. </para>

                        <para>- All right, sir; I withdraw the statement, because I do not want to get out of order, or to provoke de bate. The position I rose to take was that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> had made a statement which was not only objectionable to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae,</inline> but was objectionable to, and resented by, all honorable senators on this side ; but the  Chairman  refused to hear me, because he had called upon <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> to withdraw a statement, and could deal with only one matter at a time. The incident was continued by the vote which excluded <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae.</inline> Immediately <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> resumed his speech in Committee, I waited for a little while to see if a withdrawal was forthcoming, but after he had uttered two or three sentences, I found that he was not going to withdraw his statement. I then asked the  Chairman  to call upon the honorable senator to with-draw the statement to which objection had been taken, not only by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae,</inline> but by myself, and he ruled that the incident had passed. I claim that my only opportunity to take exception to the statement was the occasion when I did. When I rose before, I was ruled out of order because the  Chairman  was dealing with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> as an offender against a rule of the Senate. When I rose on the second occasion, it was only after a sufficient interval had passed in his speech to find out that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> did not intend to withdraw the statement. It has been the custom, sir, when an honorable senator makes a statement to which exception is taken, not only by the honorable senator to whom it is addressed, but by the Senate itself, that that statement must be withdrawn, and, therefore, I hold that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> should be called upon to withdraw his statement, which was most objectionable, and to put it mildly, a misrepresentation of the truth. </para>

Immediately the matter cropped up in the Senate, I rose to ask your ruling, but you did not see the necessity to give a ruling at the time. I desire to know, sir, whether it is the presiding officer or the senator to whom a remark has been applied who has to determine whether it is - offensive, and must be withdrawn ? Suppose, for instance, that I apply to an honorable senator a remark which I consider mild and inoffensive, but which he regards as offensive, must the opinion of the senator, or that of the presiding officer, prevail? i can see that if every little remark which is made across the floor has  10  be withdrawn at the request of the honorable senator to whom it has been applied, the proceedings of the Senate will come into ridicule. </para>

                        <para>- I should like the permission of yourself, sir, and the Chamber, to make some remarks, a few of which, although I think necessary for the elucidation of the position, may perhaps be slightly outside the scope of the specific question before the Senate. I want to remind you, sir, and the Senate, of the circumstances which led to the present position. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> made a speech, and I followed him. I ask the Senate to accept the assurance, which I make now in all sincerity, that, in endeavouring to summarize his speech for the purpose of basing an argument upon the summary - whether I did so accurately or not is a matter of opinion - I thought that I was doing it accurately. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> had the right to take exception to my remark there and then, and ask me to withdraw it. But. instead of doing that, he launched an accusation which was tantamount to a charge that I had told a deliberate lie. I asked then, sir, that that remark should be withdrawn, and you know what followed, I admit at once the force of the standing order which calls upon any honorable senator who has used words outside the Standing Orders to withdraw them. I should have no hesitation now, or at any time - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> having pointed out to me that I have incorrectly stated his argument - in withdrawing my remark or asking for a correction. The reason I did not do it when the Committee resumed was because <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> was absent. If honorable senators will turn to the record in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> when it appears - I have not seen it - they will find that I specifically referred to the fact that I preferred not to continue that portion of my address in his absence. I had intended, when he was present, to explain to him, sir, as I tried to do when you were in the chair before, but which I was interrupted in doing by an objection, that I had no wish to misrepresent his words, and that, if I have been inaccurate, I would withdraw anything to which he took exception. The opportunity was denied to me before. I thought it better to wait until <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> was present, in order that he could say what it was that he objected to, and could be present when I made an explanation. Whilst I am quite willing, when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> is present, or at any time, to do the fair and reasonable thing by any honorable senator, may <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> finish with an appeal to honorable senators, for the credit of the Senate, to take the view I am trying to emphasize - that we owe something to the Chamber and to ourselves - and not to make a storm in a teapot over what, after all is said and done, is only a little misunderstanding between two honorable senators. </para>

                        <para>- I -wish to emphasize the point made by the Vice-President of the Executive Council, and that is, that the offending senator has placed himself out of court. I trust that the Senate will stand loyally by the  Chairman,  for the simple reason that he promised the protection of the Chair to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae,</inline> who, however, took the law into his own hands. In the circumstances, I think that we are in duty bound to stand by the ruling of the  Chairman. </para>

It is, of course, regrettable that there should be any trouble in regard to the behaviour of any honorable senators in the Chamber. I want honorable senators to realize that the Standing Orders exist for their protection, and that it is desirable that, when any trouble arises, it should be dealt with immediately, and the decision of the Chair should be obeyed, whatever it may be. I submit, sir, that standing order 419, coupled with the statements which have been made to you, must show abundantly that exception was not taken at the right time, and that the  Chairman  had no alternative but to go on with the business in the way he desired. </para>

                        <para>- I am pleased if, in one sentence, I have concentrated a statement of the whole position. I may mention, without trying to add fuel to the flame, that some time ago, when I thought that an expression was out of order, I rose to order at once, and pointed out that an honorable senator on the other side was probably disorderly. The matter was settled in about ten minutes, and I hope that, in the circumstances, this matter will be settled now. </para>

                <para class="block">In this case, apparently, the words objected to were not asked to be taken down. I do not know what the words were. I do not know whether the  Chairman  of Committees knows what they were. The words should have been taken down immediately, and the senator who used them should at once have been asked to withdraw them. This is a very peculiar case, because the honorable senator who first took exception to the words used did not do what the standing order requires; and when the matter was brought up again it does not appear that any one could have stated what were the words which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> was desired to withdraw. The  Chairman  of Committees has stated that, in his opinion, it would be impossible to reach finality if senators were allowed to bring up matters affecting an incident after it had been closed. I realize that difficulty, and also the difficulty that the words objected to were not taken down. Under the circumstances, I do not see that it is possible to do anything but uphold the ruling of the  Chairman  of Committees. Honorable senators know what the Standing Orders require. They are aware that an objection to words must be taken at the time, and will not afterwards be entertained. I, therefore, have to rule that the  Chairman  of Committees was right in this case. He could, had he chosen, have asked <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> to withdraw the words, but under the Standing Orders there was no duty imposed upon him to make such a demand. </para>
