I am able to announce that to-day we received from the Government of the United Kingdom a cablegram making a free gift of the cruiser <inline font-style="italic">Pioneer</inline> to the Australian Government. </para>

If that were permissible, then, I presume, responsible government, as we understand it, would be at an end.

On the 30th June, 1908, there was a surplus of .?330,000, and in November, a few short months after that surplus was declared, they, brought in a loan proposal for ?3,500,000 for absolutely unproductive works.

Where is your justification for going on the money market to borrow when you have a buoyant revenue and a surplus to play with?&#34; The position now is that there is no surplus for the present year, that these are necessary works as well as reproductive works, and therefore the Government are justified in doing what we would not have been justified in doing had we a surplus. </para>

We have to remember that the Commonwealth policy enunciated by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest was to extend the Braddon section, and to continue to pay the States after the ten-year period three- fourths of the Customs revenue. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watson,</inline> speaking with the knowledge that we had already disposed of one proposal to borrow for the benefit of the States, was pointing out that already under the Braddon section the Commonwealth had scarcely sufficient revenue in the coming year to meet its liabilities. He pointed out what would happen if <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest&#39;s proposal was indorsed - that the Commonwealth would be forced to take up a general borrowing policy for all its public works. He was urging that there should be a revision of the Braddon section, and he made those remarks in order to show the people of Australia that if the Braddon section were extended, the Commonwealth would have no resort but to take up a general borrowing policy, and so he voiced his hostility to a borrowing policy. </para>

Nothing of the sort is intended to happen, because we have ample money in the Australian Notes Account for meeting the demands upon us when due, and no further proposal for borrowing for that purpose will be necessary. </para>

                    <para class="block">There the honorable senator was trying to make out a case to the effect that we shall be committed by this Loan Bill to a general loan policy. On that point, I only wish to say that if the worst comes to the worst - if we have to redeem these loans, as the honorable senator indicated, by further borrowing - provided that we can always do what we have done in this case, we shall have made a good bargain for the Commonwealth. If we can always effect a saving of J per cent, interest we shall have done good business, and, so far from being blamed for that, we ought to be commended. I have nothing more to say on this Loan Bill, except to add that the two vital points relate to the post-office in Perth and the redemption of loans in the Northern Territory. As to both of them, I have shown that the Commonwealth makes a profit by the transaction, and benefits considerably ; and that so far as the honorable senator&#39;s sweeping statement goes with respect to the borrowing of Labour Governments compared with Liberal Governments, it is clear that Liberal Governments have borrowed twice as much as Labour Governments in the same time. </para>

                        <para>. - There has been a great deal of discussion as to what has been in the past and what is now the policy of the Labour party with regard to borrowing. I have always understood that the idea of the Labour party since I became connected with it twenty years ago was that ultimately borrowing should be entirely stopped. But that does not mean that immediately the Labour party got into power an end would be put to borrowing. A change of a system that had been in vogue for a considerable period could not be effected suddenly. Therefore, if honorable senators of the Opposition hoped that immediately the Labour party got into power an end would be put to borrowing, they were likely to be disappointed. But during the period of the Labour Government in the Federal Parliament the ideal of the Labour party with regard to borrowing has been practically carried out. Hitherto the Government  has constructed all its public works out of revenue. Large areas of land have been bought out of revenue. The Fleet, so far as it has been advanced, and defence generally, have been paid for out of revenue. So that in regard to those matters the Labour party has carried out the original ideal with regard to non-borrowing. I say at once that personally I do not believe in borrowing. My idea is that some method of constructing public works can, and ought to, be devised without resort to this method. But, as I have already said, this cannot take place suddenly. It can be accomplished only by slow degrees. <inline font-style="italic">T.</inline> think that every reformer, whether he belongs to the Labour party or any other party, should always keep before him some objective; and the idea that I have in my mind is this : &#39;At the present moment huge sums are going to waste, and are being poured into the pockets of private individuals, which ought to go into the public Treasury. 1 am referring now, of course, to community-created values. The objective which I believe every financial re-  former who belongs to the Labour party has in view is that ultimately those values shall go into the public Treasury, where they of right belong. Before that day comes many a hard battle will have to be fought, many a bridge and railway will have to be built, and many a trouble met. But that is the financial objective which every Labour man should keep continually before him. The Federal Labour party has. never lost sight of its original ideal. Borrowing has been , restricted most severely. We have heard no end of complaints from members of the Opposition that money has not been borrowed for the building of a Fleet, the construction of Defence works, the erection of public buildings, and a number of other things which the Federal Labour Government have paid for out of revenue. </para>

                            <para>- &#91; believe that they would. I do not conceive that I am capable of doing this question the justice it deserves, but I invite honorable members to consider the system as it at present exists. In every country of which we have any knowledge there is annually a large accumulation of wealth, 95 per cent, of which passes into the pockets of a very limited section of the people. The money has to be reinvested. It is extorted in the first place from the people in the shape of community-created values, rent, interest, and profits, and is again loaned back to the people. There is thus constituted a perpetual burden upon them. First of all, the money that belongs to the people is practically stolen from them, as it is in Australia, in the shape of community created values. Then this stolen money is loaned back to the people from whom it has been taken, and the system keeps them in a condition of perpetual servitude and poverty. </para>

                            <para>-- I never tell the electors anything upon which I care to go back. I am always perfectly honest with them. Possibly that accounts for the confidence which apparently they place in me. I do not go before the electors with my tongue in my cheek, as no doubt a number of honorable senators do. I tell them the straight-out truth. </para>

                            <para>- I am a Pharisee, of course. In any case, I am as honest as I can be with the electors and with myself. In passing, let me say that it seems to be impossible to please the Opposition. Whether we borrow or do not borrow, they howl at us. That is, no doubt, quite natural and proper from a party government point of view. But if we have gone astray in connexion with this question of borrowing, the Opposition should be pleased, because to borrow is the height, depth, length, and breadth of their policy. They want to borrow for everything. They would borrow even to construct rainbows, as the Vice-President of the Executive Council put it just now. They have no idea of finance other than to buttress financial institutions, and people generally, who have money to lend. The idea of the Labour party, and my own personal idea, is that we should get out of the hands of the pawnbrokers. There is no reason under Heaven why we should be running continually cap-in-hand to Cohen to borrow our own money back again. This is a very important matter, in view of the way in which it concerns the welfare of the people. We should have definite ideas upon it, and should keep our minds fixed upon the ultimate objective all the time. The ultimate objective of the Labour party is to do away with the necessity of borrowing. If the Labour party abandons that idea, in my humble opinion it will be taking a wrong course. So far I have seen no evidence of such an abandonment. The Federal Labour party has a particularly good record in this connexion. It is only now, when no other funds are available, and for a very necessary purpose, that it embarks upon a borrowing policy. In <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen&#39;s</inline> most excellent speech, from a purely Opposition point of view, he tried to show that the Government was not only going back upon its own policy with regard to borrowing for a piece of ground and buildings- upon it in Perth, but was also making a very bad bargain. One objection he urged was that they were buying more land than they needed. Probably we are buying more land than is needed for present requirements, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> knows as well as any other man in the Federal Parliament, or out of it, that Australia is yet only a child in swaddling clothes, and that probably within half-a-century every inch of the ground which has been purchased by the Government for a post-office in Perth will be required for public buildings. It will be required in a very .short period proportionately to the life of the nation. I think that it is exceedingly good business on the part of the Government to make provision in this matter for future expansion. In other capitals, where extensions of post-offices and other public buildings have become necessary, the various Governments have had to go upon the market and buy land and buildings at prices which were very much above their real value. In my view the Federal Government and the Minister mainly responsible for this transaction have done exceedingly well, and I wish that something of the same kind could be done in every capital throughout Australia. </para>

                            <para>- Undoubtedly it is. It will pay for itself in the meantime, and may save millions sterling to some future generation. I know what the Leader of the Opposition and honorable senators allied with him would like,. They would like the Federal -Government to pursue the old policy, and secure the little piece of land necessary for present requirements in order that in a few years we should be compelled to buy from some private individual owning the adjacent land, who may have the ear of the Government of the day, at a price very much in excess of its true value for the property then required. </para>

                            <para>- As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> rightly interjects, the value of the property will be increasing all the time. If some new gold-fields are discovered in the West, as we all hope will be the case in the very near future, these values, instead of increasing slowly, will go up by leaps and bounds, and probably in the course of ten or twenty years what has been bought for about &#163;170,000, may be worth &#163;1.000,000, or more. But this is a matter of detail. I desired chiefly  to refer to the suggestion that the Labour party . had abandoned its policy of no borrowing. It has not done anything of the kind, but like every other human institution it is the victim of circumstances. It finds itself confronted with evil conditions, which can only be swept away by time and patience and as opportunity presents itself. But I believe that the ideal of the Labour party with regard to borrowing is now what it was at the beginning.&#39; We see that if the community-created land values were paid into the public Treasury, as they ought to be, and not to private individuals, as they are, they would of themselves be sufficient to build the necessary public works - railways, public buildings, roads, and bridges - throughout the Commonwealth. If honorable senators will take the land values throughout Australia, and allow 5 per cent, thereon, they will find that the position I am taking up is one which is not very far from the truth. Of course I, with other members of the Senate, realize fully that the day of the complete consummation of this policy has not&#39; yet arrived, probably will not arrive for many years. But that the Federal Labour party and the Labour Government have kept to the original policy with regard to borrowing has, I think, been amply proved by the conduct of both the party and the Government since they came into power in Australia. </para>

                        <para>. - We have heard two interesting speeches on the loan policy from two distinguished members of the Government. It was quite patent to the ears of anybody, and it was exactly so intended by the Minister of Defence, that his speech should be read and taken as an apology - an apology by comparison with the past, and, through that apology, an apologetic justification for the difficult and inconsistent position in which the Government now find themselves. He began with an apology, and his. speech was an apology throughout, and a member of the party has just ended a speech with a complete repudiation. They can reconcile their position to the Senate, and also to the supporters of the Labour party. </para>

                            <para>- Because <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> pointed out, if I understood him properly - and I think he intended to convey it - that if the financial plank of the Labour platform were carried out as it was originally intended, there would be no borrowing at all. He has gone further, and pointed out that if the idea of paying for public works out of the unearned increment of the community - which, according to him, is easily available - were realized, there would be no necessity for any loan or borrowing policy. I think that there is no man in the Labour party in Australia to-day who is so familiar with the platform, and has been so strongly insistent on that financial plank as the basis of the financial policy of the party, as has <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> and when we have the head of the party apologizing for the policy, and a strong supporter like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> repudiating it practically in its entirety, the only conclusion which the Opposition and the general public can come to is that they really do not understand what their policy means, or, if they do, that they do not intend to carry it out. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly ; and now we have had a version from the Minister of Defence, as I shall show from his speech. After the handling which it has received from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline><inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> ought to be burned. The Labour party, as well as the Liberal party, has got itself into the position in which it raids it must borrow. Circumstances have so developed - and they have developed as part of a deliberate policy on the part of the Labour party - that they must either repudiate their policy in regard to railway development in the Commonwealth or repudiate borrowing. It cannot be carried out without borrowing. Fortunately for us, <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> remains to prove irrefutably that originally when the Labour party came into this Parliament the thing on which perhaps they prided themselves more than anything else was their repudiation of a borrowing policy. At the first opportunity they got here they repudiated it, and forced a Treasurer, who, unfortunately, was not strong enough to resist the pressure brought upon him, to withdraw his borrowing proposals, and fall back upon revenue. </para>

                            <para>- Let my honorable friend read <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watson&#39;s</inline> words with that qualifying context. It is clear that what he meant was that a national emergency - a war or preparations for war, or some financial emergency such as the States were confronted with in 1893 - might require a modification of the broad principle. But the broad principle he had first laid down universally. It is clear from the words and the context, taken together, that his meaning was that there should be no borrowing for public works expenditure, but that the money should come out of the general revenue. On that line of argument, and with that explanation, it is clear that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watson</inline> boldly informed Parliament what was the loan policy of the Labour party until this Government came into power. What is the explanation given by the Minister of Defence? He has stated that the reason why the Labour party opposed the proposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner at that time was that the Commonwealth Government were returning an average of &#163;880,000 a year to the States. It would be absurd and unjust, he practically contends, when they were handing back , &#163;880,000 a year to the States, to go into the open market and borrow money for public works. But the argument cuts both ways. When the revenues were small, possibly there was more justification for it; but there ought to be no justification, in a case where the Commonwealth get a revenue of &#163;22,000,000 odd. When the . Commonwealth Government had control of only a comparatively small amount for carrying out urgent matters, and were returning, as they were bound to do under section 87, a certain amount of revenue to the States, one could understand why the Treasurer could use that as an argument not for tightening up the States any further, or for tightening up himself, or for going into the open market either in Australia or outside. </para>

                            <para>- No. There is the fact that the Commonwealth Government were tied down by section 87 of the Constitution. They had less money of their own, so to speak, to deal with. They were confronted with public works, and naturally the Treasurer at that time would, in order not to increase the pressure on himself, seek to borrow. But no such circumstances prevail now. The Treasurer is discharging practically all his obligations to the States to-day by paying back to the States only half of what <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner and his Government had to pay back under section 87. The differentiation only makes the aggravation of this loan policy, in the circumstances, all the greater. There is another consideration which is put before us, and of all people in the world, it is put before us by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> who is so strong on the unearned increment, and that is that a portion of this loan is to be applied to the purchase of land for a post-office at Perth. We are told that this purchase is bound to be a good bargain. This statement originally made by the Vice-President of the Executive Council has been repeated by a number of honorable senators opposite, and even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> could not help joining in the chorus. But how can it be a good bargain unless the unearned increment is realized upon? As a matter &#39;of fact, this is nothing but a speculation on the improving value of the property, and if the Government are going to adopt this policy in connexion with the post-office at Perth, why should it not be followed in regard to post-offices and Customs Houses everywhere? </para>

                            <para>- No. I do not want them to rent buildings if they do not require them. I have always held that there is no objection to borrowing for reproductive works. The defence in regard to this transaction is that it would be a good bargain in the future. In other words, from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart&#39;s</inline> point of view, the Government are taking advantage of the unearned increment, whereas, from the other stand-point, the investment may be regarded as a speculation. The inference, from all we have heard from honorable senators opposite, is that the land will become more valuable, and that this will be a good thing for the nation. But apparently it is denied that similar investments would be a good thing for the individual. The arguments used in connexion with the Perth Post Office remind me that some little time ago the Minister of Home Affairs went to Sydney and publicly announced that he contemplated buying up Martin-place, in order to acquire additional sites for post-office purposes. He also informed the people that  &#163;1,000,000  spent in that quarter for the purpose indicated would be one of the best investments the Commonwealth could make. After his romantic scheme had been made public, the Attorney-General had his attention called to the announcement, and described it as an &#34; Australian Night&#39;s Entertainment,&#34; and practically removed it from the sphere of practical proposals. </para>

                            <para>- Yes ; there was a little more - something that was rather humorous in so far as it had a bearing upon the relations existing between the Minister of Home Affairs and his colleagues. In addition to the Attorney-General, whose attitude I have indicated, the Treasurer also smiled the proposal out of court. He blew the &#34; hifalutin &#34; scheme to ribbons, and subsequently the Minister of Home Affairs maintained that he had just as much to say as the Prime Minister so far as the policy of the Government was concerned. He pointed out that the Caucus made the Prime Minister, as well as the Minister of Home Affairs, and that Ministers were on an equality. For the same reasons that were advanced by the Minister of Home Affairs when he proposed to spend  &#163;1,000,000  in Sydney, we are asked to approve of the expenditure of loan money in the purchase of a post-office site at Perth. Another reason that has been put forward in support of this proposal is very plausible at first sight, but is of no value when closely examined. We are reminded that we shall be borrowing from ourselves. But I would ask whether the proposal is any the better or worse on that account ? Personally, I think it would be a great deal worse for us to borrow from ourselves rather than from others, in view of the present financial conditions. There was never a time in the history of Australia when we more urgently required all the money we could get for investment in the development of our resources. We know that the Australian money market is as tight as ever it was. I admit that money is tight all the world over, but in no other country is the pressure of financial stringency being more severely felt than here. We know that overdrafts are being called in, and that advances have been practically brought to an end by the banks. It is common knowledge that every sovereign that can possibly be accumulated is being retained by the banks,&#34; and one of the worst things we could possibly do would be to go into the Australian money market for borrowing purposes. The outlook is not at all cheerful. The exports of gold from Australia from  1st  January to  19th  September,  191 1,  represented a value of  &#163;6,163,112,  whereas for the corresponding period of  191 2  the exports were valued at  &#163;10,008,197,  or a difference of  &#163;3,945,085.  This additional gold had to be sent out during the current year to meet our heavier liabilities, and there does not seem to be any indication of a diminution in the export of gold. For ten months of the current year we have exported gold to the Value of  &#163;8,860,167,  or assuming the same proportion is maintained to the end of the year we shall have exported  &#163;10,632,000.  For the corresponding ten months of  1911  our gold exports were valued at  . &#163;5,821,707,  or, assuming that the same rate of exportation was maintained for the year, the total would be  . &#163;6,995,707.  Therefore, during the current year we are being called upon to pay between  . &#163;3,000,000  and  &#163;4,000,000  in excess of the amount required from us during the preceding year. Now, taking the exports and imports, we find that during the first ten months of  19 1 2  the imports were valued at  &#163;65,057, 812,  or, allowing the same proportion for the full twelve months, the total for the year will be  &#163;78,057,812.  The imports for  191 1  amounted to  &#163;65,000,000.  In other words, we are importing very heavily during the current year as compared with the previous year, and the difference will probably amount to  &#163;15,000,000. </para>

                            <para>- I wish to show that at present the Australian loan market is the worst one to which we could go for borrowing purposes, and that the general principles which I am putting for- ward are not in any way weakened by the statement that we are proposing to borrow from ourselves. If we must borrow, the world&#39;s market will be a better one for us than the Australian market. The figures I have quoted show how very stringent the conditions are in the local money market, and if the flow of gold continues, as at present, the Government will not be able to borrow money here, nor will they be able to obtain more money from the taxpayers, but they will be compelled to go into the open market to raise money to carry out public- works. </para>

                        <para>. - The speech of the Leader of the Opposition bristled with misrepresentations with regard to the attitude of the Labour party, and the exposure to which most of those misrepresentations has been subjected has not prevented the honorable senator by interjections, and other honorable senators, from continuing the same line of argument. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> made certain statements as to what he deemed to be the objective of the Labour party from a financial stand-point, and he gave us his ideas with regard to borrowing. He made it perfectly clear that he was speaking for himself up to a certain point, and he then repeated the actual wording of the Labour platform, and pointed out that only by that plank of the Labour platform were the members of the party bound. I regard it as distinctly unfair for honorable senators to continue to indulge in misrepresentations after plain and straightforward explanations are given. We can only assume that this course of conduct is pursued for electioneering purposes. </para>

                            <para>- Just so; to the intelligent understanding of the audience, having regard to the circumstances under which the remarks were made. I am making no apology, nor am I indulging in any special pleading. I say most distinctly that thousands of electors believed, and still believe, that the circumstances under which the Federal Treasurers were returning a portion of the unspent one-fourth, to which the Commonwealth Government was entitled, to the various States, did not justify the Commonwealth Government in borrowing, though borrowing might be justifiable under different circumstances. We held, rightly or wrongly, that the Commonwealth should use the whole of that one-fourth, to which it was entitled, before it went on the market to borrow money. I know that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger, who, when he is not carried away by his imagination, tries to be fair, will readily understand the position we take up. </para>

                            <para>- But the honorable senator can draw a fair distinction between comprehending a position and sharing the same views. My own views on borrowing may be very extreme, but I say that no one has a right to pin the party to anything other than that put forward on the platform of the party. Personally, I do not believe in borrowing, and we should not make non-borrowing our objective in the dim and distant future, but should endeavour to carry it out as soon as possible. If there is one thing I am more proud of than another in connexion with the work of the party prior to my entering this Parliament, it is the steadfast and successful opposition that was offered to borrowing. I am glad that, during the ten or eleven years of the existence of the Commonwealth, it has kepi off the loan market, and I would be more pleased if we could continue to take up the same attitude for all time. I have absolutely no belief in borrowing as a policy. It should be a matter of expediency, and should be resorted to when there is no other opening; but I should make this one exception: that, if we borrow for Commonwealth purposes from funds in the possession of the Commonwealth for which we would otherwise have no outlet, it is a wise and prudent course to pursue when we have no other revenue available. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger, I think, entirely misunderstood the contention raised by the Ministers who have spoken when he pointed to the difficulty of successfully initiating loans in our own market owing to the financial tightness. The Minister did not refer to going on the Australian money, market to borrow when he spoke of borrowing from ourselves. He meant the actual borrowing of money from our own pockets as a Commonwealth - taking the money from the Trust Fund. It is immaterial whether we take money directly from the Notes Account or from any other Trust Account which is not immediately required for the purpose for which it is set aside. Take, for instance, the large amount which we will require for defence purposes. We all know that that will not be required within the current financial year, or for some considerable time, and, instead of allowing the money to lie idle, it is good financial business to utilize it for any remunerative purpose. Honorable senators opposite, who pride themselves on their very superior commercial knowledge, should welcome and indorse any policy of using the money that we have to the best possible advantage, when it otherwise would be lying idle. </para>

                            <para>- We will let the future ta&#39;ke care of itself. Can any man living tell what our financial requirements will be many years hence? I have for many years been a consistent opponent of borrowing, and I have no faith whatever in the more modified way in which that plank is looked at in the State of New South Wales than it is here. I should like to point out that the plank in the New South Wales State Labour platform is not precisely on all fours with that in the Federal platform, and it is absurd to contend that we are in any way responsible for what the Labour party of that State may do. In the administration of their affairs they are a separate entity, as we are in ours. I think honorable senators opposite would be the last to father everything that may be done in the State Legislatures by the Liberal parties in those Parliaments. What I wish to point out is that, out of this loan of a little over &#163;&#34;500,000, &#163;&#34;,376,000 odd is to be applied to the redemption of existing loans. It has always been the policy of this and every other party to provide for the redemption of existing loans by borrowing. It would be impossible to make provision for the ordinary expenditure and for redemptions out of current revenue. There is no mention made by honorable senators opposite of the &#163;360,000 to be expended on the renewal of loans which this Commonwealth Government is not responsible for incurring, but which was incurred in connexion with works taken over from a State. It is strange that honorable senators opposite have seized on the smaller amount which is to be expended in Perth, have entirely confined their criticism to that, and dropped altogether reference to the fact that the far larger amount is to be expended for absolutely unavoidable purposes. Honorable senators opposite, as well as members of their party in another place, condemn the Labour party because it does not propose to erect these buildings, and carry out other public works, out of loan money, and then they come here and condemn us unhesitatingly because we propose to do that very thing, and in the best possible way. Instead of throwing stones at us they should reconcile their conduct with their professions. </para>

                            <para>- A railway may not be a reproductive work; indeed, there are many railways in every State that are not reproductive. Here is a case where the  work is so obviously reproductive that it is beyond the speculative character of many railways, and is therefore more justifiable than they would be. Honorable senators opposite agree with the statement that the expenditure of money in purchasing land in a young and rising city is likely to be remunerative owing to the growth of land values. I should like to refer to the paradoxical sort of argument of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger. He says that we condemn the appropriation by individuals of the community-created value in land which we say the community should retain, and then he proceeds to condemn us for what he calls speculating in land values. But we are not doing that as an individual or personal matter. If we buy land now which will hereafter have an added value of that kind that will be securing the added value for the community. </para>

                            <para>- Of course, it is in many instances. The position is entirely different. The contention is that that value should go to the community, and anything which will secure any portion of it for the community is directly carrying out the very essence of the principle which we have been advocating. I maintain that the argument of honorable senators opposite is contradictory. I am sorry that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> was not here when I referred to what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Watson</inline> stated. A man&#39;s own word is. very fair evidence of what he meant so far as any context may be required to enlighten one. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Watson  told me no longer ago than last night that he was speaking entirely with regard to the circumstances that then existed. He said that he never has been, and is not now, a complete anti- borrower. He believes in borrowing for reproductive works.  His  statement was made entirely in view of the circumstance that there was an unexpended surplus from the one-fourth which the Commonwealth was entitled to, and he did not believe in returning any portion of that to the States while going in for borrowing. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watson</inline> was most emphatic in stating that that was the attitude that he took up generally, so that even if he did not go to the length of explaining that, it was in conformity with the position which he took up. </para>

                            <para>- I contend that when a man is speaking to an audience that knows what his sentiments are, he in very few cases covers every possible objection that may be raised by those who are endeavouring to misrepresent the attitude of his party. In regard to this loan, there is only a small portion that is to be used for the purpose of buying a post-office site and erecting buildings. The purchasing of that land now is in conformity with our policy, because in the future it will have a very much greater value, and even if there is not a sinking fund in connexion with the cost of the buildings, there will certainly be such a large increase in the value of the land itself as to far more than compensate for the deterioration of the buildings erected on the land. </para>

                            <para>- There is no doubt whatever that the money which the Commonwealth pays out of one fund will come back into another. Therefore, we are not losing money by the transaction. If there is any justification for borrowing at all, surely it must be stronger when money is borrowed to be used for a remunerative purpose. We have been met with the statement that since the abolition of the compulsory payment to the States of three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue the Commonwealth Government had a much larger revenue to handle, and that, therefore, there is not the same excuse for borrowing as there was when <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner was Treasurer. But it must be remembered that the payments of the Commonwealth then were very small. The Federal services which have been tak&#34; en over from the States have been developed, and have involved an enormous additional expenditure, which accounts for the additional revenue received.

                    <para class="block">Defence, for instance, the expenditure was trifling from a Commonwealth point of view when <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner was Treasurer. Now the expenditure in thai direction amounts to millions sterling, and it is growing. We are paying for the construction of battleships and for the training of our Military Forces entirely out of revenue. The postal services, which were being starved in <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner&#39;s time, are now being looked after. Additions and new works involve an enormous expenditure. There are large out-goings for old-age and invalid pensions, and the States have been relieved to a large extent on that account. We have also incurred additional liabilities through making our old-age pensions payments more liberal. One might go through many items, and show where the Public Services taken over from the States have not only been added to in number, but have been&#39; developed and amplified in every direction. There is, therefore, ample reason why the larger revenue of the Commonwealth should have been expended, and the additional expenditure by no means points to extravagance. That being the case, I say that we have an infinitely better cause for borrowing now than the Commonwealth had at the time when it refused to expend one farthing more than it could avoid of the Customs and Excise revenues, and was handing money back to the States unnecessarily, whilst, at the same time, proposing to go on the money market to provide for necessary expenditure. Nothing has been said by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> who spoke forcibly and at length, to justify this criticism. </para>

                            <para>- No; because it is clear that loans borrowed at different periods and in different amounts will have to be redeemed at different times. It would be absolutely impossible so to regulate the revenue of the country so as to pay off loans by that means. It is an absolute absurdity to attempt to do such a thking. Within the next few years one or two States have loan money to repay to the extent of twenty or thirty millions sterling. That money could not be raised from revenue. If 0 my policy could be carried out, I would have no fresh borrowing, and would proceed to establish a sink-5 ing fund to pay off loans already existing. But, until we do stop borrowing, a sinking fund is a farce. I contend, with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> that we should be prepared by direct taxation gradually to provide sufficient funds to construct public works, and I think that other sources of income which could well be applied to that purpose would be profits from existing industrial undertakings of the Commonwealth, and from any monopolies which might be nationalized, and revenue derived from the taxation of community-created values. I believe that we could adopt such a system without injury to any deserving section of the community. </para>

                            <para>- If I am doing so, I am only following the example of other honorable senators. But I will not trespass further in that direction. One argument for not borrowing for general purposes is that national necessities might require the Commonwealth Government to borrow at some time of emergency. If that should be the case, and our credit was sound, whilst our position was free from anything in the nature of a mortgage oyer our assets, we ought to be able to borrow on advantageous terms. But to do that we should, as far as we can, avoid borrowing in time of peace. We should live within our income, so that in time of emergency we should be able to borrow on the most favorable terms. On this occasion, the greater part of the money to be borrowed is required for redemption of existing loans. The other portion is required for a reproductive work. If ever there was a justifiable loan it is this. It is further justified by the fact that our Notes Issue Reserve Fund is available for the purpose, and that consequently we are not taking money out of the pockets of the people, but simply making a wise use of our own money. If it is good business to lend from the Trust Fund to the States, it must be equally sound business to utilize this money for our own Commonwealth purposes. </para>

                        <para>. - Some time ago the Prime Minister said that he dreaded a seventh borrower appearing in the market. I find from the Budget-papers that in 1911 this * Parliament passed a Loan Bill authorizing the borrowing of &#163;2,460,476. We are now asked to borrow , &#163;529,526. We have made forced loans through the note issue to the extent of &#163;5,703,816. Those three sums total &#163;8,693,818. I find that the amount required to retire loans is &#163;602,526. If we deduct that from the &#163;8,693,000, we find that the actual net borrowing of this Government will be considerably over &#163;8,000,000. The Government have entered into the business of money-lending as well as of borrowing. They borrow and lend out at the same time. The Budget-papers show that up to the 30th June no less than &#91;&#163;5,000,000 has been invested in the various States. That money was quite enough to meet the requirements covered by this measure. Some of the loans fall due in June and August of next year. </para>

                            <para>- The Government are only getting 3, 3&#189;, and 3¾ per cent, on those loans. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> speaks of short-dated loans, it is significant to remember that no less than &#163;3,130,000 has been invested in stocks which will fall due between 1919 and 1926. We can hardly call that a short-dated loan. The fact of the matter is that the reason why the Government are asking to be allowed to borrow this money is that they have been taking moneys available from the note issue, which, beyond the reserve, might have been legitimately used for purposes such as those for which this Bill is being passed, and have invested them outside. They have invested these moneys at 3 per cent., and now are going to borrow for the purposes of this Bill at 3&#189; per cent. Any one who imagines that the present Government have not borrowed something like &#163;8,000,000 in three years will be making a serious mistake. What the Government really propose to do is to rob Peter to-day in order to pay Paul to-morrow. </para>

                            <para>- The simple explanation of that is that under the Braddon section they were compelled to. pay back all surplus revenue to the States. Owing to the muddle which the Government have made in borrowing trust monevs, in order to lend them again, it is possible that the money asked for under this Bill should be borrowed. But I wish to say that I do not approve of the Government entering into the business of money lenders by raising money from the people in excess of requirements, whether by a forced loan, as they have done in connexion with the note issue, or in the form of excessive or unnecessary taxation. They should take as little as possible from the pockets of the people, and pay their way by managing the affairs of the Commonwealth as economically as possible. </para>

                        <para>- - I do not propose to say more than a few words on this measure. I am not acquainted with the particulars of the land purchase transaction in Perth, and am unable to say whether it is as good as has  been represented. I am, however, quite prepared to admit that it is a wise &#39;policy, when the opportunity presents itself, to secure sites which will improve in value, and will be required for public purposes later on. I  am not prepared to say that the practice adopted by the Government in dealing with trust moneys is a wise one. I am inclined to believe that it is rather a dangerous practice when it can only be availed of by the raising of a forced loan from the people as the Government did in connexion with the note issue. It should be remembered that most of the money in the Trust Fund has already been hypothecated for specific purposes, and to apply it to other purposes is a diversion of trust moneys which may not be available when required for the purposes for which they have been set aside. At the last election the manifesto issued to the electors of Victoria by the Political Labour Council indicated that the Labour party were dead against borrowing. It was pointed out that Australia had already borrowed some &#163;230,000,000, and the statement was made that not one penny of that amount need have been borrowed. Can any one realize the absurdity of such a statement? What would this country have been had we not borrowed in the early days, when there were no people here upon whom to levy taxation? In this debate honorable senators on one side have endeavoured to show that members of the Labour party have said that they would not borrow, and honorable senators opposite have been concerned to explain that when they said that they meant something else. I admit that members of the Labour party are at liberty to change their mind and review what they said in the past, and that, as the circumstances have altered, they may alter their policy. We know that, speaking generally, the State Labour parties have entirely altered the non-borrowing policy. In New South Wales  they  have borrowed  &#163;10,000,000  in two years. In Western Australia they have borrowed &#163;2,000,000, and the Labour Government in South Australia also borrowed money. The Federal Labour Government will need to borrow very largely if they are to carry out the works to which the Commonwealth is committed. I rose particularly because, in his reply to the attack of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> on Friday last, the Minister of Defence has made statements which are not accurate. The honorable senator stated that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> should be very careful  when he made statements that they were accurate. But, in referring to the time, in 1902, when <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner proposed to borrow money, the Minister of Defence said that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner did not set out clearly what the money he proposed to borrow was for. </para>

                            <para>- It was read a first time on 4th June, 1902. It is clear, therefore, that the statement which has been made to discredit a former Treasurer of the Commonwealth is absolutely wrong, and the gibe that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> should be careful to be accurate in his statements comes with a very bad grace from a Minister who evidently was not sure of his facts, and tried to bolster up an argument by casting discredit upon a former Treasurer of the Commonwealth. I am not opposed to this Bill. I have said that it may be a very wise course to secure ahead lands which may be required for public purposes. I do not know whether all the details of the transaction are correct; but I shall not quarrel with it, because it is what I would have done myself. </para>

                        <para>- - I have only a very few remarks to make in reply to the numerous observations which have been made in connexion with this measure. I point out to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> that, whatever the source from which we secured the money necessary to carry out the purposes of this Bill, we were bound to introduce the measure, and set out the various items in it, or we should have- had no authority to get the money from anywhere. A statement has been made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> that, in connexion with the purchase of land and buildings at Perth, we actually require only about &#163;149,000. That statement, I am informed, is substantially correct. But interest will have to be paid on that amount from the time the Commonwealth takes over the property. It was necessary to make provision from the time the property was taken over by the Commonwealth until this money was provided and actually paid over to the original owners of the property. </para>

                        <para>. - In reference to a statement by the Vice-President of the Executive Council as to the reason why the amount proposed to be borrowed under this Bill for the purposes of the acquisition of lands and buildings at Perth is in excess of the amount necessitated by the purchase itself, and includes&#39; a sum for interest, I should like to say a word. If I understand the transaction aright, the Government purchased this block of land, and the houses upon it, for a little under &#163;170,000. They paid a cash deposit of &#163;17,000. I find that my figures are not quite correct; but, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> has admitted, there was a difference between the amount we owe on that land and the amount we are to borrow, namely, &#163;153,000. The Minister quite rightly said that it was due as interest on the purchase money from the completion of the purchase until the Bill becomes, law, and we can make our own deduction. I can quite understand that we have to pay interest on the purchase money to the vendors; but surely, if we have to pay interest, we ought to get the rents derived from the properties since the date of purchase? Are we to pay interest on the purchase money and the benefits to go to other people? That seems to be the position, unless the Minister can offer some other explanation. I understand that the transactions were completed about six months ago. Necessarily, if we concluded a bargain with the vendors then, and can not pay until this Bill goes through, we owe them interest on the purchase money; but the property should count as ours from the time we commenced to pay interest, and the rents ought to be ours from the date of purchase. </para>

                        <para>- - I feel rather inclined to compliment the Government on their change of view. This is a Bill to authorize the borrowing of half a million, notwithstanding all the outcry against borrowing, restriction of borrowing, and never borrowing except for reproductive works. I am glad to know that the Government are alive to the fact that it is a proper thing to borrow on certain occasions, and for certain purposes. Here they have purchased a property on which they intend to erect a post-office, and, if I understand rightly, other buildings, which are to be let and will bring in a certain revenue. I have felt all the time that, as regards permanent public works - that is, works that are to last for half a century - it is not a good policy to take the money for their construction out of the revenue for the year in which it is spent. Therefore, I am pleased to see that the Government are adopting this policy. It is said that this money is to be borrowed from our own people, but there is nothing in this clause to indicate where it is to be borrowed. The Minister said, &#34; We are going to borrow from our own people.&#34; He meant by that phrase to borrow from the Trust Accounts which have been created. _ I take it that the funds in the Trust Accounts are laid aside for specific purposes. If there is a sudden demand on the Trust Fund, and more money is wanted, is money to be called in immediately to reimburse the Trust Accounts? We ought to know more about that matter. We have had questions on the notice-paper -about the tightness of the money market, and about the banks calling in their money. If they are putting pressure on their- customers, as has been stated here, they may put pressure on the Government. They may want some of the sovereigns for the notes which they have lying by; and if there is a sudden call on the Trust Fund, where are the Government going to try to get the money to reimburse the Trust Accounts ? I do not object, as a matter of principle, to the Government borrowing for permanent works, because - for buildings which are to last for half a century - it is a very fair thing to borrow the money provided that it shall be spent on the buildings and gradually repaid. But to talk about &#34; borrowing from our own people,&#34; seems to me to be altogether absurd when money is wanted in Australia as it is at present. Instead of &#34; borrowing from our own people,&#34; the people should be allowed to use their own money, and the Government should get money from outside the Commonwealth - from a foreigner or anywhere they like - so long as they pay a fair rate of interest. The spare money we have here ought to be devoted to developing Australian industries rather than be borrowed by the Government for a purpose of this kind. </para>

                            <para>-  I am not objecting to the money being used for that purpose, but congratulating the Government that they have come to a sane view in regard to some of these matters. I am disposing of this fallacy of borrowing, from our own people. When we have vast resources, as we have, we ought not to think about borrowing from our own people, but the spare money here ought to be worth a great deal more than  ,3  per cent, or  4  per cent, in developing those resources. What we ought to do is to create a greater feeling of confidence in regard to our resources, and so encourage persons not to hoard their money or to lend it to the Government, but to put it out in legitimate enterprise in developing our resources; and for public works let us get money from those who have money to spare, and are willing to lend it at a low rate. I do not intend to oppose the passage of the Bill in any way, because I think that the principle is right. </para>

                            <para>- The Minister may have it that way if he likes for the present. He brought forward a set of figures, which he assured the House had been obtained from the Government Statistician, for the purpose of showing what amounts had been borrowed by Labour and Liberal Governments respectively during the three years 1909-10, 1910-n, and 1911-12. The moment the Minister read the figures I knew that he had abstained from giving the House the whole truth. The figures quoted by the Minister, and which I have no doubt he obtained&#39; from the Government Statistician, represented the total amount borrowed by Labour Governments during the years referred to as only &#163;13,000,000. I refuse to believe that the Minister has not a better knowledge than to be misled into the belief that that amount represents the total borrowings of Labour Governments in the three years, and I accuse the Minister of absolutely withholding information or of being more ignorant than he, as a public man, ought to be. </para>

Now he is turning round, sneaking away, and raising quibbles. The Minister, as a member of the Government which granted the loans, should know what money was lent bv the Commonwealth to the States. And yet he has brought forward a statement exclusive of the moneys which went from the Commonwealth Treasury to the State Governments. </para>

We have the statement of the Minister that the Labour Governments in Australia during the years mentioned borrowed only &#163;13,750,000, and I want to show how inaccurate that statement is. Turning to the details, I find that in the year 1910-n the only Labour Government that is debited with having borrowed is the New South Wales Government. But I hold in my hand a Loan Act, which was passed at the instance of the Verran Government in South Australia, authorizing the raising of &#163;4,750,000. </para>

                            <para>- They may not have done so. But I can show that the Labour Governments have been borrowing very heavily from their Savings Banks and the Commonwealth Government, and that last year the total loan expenditure amounted to &#163;15,000,000. This money was spent out of loan funds, but what the Minister calls the public debts were increased by only &#163;10,000,000. It is highly discreditable for any public man to handle figures such as those submitted by the Minister without a knowledge of the subject on which he is speaking. I have justified every statement I have made. </para>

                        <para>- I have no desire to transgress the rules. I wished to show that I had not spoken upon this subject without making myself acquainted with the facts and figures, and that I presented the whole of the facts and figures to the House. I shall be glad if the Minister will act in the same way. With regard to the clause now under discussion, I would like some explanation as to how the interest is to be paid, and why we are already creating a debit and have to borrow money to pay interest on this transaction The land cost &#163;166,370, and, according to the Treasury officials, 10 per cent, was paid out of the Revenue Account by way of deposit, leaving a balance of &#163;149,733. Now, the Bill provides for a sum of &#163;153,000, or &#163;3,267 more than is due to the vendors - unless interest has to be paid. When I asked a question about this, the Minister admitted that the extra amount was intended to meet interest and charges, and  1  understand that the interest liability arose in this way : Having purchased the property some time ago, but not having been in* a position to pay for it until the Bill went through, the Government considered it was only right and proper to pay interest to the vendors, who were being kept out of their money. But if we are to pay interest in respect to the money we have not paid, the rents accruing from the property should be ours. If the vendors are receiving the rents, should we be called upon to pay interest? It is very curious, and it can scarcely be a coincidence, that the amount of &#163;3,267 represents, within <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> or &#163;2, 5 per cent, for six months on the amount still owing to the vendors. Now, I want to know whether the Minister of Home Affairs has agreed to pay interest at the rate of 5 per cent, until the transaction is completed.  1  would not demur to a businesslike arrangement ot that kind; but if such an agreement . has been entered into the Commonwealth Government ought to be receiving the rents from the property. </para>

                        <para>. - If the honorable senator will consider the matter for a few moments he will know that rents paid in respect to property acquired by the Commonwealth are paid into the Consolidated Revenue, and that if that money were required to be allocated to the payment of interest on the purchase money an item would have to be inserted in the Appropriation Bill. We think the same thing can be accomplished more expeditiously and easily by making provision in the Bill as at present, and we think, moreover, that by this means we shall be overcoming the red-tape system of which we hear so much in the newspapers and on the public platform. I understand that the tenants are paying their rents to the Commonwealth Government, and that the money is being paid into the Consolidated Revenue. </para>

                        <para>In reply to your letter of the 9th inst., I am sending you the information required by the Minister of Defence in the accompanying table. The figures have been taken from the last three annual Statements made by the respective State Treasurers, referring to loans floated in the financial years 1909-10; 1910-11, and 1911-12. In that period there have been three State Labour Governments in power in Australia; those of Messrs. McGowen (New South Wales, October, 1910 to present time) ; Verran (South Australia, April, 1910, to February, 1912) ; and Scaddan (Western Australia, November, 191 1, to present time). The loans in the remaining States have been contracted entirely by Liberal Governments. </para>
                        <para>Yours truly, (Signed) G. H. Knibbs, Commonwealth Statistician. </para>

                    <para class="block">These are the figures supplied to me by the Government Statistician as to the loans effected by the respective State Governments. If the statement is misleading, I have been unintentionally the means of disseminating it. I do not admit that it is misleading. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen&#39;s</inline> statement refers specifically to the loans raised by Labour Governments, and he said that the Labour Governments had borrowed more money by way of loan than other Governments. I quoted his remarks, and I instructed my secretary to get from the Government Statistician the figures dealing with the matter. I think that when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> reads the proof of his remarks he will find that he referred specifically to that matter. </para>

                        <para>.- When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> does read his proof, and when the Minister reads his proof, we shall probably know what is meant. But I am not concerned with that. What I am concerned with is this : That I think it is absolutely obligatory on the Minister, after what has been said, to produce at some definite time the letter which was sent by him- </para>

The vendors of this property may be said to have lent the Common wealth Government money, and I want to know what interest the Government have paid on it. I heard some mention of  5  per cent., and I want to know if we are paying  5  per cent, pending the completion of this transaction. I also want the Vice-President of the Executive Council to tell the Committee what rents have been received from this property since the agreement for sale was executed. I think the Committee is entitled to that information. I want to compare the amount paid by the Government in interest because of this delay of six months, with the amount the Commonwealth has to receive with respect to rents due for the same period. </para>

                        <para>. - If the Vice-President of the Executive Council has not got this information I am not going to attempt to delay the passing of the Bill. I think the information I have asked for is information which the Committee ought to have, but if he has not got it now I do not propose to delay the matter any further. We do know that the Commonwealth is paying some interest on the purchase price. We also know that certain rents are accruing to the Commonwealth in respect of those properties, and I certainly think that when we are in Committee dealing on business lines with the purchase of a property that is information which ought to be .supplied. I shall take the first opportunity, probably by question to-morrow, of asking him to supply the information which I think ought to be given to-day. </para>

                        SYMON (South Australia)  &#91;6.12&#93;.  - We would be glad to get the simple information which ordinarily, would be given by any one who wants authority to raise a sum of money for the purpose of paying off a debt. The amount stated is &#163;153,000. All that is asked for is that some particulars should be given as to the way in which that amount is made up. I should not think it was beyond the possibility of my friends on the Ministerial bench to say what the rate of interest is. That ought to be a very simple thing. Either they have told us too much or too little. Either they have been given barely enough information themselves, or else, for some reason or other, they are indisposed to communicate the information to the Senate. I think they could within five minutes ascertain that information by communicating with the Treasurer in the other Chamber. It is a very simple thing, and it would facilitate business. The Vice-President of the Executive Council is always courteous and ready to facilitate business. It would have been a very easy thing whilst we have been debating this matter to ascertain that information. It would be very much more satisfactory if we got it now rather than after the Bill is passed, to elicit it by means of a question. If any alteration ought to be made in this amount - I do not suggest that there should be - it should be made now. There is no object in getting the information at all, unless in connexion with the consideration and passing of the Bill. I shall not go into the question as to whether it is better to have those rents passed into the Consolidated Revenue, and an appropriation made afterwards to pay interest, but we certainly ought to be given this information so that we may be able to set one against the other to see whether the Government are making a satisfactory bargain or not. We ought to know exactly what we are paying for this property, and the basis upon which we are borrowing this &#163;153,000.

                    <para>. - Only one reason has yet been given for the refusal of the Government to accept my amendment, and that is the startling one that there are constitutional difficulties in the way of its acceptance. This is the first time that the present Government have been deterred by constitutional difficulties. It was mentioned that ii injured workmen were given, under this Bill, recourse to the State Courts, a constitutional difficulty might arise. To meet that, I have slightly altered the provision which I have taken from the Imperial and State Act, so as to confer jurisdiction upon the State Courts. To confer jurisdiction upon those Courts is one proposition, and for the State Courts to decline that jurisdiction is an entirely different proposition. I remind honorable senators that the Bill itself, in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> of this clause, and paragraph <inline font-style="italic">e,</inline> which we are now considering, recognises the jurisdiction of State Courts. In the circumstances, the objection raised to the amendment may be described as absurd and finical. It is possible that 99 out of 100 cases arising under this Bill would be met by its provisions, and adequate compensation would be recoverable, but it is the one-hundredth case which may cause hardship, and I am leaving the 99 to go after the one-hundredth case, and provide for that. If a Commonwealth workman is injured, he has the right to claim compensation at common law under a Workmen&#39;s Compensation Act of any of the States, or an Employers&#39; Liability Act. And .under paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> of this clause we provide that he shall not be entitled to recover compensation, both independently of, and also under, this Act. That is quite right if a man secures compensation by an appeal to a Court under another Act; he should not be at liberty to seek an additional remedy under this Bill. But paragraph <inline font-style="italic">e</inline> provides - </para>

                        <para>- It is adapted from the Imperial Act, and made applicable to Commonwealth conditions, and a similar provision is to be found in four of the State Acts. The only reason given for refusing to accept the amendment is that there are constitutional difficulties in the way. I have already said that the jurisdiction of the State Courts is recognised in paragraphs &#38;and <inline font-style="italic">e</inline> of this clause, and if the State Courts decline the jurisdiction we are in a position to force them to exercise it. What practically would be the effect of the amendment? An employe of the Commonwealth may be injured to such an extent that &#163;500 would not be adequate compensation for his injury. He might be advised to appeal to a State Court under an Employers Liability Act for a larger sum. If he succeeds, no harm will be done. If he proceeds at common law, and is given a greater amount of compensation than is provided for under this Bill, no harm will be done. But if he has misconceived his remedy- </para>

Ought a man, in the circumstances, to be put to that risk? Neither the Imperial Act nor any State Act puts a man to that risk, but saves him from it. The Commonwealth Government can have the matter investigated thoroughly, and the Crown Law officers may say, &#34; This man has an action against you at common law, or probably an action under the State Employers Liability Act. He may get  &#163;2,000  or &#163;3,000 damages if he chooses to sue. Now, protect  i-ourselves  right before his eyes, and make him face the risk of signing a declaration under paragraph <inline font-style="italic">e.&#34;</inline> Is that fair? </para>

                    <para>. - I am sure that every honorable senator will give the Commonwealth credit for doing the very best it can in the circumstances. What possible object can it have in depriving an employe of what is his just right? I wish to point out that the Imperial Workmen&#39;s Compensation Act, as well as every State Act on the subject, is different altogether from this Bill. The Imperial Act is a general Compensation Act with respect to accidents occurring in the employment of workers throughout Great Britain, and so is every State Act with respect to compensation to workmen generally employed in that State. But this Bill deals with only a section of the workers in Australia, namely, the employes of the Commonwealth. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger recognises that fact, he must acknowledge that the case he has referred to under the English Act has no relation to this measure, because the employe and the employer are different. </para>

                        <para>- Paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> of the clause only provides that an employe&#34; cannot recover compensation first from the Commonwealth under this Bill, and then claim compensation from the Commonwealth or anybody else under another law. It provides that he cannot do the two things at the same time. The clause which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger is endeavouring to amend does not debar any employe of the Commonwealth who, in the course of his employment, has met with an accident, from taking action under any other law, if he thinks that it will be to his benefit to do so, and if he fails there he can take advantage of this measure. But it provides that if he elects to come under this measure straight-away - and that is what every sensible employe will do, because it will be the most liberal and most certain legislation existing in the Commonwealth - he will have to give an undertaking not to seek a remedy under some other law at the same time. What more does the employe want ? If he comes under another law, and gets compensation, of course he will not be able to get compensation under this measure. </para>

Since the Imperial or a State Act is a general Workmen&#39;s Compensation Act, the Court, working independently under that Act, can dismiss a case, and has dismissed a case. Although it may be a State Court which will try a complaint under this measure, yet it is very doubtful whether, under the Constitution, we could direct a Court in a State, as we could not direct a Court in Great Britain, to dismiss a case. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger desires to make what is plain and straightforward at present complicated and difficult, he will stick to his amendment.

                        <para>- That was afterwards modified. I say, &#34; Deal with your own employes, and allow your employes to go into your own Court.&#34; It must be admitted that if the Commonwealth is advised that the claimant may have an action at common law in the Federal Court, the Commonwealth Government can block him under sub-clause <inline font-style="italic">e.</inline> They can say, &#34; No. You will not have a penny. You must sign that declaration.&#34; The moment the man has signed that declaration his common law rights in a Federal Court are gone. If the man elects not to sign the undertaking, it is a very nice point as to whether he will have an action in the Federal Court at common law, and that point should be placed beyond all doubt. There is a remarkable difference between this Bill and the Imperial Act in that respect, and there is a remarkable departure in this Bill from the provisions of at least four of the Acts of the States of the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth Government when dealing with their own employes leave the question of their liability in doubt, while the Imperial Act and the Acts of four of the Australian States make the position clear. </para>

                        <para>- There is no doubt about that. I have proposed this amendment, which appears in the Imperial Act and the Acts of four of the States, but which does not appear in this Bill, in order to make the position clear. The Commonwealth Government, when dealing with its own employed, should be subject to the same obligations as a private employer under the Imperial law and the State laws. It may be that if a- man chooses to sue at common law even in the Federal Court, and the Commonwealth do plead sub-clause <inline font-style="italic">e,</inline> there is no estoppel,, but the risk is too great, and my amendment would place the question beyond: doubt. The only objection that can be offered to it is that if we were to attempt to confer jurisdiction on the State Courts the State Courts would decline to exercise that jurisdiction. Even if that be granted, it should be made quite clear that when an employe of the Commonwealth is suing in the Federal Court he should have the same rights as he would have if he sued at common law a private employer in any part of the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>. - There is a great deal in the argument put forward by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger, and I think it is a matter,, not of introducing the unwieldy section that is in the Imperial Act, but of revision. of this clause in order to make the position clear. I believe the intention of. the Government is not to prevent a man from: suing at common law, but as far as 1 can make out the draftsman has followed closely the provision in the Seamen&#39;s Compensation Act which we passed last year. In that Act the departure was made, but. the position was made clear in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">c,.</inline> sub-section 2, of section 5, which reads - </para>

The whole point, with me is whether this Bill  does  so prevent ;him. I have looked closely into the point, and I think that it is only a matter of draftsmanship. I do not believe that the intention of the Government is to prevent a man from claiming at common law. lt must be remembered that the Bill does mot apply to the Commonwealth only, because the clause says - </para>

                        <para>- I am assuming that. My experience is that the question of awarding compensation is always put to the arbitrator. There have been few cases that have been settled independently of arbitration, because the whole question hinges on the amount of compensation. The Bill sets forth the maximum amount that shall be paid by the Commonwealth Government in any case. That is the very  reason  why the case should be put to the arbitrator, to show that the State is entitled to pay the maximum in every case. The arbitrator is the Court. </para>

                        <para>- In every case that I have known, a stipendiary magistrate has been the arbitrator. This Bill provides exactly the same machinery. The only point that is not clear, to my mind, is this : Under the Bill, if a person is injured whilst in the employment of. the Commonwealth, he is entitled to get compensation except where there has been wilful and serious negligence on his own part. Is that workman to be shut out from going to Court if he prefers to do so, rather than to claim compensation under the Bill? </para>

                        <para>- Take the case of a public servant who is killed whilst on duty. Suppose that the widow or next of kin consults a solicitor, who advises that it would be expedient to sue under the common law, because by so doing a larger amount of damages would be obtained than under this Bill. Suppose that when the case goes to Court, the widow is unable to prove her case. In that event, under the Imperial Act, the Judge who tried the case at common law could nonsuit the plaintiff, but could, at the same time, assess damages under this measure. </para>

                        <para>- I have read the clause in conjunction with other- Acts, and have studied the greatest authority on workmen&#39;s compensation, and I am inclined to think &#34;that the plaintiff who proceeded under common law in the first instance would have to give up his right to claim under this Bill. If the Government can give me an assurance I shall be satisfied. I do not want a public servant to suffer because of some mistake of ours in framing the Bill. Our Public Service ought to have all the benefits that are conferred upon workmen in private employment. </para>

                        <para>- I understand, then, that if a claimant does not recover, that is to say, if he does not get a verdict from a Court, he can claim against the Commonwealth under this Bill. But if he claims under this Bill first, he must not appeal to any other Court afterwards. If the Government are assured by the Crown Law officers that that is the meaning, I am satisfied. </para>

                    <para>. - I was at first in doubt as to the relation of paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> to paragraph <inline font-style="italic">e.</inline> I think that an employe&#39; is perfectly protected as far as paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> is concerned. What appeals to my mind is that the latter portion of the paragraph, which says &#34; shall not affect any civil liability of the Commonwealth under any other law.&#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger has quoted the Imperial Act extensively. I remember the first Workman&#39;s Compensation Act being introduced into the House of Commons, where it was passed on the 1st July, 1896. One of the provisions of that measure was that a workman engaged in the erection of a building had to fall 30 feet before; he could recover compensation. If  a  workman was going to fall from a scaffold&#39;! he had to make up his mind to fall 30&#39; feet, or not fall at all. Otherwise he would get nothing. </para>

                        <para>- This measure lays down no qualification in regard&#39; to&#187; Federal employes claiming against the Government. I should hesitate to agree to&#39; the passing of this clause if I thought that&#39; paragraph <inline font-style="italic">e</inline> would debar an employe&#39; of the Commonwealth from claiming compensation under any other civil law. But! having listened to the legal arguments on both sides, I am satisfied that paragraph.- <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> makes ample provision for the protection of the workmen. </para>

                    <para>. - - I do not know whether clause 5 has: been considered in this connexion; but if&#39; occurs to me .that it might have some bearing upon the matter. It provides that proceedings for recovery of compensation under the Bill are not to be maintainable unless the claim for compensation has been made within six months from the occurrence of the accident. I take the case of a man who says, <inline font-style="italic">&#34;I</inline> shall try my luck at common law before I appeal to the Commonwealth,&#34; and proceedings in his action-- are dragged out for over six months from the time of the occurrence of the accident. </para>

In the circumstances, I should like to be sure as to the effect of the paragraph. I have quoted cases where, but for such a provision as I desire to have inserted in this Bill, no relief would have been open to injured workmen. However, I am told that the Crown Law officers have decided that the use of the word &#34; recover &#34; in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> will affect the case of a person claiming compensation from the Commonwealth under paragraph <inline font-style="italic">e.</inline> It is contended that if an. injured workman has not recovered compensation, he will be regarded as a claimant under paragraph <inline font-style="italic">e,</inline> though he may have tried to recover compensation under some other law.

                    <para>. - I should like to ask whether the Government intend to introduce a provision providing for compensation in the case of workmen who contract a disease arising from the nature of their employment. I referred to the matter when we last discussed the Bill. This measure deals only with compensation for injuries received as the result of an accident, and it does not, as most of the State Acts do, make provision for the case of an employe&#34; of the Commonwealth who contracts a disease arising from the nature of his employment. I think that in such cases compensation should be allowed in just the same way as it is proposed under this Bill to allow compensation in the case of a workman who breaks a leg as the result of an accident. Persons in the employ of the Commonwealth may contract lead poisoning or a number of other diseases owing to the nature of their employment, and may be affected quite as seriously as if they suffered an injury as the result of an accident. I  should like to hear whether the Government intend to make any provision in that direction. </para>

                    <para>. - This is a Bill to provide for compensation in the case of accidents to workmen in the employ of the Commonwealth. Permanent employes of the Commonwealth are entitled to receive a certain amount of pay during the time they are absent by reason of sickness. A casual employe absent from his work by reason of sickness would not be entitled to compensation. I hope that in the near future something may be done by legislation or regulation to meet such cases. Casual employes will, under this Bill, be compensated for injuries arising from accidents. Diseases which may be contracted owing to certain conditions of employment are not due to accident. I hope that in the near future legislation will be introduced to deal with sickness and unemployment, but it should be associated with such legislation as that providing for old-age and invalid pensions. It is, we think, beyond the scope of this measure providing compensation for injuries resulting from accident. </para>

I really thought that from- the different arguments which had been advanced he had come to the conclusion that it would be of no use to move the amendment, because the Government is not. prepared to assent to it. It is one to which I have already referred in connexion with other matters. It more nearly relates to an amendment of the Old-age and Invalid Pensions Act, because its purpose is to grant pensions to the widows and orphans of those who have been killed by accident in the Commonwealth service! I know that the amendment has been circulated with a very laudable purpose, but I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> will see that it is necessary to proceed in another way. The provision would hamper and overload a Bill of this kind, and therefore I trust that he will not press his motion for a recommittal as the Government cannot see its way to support the amendment. I think that it would he only a waste of valuable time to recommit&#39; the&#39; Bill, and bring about any very lengthy argument in favour of the amendment or against it. I really thought that the honorable senator had given up the idea of amending the schedule, and was absent on that account. </para>

                <para class="block">The object of this amendment is to provide some substantial compensation for the widow and family of a workman who has been killed, or who has died through an accident, while in the service of the Commonwealth. The principle which I should like to place before the Committee is this : If a man dies or meets with his death indirectly through an accident in the service of the Commonwealth, his widow ought to become a charge upon the Commonwealth. If a man&#39;s life is sacrificed in the service of the Commonwealth, it is only a fair proposition to make that his dependents should be looked after by the Commonwealth until they are able to provide for themselves. The amendment does not ask for anything in the way of charity. It simply provides that the Commonwealth shall give to the widow and family a <inline font-style="italic">quid fro quo</inline> for the life of the father and the breadwinner. Under the schedule as it stands, the minimum amount of compensation in case of death is &#163;200, and the maximum &#163;500. During the second-reading debate I instanced the case of a woman left with a family of four young children, aged, say. two, four, six, and eight. Eight years would elapse between the death of the husband and the time when the eldest of the children would be sixteen. Ten years would elapse in the case of the second child, twelve in the case of the third, and fourteen in the case of the youngest. During the whole of that time, not only would the burden of providing for those children be thrown upon the mother, but there would also be cast upon her the&#39; duty of earning her own livelihood, and the only assistance she would have would be the maximum amount of &#163;500. It might be any sum between &#163;200 and &#163;500, but  it could not be more than &#163;500. I submit that &#163;500, although it looks a big sum, is entirely inadequate compensation to a family such as I have indicated, for the loss of the breadwinner. </para>

                        <para>- There might. _ I am merely taking the case of a small family. To think of investing &#163;500 for the widow and family is altogether out of the question, because, even if it were invested in Government securities at 4 per cent., which is a very high rate of interest for that form of investment, the income would be &#163;20 only, or something like 7s. per week. So that if the money is- -to be of any benefit to the widow and family, the principal must be spent. Five hundred pounds is equal to the result of three years&#39; earnings of a man getting &#163;3 per week. The widow and children can live on &#163;2 per week. At the end of five years the compensation is exhausted, and the widow is thrown entirely on her own resources to earn a living, not only for herself, but for the children. Each of those children is of value to the community. We are anxious to get more population in Australia, and with that object the States, and the Commonwealth to a certain extent, are encouraging emigration from other countries. We ought, in the first place, to do our utmost for the children who are born upon Australian soil, and when children are deprived of their natural protector, the Government ought to step in and do all. it can for them until they are in a position to earn their own  living. I think the amendment is a fair and reasonable one, and I trust the Government will see their way to accept it. The Vice-President of the Executive Council, when replying on the second reading, said the Bill was not for the purpose of paying pensions, or anything of that kind; it was simply to provide for compensation. This amendment provides for compensation, and as, by the Bill, weekly payments to a person totally incapacitated can be commuted for a lump sum or an annuity, the principle of a pension or annuity is already embodied in the measure. </para>

                    <para>. - I am sure that every member of the Government, and every member on this side of the Chamber, and, I dare say, every member on the other side, would only be too pleased if we could grant pensions such as are proposed by the amendment in a time of difficulty; and not only grant them in connexion with servants of the Commonwealth, but the working sections of the community in every walk of life. It would not be fair to the workers, who have to go out into the cold blast of competition throughout the whole of Australia, and who meet with an accident or misfortune, that they should have only the State Acts to fall back on in connexion with accidents, and that the employes of the Commonwealth should be placed in such an advantageous position. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> must remember that it is the workers in every walk of life who would have to make their contributions towards the amounts that would be distributed by way of pensions among the widows and orphans of those who had been in the service of the Commonwealth. The liberal allowance proposed to be made to the widows and orphans of Commonwealth employes is not for the purpose of enabling the widows to sit down and enjoy themselves in peace and contentment during the rest of their lives. The widow gets this compensation for the purpose of enabling her to get into some little business, or carry on some calling, until such time as her children are in a position to assist her. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. It is a subsidy on account of a loss that they have sustained; and I think it will be time enough to consider the widows and orphans of deceased Commonwealth servants when we are considering the position of other widows and orphans. Honorable senators are all aware that you, sir, have a motion on the business-paper dealing with this very question, and I hope the time will come when the Commonwealth will be in a position to bring in a general scheme providing, not only for all invalids as well as old-age pensioners, but for all widows and orphans who are left in an unfortunate position. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> has neglected to look at another phase of the question. It&#39; you are going to give a widow with four children, of whom the youngest is only eight, 15s. per week until she is married, she will never get married, and the very object which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> has in view with regard to peopling Australia with young Australians will be defeated. I believe <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> is endeavouring to do something in the interests of the widows and orphans of former public servants, but before he proceeds to do anything of that kind, I ask him to consider the hundreds of thousands of other widows and orphans. </para>

                        <para>- No ; but when we begin to deal with widows and orphans, let us deal with all the widows and orphans in Australia, and not one small section at the expense of the rest. Although I should be glad if we were m a position to do this, and far. more. I ask honorable senators to consider the position of the Commonwealth. At the present time we have enormous commitments to meet, and although we may desire to do all that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> wishes, still we should have discrimination enough to know that an amendment like this, upon such a Bill, is not the very wisest legislation that could be passed. </para>

                    <para>. - I quite understand that this is such a drastic amendment that Ministers naturally feel somewhat averse to accepting it. But it appears to me that the argument of the Vice-President of the Executive Council that the widows and orphans of the rank and file of the citizens outside the Commonwealth Service are not going to receive such good treatment as the widows and orphans of public servants, ought not to carry much weight, because, taking things by and large, the position of those working in the Commonwealth Service is above the average of the same class of ability outside the Service. </para>

                        <para>- I am not saying that there are not. I am simply replying to the honorable senator&#39;s argument. It has frequently been said that the Commonwealth should make an example of its Service in regard to the treatment of employes. Therefore, if we pay a high minimum rate during the lifetime of our employes, the argument holds good for treating their widows and orphans better than the widows and orphans of persons outside the Service are treated. Then, again, it does not follow that we should reject the amendment, because a very much larger sum than .&#163;500 would be disbursed between the time of the supposed widowhood and the attainment of the age of sixteen years by the youngest child. Some widows would be without families. Where there were large families the presumption is that the elder children would be earning something. In the case of those who were at the age mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> there is no earthly reason why we should say that the widow should have just barely enough to keep both body and. soul together. The- Vice-President of the Executive Council mentioned that this Bill provides a means whereby a widow deprived of her husband by accident would be able to get into some little business to keep her and her children. But, like every other human quality, business ability is something which .everybody does not possess. There are some people who could never make a success of a business. </para>

The minimum proposed in the schedule to this Bill is <inline font-style="italic">&#163;500.</inline> That sum at 5 per cent, would return 10s. per week. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart&#39;s</inline> proposal is to pay 15 s. per week, which capitalized would amount to .&#163;750. That is an increased amount as compared with the sum specified in the Bill. I submit that, according to the rulings that have been given by preceding Presidents of &#39;the Senate, an amendment of this kind cannot be moved, inasmuch as it involves an increased charge or burden upon the people </para>

                <para class="block">If you give some people a sum of money which is not sufficiently large for them to live upon when placed in a bank or invested, they are not possessed of the business ability to handle it wisely, and in many cases widows and families would soon be in a state of destitution or no better off than if no compensation at all had been paid. In cases where large sums of money have been collected for the widows and orphans of those who have met with mining accidents - as in the instance of the Bulli disaster - it is nearly always administered by some trust or board, which pays pensions or annuities. That step has been taken because it has been found from experience that if money were paid in a lump sum it would be of little use to widows and orphans. At any rate it is not so valuable as it is when paid out periodically. For that reason a proposal to make some kind of periodical payment appeals strongly to me. The argument about the payment of a weekly sum on account of each child tending to prevent widows from marrying does not appeal to me strongly, because it a widow likes a man, and he can adequately keep her, he would probably spend a great deal more on her than  15s.  a week. If she preferred the  15s.  to marrying the man, she ought to keep it, and give a chance to a single girl. There is great competition among widows, at any rate ; and if a widow met a man whom she liked, I do not think she would stick at  15s.  a week-. It is not such an enormous sum after all. I am not a particularly egotistical person, but I do not think my wife would care to lose me for  &#163;5,000.  In regard to young families, I put this point to any one who has any knowledge of bringing up children - whether it is not a fact that both parents are necessary for the proper care and upbringing of a family. If, unfortunately, children are left fatherless, and the mother has to take the place of both parents, assistance is all the more necessary. Consequently, it is not unreasonable to accept an amendment of this kind to assist widows in bringing up their families. As to. paying a lump sum to put a widow into a business, I remind the Senate that aptitude for business does not pertain to every one, and it is not every one who can handle a large sum like  &#163;500  or  &#163;5,000.  The more some people have, the more likely they are to be &#34; taken down &#34; or to squander their means. If there were a possibility of substituting a weekly allowance, I feel sure that it would be a better investment both from the point of view of the widow and family, and of the Commonwealth, than would be the payment of a lump sum. </para>

                        <para>- Even so, the money would be well spent. In any case I think that when a widow and family lose their breadwinner in the service of the Commonwealth, the Commonwealth is under an obligation to see them through. The Commonwealth could not exist unless certain works were carried on ; and if some unfortunately lose their lives in the carrying on of those works, surely the widows and families of those mcn should not be called upon to endure the added anxiety of poverty and want in addition to the loss of the father in the case of the children, and of the husband in the case of the wife. The loss of the parent and the husband should be sufficient in itself, but when to this is added poverty, want, and suffering caused through that loss, the circumstances often become deplorable. If we stopped to count the cost in everything we did we should never do anything. What was the argument of the Opposition when old-age pensions were first mentioned ? They said &#34;Look at the cost.&#34; We waved that argument aside, and said &#34; Never mind the cost. These old people must be provided for. They have borne the heat and burden of the day, and we are not going to see them destitute in their old age. We shall, therefore, give them pensions.&#34; Again, invalids who are incapacitated from earning their own living are given pensions. </para>

                        <para>- I was going to refer to it. It is open to the richest people in the land. I ask, where is the consistency of the Government in this matter? We subsidize people who do not require assistance, and the Government in this case refuse to help people who do re- quire assistance. That is wholly inconsistent with the dictates, I will not say of humanity, but of justice. We say to the rich woman, &#34; If you have a child, we shall make you a present of die sum of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;5.&#34;</inline> She may have an income of &#163;5,000 a year, live in a palace, drive around in a beautiful motor car, be able to obtain the luxuries as well as the necessaries of life, and may spend upon herself and her surroundings more than would be sufficient to provide for 100 families, yet we have agreed to pay this woman a sum of money which she does not want, and at the same time we refuse to assist in any substantial or useful way the widow and orphans of a man who loses his life in doing the work of the Commonwealth. The Vice-President of the Executive Council has said that with a sum of ,&#163;500 a widow might go into business. I have never seen anything so lamentable as the attempts of the widows of working men to make a living for themselves and their children by keeping small shops. They have no business training, are suddenly projected into a sphere of which they have, no knowledge, and, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> has pointed out4 they become very often the victims of people who are more clever than themselves, or of their own simplicity. That argument is worth nothing, because 95 per cent, of working men&#39;s wives have no training which fits them for business, and, further, we know that the day of the small shop is passing. The big stores are everywhere wiping the small people out. The probabilities are that the widow and family of a working man would be unable to subsist upon the profits of a small store. I am aware that there are thousands of widows who have kept stores in the past and are keeping them now, ekeing out a miserable existence in that fashion; but the opportunities in that direction are less now than ever they have been before, and are likely to be still less in the future. One other reason which the Vice-President of the Executive Council gave against my amendment was that the payment of 15s. a week to a woman for life might induce her not to marry again. That is not an argument at all. If she wished to marry, or some one wished to marry her, I do not suppose that the payment of a sum of 15s. a week would prevent the marriage. That is a matter which might very well be left to the woman herself. We have nothing to do with whether she marries again or not. </para>

                        <para>- No, I would not. The honorable senator is now trying to make the thing ridiculous. If he cannot accept the amendment he ought at least to treat it in a serious manner. We cannot at present provide for the widows and orphans throughout the Commonwealth, but I hope that the day is not far off when we shall do so. There is a motion on the business paper of the Senate at the present time dealing with that matter, and if it goes to a vote I shall support it. I say that the widows and orphans of the Commonwealth should be a charge upon the people of the Commonwealth. Human life is of more value than is anything else to the Commonwealth, young life more especially, because it is upon the young lives that the stability and safety of the Commonwealth depend. I trust that honorable senators will not be led away by the arguments of the Vice-President of the Executive Council, but will do the right thing by voting for my amendment. </para>

I shall first of all state to the Committee the object I have in view in submitting the amendment. The provision as it stands provides for a weekly payment during incapacity of a sum not exceeding half the average weekly wage of the workman during the previous twelve months. Under the amendment I wish to move the workman would receive the whole of the average weekly wage for the first month during which he is incapacitated, and half that wage for the period that came after. One reason why I move the amendment is because I think that men who meet with accidents in the Public Service ought to be treated at least as considerately as are members of the Public Service who become sick, and are unfit to attend to work for any particular period.

I think that men injured in the service of the Commonwealth ought to be at least treated on an equal  basis with servants who become sick in the ordinary course of events, and have to leave through sickness. That is all that is claimed in my amendment. Honorable senators will,  1  think, see that it is a perfectly fair proposition. If the amendment which was carried here the other day is agreed to by the other House, all that a person injured will be able to claim from the moment of injury will be half his wages ; whereas under the Public Service regulation, if a man takes influenza, and has to go home, that is, with a doctor&#39;s certificate, and receives leave of absence for a month, he gets full pay for a month.

Very often disaster occurs when a Bill like this is loaded. It causes delay, and we do not know where finality may be reached. In this Bill, we provide for a . payment up to &#163;2 a week, whereas the State Acts only provide for a payment of half the employees wages, and not to exceed&#163;1 a week. We provide for double that amount. I think that our Bill is fairly liberal, and I ask honorable senators to look at the matter from that point of view. We have wasted a good deal of time. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not want to waste time, but I certainly think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> deserves thanks from the Senate for the care and attention which he has bestowed upon this Bill. What strikes me in connexion with his amendment is that if at present the Public Service regulation provides for payment for one month in the case of sickness, subject, of course, to the Minister&#39;s right of disallowance, which,  1  suppose, is very rarely exercised, and is practically a dead letter. It will be a very difficult thing, if we have a different rule&#34; applying to another case, to always draw a distinct line where sickness can be separated from accident. There should be a distinct value in having a uniform practice for sickness brought about by ordinary causes. </para>

                        <para>- That is not quite the point I mean. It may lead to some injustice, if not confusion, in the administration of the Public Service, unless the honorable senator&#39;s amendment is adopted, because one class of men is on a different footing from another class. There are provisions whereby, if an accident is caused by wilful negligence on the part of the employe, he may not receive consideration. I mean that it will not be an absolute payment in all circumstances. There are qualifications which will deprive a person of the benefits under this measure. If we take an ordinary accident, which is not due to a person&#39;s own fault, but to any one of a thousand and one causes, it is really more deserving of compensation than is an ordinary illness. I maintain that, in a very large measure, ordinary sickness is a person&#39;s own fault. If a man has anything like a decent constitution to start life with, and pays due attention to what he eats, drinks, and wears, and to exercise, it is very largely his own fault if he gets ill. </para>

                        <para>- I refer to those who start fairly, of course; there are many eminent men who start with a poor constitution. So much sickness is brought on by indiscretion in eating, drinking, and many other causes, that a person who is suffering from an unavoidable accident is a more deserving subject for remuneration and adequate treatment than are many persons who may assist in bringing about their own illness by indiscreet methods of living. Ordinary accident is more deplorable than ordinary sickness, and in many cases is far more deserving of commiseration and adequate treatment. It may lead, I repeat, to confusion in the administration of the Public Service when we find one system governing one set of employes and another system of calculating compensation provided for the other set. </para>

                        <para>. - I desire to ask the Minister of Defence if he can give any explanation of the long delay in receiving the promised report about the alleged flogging or caning of a cadet who attended the Sydney Grammar School. The incident occurred some time ago, and as the officer concerned and the place where the incident occurred are within a short distance of one another, it seems - peculiar that there should be any circumlocution about getting a report on the matter. It looks to me as though some of those concerned were trying to concoct some feasible story before they let the Minister know their version of the incident. It is also stated - I do not know with what degree of truth, but the statement has appeared in, the Sydney press - that a cadet named Wall was punished by the adjutant and some other officer. </para>

                            <para>- I do not, but I think I could get the information. It is stated that the same officers who are concerned in the case of the Sydney Grammar School boy are also concerned in the case of this lad, who is the son of a widow, and is working for the Fresh Food and Ice Company in Sydney. The charge against him was that he had repeated an order given by his officer. It is said that the officer had given the order &#34; Shoulder arms,&#34; &#34; Present arms,&#34; or &#34; Order arms,&#34; and the lad afterwards explained that he merely repeated it in order to memorize it, and did not mean it as an insult to the officer. For this alleged offence, the adjutant and another officer arrested the lad and took him to the barracks, and caused him to be flogged. When he returned home, his mother saw that he was in some pain or trouble, and questioned him, but he refused to give her any satisfaction. After he was asleep in bed, however, she examined him, and found great weals on his body, which had been inflicted by a stick or cane. She was urged by her neighbours to take the matter to Court, but she did not like to. Many people do not care about going to the Law Courts. The statement is that this officer said to the lad that he could either be prosecuted and fined, or take a flogging. The lad replied that he was poor, and could not afford to undergo a prosecution, and so the two officers flogged him. Whether the story is a true one or not, I do not know ; but investigation of these matters should not be delayed. If there is going to be strict military discipline and prompt obedience by cadets of the orders of their officers, there should also be prompt action with regard to officers who are guilty of this kind of conduct. If the facts are as alleged, the officer should be dismissed from the service. If we are going to introduce the old system of flogging into our Defence Force, it will soon burst up the show, and those who share my feelings will help to do it. I am not putting this forward as fact. I am merely making the statement as it has been reported. What I want to know is the reason for the delay that has occurred in connexion with the report on the matter. </para>

                        <para>. - I should like to complain of the unnecessary delay that has occurred in connexion with an investigation which the Minister promised into the prosecution of cadets in Hobart, several weeks ago, and which was brought under his notice at least three weeks ago. I refer to those prosecutions in which the cadets concerned alleged that they were prevented from, attending the statutory drills owing to the fact that the  Deputy  Postmaster-General at Hobart would not give them the time off. Some difficulty may have occurred to prevent the Minister getting the information placed before the Senate, but there seems to have been too much delay altogether, and it would appear as though the Senate were going to rise without the information. If the statement is true, I think that the official concerned is entitled to the strongest censure by the Minister controlling his Department, and strong measures ought to be taken to prevent one Department coming into direct conflict with the administration of another very important Department. I urge the </para>

Honorable senators know that we have not a system of centralization. We have attempted to decentralize ; that is to say, officers in New South Wales are under the Commandant of New South Wales, and, as far as discipline is concerned, administration is not carried out from Melbourne. When a case like this is reported, I bring it under the notice of the Adjutant-General. He then has to instruct, the particular Commandant to get a report, and the Commandant has to call upon the Area Officer to supply a report. </para>

It has either been reported by inspectors to him, or it comes under my notice, either by letter or by representations made by a member. It can easily be seen that when a case is mentioned here it takes some little time to bring it under the notice of the Commandant, and for a report to be furnished by the Area Officer. </para>

                            <para>- No, and I do not think Be does. The Area Officers are not permanent officers; they are not permanently paid, and they can only do the work in a certain portion of their time. Delay often occurs in dealing with officers who are not permanently employed. In regard to the. other case <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> must recognise that it first came under my notice to-night. I have no personal knowledge of the facts. I cannot assume that they are correct. The &#39;honorable member would not expect me to do so. I must send the  matter on for report. As to the honorable senator&#39;s remarks about the practice of flogging, I can assure him that while I am Minister there is no danger of any such thing being _ permitted. No military officer can bring in such a system unless the political head of the Department allows it. I will see that the reports on the two cases are obtained as early as possible. </para>

                            <para>- It the cases, are proved the officers responsible will be severely dealt with. There is not the slightest doubt about that. With regard to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Long&#39;s</inline> complaint, the question to be dealt with is 4: complicated one. It concerns the Post and Telegraph Department as well as the Defence Department. As far as my Department is concerned, I have had inquiries made, and the report came to me yesterday. Inquiries were made from the cadets concerned, and they have made written statements to the effect that they were prevented from attending drills. Now we are sending on the reports to the Postmaster-General in order that lie may get the- statements of his officers 011 tlio charges made.- It would not be right for me to assume that the statements are correct until the officers of the Post and Telegraph Department have made their statements. I have no right to call upon them for reports, but as soon as I received the papers I minuted them- to be forwarded to the Postmaster-General, asking him to inform me whether the charges are correct, and what his officers had to say about them. I also minuted&#39; the papers that the matter is urgent. So that everything that can be done has been done. The Defence Department is not solely responsible, nor can we accept the statements of the cadets without giving the officers against whom the charges are made an opportunity of replying. As soon as a reply is received from the Postmaster-General I will make the information available. </para>
