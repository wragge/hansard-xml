                        <para>. - One marked feature of this Bill which will strike every honorable senator is its great severity, and I may say from my point of view, and I think from the point of view of the Opposition generally, and of all other liberal-minded men in the community, that its penalties are unduly and unnecessarily severe. In that respect I think that the Bill is a violent transgression of the opinion of all great modern jurists and penologists. I am tempted to point out how in every age penalties which are unnecessarily severe have inevitably defeated their own ends. The nineteenth century has recognised that principle. The battle for its recognition was begun about 2,000 years ago, and, if I may make a rather graphic remark, twenty-six centuries are speaking in protest against this kind of legislation. Honorable senators on the other side are giving their reasons for this departure, and, notwithstanding the historical protests of those twenty-six centuries, they will give effect to their opinions on this matter. But I make no hesitation in saying that if we are going to make a mistake about this kind of legislation, I would rather err with Solon than shine with Draco, or his twentieth-century descendant, the Australian Attorney-General. What is the defence hurled back to us when we point out these enormous penalties ? One argument is that the possible delinquents can bear the penalties. We have heard that view repeatedly expressed by interjections during the debate. From a Liberal point of view, almost, from a logical point of view, those who advance that argument ought to be ashamed of the position which they assume. There is not a single man in. .this. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para class="block">Chamber who can predict who the delinquents may be ; arid legislation in anticipation of possible delinquencies, especially from the point of view that the possible delinquents "can bear it," is founded, not on Liberalism, but more or lesson the spirit of legislative ferocity. The argument itself is one with which all who know anything of history are acquainted. It was the argument of the Star Chamber. It was the argument of the Inquisition. Very often, the victims of both those bodies were handed over to the executioner, who was instructed that the physical torture to be perpetrated should be adjusted to the capacity of the victim for enduring it. Although the penalty imposed by this Bill is chiefly pecuniary, the idea that possible de'linquents may be able to bear it, and should have penalties imposed according to the degree of their capacity for endurance, is identical in spirit, however much it may differ in other respects, with the torture penalties of the Star Chamber and the Inquisition. Another argument used for the Bill is that certain witnesses have delayed the proceedings of a Royal Commission. In the name of common sense, why should they not? The Constitution gives them a right of appeal. This Parliament cannot take that right away from them. Inasmuch as the. persons who will be penalized by this measure have, in common with the rest of the community, to bear the expense of providing Law Courts, they should have an equal right, if they chose, of appealing to any Court to which the law allows them to go. How 'futile such an objection is ! It is only- another method of trying to breathe revenge rather than to legislate. Even now the Bill, with its drastic clauses, its severe punishments, and its summary jurisdiction, cannot deprive persons of their right of appeal. They have that right, notwithstanding all the penalties imposed. Their legal rights will be the same, notwithstanding this Bill, as they were before it was introduced. Therefore, that kind of excuse is utterly flimsy in itself, and has only to be touched to show how hollow it is. It falls at once to the ground. I do not wish at this stage to enter into details. I wish' to confine myself, as far as I can, to general principles. But I desire to draw the attention of the Senate to some of the very drastic clauses. We have here constituted what the Bill calls an offence. By clause 5, sub-clause i, clause 6*c and clause 6e, heavy penalties are imposed. The refusal of a witness to answer a question put to him by a Commission is constituted a continuing offence. Every time the tribunal wishes to bring a witness before it, and the witness refuses to answer, an offence is committed. Now, we know what indictable offences are under the Constitution. An accused person has secured to him under the Constitution the privilege of trial by jury. But there is a clear distinction in the Constitution between an indictable offence and an offence of another kind ; the main difference being that offences are triable by summary proceeding, whilst indictable offences must go to a jury. This Bill teems with provisions constituting indictable offences. But the tendency of the Bill, as has been the tendency of many other measures brought in by this Government, is steadily to deprive those persons who may come under it of a right of trial by jury. lt is a maxim of law that where an offence which would otherwise be indictable is constituted by Act of Parliament an offence punishable in a particular way by another tribunal, the offence does not become indictable. I do- not say that the principle as I have laid it down is applicable to all cases. It would seem that the Attorney-General has done all he possibly could in this Bill to deprive a person who. may be accused of an offence under it of the right to a trial by a jury, and has used every known provision of the law to bring him before a summary tribunal. </para>

I can understand the inclusion of a provision of that kind in a Customs or Excise Act, but I cannot understand its appearance in a Bill of this character. This clause means, if it means anything, that a Royal Commission may commit a witness appearing before it to gaol for a certain term, either upon summary conviction or upon indictment, and may by execution and distress strip him of every penny he owns as well. Such a provision might possibly be excused if it applied only to powerful and wealthy companies, but this Bill is all-embracing, and may apply to a mere official of some trading company who may perhaps innocently fall within -its provisions. If there is a Draco as  Chairman  of a Royal Commission he may strain its provisions to such an extent as to absolutely ruin a witness. When a man is committed to gaol his imprisonment is usually accepted as an expiation of his offence. Even a felon after he has served his sentence is allowed to retain his goods and chattels. But we are asked to give a Royal Commission the power to deal summarily with a witness, have him detained in gaol, .and that is not to be an expiation of his offence, as he may still be ruined by the sale of <inline font-style="italic">his</inline> goods. </para>

                            <para>- That is so; but a jury may refuse to take the directions of a Judge, though a defendant may submit no defence to a charge brought against him. Under this Bill, if the  Chairman  ot a Royal Commission considers that an offence has been committed he may send a witness for summary conviction. The witness may be committed to gaol, and, after he has expiated his offence by imprisonment, there is .still the power of execution and distress upon his goods. I decline to assent to the proposition that our commercial community is so rotten as to justify these extreme and barbarous penalties. There is another feature of the Bill which must strike any intelligent observer as it strikes a lawyer. There is an attempt, under the guise of what is called contempt' of a Royal Commission, to give to the  Chairman,  if he happens to be a Justice of the High Court, or of a Supreme Court, or a Judge of inferior jurisdiction, greater powers in the punishment of contempt than he would have sitting in his own Court. One of the provisions of this Bill is, in substance, that if any person by speech or writing utters what is false or defamatory with regard to a Royal Commission, the  Chairman,  if he be a Judge of the Courts cited, may commit him for contempt. In the case of the <inline font-style="italic">King</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Nichols</inline> it has been laid down by the High Court of Australia in unmistakable terms that the mere publication in a newspaper of something that, is false and inaccurate about the High Court, or a Judge of that Court, does not in itself constitute a contempt of the Court. The real test as to what is or is hot a contempt of the Court is not whether statements made are defamatory or false, but whether the effect of their publication is such that it may be calculated to impede the administration of justice. I hope that when we come to discuss the Bill in Committee the Government "will .permit an amendment to make it dear that the  Chairman  of a Royal Commission shall have no .greater powers in this direction than a Justice of the High Court. I may -mention, as part of the history -of the case of the <inline font-style="italic">King</inline> v.. <inline font-style="italic">Nichols,</inline> thats though great powers in relation to .contempt are conferred upon the Conciliation and Arbitration Court, and though that case arose directly out of statements made in .respect of that tribunal, yet, when the offender was proceeded against, the Attorney-General did not rely upon the provisions of the Act relating to contempt of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court, but upon the fact that what was done or said by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nichols</inline> was contempt of the High Court itself. 'The High Court, however, ruled that the statements published 'by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nichols</inline> did not constitute contempt. It seems to me that in this Bill we are asked to deliberately flout that decision, because it is proposed to invest the Chairmen o'f Royal Commissions with powers greater than those which are vested in the High Court itself. If the powers of the latter tribunal are sufficient to insure that its proceedings sha'll be conducted in an orderly manner, and to enable it to enforce its  judgments against every man in the community, is it necessary to vest Royal Commissions with greater powers? There is another phase of this matter which naturally strikes one. One of the favourite methods of procedure adopted by the  Star  Chamber in its most severe days was to charge persons with libel or sedition, or with having used defamatory language, and to constitute it an offence against the King's prerogative. Because of the alleged libel or offence against the King's prerogative the accused were haled before the Star Chamber and by summary jurisdiction were frequently fined ; indeed, some were almost sent to execution. Under this Bill we are invited by the Attorney-General to make Royal Commissions like the Star Chamber  - to empower them to declare that any cf-. fence against them shall be dealt with in the same summary way. In this connexion one is irresistibly reminded of the name of Strafford. We know the way in which he used the Star Chamber and its machinery. He began like the  Attorney-General  has begun, and it may be that the  Attorney-General  will end as he did. I am speaking, of course, only in a political sense, because in these days we do not kill kings or execute statesmen. It is true that sometimes they are shot, but, as King Humbert remarked on one occasion, that is " one of the risks of the profession." For these reasons, I am justified in pointing to the parallel which exists between the legislation which we are now asked to enact and the methods which used to be employed in the old days, and which have been so universally execrated. Then I would direct attention to the fact that the first clause of the Bill seeks to alter a section of the Royal Commissions Act, under which the Governor-General has power to constitute a Royal Commission. It is proposed to amend that section by giving to the Government additional powers to appoint Commissions under "Letters Patent of the King." Here, again, the very words employed are reminiscent of the tyranny of past ages. The term '' Letters Patent of the King " is familiar to every constitutional lawyer, and, indeed, to every person who is seized of the development of British constitutional history. </para>

But it is somewhat strange that in Australian legislation we should be asked to give powers to Royal Commissions appointed under " Letters Patent of the King." </para>

                            <para>- The Royal Commissions Act was passed in 1902, and under it the Governor-General is empowered to appoint Royal Commissions. I am not aware - I confess that I am speaking entirely from memory, and, therefore, subject to correction - that anywhere in Australia, certainly not under the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth, have Commissions been appointed by Letters Patent of the King. They have been created under the powers vested in the Government by the Constitution itself, and those powers have been exercised by appointment through the Governor-General. Therefore I ask, " Why is it proposed to grant these additional powers? What is the difference between the powers of a Commission appointed under ' Letters Patent of the King ' and the powers of a Commission which is not so appointed ? " I would also direct attention to the fact that, under this Bill, the powers of inquiry by a Commission are extended to matters which " relate to, or are connected with, the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth.'' </para>

                    <para class="block">These words are so important that they require an exp!anation, through the trained (channel I should think of the Crown Law officer. I do not think that even under Letters Patent from the King you can give to a Royal Commission powers to inquire into anything which is outside section 51 of the Constitution. That section empowers the Parliament to deal with all matters referring to the "peace, order, and good government " of the Commonwealth in relation to the thirty-nine succeeding paragraphs, showing the ambit of its powers. The provision in this Bill seems to be an attempt to extend the powers of Royal Commissions to inquire into anything, provided that the subject-matter is directly or indirectly connected with what is known as " the peace, order, and good government " part of section 51 of the Constitution. I may say, on the other hand, that probably a constitutional lawyer would not feel alarmed over those words, and would hold, in harmony with repeated judgments of the High Court, that Parliament itself must be confined, so far as it is legislating with regard to the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth, within the ambit of the jurisdiction laid down in the thirty-nine paragraphs of section 51. But when we find a provision in this Bill that a Royal Commission may inquire into any matter which in any way relates to, or is connected with, any public power of the Commonwealth, it provokes anxiety, and is, at least, entitled to some explanation by the Government. </para>

                            <para>- Possibly. The words which appear to me dangerous are those giving a Royal Commission powers to deal with and inquire into anything of a public nature - anything affecting the ;public welfare. If we could be perfectly certain - perhaps some constitutional lawyers are certain - that, notwithstanding these words, a Royal Commission, like the Parliament itself, cannot go beyond, and must be strictly confined within, the Constitution, all would be well. If that be so, why do the words appear in the Bill at all ? They would be unnecessary, if, notwithstanding what words may be added to the Act, a Royal Commission, like Parliament itself, was strictly confined within the ambit of its jurisdiction. I would now draw the attention of the few honorable senators on the other side who have remained to listen to my speech to subsections 1. 2, and 3 of the proposed section 6b, giving the  Chairman  of the Commission the power to issue a warrant for the apprehension of any witness and to detain him at his will. The provision is worse than drastic ; it is extraordinary. To give to the  Chairman  of a Commission the power of detaining a witness as long as he chooses is certainly an arbitrary power. Are we to understand by that that we are going to give the  Chairman  the power to detain as he likes, and for what term he likes, subject, of course, to the provisions of the Bill, and that there is to be no appeal? If that be so, it would seem that the common law <inline font-style="italic">habeas corpus</inline> right, together with the statutory <inline font-style="italic">habeas corpus,</inline> has gone. This is a very serious matter. May I ask the Minister to take a note of my criticism so that in Committee he may be able possibly to explain away our fears. I take it that under these powers a witness may be right after all in his contention, but if it is in conflict with the Commission, or its  Chairman,  then the  Chairman  can enforce his way on the witness in the drastic form of detaining him as, he chooses. It is a very serious question whether we are going to allow, or whether we have allowed, a thing like that. It seems to me possible that the Government are seeking to deprive people of the benefit of the <inline font-style="italic">Habeas Corpus</inline> Act, and the <inline font-style="italic">habeas corf us</inline> procedure. The provision also says that a warrant may be addressed to any person, and that such person may break into and enter any place. That, too, is another drastic departure. I know that such a provision appears in the Customs Act and the Excise Act, for reasons which are obvious. But let me point out this contrast from the other point of view. If a person suspects that his goods have been stolen by a man and are stored in a certain place, and he wishes that place to be entered in order that he may discover, if he can, his stolen goods, he may apply to a magistrate for what is called a search warrant, and  1  believe that my memory is exactly ' correct when I say that, in the lower Courts, it is always addressed to a police officer, or a police constable. A man cannot get a warrant signed in the case of- stolen goods, take it outside the Court, and give it to any Tom, Dick, or Harry in the street, and say to him, " Go and search anywhere. Break in anywhere, and try to find my goods." He has, in "the warrant, to specify the place which he wants searched.  This  Bill departs entirely -from that procedure. <inline font-style="italic">lit</inline> gives to the <inline font-weight="bold">(Chairman .of a Royal Commission power in .certain .circumstances to issue a warrant to he executed by any person who may .enter any place or building, and I believe ;that a building would include .a ship or a ;boat. These general warrants have been universally execrated and condemned by jurists in England. The battle as to " the .exercise of these arbitrary powers under warrant has been fought out in England, but it extended oyer 200</inline> years. The infamous powers of general warrants were finally put an end to and destroyed by three leading cases, which must be familiar to every student of constitutional law. These cases are <inline font-style="italic">Walker</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Wood</inline> in  1763, <inline font-style="italic">Leach</inline> y. <inline font-style="italic">Money</inline> in  1765,  and <inline font-style="italic">Entinck</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Carrington</inline> in  1765.  In <inline font-style="italic">Walter v. Wood,</inline> the whole question of general warrants was brought before the Court of King's Bench, and they were universally condemned, and the warrants, when they were issued even in the name of the King, had to contain the names of places, the names of persons, and the names of documents which were wanted, before they could be executed.' The tyrants in those days did try to get warrants of this kind without naming the persons, and the Court held them back. They did try to get hold of documents without naming the documents they wanted, and the Court held them back. Here we are, so to speak, in one bound going back to the very principle which has been universally condemned by the Court itself, and which are revolting and antagonistic to our modern spirit of British freedom. I shall conclude my criticism with the statement that there is no need for this Bill. Recent proceedings of a Royal Commission have shown that there is not the slightest need for its enactment. So far as we know, the law is sufficient as it stands. I know that this Royal Commission came in contact with, very probably, one of the ablest men in commercial circles in Australia. If he and his legal advisers thought there was a loophole in the law, and tried possibly - and with a good deal of excuse, no doubt - to evade some of the demands of the Commission, I am still of opinion that the law, as we know it, is ample. It is a display of Draconian spirit to bring in new legislation until every power of the machinery of the law which we have set up has proved to be ineffective for the purpose intended. It may be that, after all, on appeal, the powers which seemed to the </para>

As soon as that was declared to be the law of the land, and binding upon everybody, a Bill was brought in to do away with that judgment to a certain extent. But the Commonwealth Government, in their insatiable hatred, so to speak, of these large trading operations, want to anticipate the declaration of the law itself by some more or less fanciful or imaginary evils which they say are besetting the community, and of which, so far, in this Bill we have no distinct evidence. I think that a strong Commission will effect its purpose under the present law ; and no matter how you improve the law, how drastic and clear you may make its provisions, you will not save a Commission in the future, if it be composed of dunder-headed Dogberrys from the effect of their follies and stupidities. </para>

                        SYMON (South Australia)  [3.54].  - It is customary - and very proper, I think - that we should examine a Bill with reference to the circumstances under which its introduction has been thought necessary, and particularly the mischiefs which it is proposed to remedy, and the remedy provided for them. That is, I think, peculiarly the case with respect to this Bill, in which a very great deal of interest has been taken, and about which much feeling has been aroused. The origin of the Bill is to be found in an existing Commission. That is very apt to be overlooked. We all know of what has been called the notorious Sugar Commission, which unfortunately arrived at a condition of cross purposes, at a condition which led to a suspension of its proceedings in order to determine whether the refusal of a witness to attend was or was not justified, and that is a matter which is now
                        <inline font-style="italic">sub judice.</inline>
                        Shortly described, this is a Bill introduced to alter the law, to create new offences, to increase penalties in respect of, it may be, existing offences - at any rate, of matters pending before a Royal Commission. To give new powers of punishment to, to add; in fact, new terrors to the proceedings of; an existing body, which has nearly concluded its investigations, is unheard of as far as my experience goes. But whether it be unheard of or not, it does appear to me to require calm investigation. Very adequate, very strong, very convincing justification is required, on the part of any Government that introduces such a measure. I have not heard that justification yet, nor have I read it in any of the attempts that have been made to justify this Bill. It is just as if, in proceedings before a Court, it were disclosed that the accused was possessed of unexpectedly large means, and Parliament was asked, upon that discovery, to legislate to increase penalties for that particular case. In other words, if one may » use the phrase - which I think 'has its origin on the stage - we have reached a point at which we are going to increase penalties, not to make "the punishment fit the crime," but to fit. the pocket of an alleged offender. That surely is a course of action which requires some very strong argument to justify it. Such a procedure would, as I have said, be very strange in the case of a Court invested with all the powers, clothed with all the authority and solemnity, of a Court of justice. But I beg to remind the Senate that a Royal Commission is not a Court. It has none of the attributes of a Court. The Royal Commission which has given cause for the introduction of this Bill was not created for the purpose of administering justice. It was established for the purpose of making certain investigations.

                            <para>- I quite agree. It was established for the purpose of securing information. Those Royal Commissions that are established for the purpose of securing information are usually composed of laymen and experts ; or, it may be, if there is a political element involved, of those who, in the arena of politics, have a particular interest to look after, or have a particular familiarity with the subject-matter to be dealt with. Naturally so, because such bodies are not expected to adjudicate. All that they can do is to inquire. They may have to inquire, as this Commission is inquiring, into matters of  economic importance, into matters affecting trade and commerce in a particular sphere. As to this Commission, I will not use an expression which has an offensive ring about it; I will not say that it is partisan; but I will say that it is a body notoriously wearing a political complexion. It was appointed, as one of the parties concerned evidently believes, not so much for the purpose of gathering information, like the well- known Tariff Commission - which, I may remind the Senate, was composed almost equally of Free Traders and Protectionists - but to collect material on which, probably, to found a prosecution or legal proceedings of some kind. That is openly confessed. It is said - and we are not concerned to deny or to pronounce one way or the other - that that was in the mind of the promoters of the Commission. The Sugar Company was looked upon as a gigantic combine, and as embodying all the worst features of a monopoly. I do not look upon the company with any particular favour myself, but it is entitled to justice, all the same. At all events, it was an open understanding in this country, and was generally believed from end to end of Australia, that the Sugar Commission was organized for the purpose of securing material to bring about a successful prosecution of the company. Naturally, therefore, it was not viewed with favour by those before whom was held the possibility of prosecution. They could not be expected to regard with favour the machinery by which material was to be collected for the purpose of their own conviction. Whilst we may feel that those connected with the Sugar Company have been taking advantage of everything which was in their favour, which of us can condemn them for that ? And which of us is to justify the introduction of special legislation in order to pillory them, or to put them, so to speak, to the torture? On the one hand you have one of the parties cited, who are supposed to be the intended victims, and are naturally, therefore, resentful of these proceedings. We cannot wonder that they did resent proceedings the object of which was to submit them "to searching investigation arid cross-examination for the purpose of a prosecution. But because of that we have introduced provisions which are certainly not consistent with the law of England, and which would not be tolerated for five minutes in an ordinary Criminal Court; which, indeed, only find an analogy, as far as I know, in the law of France. No man accused of an offence is liable to be compulsorily examined, and cross-examined, or to have inquiries directed to him, in order to force him to convict himself out of his own mouth. We know that an ordinary policeman says to a man arrested, " You are not obliged to say anything, but if you do say anything voluntarily, I warn you that what you say may be taken down and used against you at your trial." The parallel here is that these men are not <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> be entitled to the privilege of an ordinary person accused of one of the meanest of offences, but they are to be subjected to fresh legislative instruments to coerce them into admissions. I am not here as a defender of the Sugar Company, nor am I here to question the desirableness of establishing Royal Commissions, which are the counterpart, we must not forget, of Select Committees of this Parliament. There is this difference, however, between a Royal Commission and a Select Committee : if a witness does not answer a question before a Select Committee, or is recalcitrant, the matter has to be reported to Parliament, and dealt with there, where it can be thoroughly investigated. I do not question at all the propriety or the desirability - if you like, the necessity - of this kind of investigation to secure information. But in judging of the attitude of those from whom the information is sought, you must consider the circumstances and how they may think it affects them. Again, I remind the Senate of the excellent Tariff Commission. As long as Commissions are established honestly and fairly, I do not believe that you will ever experience any serious trouble in securing the information you require. </para>

I am not trying these men; but if I were trying them, I should give them, what this Bill does not give to witnesses, an opportunity of being heard in their own defence. I venture to think that there is reason to suggest that, as there is so much smoke, there is probably a little flavour of partisanship about the Commission. I am not speaking qf the  Chairman.  I am speaking of the Commission apart from the  Chairman.  There seems to be reason to fear that they are more or less saturated with the existing feeling about the enormities - for all I know they are enormities - of the Sugar Company. It is very difficult to suppose that there is no ground for the Sugar Company's supposition that the Commission is not friendly to them. I think that is putting the matter as fairly as one can to both sides. </para>

                            <para>- That is another circumstance in connexion with the Sugar Company that has to be remembered. It may have been a monopoly for the whole period of its existence, as far as I know. But I do not think that that is what has made it so potent and so solid a monopoly as it is at this day. Is not that due to the action of many of my honorable friends opposite, in the early days of this Parliament, when they voted for  those enormous sugar duties ? </para>

                            <para>- I think it was. But let us come back to the point. As I have already put it, can there be any wonder that there should be, in connexion with this Commission, friction, difficulty, and perhaps resistance? Surely those conditions were likely to be promoted under circumstances such as <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> have summarized. My honorable friend says that things of that sort might happen in a Court. So they might; but they might much more readily happen in connexion with a Royal Commission. For that reason we have had more heat introduced into this debate than was noticeable in any debate we have had for some time. But these are not reasons for introducing what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger has described as " Draconian " legislation, adding terrors to life and business. These are reasons for tact and care on the part of the members of Commissions, and a judicious discrimination in the conduct of their business. My belief is that a larger exercise of these qualities would be very much better in the interests of the community than the passing of such a Bill as this. For instance, hard things have been said about the  Chairman  of the Sugar Commission, who is a Judge of the Supreme Court of South Australia. But he is not sitting as a Judge when acting as  Chairman  of the Sugar Commission. He is a man with like passions and frailties with ourselves. "We must remember, if he has been betrayed into an indiscretion, as I think must be admitted, that the circumstances are quite unconnected with the judicial position, or with the usual functions or administration of a Court. He has himself frankly admitted it, and apologized for it. I venture to say that any one who has had the privilege, as I have had, of knowing <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Gordon for many years, off and on the Bench, will admit that if he had been sitting in a Court administering justice In the ordinary way as a Judge it is unthinkable of him that he would commit any breach of judicial restraint or decorum. </para>

He was not sitting in a Court. We must not forget that under the robes and ermine of a Judge there is the human being. When <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Cordon was induced by the Government to step down from the Bench and take his place as  Chairman  of a Royal Commission of a political complexion - I shall not -say of a partisan character - he was there -simply as a member of the community and a. citizen of the Commonwealth. It is for that reason I say that those who are to be condemned in the connexion with the proceedings of the Sugar Commission are the Government who invited and induced <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Gordon to leave his seat on the Bench and take the position of  Chairman  of that Commission. </para>

It was specially created because the ordinary Courts of the realm could not undertake the duty of trying that case. It was a special Court created to try the case between a body of men known as " Parnell ites " and the <inline font-style="italic">Times</inline> newspaper. </para>

                            <para>- The Sugar Commission is full of it. On Friday <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> by interjection, absolutely declared that the object of the Sugar Commission was to conduct proceedings with a view to destroying the so-called monopoly of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. That undoubtedly was the object of the Commission. I say that the circumstances attending such a Commission are such that, in my view, it was wrong for the Government to appoint a Judge to take any part whatever in it. It is like politics which are compared to a blacksmith's shop, where sparks are always flying about. It is because of these circumstances that the condition of conflict and friction was created which gave rise to matters on both sides that it would have been very much, better if they had not happened. </para>

                            <para>- Let us consider the Bill which has been introduced in these particular circumstances.. A condition of friction having arisen in connexion with the Sugar Commission, proceedings were taken with a view to enforcing the attendance of a witness who refused to attend. I agree with the honorable senator who last spoke that there is no need whatever for this Bill. It is altogether without precedent. There is no adequate justification for it. If there is a condition of inconvenience, or of scandal, if honorable senators please, in connexion with the length of the proceedings instituted for the punishment of a witness who did not attend, that is not remedied in any way by this Bill. We shall have very much the same difficulty hereafter that exists <inline font-style="italic">now. In the</inline> clause of this Bill which deals with such matters, the only difference is that we provide two or three alternative proceedings instead of the simple one before a Court of summary jurisdiction. These proceedings in respect of offences which are not indictable may betaken in the High Court by information or appropriate proceedings, or by any person in any Court of summary jurisdiction. Recourse might be had to the High Court, which is fully occupied with many other things. Such a case would have to <inline font-style="italic">her</inline> heard, as ^ case of first instance probably, before one Judge, from whom, there would be. an appeal to the Full Court of the. High Court, and from which there, might' be a, further, appeal. Such proceedings 'are now, taken under the existing Act bt 1902. before a magistrate in his summary, jurisdiction. From him there is an appeal, apparently," pending in the case o,f the Sugar Commission. ' In what way would this Bill expedite such proceedings?. Then we 'have" a provision for an increase of the penalty,. Under this Bill, the penalty., instead of being limited to a maximum of ^50, is to be increased to .£509." What is the use. pf putting, that provision upon paper, seeing that the minimum penalty may be. just what it may be now ? It would be a new and startling doctrine, to. promulgate, that any Court should' impose a penalty according to the length of an offender's pocket, and np,t according to the nature of the offence, of which he is adjudged to be guilty! I come, now tq certain provisions which seem, tq me absolutely, unjustifiable. Under, clause 7,' a man may be' arrested and brought before the. Comsmission. l{ie may b,e kept in custody at the will of the  Chairman.,  it may. be. until he rots, and he is to have no opportunity, pf regaining his liberty," except by ' the exercise.' of that will Such a provision would practically. repeal the <inline font-style="italic">Habeas Corpus</inline> Act. In addition <inline font-style="italic">\a</inline> being kept in custody at the, will pf- 'the ' Chairman, suB-paragra'ph 4 declares that his arrest arid imprisonment without any limited duration shall npt relieve him from the other penality's provided by the Bill. "In, other, words, he may be punished twice over. I do not know who is responsible for this remarkable conception. Not merely. pay a "man be imprisoned for an unlimited term under the first part of clause 7, but, under the second portion of it, he may be punished a second rime. </para>

If a person writes words which are false and defamatory of a Royal Commission, he merely invites an action for libel. But this is a new method of prescribing what shall constitute a libel on a Commission. Without any provision pf this kind, I think that a man would, as the law stands, expose himself to proceedings for libelling a Commission.

                    <para class="block">In other words, the  President  or  Chairman  of a Royal Commission is to sit in judgment upon what, if proceedings were taken for criminal libel, would be dealt with by a Judge and jury, and he is to do so whilst suffering under a sense of personal grievance. Is that the way in which justice should be administered ? The determination of the question of whether the proceedings of a Commission have been interrupted or disturbed is to be remitted to its  Chairman  ; but that is not the worst feature of it. What I wish to point out for the consideration of my honorable friends opposite is that the insertion of this provision relating to contempt is based upon an entire misapprehension as to the jurisdiction of Courts of Justice in relation to contempt. I have never heard of a body such as a Royal Commission, or one exercising similar functions, merely an inquiry, being intrusted with the powers which have come down from century to century to our Courts, and which enable them to punish for contempt. The power to punish for contempt is vested in 'a Court to enable justice to be administered. It is in furtherance of the dispensation of justice; but even then, it is very rarely exercised. Contempt of Court does not arise in consequence of something which may affect merely an exaggerated sense of personal dignity, or personal comfort, or personal reputation of a Judge. No Judge has a right to allow such considerations to influence him, because his temper might be brought into play. He is only justified in exercising his jurisdiction! as to contempt if what has happened is likely to interfere with the administration of justice - to disturb its flow or interfere with its direction. <inline font-style="italic">Oswald</inline> on <inline font-style="italic">Contempt of Court -</inline></para>

This Bill in the form in which it was originally introduced" in another place contained the words- " bringing it into disrepute " in lieu of the words " false and defamatory." I say,, without hesitation, that' if this power be committed to Royal Commissions, the members of those bodies in a moment of irritation may exercise it merely because their' own sense of personal dignity has been wounded. It is an innovation of the worst' description to confer such a power upon any body of men who do not answer to the well-known description of Judges sitting in a Court and exercising the functions of a Court. .

                        <para>The policy of permitting Judges to de'termine (except in cases of open and undoubted insult to their persons or authority while actually engaged in administering justice) what is or what is not a contempt of their own dignity or power has been, and may still be, with wisdom doubted. In a note on <inline font-style="italic">Rex</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Almon,</inline> referred to in Campbell's " Lives of the Chief Justices," it is stated that although the power to proceed by attachment in the case of a libel published on the Judges is undoubted, yet " the preferable course is to proceed by information or indictment so as to avoid placing them in the invidious situation of deciding where they may be supposed to be parties." </para>

                    <para>Unless the Minister can point to some precedent for this provision, or invite the Senate to the consideration of some authority for committing to a non-judicial body, exercising purely inquisitorial powers, they should abandon the provision. Some 'day or other it will come home to roost for themselves.  I  am not defending anybody, and  I  do not want any witness before a Royal Commission to abstain from attending or answering questions which are properly put, or to throw obstructions in the way.  I  think that the present law for that purpose is really sufficient, but if it is not sufficient - and  I  am sorry that it should be attempted to be altered while proceedings are pending - here after  I  shall be one to readily enlarge it, because of the difficulties which lie before us in regard to monopolies, and all that sort of thing.  I  am with my honorable friends opposite in trying to put all- these things down if they are inimical to the public interests. But that ought to be done calmly, and apart from any friction or indignation which may be caused by the particular circumstances of this case.  I  do ask my honorable friends opposite not to take a step of this kind - to put in the hands of any one the power, it may be in a moment of temper, to which the best of us are liable, of imprisoning a witness simply because he has come to the conclusion that the man has disturbed or said something derogatory to the personal dignity or hurtful to the feelings of a member of the Commission. The provision is to apply, not to the case of the Sugar Commission alone - we may dislike their methods or not, as we please - but to the case of any Commission which may be appointed. My honorable friends opposite may have a Commission appointed by another Ministry to inquire into matters affecting grave and widespread labour questions. They may not like to have these matters investigated, they may like to assert themselves with conviction and passion ; but if they do so, and if the Commission includes men who are, perhaps inspired with feelings which are not friendly to their organization or their system, they may have these powers put into force without adequate justification, and they will have no power of appeal, and may be imprisoned. There will be no redress, no compensation, if 'they are unjustly dealt with. Therefore  I  ask them to seriously consider this measure in all its far-reaching effects. They may think that they have a most excellent weapon to " down " somebody who they believe is acting not in the interests of the public. They may think that this is the very thing with which to accomplish their immediate purpose, but it will remain on the statute-book unless they are going to repeal it after the Commission has done its work. My honorable friends will have this drastic instrument permanently embodied in our legislation, and it will be really a form of legislative rack and thumb-screw, a method of putting people really to the torture without hope of redress by means of an appeal, for offences on which the other party to the proceeding - those who have to examine - will sit in judgment. With a Commission it is the members who are the examiners. They may set out with a friendly or an unfriendly feeling towards the witness, or the cause or interest he represents. They may be biased in every way. They are not set to decide between one party and another. If each party were represented by counsel, there would be a person on each side making the examination, but here the Commission are, so to speak, the prosecutors ; they are the advocates for their particular view of the case. </para>

                            <para>- The boundary between the inquirer and the advocate is very slender when an inquiry of this sort is taking place. A man must form some notion as the proceedings go on - a bent in favour of one side or the other - unless he is sitting to administer justice, which he is not doing. He may say. " I am not deciding anything; I am expressing my opinion." I have noticed that members of a Commission say things casually, or it may be, argumentatively, which they would not say if they had to decide the question, because it would look like prejudging it. They may form an opinion about the demeanour of a witness, and express it, which they would not do if the result of making the remark was, perhaps, to affect his fortune or his character. But they say freely what they think, and it is right that it should be done, because it is only by opening up what is in the inquirer's mind, and the bent of his opinion, that the fullest information can be obtained. Yet these are the persons to whom my honorable friends are going to commit this power of summary - indeed, arbitrary punishment. I venture to suggest that that is the most conspicuous blot in the measure, which otherwise I think is unnecessary. The increasing of the penalties is nothing unless it is to invite the magistrates to measure the amount of the line by the pecuniary position of the offender. The other clauses to which attention has been called certainly should be remodelled or reconsidered, in order to prevent the possibility of a man being punished twice for the same offence or of being kept in prison without redress at the will of the  Chairman  of the Commission who may be temporarily affected, who may be betrayed into a failure of temper, which it is easy to see may affect his judgment, and lead to an act- from which certainly "I think the  Chairman  of this Commission would be the very first to shrink of doing an injustice to a witness brought before him. </para>

                        <para>. - That the introduction of this measure is justified, I think, most reasonable men will admit if they will simply look at the result of the Royal Commission which is inquiring into the sugar industry. I think it is fortunate that its  Chairman  is not an active politician, that he is in no way identified with the Labour movement, seeing that such an important a question has arisen out of its investigations. Had the Commission been presided over, as is customary, by a politician, and had he been a representative of the Government of the day, we should have had the party element drawn into this discussion straight away, and our political opponents would have been quite justified, from their stand-point in arguing that it was the partisan character of the  Chairman  which was at the root of the trouble between himself and the witness, and had brought this matter to a head. It is very lucky for the Government and for the proper consideration of this measure that that argument cannot be imported into this discussion. There is no denying the fact that we have set out to solve a very large problem, and unless the Commission can probe every question to the utmost it will be impossible for them to proceed and bring in a satisfactory report. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, even in South Australia it was shown. If honorable senators opposite are anxious to have the great question of the increased cost of living probed, and the causes of the increase traced, they cannot conscientiously oppose this measure. I am not in a position at the present moment to say that it is due to the operations of the Sugar Trust or the Meat Trust in Western Australia or any other trust, but we have good reason to believe that the tactics of these trusts are such that they have increased the cost of living. It is increasing in other parts of the world, and we want to know to what extent the operations of the trusts have caused the increase here. If we view it from that stand-point, we cannot but arrive at the conclusion that the proposed amendment of the law is an absolute necessity, unless we are prepared to see Royal Commissions appointed by the Federal Government turned into a laughing-stock, flouted, and denied the information which the public have a right to obtain by their means. When the Bill was introduced into the Senate, it appeared to be represented that there was only one question before it, and that was the character of the  Chairman  of a particular Royal Commission. That gentleman was denounced in the most violent language that could be applied to a man in his position. We heard the gentleman occupying the responsible post of Leader of the Opposition in the Senate denounce him as "a chartered bully." Chartered by whom? Bullying whom? I say that he is neither the one nor the other. I quite recognise, that the  Chairman  rather lost his head for a moment, when he applied to one of the witnesses an epithet that was not altogether suitable coming from a man in his position. </para>

                            <para>- He apologized in the most abject manner. He tried in every way to make amends for the remark which he had employed. That being so, I think it was most uncalled for to apply such a term as " chartered bully " to him. I wish to put on record a cutting that has been handed to me by one of my col leagues. It is taken from a Sydney newspaper, and it shows, I think, that, in other ways from those from which we have been viewing the subject, the Bill before us is to be justified. We must remember that all Commissions of inquiry have to depend more or less upon evidence relating to public companies, or other business concerns. Sometimes the  evidence of accountants is of material importance. If we find that accounts are " cooked " for the purpose of misleading the public, a large vista io opened up as to the way in which not only people generally, but Royal Commissions, may be misled in the evidence which is given. From that point of view alone there is good reason why Royal Commissions should have the utmost power to probe matters to the bottom. The cutting which I wish to quote reads as follows : - </para>

Thursday night, and the  Chairman,  Frank Yarwood, is reported to have got the following; chunk of wisdom off his chest : - " It is my personal opinion that if public accountants are brought under the influence of Royal Commissions, such as is presaged in the Bill now before the Federal Parliament, and are asked to divulge the private affairs of their clients, it will not be long before some of us are in Darlinghurst Gaol." </para>

As I have already said, in dealing with some of the most serious problems that face Australia we may have to depend upon the evidence of accountants, and ought to be in a position to know whether it is reliable evidence or not. What can we think when a Commission is flouted as this Commission has been? Not only <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knox,</inline> who, apparently, was hurt because of the remarks of the  Chairman,  flouted the Commission, but other witnesses refused to attend to give evidence at all. We may as well close down the whole of our efforts to investigate if we allow these people to run the business of Royal Commissions according to their own particular liking. Sufficient justification for this measure has already teen given, and I shall not take up time by arguing further in that direction. But this 1 will say - that, unless we are prepared to grasp this question in a manner satisfactory to the people, even if we were to withdraw this measure I feel satisfied that, before many months were over, it would have to be introduced, with even more drastic clauses in it, in order to grapple with the evil with which we are faced. Therefore, I shall support the Bill. </para><interjection>

                        <para>-- I am not one of those who consider that the existing Act dealing with Royal Commissions is quite sufficient. I believe that the time has arrived when the Act should be amended to enable Royal Commissions to carry out the duties "with which they are intrusted expeditiously and effectively. I realize that in the course of some recent proceedings - to which I do not propose to refer again in the course of my remarks - a certain Royal Commission appointed by the Federal Government has been hampered in the discharge of its duties. I quite agree with what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger said, that it was quite competent for any individual called before that Commission to take the legal proceedings that have been taken, and which, to some extent, have contributed to the launching of this Bill. But when I read the measure submitted to us, I am impelled to the conclusion that those who have been responsible for the framing of it ill-conceived the necessities of the situation. From beginning to end, the Bill has been founded upon an entire misconception of the necessities of the case. The basic principle of the Bill seems to be an assumption that every witness summoned to attend and give evidence before a Royal Commission will be reluctant ; that when he does attend, either by compulsion or otherwise, he will be unwilling to give evidence; that when he does give evidence, because compelled under penalty of a fine to do so, his evidence will be unreliable; and, generally speaking, that he will in his attendance upon a Commission be constantly behaving contemptuously and will not appreciate the importance of the procedure. Honorable senators have in their hands a copy of the measure as proposed by. us, and of amending provisions printed in black type; and if they will go through those amending provisions I venture to say they will find that there is not one of them that is not based on one or other of the ideas that I have mentioned. In contrast, I draw attention to the Royal Commissions Act which was passed in Tasmania as far back as  1888.  In that Act, the general powers of a Royal Commission are defined. The authority to summon witnesses is set out. The obligation of witnesses to answer questions is provided for. Penalties for non-attendance and for not answering questions are prescribed. Provision is made for the representation of parties interested by counsel or solicitor. General provision is made for enabling a Royal Commission to fulfil its functions expeditiously and effectively. But practically 'the whole of the provisions printed in black type in the memorandum that has been circulated in connexion with this Bill relate to the reluctance to attend, unwillingness to give evidence, the giving of false evidence, and contempt of the Court. I believe that an Act might be passed which would endow Commissions hereafter appointed with the necessary powers to enable them to effectively investigate all matters remitted to them, and to make a report to the authorities by whom they are appointed. All that this Bill does at the outset is to assert the power of the Governor-General to appoint a Royal Commission. The reason for that is obvious and interesting. It may not be generally known to honorable senators that there is an opinion prevalent even to-day, even in limited legal circles, that there is no prerogative right in the Crown to appoint a Royal Commission to inquire into matters of private concern. I do not say that it is a correct opinion, but that there is an opinion of that kind still lingering is abundantly evident from arguments from time to time adduced before Courts, and also from opinions that have been given. During the last century two or three very important instances occurred in which the question of the power of the Crown to appoint- a Royal Commission was considered. As far back as 1830 a Royal Commission was appointed to report upon the municipal corporations of England, and advice was sought as to whether or not the Crown had the power to appoint a Royal Commission to make inquiry into the matters that were remitted to that Commission. </para>

                            <para>- About 1850 a Royal Commission in connexion with the University and Colleges at Oxford was appointed, and in relation to the validity of that Commission's appointment strong adverse opinions were furnished by some of the leading counsel of the day. Since then I think it has been generally held that there is an inherent power in the Crown to appoint Royal Commissions, and certainly such a power has been exercised, and no question has been raised of later years. This is obviously the reason why at the beginning of this Bill we find the words - </para>

                        <para>Without in any way prejudicing, limiting, or derogating from the power of the King, ot of the Governor-General, to make or authorize any inquiry, or to issue any Commission,  and so on. It has to be remembered that the power of appointing Royal Commissions, and the validity of their appointment and authority, has not been unquestioned. Until comparatively recently these matters have been legally questionable and questioned. At the best all we can say of a Royal Commission is that it is a tribunal, if we may so call it, of somewhat doubtful legal authority.  Its legal authority and status have not always been admitted and recognised. In endowing such a tribunal with powers this fact should always be borne in mind. The other provisions of the Bill extend to' the matters to which I have referred. They impose upon witnesses who are summoned the duty of attending, and subject them to certain penalties if they do not attend. One of the penalties to which a witness who does not attend in obedience to a summons is subjected, is that of being arrested and brought before the Commission, So far as the general penalties proposed are concerned, I do not think there is much cause for such widespread alarm as has been manifested. It has to be recognised that the penalties proposed are maximum penalties in every instance but one, and that is where a certain offence has been committed a second time. The minimum penalty is then ^500, and the maximum penalty ^1,000. If we bear in mind that these penalties are maximum penalties, and assume, as we are entitled to do, that a certain amount of reasonable discretion will be exercised in their imposition, I do not think there is cause for the widespread alarm that seems to be prevalent. With regard to the powers with which it is proposed to endow a Royal Commission in respect of contempt or alleged contempt, we might very well pause. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> has dealt with what is contempt of Court. He has quoted, I think, from Oswald's famous text-book on the subject to illustrate what is meant by it. He has drawn upon that authority for the purpose of making it abundantly clear that contempt of Court has no reference whatever to the person of the Judge or members of the Court. For whatever words may be used orally or in writing of a Judge in his personal capacity he has the same remedy as any private individual. The contempt must be in relation .to his office, and the discharge of the duties of his office. Broadly speaking, contempt may be described as a disobedience of the authority or orders of, or opposition to the authority or orders of a Court, or openly despising the orders, authority, conduct, or justice of a Court, leading as a consequence to general disrespect of the Court, disregard of its injunctions, orders or decrees, or to the prejudicing of the Court in the eyes of the community. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">The particular acts complained of must have a distinct reference to the Court, and not to the individual or private capacity of the Judge. It is not all members of tribunals who can realize that distinction. It may be that a gentleman, in all other respects excellent, may have a very touchy disposition. He may be unable, especially in a moment of excitement, to- distinguish clearly between his personal capacity and his capacity as a member of a tribunal. The power that is given to a Justice of the High Court to commit for contempt might be exercised in all good faith by such an individual in a way in which he would have no right whatever to exercise it. I realize that every -tribunal must have power to vindicate its authority, and to enforce obedience to its judgments, orders, or decrees, if it has the competence to make them. It is because of this that the summary powers for dealing with contempt of Court are vested only in the superior Courts of record. Honorable senators will understand that summary powers of dealing with contempt, or alleged contempt, of Court are not enjoyed by any but superior Courts of record. That is to say, other Courts have not inherent powers of summarily dealing with contempt of Court. Inferior Courts of record have the power only to deal summarily, so far as contempt is concerned, with what is known as* " contempt in the face of the Court." Superior Courts of record have inherently, and as a part of their very existence, the innate power of summarily punishing what are generally known as contempts. Inferior Courts of record, such as District Courts", the Local Courts of Tasmania, and the County Courts of Victoria, derive the power to punish for contempt from the Statutes creating them. Such inferior Courts as Courts of Petty Sessions and Magistrates' Courts have not any power to deal with what is known in law as ordinary contempt of Court. Their power begins and ends in excluding from the Court anybody who creates a disturbance. The summary power of dealing with contempt in the face of the Court is a very arbitrary and unlimited power. It is usually exercised only with the greatest amount of caution. I direct the attention ot honorable senators to a brief reference on this point from Lord Halsbury's <inline font-style="italic">Laws of England,</inline> a book in course of publication in many volumes. This reference will be found in Vol. VII., page  281,  under the heading "Contempt o'f Court." Lord Halsbury says - </para>

                        <para>The superior Courts have an inherent jurisdiction to punish criminal contempt by the summary process of attachment or committal in cases where indictment or information is not calculated to serve the ends of justice. The power to attach and commit being arbitrary and unlimited has to be exercised with the greatest caution, and as the application of this remedy involves the withdrawal of the offence from the cognizance of a jury, it is only to be resorted to where the administration of justice would be hampered by the delay involved in pursuing, the ordinary criminal process. </para>

                    <para class="block">There it is laid down that, though the superior Courts have this power inherently, the power is arbitrary, is unlimited, and is exercised without recourse to a jury. Therefore it should be exercised with the greatest caution, and should be resorted to only when the administration of justice would be hampered by delay in pursuing the ordinary criminal process. As evidencing how jealously and carefully even this necessary arbitrary power is guarded, and how the security and liberty of the individual is protected, I find that the same authority, on page  283,  says - </para>

                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">Thus a Judge of a superior Court, exercising judicial functions in Chambers, may be insulted ; but he has no power to commit or to deal with the offender for contempt. He must bring the matter before the Court itself, and it is for the Court to deal with the offender. So, too, with regard to contempt which consists of contemptuous interference with judicial proceedings within the precincts. These things serve to emphasize the fact, that though this arbitrary power is inherent in the superior Courts, it is exercised with the greatest caution, and is resorted to only where other proceedings for the punishment of the offender would tend to delay justice. All of which goes to show that, necessary as the power may be for the protection of a Court, yet the security and liberty of the individual are most jealously safeguarded. I would further point out that from punishment for contempt there is no appeal. For criminal contempt the Sovereign himself or herself had power to revoke the sentence passed upon the individual. But from punishment for ordinary contempt in the face of the Court there is no appeal. Having outlined what constitutes contempt, and how punishment for the offence is meted out, I wish to direct attention to the difference which exists between a Royal Commission and a Court. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> has stressed the fact that a Royal Commission is not a Court. But iri elaborating that statement, he might have pointed out that a Court is a permanent tribunal, whose sole function is the administration of justice, year in and year put. On the other hand, Royal Commissions are not permanent bodies - they are merely of a temporary character. They are not habituated to dealing with matters year in and year out, nor have they certain general jurisdiction. Their jurisdiction is confined to one particular matter. The exercise of its ordinary power by a Court habituated to administering justice in relation to a variety  pf  matters coming within its jurisdiction is an exerei.se of power within what may be called its order pf course. But a Royal Commission, in determining matters which may arise under this Bill in its treatment of witnesses, will be dealing with what may be called an order of emergency. It has jurisdiction and authority only in relation to a particular matter which is set put in its letters patent. We have to remember, too, that, in connexion with Courts of justice, there is an atmosphere of tranquillity, an atmosphere suggestive of routine, and one which cannot fail to impress anybody who comes within it with the idea that Courts are perfectly conscious, under all circumstances, of the limits of their powers, and of the principles which should govern their discretion. But in .the case  pf  a Royal Commission, through no fault of its own, but inherently as the result of its creation, there is not that atmosphere df tranquillity. There is not that suggestion to the onlooker that it is as conscious of the limitations  pf  its powers, or  pf  its discretion, and of the principles which should regulate that discretion as is a Court. For these reasons, we should hesitate before we vest a body  of that kind with the arbitrary and unlimited powers to which I have referred, and which have been commented upon, as I have quoted, by the -greatest lawyer of the day, Lord Halsbury. We should hesitate a long time before we vest a temporary tribunal appointed to investigate a particular matter, with the powers in relation to contempt which are enjoyed and exercised, with, such caution by the superior Courts pf record. We have also to recollect that in regard to the particular matters which come before a. Court, its members have no personal, interest whatever. But in the cas.e of a Royal Commission, it frequently happens that the subject-matter which it is appointed tq investigate is one which is agitating the minds of the community, or pf a great; portion of it. Under such circumstances, it is almost useless to expect the members pf a Commission to be unaffected by those influences which operate on the general body pf the community,' or on a large section of it. Added to these considerations, which should differentiate our treatment of this tribunal from pur treatment p,f a body like a superior Court pf record, we have the fact that the gentlemen who compose a Court are men who have been habituated to the determination pf matters which arise in litigation. In other words, they have had a professional training for the Bench. It has been practically their life-long training, Does the same remark apply to members pf Royal Commissions? It would be absurd to expect them to be men pf training at all, much less to possess the training of the Judges of even bur inferior Courts. All these considerations should cause us to pause before we confer upon Royal Commissions the powers which are enjoyed by only the highest Courts of the land. I have already pointed out that contempt of Court in relation to a single Judge in Chambers is an offence with which he is not privileged to deal. He must report it to the Court. Yet in this Bill it is proposed to endow a Judge of the Supreme Court, or of a County Court, or of a District Court, or of any Court in the Commonwealth, if he happens to be the  Chairman  of a Royal Commission, with the powers for dealing with contempt which are reposed in the greatest tribunal in Australia. I really think the Attorney-General must have been nodding when this particular clause was drafted for inclusion in the Bill. In saying that, I speak as one who is not opposed to vesting Royal Commissions with ample power to enable them to effectively discharge their functions. I am not prepared to criticise adversely and in a wholesale manner, even the extremely heavy penalties which are imposed under this Bill. But anybody who is familiar with what contempt pf Court means, and with what it has meant in th,e development of the liberties which we enjoy to-day - that is to say, who is aware of the restrictions which have been placed on the exercise of the power to commit for contempt - will hesitate before intrusting to a temporary tribunal, appointed in an emergency to investigate a matter in respect of which the public are agitated, powers such as are proposed under this measure. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> referred to the fact that contempt may be manifested in various ways. Some authorities point out that the same words used by two different persons may convey a very different meaning. In the case of one, they may be perfectly innocent, whilst in that of the other they may be most offensive. It may be the tone and manner which accompany them which imparts to them the character of contempt. A number of instances are given in the text-books of what has been held to constitute contempt in the face of a Court. It may be that the  Chairman  of a Commission may hold that the refusal of a witness to answer a question, and the signification of that refusal in a certain way, amounts to contempt. If so, and if he chooses to exercise the powers which will be conferred by this Bill, who is to say him nay? Is there any Court in this country which can issue a writ of prohibition, or any corresponding process, to restrain him from proceeding to enforce a committal order, or any other punishment which he may see fit to impose? There is not. Let us assume that a question is asked, that the Commission itself had no power or authority to ask, and the answer was declined. In what a curious position would we then be placed. The witness would be perfectly entitled at law to refuse to answer the question, and yet the  Chairman  might deem him guilty of contempt, and might punish him. There could be no appeal and no redress, and the man would be punished for doing an unlawful act. Honorable senators may labour under the delusion that a Royal Commission can inquire into anything, and ask any question. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, I know that it is a very difficult matter, even for trained men. Every lawyer knows that there is  a  number of treatises on the law of evidence. Everybody who has been in a Court at any time will know that various questions are asked, and the answers to them are objected to because the evidence is not admissible. Very often evidence is sought to be obtained which cannot be given at all, according to the rules of evidence, which, I may mention, are framed on what one might almost call analogously a mathematical basis, in order that, as far as possible, the witness shall only depose to facts pertinent and within his own knowledge. But there are various matters which are not allowed to be given in evidence - for instance, the contents of written documents. A witness cannot depose to the contents of a written document. It must be produced, and speak for itself. If a document has been destroyed, and it is abundantly proved without doubt that it has been destroyed, what is called secondary evidence of its contents may be given. So, too, there are other matters which are set out - privileged communications, such as a communication between a patient and his doctor, a client and his solicitor, a husband and his wife,  a  clergyman and anybody whom he is attending in that capacity. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie read an extract? dealing with something which had been would by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Yarwood,</inline> in Sydney, at an accountants' dinner. I did not hear every word: which the honorable senator quoted, but it seemed to be an attempt to misrepresent  a  statement which had been made by Mr.Yarwood that if this Bill were passed many of them would find themselves in Darlinghurst. I took the extract to mean that if the Bill were passed, it would' purport to compel accountants to disclose before-  a  Royal Commission what a Court of Justice cannot compel them to disclose. That is the position, and that is what the man was objecting to. It is no wonder that he said that if the Bill -were passed-, and enforced, they would find themselves in gaol. A Court of justice cannot compel the disclosure of a communication made by a husband to his wife, but will this Bill privilege such  ai  communication? It contains nothing with regard to the application of the ordinary rules of evidence. </para>

                            <para>- No, that is what I am saying. The Bill does not say that Royal Commissions shall be guided in their investigations by the rules of evidence. We know that Select Committees and Royal Commissions, as a matter of practice, do not confine themselves to the rules of evidence. They will "take hearsay evidence, which is inadmissible in a Court of law. They will take other kinds of evidence, some of which is admissible in a Court, and some of which cannot be compulsorily given in a Court. A communication, for instance, made by a husband to his wife is evidence if neither party objects to it being tendered, but if either party makes an objection, no Court in the land can compel the communication to be given. That is the law of evidence. But, apparently, a Royal Commission is not to be bound by the rules of evidence which apply to all the Courts in the land. If they ask a question, relevant or irrelevant to the inquiry, an answer must be given, and, if not given, an offence is established, and there is a penalty. The Royal Commission may ask a question absolutely irrelevant to the subject-matter of their investigations, and the witness may decline to answer it on that ground, and yet he may bring himself within the four corners of this measure, and be punished. </para>

                        <para>The language of the several Acts of Parliament which, in different States of the Commonwealth, empower Commissioners to summon witnesses and to administer oaths to them, and to compel the production of books and documents, does not warrant any assumption that they purport to invest Commissions of Inquiry with any greater powers to obtain evidence than those possessed bv Courts of Law. But there are a number of matters concerning which particular persons cannot be compelled to give evidence in a Court of Law; and in many cases the persons so protected against a compulsory disclosure of such matters are the only persons who know anything about them ; and therefore a compulsory disclosure of such matters by any process of law is impossible. So, also, with regard to the contents of written documents, it is a fixed rule of law that a person cannot be compelled to disclose the contents of a document which he is not bound to produce ; and there are documents which the owner of them could not be compelled to produce in many cases in which be might be a party to the litigation in which the discovery was sought, and which he could never be compelled to produce in the course of any litigation to which he was not a party. In regard to such matters,, the several Acts of Parliament which, in some of the States of the Commonwealth, confer upon Commissioners compulsory powers to obtain evidence do not invest them with any greater' power of discovery and investigation than those possessed by Courts of Law in relation- to matters in respect of which such Courts have jurisdiction. If a contrary contention could be supported, there would not be any defined' limits to- the compulsory powers of discovery conferred* by those Acts upon Commissioners appointed by the Crown - </para>

                    <para class="block">That is if the contrary contention can be supported, as it is assumed it can- be supported in aid of this Bill -  and the result would be that the Crown- would) be authorized to invade that right to- privacy, and to the exclusive possession and use of property which every subject of the Crown has hitherto possessed in regard to many matters, under the common law. </para>
                    <para class="block">It will be seen, therefore, that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Clark, in his work, lays it down as a principle that the investing of a Royal Commission with power to summon witnesses and to take evidence gives them no greater authority than is enjoyed by a Court of law. </para>

                    <para>The prerogative powers of the Crown have been defined by Locke as " the discretionary power of acting for the public good when the positive laws are silent.'' The question whether an inquiry into a particular matter is for , the public good or not, is not a legal question. But an inquiry into a matter in which public interests were not involved would inevitably, in the absence , of express statutory authority, become illegal as soon as private rights protected by law were invaded. Nor would the fact that public interests were involved in the inquiry authorize the Commissioners to invade private rights protected by law if th'ey were not empowered by special legislation to do so. </para>

                        <para class="block">Surely the Vice-President of the Executive Council will not pretend that it would be desirable, when dealing with Commissions generally, to lay down the principle that all Royal Commissions' should have power) in the course of their investigations, to interfere with the common law right of privacy. I can quite understand that when a Commission was created by a special Act to inquire into a particular matter, the limits of the inquiry would be defined; because then we should have a concrete instance before us, and should knqw how far we might endow the Commission with powers beyond those enjoyed by a Court of law. </para>

                                <para>- Those provisions deal with the duty of witnesses to continue in attendance ; the arrest of witnesses failing to appear; acts of omissions on different days to constitute separate offences; witnesses need not disclose secret processes; statements made by witnesses not to be admissible in evidence against them ; penalty in case of offence committed after a previous conviction ; power of Commission in relation to documents produced; witnesses to be paid expenses; giving false testimony; and so forth. I have already said that this Bill is based upon the unwarrantable assumption that every witness summoned will be reluctant to attend; that when at last he does attend he will be unwilling to give evidence; that when he does give evidence the evidence will be unreliable; and that, generally speaking, his attitude towards the Commission will be one of contempt. There is nothing in this Bill to provide that a Commission shall be guided by the rules of evidence applicable generally in Courts of law or otherwise. There is nothing to show that the Commission is to have greater powers of investigation and inquiry than a Court of law. The Bill is silent on that subject. </para>

                                <para>- No; but I am pointing out that the Bill will not effect the purposes which it is intended to effect. All that the Bill does is this : It gives to Royal Commissions a fancied illusory power which will enable them to do grave injustice and great damage to individuals, whilst there will be no redress for those individuals who may be aggrieved and damaged. Nevertheless the object sought to be accomplished will not be achieved. I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> again to tell us where the Bill contains that special power which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Clark says that a. Royal Commission should have to enable it to go effectively beyond the rules of evidence which apply in an ordinary Court of law? </para>

                                <para>- The provisions are contradictory. Originally there were in section 2 of the existing Act the words " Material to the subject-matter of the inquiry." Those words have been struck out by clause 2, of this' Bill. Therefore, the witness is to be compelled to produce books, documents, and papers, whether material or immaterial. He may be prosecuted if he does not do so; but if he is prosecuted he may prove that the documents in question are immaterial. It is precisely because that  provision is in the Bill that I have pointed out that it will not do what it is intended to do. It imposes penalties upon persons, and subjects them to punishment for contempt. But the powers which may be exercised by the  Chairman  of a Royal Commission when it is travelling outside its own jurisdiction, as defined by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Clark, will not effect the objects which the Bill is intended to effect, namely, the efficient and expeditious investigation of matters subject, to the inquiry. The Bill will' only seemingly endow Royal Commissions with powers which, in many instances, will be illusory. But, notwithstanding that they will be exercised to the great detriment of individuals, those persons will have no remedy or redress. I was dealing just now with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Clark's comments upon Royal Commissions generally, and was commenting upon the fact that unless they are endowed by special legislation with power to inquire into matters as Courts cannot inquire into them, and to compel the production of documents that: the Courts cannot compel to be produced, they have no greater power than Courts, have. But what I take exception vo in this Bill is not that there is no definite provision to enable Commissions to travel beyond the ordinary rules of evidence, but that the Bill empowers a Commission to treat a witness, as in contempt if he chooses to decline to answer questions which may be irrelevant. The  Chairman  of the Commission will be left to judge of relevancy or otherwise on- those occasions, and will be enabled to treat a witness as in contempt if he considers the tone of the witness to be offensive, although his words may be perfectly innocent. The Commission might proceed to ask for the production of documents that even a Court of law could not demand, and on the failure to produce them might proceed to exercise its supposed powers as to contempt. Clause 6 of this Bill amends section 6 of the principal Act by omitting the words " be liable, on summary conviction, to a penalty not exceeding <inline font-style="italic">£50,"</inline> and inserting in their stead the words "be guilty of an offence." Let us suppose that a question is put to a witness by a Royal Commission which could not be properly asked in a Court of law ; a question, the answer to which would involve the disclosure of a privileged communication from husband to wife, or between a doctor and his patient- </para>

                                <para>- No ; but clause 6 appears, on the face of it, to do so. We have the power to say that these matters shall not be privileged in the case of inquiries by Royal Commission, but I do not think that any Government would introduce such a power in a Bill of this character, and make such a principle applicable to Royal Commissions generally. If the Bill were framed more on the lines of the Tasmanian Act of  1888,  and were general in its application, then, in respect of any Commission appointed for the investigation of a particular matter, we could, with a concrete instance before us, lay down the exact limitation of its jurisdiction with regard to questions, and say how far the Commission might exceed the competence of a Court of law in inquiring into the matter. </para>

                        <para class="block">Some one said something just now about reactionaryism. I venture to say that that is one ot the most reactionary clauses introduced in any legislation of recent years. There is hardly a portion of the British Empire in which there has not been a good deal of legislation in regard to evidence during the last ten, or even twenty-five, years. Much of it has had for its object the codification as far as possible of the law of evidence ; that is to say, the embracing of enactments spread over a variety of subjects in one complete comprehensive systematic code, with something in the nature of proper sequence in its provisions. Owing to modern methods of business, the tendency has been as far as possible to dispense with the production of books. Originally the practice was that a book should be produced in evidence to show the entering up of an account or record of a transaction made by a particular clerk or officer in the employ of a business firm in the course of his daily duties. The tendency of later years, as in the case of what is known rs The Bankers Books Evidence Act, has been to enable extracts to be taken from business books, and to have those extracts verified. Extracts relevant to the issue before the Court are made from books, and they are submitted as evidence, whilst the books are left with the bank or business firm, that it might continue to carry on its ordinary business. One can hardly estimate the inconvenience to which some business firms would be put by the removal bodily of their books, even for a day. </para>

                                <para>- An original agreement is evidence, but in Courts of law it very often happens that both parties to a case agree to accept secondary evidence, in the shape of a copy of an agreement, when it might be inconvenient to produce the original. I am directing attention to the fact that in this Bill, instead of enabling relevant extracts to be taken from business  hooks,  and the production of the books themselves to be dispensed with, we are asked to go to the other extreme. There is in the proposed new section 6dd a very proper and necessary provision for the protection of witnesses who give evidence before Royal Commissions. It disposes at once of one of the original grounds put forward for the opinion that the Crown has not the power to appoint Royal Commissions. In 1850, when a Royal Commission was appointed to investigate the affairs of the University and Colleges of Oxford, one of the grounds put forward in support of the opinion referred to was that witnesses who came before the Commission would have to give evidence, not necessarily on oath, and might not be protected from actions for defamation, whereas, if their evidence were given in a Court of  law,  it would be privileged, and no action for defamation could lie in respect of the  Statements  so made. One important provision to which I direct the attention of the Vice-President of the Executive Council is contained in the proposed new section 6g - </para>

                                <para>- The honorable senator has stated the ordinary practice ; but it is not always followed. We should. I think, adopt the practice of Courts of law. If a witness is served with a summons to attend a Royal Commission, and demands his necessary travelling expenses, they should be tendered to him. In the practice of the ordinary Courts a witness is entitled to receive his travelling expenses to and from the Court when he is served with his subpoena, and if he does not receive them, he is at liberty to disregard the subpoena, and the Court will not punish him for doing so. 1 repeat that I think the words " and tender of expenses if demanded " should be inserted after the words " service of the summons," in the proposed new section 6b. </para>

                                <para>- We can scarcely be said to have established a custom with regard to Royal Commissions in the Commonwealth yet. The proposed new section 6b, provides for the issue of a warrant for the apprehension of a witness who has failed to attend if proof is given of the service of the summons upon him. But I think that before issuing a warrant for the arrest of a witness we should at least provide that when he is served with his summons he should also be tendered his travelling expenses. </para>

                                <para>- The Commission might be acting in what they considered a <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> way in the exercise of their powers under this legislation. They might say that this matter was referred to in the passing of the Bill, and might feel bound to carry out the provision of the proposed new section  6b  if a witness did not attend upon their summons.. No harm could be done by providing that if a witness's expenses are asked for when he is served with a summons to attend a Commission he should be tendered them. Under the Bill he would get them subsequently, but I think they should be tendered with the summons. Royal Commissions cannot visit every centre, and some witnesses will no doubt be obliged to travel a considerable distance to attend a Royal Commission. I hope that if the Bill is to become law some amendments will be made in respect to the matters to which. I have directed attention. As I have already said, I am not very much concerned about the severity of the penalties. They are maximum penalties, and we may assume that a reasonable discretion will be exercised by Royal Commissions, and penalties imposed in proportion to the offences committed. So far as the Bill itself is concerned, it is not, I think, the kind of measure we should be invited to pass at this stage of our history. It purports to give powers to Royal Commissions which it does not really give. Those powers will be regarded as being held by members of Royal Commissions, and that will be an illusion. In the exercise of those illusory powers individuals may be .prejudiced and injured. The ends we are all anxious to achieve will not be met by this Bill, but possibly in many instances they will be frustrated, and incidentally in their frustration many individuals in the Commonwealth will suffer personal sacrifice, injury, and damage. </para>

                            <para>. - The members of the legal profession in this Chamber have already dealt with the legal aspects of the Bill which is now under consideration. I propose to confine my observations to one or two points which have occurred to me as being worthy of attention. I have no objection to clothing Royal Commissions with the fullest powers necessary to enable them to extract information from witnesses who appear before them. But it seems to me that the chief danger to be apprehended from th,is Bill lies in the fact that Royal Commissions, are largely appointed for political purposes. There is always a danger of establishing authority, if that authority may possibly be used unfairly. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie made it very clear this afternoon that this Bill has been introduced as the result of certain proceedings before the Sugar Commission. If that Commission is to-be quoted as a reason for the introduction of this Bill- </para>

                                <para>- I will prove it now. Some time ago I asked the Government if they had supplied <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cattermull</inline> with a copy of the confidential report which was furnished by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Maxwell</inline> to the Deakin-Cook Government. I was informed that they had not. Yet they supplied each member of the Commission with a copy of that document. Why was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cattermull</inline> able to read it to the Commission from beginning to end? Obviously because some Commissioner had supplied him with a copy of it. </para>

                                <para>- I desire to emphasize that that report has not yet been placed in the hands of any member of this Parliament, with the exception of Ministers. It is worth while asking, therefore, how it came about that a copy of it was in the hands of such a comparatively insignificant person as this witness, who was able to read it before the Sugar Commission? It was read by him on 27th March, and, according to a newspaper report, the witness presented, in the course of his testimony, a copy of a report by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Maxwell,</inline> dated 5th or 6th January, 1910. The  Chairman  remarked that he had understood that that report was confidential. I believe I am correct in saying that the Government supplied members of the Commission with copies of it, and very properly so. But, seeing that this Bill will confer enormous powers upon Royal Commissions, we have a right to know whether in future these bodies will act on behalf of a party, either in politics or in industrial affairs. </para>

                                <para>- Clairvoyants cannot read columns of figures in the way that this witness did. Now, let us see what Commissioner would be likely to supply the witness with a copy of that report. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Gordon expressed surprise that he should be able to read it, because he understood it was confidential. It is reasonable to assume, therefore, that he did not supply it. Another member of the Commission is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Anderson,</inline> of Sydney, who shortly after his appointment boasted that he had always been a strong supporter of the Labour party. Another member of the Commission is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. R.</inline> M. Shannon, who twice contested the Mackay district in the Labour interest, and who, fortunately for the country, was defeated on both occasions. Then we have <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Crawford,</inline> the  president  of the Australian Sugar Association, which is a body strongly opposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cattermull,</inline> who is  president  of the Cane-growers Union. It is fair to assume that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Crawford</inline> did not supply his industrial opponent with a copy of the report. Still another member of the Commission is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hinchcliffe,</inline> M.L.C., the business manager of the Brisbane <inline font-style="italic">Worker,</inline> and a strong Labour supporter. </para>

                                <para>- I do not know that he requires his friends here to urge that he is a decent man. Perhaps the other members of the Commission are indecent individuals. If so, the Government should not have appointed them. Having mentioned these names, I leave honorable senators to wonder which of the members of the Commission actually supplied a witness who appeared before them with a copy of a confidential report to the Government so that he might produce it in evidence. </para>

                                <para>- I have. The Government did not supply it. It has never been issued, except to members of the Commission, and I say that one of the Commissioners must have loaded up this witness with it. I make that charge deliberately. I come now to an extraordinary feature in connexion with the inquiry which has been conducted by that body. It is significant that while the Colonial Sugar Refining Company were refused copies of evidence taken before the Commission, uncorrected proofs of evidence were supplied to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Peacock's</inline> solicitor, under instructions from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Gordon, in order that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Peacock</inline> might draw up his indictment against the Company - an indictment which was published in a statement in the newspapers, and which the  Chairman  of the Commission subsequently held in his hands whilst he put questions to the witness.- These facts indicate that, either unintentionally or deliberately, a Commission may be unfair. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cattermull,</inline> representing what is really a Labour union, read a statement to the Commission. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Peacock</inline> also presented a statement which the  Chairman  affirms was not actually received. It is a fact, however, that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Peacock</inline> was questioned on the lines of the statement which he made. These circumstances prove conclusively that a Commission may be unfair. It is possible for it do do what is not . right as between the parties, and it is idle for us to turn round and say that it would not do that. I would also remind honorable senators that very frequently Select. Committees are appointed during a parliamentary session, which, not having completed their labours before the prorogation, are subsequently converted into Royal Commissions so as to enable them to continue their work. These Select Committees have certain powers, but as Royal Commissions they will be vested with infinitely greater powers under this Bill. I wish to direct attention to a rather curious position into which we are drifting. The Senate has already passed the Parliamentary Witnesses Bill, which is now before the other Chamber, where an order for the resumption of its consideration was made on the  20th  September of last year, or about twelve months after Parliament re assembled after the last general election. </para>

In Committee, I shall try to bring the provision into line with the provision in the other Bill. Otherwise, under one Bill we shall give a witness before a Select Committee reasonable protection, but under the other we shall practically give a witness no protection unless he deals with one item, and that is a secret process of manufacture.

                        <para class="block">Under the Royal Commissions Bill, a witness does not come off nearly so well. It will be noticed that a. witness before a Select Committee is permitted to recover a certain amount of fees and travelling expenses, but a witness before a Royal Commission which is endowed with powers of imprisonment and fining to a large amount, is only allowed to lie paid a reasonable sum for the expenses of his attendance, in accordance with the prescribed scale. The two Bills do not fit in at all. </para>

                                <para>- I was on a Select Committee last session, or the session before, and I had to go up to Sydney, anyhow. The honorable senator knows perfectly well that the  Chairman  has only to ask for leave for a Select Committee to go and sit in another place, and it is always granted. There is one other point to which I wish to draw attention. Subsection 2 of proposed new section  6  o gives the  President  or  Chairman  of a Royal Commission -  all the powers of a Justice of the High Court sitting in open Court in relation to a contempt committed in the face of the Court, except that any punishment inflicted shall not exceed the punishment provided by sub-section (i) of this section. </para>

                        <para class="block">If I am called as a witness before a Select Committee, and misbehave myself, the Attorney-General must prosecute me. If, on the other hand, the Select Committee is converted into a Royal Commission at the end of the session, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger, who always behaves himself - but whom I take as an example- -is called as a witness, and misbehaves himself, he may be summarily convicted by the  Chairman.  Now, if there is one matter more than another against which the Senate has set itself, it is allowing anybody to be a judge in his own case. It will be remembered that, in the Disputed Elections and Qualifications Act of 1907, we made a special provision, arising out of the case between the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Crosby</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon.</inline> In spite of the protests of some of our legal friends, including <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> we put in a provision that the Senate could order a disputed return to be referred to the High Court, because we did not believe it was desirable to sit in judgment upon a matter affecting ourselves. Not only have we often heard the opinion expressed, but we have also seen the statement in the press, that a Judge ought not to sit in judgment on a case of contempt which, has been committed in his own Court. This proceeding is gradually going into desuetude; Judges are abandoning the right to try their own cases. Now, the Government turn round and say, " We do not believe in a Judge sitting on a case of contempt which has arisen in his own Court; that is in a matter which concerns himself. But where a Judge is sitting on a Royal Commission, we will let him determine that which we will not allow even a Judge to decide." There lies the great weakness of the Bill. So far as contempt is concerned, we should adopt the principle which was laid down here in the Parliamentary Witnesses Bill. If honorable senators refuse to alter this measure, they have to assume that a witness before a Select Committee must be liable to one set of conditions, and that a witness before a Royal Commission, or a Select Committee turned into a Royal Commission, must be liable to another set. </para>

Surely they are also willing to allow an appeal from a civil decision, which might practically ruin a man? With regard to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Gordon, I agree with the remarks made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon. Mr. Justice</inline> Gordon was certainly in very bad health when I saw him in Sydney. He was not, I think, entirely under self-control. I listened to him when he delivered a speech. He waved his arms about; he was white with passion, and made remarks which he thought fit the next day to withdraw. That is only evidence that it is possible even for a Judge of a Supreme Court, under certain circumstances, to so lose his self-control that he might very well do a person a grave injustice. </para>

I was there listening to what he said, and I am putting the most charitable construction I can put on the remarks he made, lt was early in the morning. Nothing had occurred, except that the names of certain witnesses had been called, and they had not arrived. Then the Judge read portions of certain documents, which, he said, he would hand to the press, and made the comments which have- been very much remarked about, including the famous comment that a certain statement, which was made on the strength of a statutory declaration, was "a deliberate lie." I have only instanced these facts to show that honorable senators need to be very careful if they are going to put enormous powers into the hands of Royal Commissions. Nothing at the present time shows that this Bill is necessary. If the law should fail, after it has been tried, by all means bring in a measure as strong, if you like, as this one; but do not pass a measure which will allow the  Chairman  of a Commission to judge those who he thinks have offended him, and sentence them either to heavy fines or to long terms of imprisonment. </para>

                            <para>.- I do not propose to occupy many minutes in discussing the measure, because it has been very well threshed out to-day. We have had from our legal friends some very sound speeches, delivered with all the weight of authority and legal experience behind them, and to which, I think, the Government should pay very great heed. Senators Symon, St. Ledger, and Keating have pointed out a number of dangers in connexion with the Bill, and indicated where certain amendments ought to be made. I do not think that the Government should show too stiff a back, but should accept the suggested amendments, believing that they will improve the measure. I take very strong exception to the action of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie in tabling a slip from an unknown newspaper, which is practically an attack upon the accountants of Australia. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable senator quoted a statement about " cooked " accounts and "figure juggling" in connexion with the matter, and it is not right that such remarks should go forth from this Chamber. A few remarks in a newspaper might do no great harm, but when these matters are put into <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.,</inline> and have the weight of Parliament behind them, they are capable of working mischief. The chartered accountants of Australia are a highly respectable body of men belonging to a responsible association. They a're intrusted with the keeping of accounts for the business enterprises of this country, and nothing should be said to weaken their reputation for probity and honesty unless the charges against them can be clearly proved. I desire now to call attention to some very extraordinary conduct on the part of the  Chairman  of the Royal Commission in question. When he was in Victoria he took exception to the policy being pursued by the Government of the State, in a manner which was altogether beyond the range of his duties. He showed great animus against the policy of encouraging the growth of beet for the production of sugar. That was not his business at all. The Commission over which he presided was appointed to inquire into the economic conditions affecting, the growth and manufacture of sugar, and also into the effect of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company upon the interests of the sugar-growers and users, both those who sell and those who consume. But Judge Gordon went out of his way to make an attack upon an industry which the Victorian Government are endeavouring, to stimulate, believing that it will be of great advantage to this country. Our Government has spent a great deal of money on the industry, and in doing so was quite within its rights. The Judge,  1  say again, went entirely out of his way in making that attack.

                            <para>Are you aware that the evidence given before the Commission has shown that sugar cane culture is the only industry which so far has been successful on a large commercial scale in those regions of Queensland specially calling for settlement, namely, the northern coastal areas? - I don't know about that. </para>
                            <para>If this were so, would not the facts supply abundant reason for the people of the whole of the Commonwealth incurring financial burdens in specially encouraging the growing of sugar in those regions, and thus provide means of defence? - 1 dare say. if Queensland can completely supply the Australian market, would it not perhaps completely stultify the national policy to encourage in Australia the beet sugar industry, which, in the near future, might prove a rival to the production of sugar in those areas specially calling for settlement, and which, according to the evidence given before this Commission,, can only be made available for present occupation and further development by means of sugar production? - I would be very sorry for Queensland if the is dependent solely on the sugar industry. </para>
                            <para>Our evidence taken elsewhere shows that along the coast of northern Queensland sugar cane growing has proved the only profitable industry; do you know of any other industry that can supplant it? - The Queensland sugar people surely ought not to object to the Victorian people putting their sugar on the market. </para>

It was contended that they were acting in an " unnational " way by endeavouring to force this industry, and bv showing that sugar beet could be grown in this part of the country. The endeavour was to demonstrate that it was an entirely unnecessary thing to do. I think I am right in calling attention to this matter, to show that Judge Gordon went completely outside the scope of the duties intrusted to the Commission over which he presides, when he made these remarks concerning the efforts of the Government of Victoria to promote an industry which it is hoped will be of some benefit to the State. </para><interjection>

                                <para>- They bear it out  entirely. I do not want to take up the time of the Senate by reading more of the evidence; but there is much more to the same effect. I do not propose to say much with regard to the measure itself. It appears to me to be intended to cover a great deal more than it purports to do. We have worked very well for ten years under the Act of 1902, which has been found to be satisfactory for the purposes of eighteen Royal Commissions. No exception has been taken to it before; and it is only in the case of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company that it is desired to clothe a Commission with such extraordinary powers. Since the Bill was first introduced, a decision has been given with regard to the Colonial Sugar Refining Company which has proved that the existing law is strong enough to enable Royal Commissions to pursue their inquiries in a reasonable manner. The penalties proposed by this Bill are simply barbarous. They are on a par with a good deal of the legislation which we are getting from the Commonwealth Government at- the present rime. This legislation is to some extent predatory, and largely vindictive. The penalties are certainly vindictive, and perhaps the predatory part will come out more strongly later on. It must be remembered by honorable senators opposite that legislation like this will cut both ways. We shall have other Governments in office later on, and then this harsh legislation, which is not in the interests of the country, may be turned on the friends of its authors. With every desire to make this a perfect Bill, I ask the Government to pay heed to the statements which have been made by our legal friends, and to insert such amendments as will, make it a fair and reasonable measure, whilst at the same time attaining the object desired, which is to enable Royal Commissions to obtain necessary information. </para>

                            of the Sugar Commission, the existence of which is alleged to be the cause for the introduction of this Bill. Some criticism has followed upon the use of a term which I then employed. It seems to me, in view of that criticism, that I am rather under an obligation, either to withdraw the statement which I made, or to justify  it. I do not intend to withdraw it. I propose to give reasons which induce me to regard it as being not unfair criticism of the gentleman to whom I referred. This afternoon the debate has furnished grounds sufficient for affirming that I was entitled to make the remark, with a qualification which I shall add a little later on.

What difference can there be in the temperament of a. man discharging the duties of a Judge and discharging those of the  Chairman  of a Royal Commission? One has only to recall the words used by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> to see that it was an apology tendered by a friend of Judge Gordon, who was seeking to show that, under other circumstances, he would not have incurred the criticism to which l\e had been subjected. I am unable to follow <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon's</inline> reasoning when he says that a gentleman may be qualified to net as a Judge when he may not be qualified to act as the  Chairman  of a Commission. It seems to me that, whatever qualifications any one may have, if he is qualified to preside over a public body at all, <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> experience attained as a Judge ought naturally to qualify him doubly for presiding over any Commission appointed anywhere. </para>

                                <para>- Exactly ; and I believe that any Commission is all the better for being presided over by a Judge. I say that, in spite of the fact that Judge Gordon is occupying his present position to-day. I turn to the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon,</inline> who spoke of Judge Gordon as being, from his own personal knowledge of him, a courteous gentleman. I was very pleased to hear that remark. 1 have no desire to do any injustice to any man. Judge Gordon is unknown to me personally, but I am pleased to hear one of his personal friends speaking of him in this way. But I venture to say that, not being able to speak from personal intercourse - not being acquainted with Judge Gordon myself - I was entitled to judge him from his acts as they appeared to me. What were those acts ? The first question to which I direct attention is this : That the particular instance to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator ,Gardiner</inline> and others referred was a statement wherein Judge Gordon described a statement made by a witness as " a deliberate lie." That is not a solitary instance in which he offended against public taste and decency in the conduct of this Commission. Had he done so, I might not have referred to it as I did. But if we read down the evidence, we find that there are several cases, not so gross, perhaps, but nevertheless sufficient to justify attention being called to them, and which go to show that there was something about Judge Gordon which ill -equipped him for the duties which he was appointed to discharge. Take another witness - one who was not, as far as [ am aware, connected with the management of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. Judge Gordon called this man " either a lunatic or a perjurer." </para>

                                <para>- Yes: Judge Gordon said it of a witness who was being examined. He may have been a simple witness, but he ought not to have been referred to in terms of that kind. The point was this. The man was asked his interpretation of a clause in an agreement under which certain men were working. The clause had reference to whether the men were to be paid for work in wet weather or not. The witness gave his own interpretation that the men were to be paid in wet weather only if they worked, but Judge Gordon, who' held a different opinion, said, " If that is your view, you must either be a lunatic or a perjurer." I couple that with his denunciation of the statement of another witness as " a deliberate lie." If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> regards those two instances as evidence of Judge Gordon's gentlemanliness and courtesy, he is welcome to do so. </para>

                                <para>- It may have been the answer of a simple man endeavouring to interpret an agreement ; but if a man, in giving evidence, says, " That is my interpretation," it ought to be taken as an honest answer. As a matter of fact, there are many industries in Australia in which men are only paid in wet weather for the work which they actually do, and not for their whole time. Judge Gordon may not have known that, but it is a fact, nevertheless. Nothing that happened, however, would justify any one, whether  Chairman  of a Commission or Judge on the Bench, in referring to a witness in terms of that kind. It has to . be remembered that the  Chairman  of a Commission is vested with very strong powers. A Judge can say what he likes with impunity, and the witness before him can only answer back at his peril. </para>

                                <para>- Some honorable senators seem to think that that is rather a fatal objection when a member of Parliament uses his position, and the privilege which is accorded to him, for the purpose of enabling him to discharge a public duty. I have not brought this matter up out of any personal feeling against Judge Gordon. I do not know him. The reason why he has been brought into this matter is that the statement has been made and repeated by the other side that this Bill has been brought in because of what has happened in connexion with the Commission presided over by Judge Gordon. I want to carry the matter a little further. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> just now furnished another instance of. the temperamental disability of Judge Gordon which, in my opinion, ill-equips him for this position. What was there in the commission issued to him calling upon him to question the economic right of an act of the Government of this State? If the Government of Victoria choose to indulge in the experiment of making sugar from beet, they have a perfect right to do so, without being subjected to this lecture by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Gordon. </para>

                                <para>- In the so-called questions, he was laying down affirmations that it was- not right and proper for the Victorian Government to enter into the beet-sugar industry. He was instructed to make an inquiry, and to ascertain the facts in connexion with the sugar industry from other people, and not to give his views upon the action of members of any State Government. I have dealt with the personal utterances of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Gordon ; but I must assume, further, that the  Chairman  of a Commission exercises a general controlling authority over what it does. I want to say that, not merely has <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Gordon been personally insulting, but the Commission has not been fair to the various interests represented before it. I could give a greater number of instances, but I shall give two and stop at that.

I do not know what honorable senators opposite want when they are so touchy about references to a. Commission that conducted its proceedings in the way I have indicated. There is another thing which came out in the course of the debate. A certain statement was made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway,</inline> and I venture to say that I am entitled to refer to the position of affairs disclosed by the honorable senator; as  something ' in--' the nature of a public- or official scandasli.' It is'-a "ifact that an official - document, which should- have - remained 'Safe with the- caste* dians of public documents, found ' its way into the hands of' a partisan witness. So remarkable was the appearance of this document in -this way, that even <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Gordon comments upon the extraordinary fact that this secret' and -confidential report should, apparently, be available to &gt;a witness1 who gave evidence  of a pronounced character on one side in&gt; this controversy. </para>

                                <para>- I shall choose my own time, subject to you, sir, and to the rules of the Senate. I am always glad of suggestions from my honorable friends opposite, but I fear the Greeks when they bring gifts. The first matter to which I wish to redirect attention - because other honorable senators have already dealt with it - is the staggering proposal in this measure to abolish trial by jury in quite a number of cases. Let me remind the Senate that in  1904  we passed a Bill, in which we set out that where a man was liable to more than six months' imprisonment for an offence, it should be an indictable offence, which means that he should be entitled to trial by jury; and that where he was liable to less than six months' imprisonment, it should not be an indictable offence, but one which might be dealt with by the exercise of summary jurisdiction. Under this Bill, the Government are seeking, not to repeal the Acts Interpretation Act, but to get round its provisions. In no less than five cases there is a proposal to take offences which carry more than six months' imprisonment out of the category of indictable offences, and to enable the persons charged with them to be summarily dealt with by a Judge, without the benefit of a jury. In two of these cases the penalty provided for the offence is two years' imprisonment. I want it to go out to the country that the Labour party are proposing a new code, under which a man may be sent to gaol for two years without being tried by his fellows. We all know that at the last general election in New South Wales there was no cry which was used more vehemently by the Labour party than that which was raised against the Wade Administration that it had sought to destroy the system of trial by jury. Why? Because at the instance of that Government legislation had been enacted which provided that a man could be sent to gaol for twelve months for stirring up industrial strife to the detriment of the general community. Consequently, my honorable friends raised the cry that the Liberal Government of New South Wales were attempting to tear down the citadel of trial by jury. </para>

                                <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> had sense enough to put up his umbrella and to get in out of the rain. We know how that cry was raised, and used for all it was worth. Yet the same party now have no hesitation in imposing a penalty of two years' imprisonment on men for offences under this Bill, without giving them an opportunity to be tried by a jury. That is one of the most serious blots on the measure. I come now to another question - that of materiality.  1  should have less objection to the proposal as it stands if. we had some reasonable guarantee that the powers conferred by this Bill would be exercised by a trained and competent  Chairman.  But we have to recollect that Royal Commissions will not always have a legal genius presiding over them. What is the position to-day? Under this Bill a Commission may call upon a witness to answer any questions that it chooses to put to him, and to produce any document which it may deem relevant to its inquiry. I wish to suggest to honorable senators the danger which will arise from such a provision where there is an interested person on a Commission. I have already shown that there is one gentleman on the Sugar Commission who is closely connected with the jam industry. </para>

                                <para>- I. do not know what the honorable senator means. I do not say that the Bill is unconstitutional, but that it is unfair. It is quite conceivable that there may be appointed to a Royal Commission some person who has a trade rival. I have already alluded to one species of rivalry, and it is conceivable that a member may be appointed to a Commission whose interests, perhaps unconsciously, render him unfit to determine what is right. We know that bias, conscious or unconscious, does warp our judgments. </para>

I wish to point out the difference between the powers conferred on a Royal Commission by this Bill and those vested in the Conciliation and Arbitration Court, so far as witnesses are concerned. The Parliamentary Witnesses Bill provides that no evidence given by a witness relating to a professional or trade secret, or to his profits or financial position, shall be disclosed. That provision also finds a place in the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. Surely the same security should be given to witnesses who appear before a Royal Commission. In the case of the Arbitration Court, we have at least the guarantee that its proceedings will be presided over by a qualified Judge. But we have no guarantee that the  Chairman  of a Royal Commission will possess any legal training at all. </para>

                                <para>- It is not a question of the working person at all.. No witness before the Arbitration Court need sanction the disclosure of any information he may give in regard to trade secrets, or to his profits or his financial position. The same protection should be accorded a witness before a Royal Commission. I am surprised  that  anybody ..should argue-- that greater,, powers should 'be.given to a Commission in this regard, than are conferred upon the High Court. </para>

                                <para>- I am quite serious. I know this from past experience, and there is nothing like experience for teaching one. In this championship my honorable friends have even gone to the extent of using arguments that would reasonably lead any person to come to the conclusion to which I came long ago. We have the Leader of the Opposition pointing out to the Senate that the Labour party in New South Wales took the part of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Peter</inline> Bowling against the Government because the latter, according to his statement, were prepared to do away with trial by jury. We know the circumstances that aroused public opinion in connexion with the disturbances in New South Wales at that time; but there is no analogy between what took place in connexion with the great coal strike there and the position that has been created as between the people of all Australia and the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> says earnestly that the Labour party took the part of Peter Bowling against the Government, does he ask honorable senators on this side to believe that. he is taking the part of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company against the Commonwealth Government in the attitude which he is assuming now ? Does he say, and is he backed up by honorable senators on his side in the statement, that the Commonwealth Government are wrong in putting in the hands of a Royal Commission the power to inflict punishment for resisting, not only the will of the Government, but the will of Parliament? When the Government appoint a Commission, and have the sanction of Parliament for doing so, is the Commission to be flouted ; is its work to be neutralized ; is it to be defeated in every direction, by the gentlemen, or the companies, or the combines that honorable senators on the other side represent? </para>

He and his friends on the other side are trying, in the interests of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, to keep the power from any Royal Commission of compelling witnesses to produce books or documents, to answer questions, or to appear when summoned. Is not that their attitude? </para>

The honorable senator seems to be so mixed up with the ancient Greek philosophers, including Clysthenes and Demosthenes, that one is. scarcely capable of realizing the position that he ought to occupy at the present time. </para>

                                <para>- To my mind, the speech of the honorable senator, although he invited the press to be present, was a tissue of either clouded mysteries or misrepresentations. In one instance, referring to the expenses of witnesses, he declared that there was no allowance for -witnesses, except at the discretion of the  Chairman  of the Commission, when he "knew, or at least ought to have known, that it is the intention of the Bill to fix the allowances by regulation, because the words "as prescribed" are used. Until they -are prescribed, or in instances where they are not prescribed, the discretion is left :to the  Chairman  of the Commission. The honorable senator either knew, or he did not know it ; and if he knew it, he ought to 3be ashamed of himself. </para>

                                <para>- Other honorable senators will also try to get out of statements which they made, but I have no desire to occupy time in replying to all the -criticisms that have been levelled against this Bill. I have already dealt with all the details to which it was necessary to refer. I regret very much that a gentleman in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen's</inline> position should still persist in what I may call the uncharitable, -undignified, and unjust remarks that he made by way of interjection, and has tonight endeavoured to justify, with respect to the  Chairman  of this Commission. Like other South Australians, I know <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Gordon. I knew him before he became a Judge. I knew him when he was a member of Parliament. I can honestly say that he was never a Labour man, and never showed any shadow of sympathy in that direction while I was associated with him. </para>

                                <para>- Why should <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger try to make prominent his principal characteristics? It is not dignified. The less said about them the better. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Gordon was not appointed to preside over this Commission because he had Labour sympathies, but because he was a just man, and was con- - sidered by this Government, and by every one else who knew him, to be a man who had tried to hold the scales fairly between man and man. How could this Government, in appointing a Royal Commission, expect to' find men entirely devoid of political principles ? Are we expected to go to Heaven,1 or the other place, to find persons of that! description ? In choosing the Commissioners we took up a legitimate position'." We recognised that there we're varying ' interests to be inquired into. There was the general public ; there were the small growers and their complaints as to the manner in which they were being defrauded or fleeced ; there were the large growers ; there were also the commercial interests. We often hear in trams and trains the opinion expressed that it would be far better for this country if its business were put in the hands of men of commercial knowledge. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Anderson</inline> was appointed to the Commission because he was considered to have commercial knowledge. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Shannon</inline> was appointed because he was considered to have the best knowledge of the small growers. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Crawford</inline> was appointed because he was considered to understand the interests of the large growers. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Gordon was appointed to look after the interests of the general public. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hinchcliffe</inline> was appointed because he was considered to have a special knowledge of the workers engaged in the Queensland sugar industry. 'Every member of -the "Commission represents certain interests. I 'do not know -whether. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. .</inline> Anderson has, as alleged, anythiijig &lt;,to do with a . jam,. factory. It  he  has, what difference does, -it make?  . He  has commercial knowledge, and can be trusted to inquire into the commercial interests tiftected. ' But, if we had appointed <inline font-weight="bold">'Sir William</inline> McMillan, probably the /Oppo'siL-ion would have taken up"the same ' attitude as they 'do in regard to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Anderson.</inline> No one can question that the Government desired 'that . all the interests should' be represented. </para>

The first Commission of the kind to, which I shall . refer was, appointed in 1904,, and was known as the Machine Shearers' Commission.: From, a Labour.. party point. of view an , inquiry * into  a, business . of} that description, was about as . political, as anything could- well; be. But Judge Backhouse was  Chairman   of : that- Commission. In... 1905 there 1 was- another Commission appointed, in New South Wales , to inquire into the claims of members of certain, contingents, in South Africa, and . it was presided, over,, by-. Judge- Murray. In I9°5(&gt;. also,. the railway administration . of  the, State, was inquired , into . by . a Commission,/ the  Chairman  of which was Judge Rogers; We cannot . often- get <inline font-weight="bold">Senator S.ymon&gt;</inline> to listen- to us, bub I should: like the. honorable- senator rand- those- . who back him* up ;  to. take i notice; of' these facts;.  There -was,i further, in-'irjds, another- Commission, the importance of which will-jbe recognised - by 1 <inline font-weight="bold">Senator- Millen1</inline> probably more than . -by any- other member of ' the Senate; It w-as appointed to. inquire into the- conduet-'-of the Lands' Depatment;' </para>

                            <para>.- This clause should be reconsidered. Under it a Commission may issue a summons to a person to produce any evidence whether it be material to the subject-matter of the inquiry or not. It is proposed that the words " material to the subject-matter of the inquiry " shall be struck out of section  2  of the existing Act. It must be remembered that a penalty is provided for not " producing evidence asked for whether it be material to the subject-matter of the inquiry or not. In passing such  a  clause, we shall be entering upon  a  very dangerous course. We shall put it into  the  power of Royal Commissions to demand from witnesses information which  has nothing  whatever to do with the matters they are appointed in inquire into. The Pearl Shelling Commission, for instance, sitting  at  Thursday Island,  may  demand that  a  person shall attend the Commission, and produce evidence that may not  be  material  to  the subject-matter  of  their inquiry,  so  long as  it  is mentioned  in  the summons  Which he is  given  to  attend. If a Royal Commission be appointed  to  inquire into the tobacco industry, or the sugar industry, the questions, which witnesses should be called upon to answer should be material to the subject-matter of the inquiry. I think, therefore, that the proposed amendment of the principal Act should be negatived. </para>

                            GOULD (New South Wales)  [9.56].-  We ought to be careful to make it perfectly clear that we intend this Bill to apply only to matters which are pertinent to the inquiry which is being conducted by any Royal Commission Under clause  2  it is proposed to render a man liable to punishment if he does not produce documents that he is required by summons to produce. Yet a subsequent provision affirms that it shall be a defence to a prosecution for failing, without reasonable excuse, to produce any documents, books, or writings, if the defendant proves that those documents, books, or writings are not relevant to the inquiry.

                            SYMON (South, Australia)  [9.58].  - I also wish to invite the attention of' the Vice-President of the Executive Council to this point, because I think he must be satisfied that one or others of these provisions ought to be eliminated. The provision contained in clause  2  evidently excited so much dissatisfaction in  another place that an attempt was made to remedy it, because I understand that the words " not relevant to the inquiry " were  inserted at the instance of a member of the  Opposition. Instead of conferring in creased power on Royal Commissions, this clause will take away from them a power' that they ought to possess. By eliminating the words " material to the subject-matter of the inquiry," we shall deprive Royal Commissions of the power of de- - ciding whether the documents which witnesses are required to produce are material ' or not. We shall make it obligatory - upon the person's summoned to produce - documents, and we shall deprive Royal Commissions of the power of inquiring whether or not they are relevant. In clause 2 it is proposed to take away from Commissions the power of determining whether or not documents are material to an inquiry, and of relegating it to the Court which has to try whether or not a witness has committed an offence. Obviously, that is not the intention of the Government. We do not need to transfer the determination of a simple question like that to a Court. The right thing to do is to strike out clause 2 of the Bill, and also sub-clause 2 of clause 5. We shall then intrust to Royal Commissions the discretionary power of determining whether or not the documents mentioned in any summons issued to a witness are relevant to the subject-matter of the inquiry.

                            <para>. - It is proposed to amend. section 6 of the principal Act by inserting after the word " question " the words " relevant to the inquiry." If that be carried, and if a question be asked by a Royal Commission which is not relevant to its inquiry, the witness need not answer it. That is the clear intention of the Government, as expressed in the proposed amendment. Now, if a witness cannot be punished for declining to answer a question because it is not relevant to the inquiry being conducted by a Royal Commission, surely a Commission ought not to have power to call for documents except those which are relevant to its inquiry. Let us extend the amendment which is proposed in respect of questions to documents. </para>

But honorable senators will recognise that there is a vast difference between requiring witnesses to produce books, documents, and writings, and requiring them to answer questions.. Under the powers which will be conferred on Royal Commissions by this Bill, witnesses will be compelled to answer questions put to them. To my mind, Royal Commissions ought to be armed with the power to require the production of all books and documents which" they may need. </para>

I cannot believe that, when hel fully understands the situation, he will allow these two clauses to remain as they are. Clause 2 does not harmonize, and cannot be made to harmonize, with the provision in clause 5. </para>

The Commission cannot let the witness off, and, however irrelevant the documents may be which they want him to produce, they will force him to go to a Court. Does the Minister want that? </para>

                        <para>Executive Council is simply stumbling from one misconception to another and a deeper one. At this stage of the Bill, the trouble is not as to persons appearing without documents, but as to what documents are to be produced. Naturally, the documents must be either relevant or irrelevant. Neither this Parliament nor the Commission wants irrelevant documents to be produced. Therefore, if we insert the word " relevant " as it has been inserted in the clause with regard to questions, we shall be perfectly consistent, not only with elementary common sense, but with the wish of Parliament. Does the Government desire that a pile of irrelevant documents should be brought up? Certainly not. They only want relevant documents to be produced. Nobody wants to be troubled with irrelevant ones. The tribunal should have the power of deciding as between relevancy and irrelevancy. What harm can there be in . inserting the word " relevant "? </para>

                                <para>- Every one is familiar with that procedure. Even in a Court of Petty Sessions, when you call upon a man to produce books and documents, you require him to produce only those which are relevant to the inquiry. Suppose that a document which the  Chairman  of a Royal Commission inadvertently put down in the list, happened to be entirely irrelevant. Suppose that the witness did not produce the document. The Commission construing this clause would have to say, " There is a difference as between question and documents. Parliament gave us no discretion with regard to documents, and the matter of relevancy cannot be considered." That would be absurd. Why, in the name of common sense, can we not say in the Bill that only documents relevant to the inquiry need be produced? As it is now, the clause is not only unjust, but it is grossly stupid. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable senator has been looking for trouble, and now he has got his answer. May I ask again, are these extended powers being given in this case for the particular purpose? What do the words to which I have called attention mean? The framers of the Bill no doubt intended something by them ; and I ought to be able to ask a simple question without being subjected to <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> kind of heckling which I have now dealt with for the first and last time. </para>

Every Commission that I have heard of has been appointed in that way. Why <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger should think that extended powers are given because the words to which he has referred are used in this clause is beyond comprehension.

                                <para>- If the honorable senator had read the clause, he would see that that is not what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger was directing attention to, but the latter part of the clause, which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator 43ivens</inline> has overlooked, and which does very largely increase the objects for which Royal Commissions may be appointed by Letters Patent. The first part of the clause is merely a recognition of what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> has told us, and, after all, that is very elementary knowledge even for a layman. But until this clause was inserted in a Bill, I do not think there ever was a power proposed to issue a Commission to make an inquiry upon matters specified in the Letters Patent, " and which relates to, or is connected with, the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth or any public purpose or any power of the Commonwealth." That is the departure from practice to which attention has been directed. </para>

I am merely pointing out that this Bill goes a long way further, in respect to the functions of a Royal Commission appointed by Letters Patent than has been known in any legislation before. Under the clause a Royal Commission might be appointed to make an inquiry as to any public purpose and as to any power of the Commonwealth. If the Government desired to have an inquiry into the prospects of the passing of the referenda proposals-, when they are again submitted to the people, they might, under this clause, appoint a Royal Commission to make that inquiry. </para>

                        <para>: - It is desirable 'to correct some misstatements made about the division of Western Australia into Federal electorates.'..' Stress. has .  been laid by lan-honory able member, jn.. another. . place, . as . well as by the Commissioners, on the supposed decrease in the voting strength in the goldfields district. This was made the excuse for placing nearly 5,000 excess voters on the Kalgoorlie division. I shall show that these prophecies have not only been erroneous, but have been absolutely falsified. I have here the official figures of the enrolment on the nth May, 1912 - that is, figures five months later than those on which the Commissioners based their prophecy of a decrease. These figures show that in several of the mining districts there has been a substantial increase, and not a decrease, in enrolment during those five months. For instance, at the Boulder the voters have increased from 3,251 to 3,591 ;  Brown Hill, from 2,304 to 2,416 ; Hannans, 5,489 to 5,494; Menzies, 2,107 to 2,126; and Mount Leonora, 2,649to 2,684. The decreases have been very trifling, but, setting them against the increases, we find the total enrolment to be, on the11th December, 34,299, and, on the nth May, 34,486, or an increase in the Kalgoorlie division of 187. Now, coming to the E, or Dampier, division, which is said to be " rapidly increasing," due to agricultural settlement, I find that the enrolment in several agricultural areas has actually decreased. The whole increase, amounting all told to about 400 voters, has actually taken place in the mining district. The figures of the Chief Electoral Officer show that the Senate was absolutely right in sending the report back to the Commissioners for reconsideration, and when the developments take place that we may expect, the voting power will be increased by 5,000, ' instead of being decreased as prophesied. </para>
