        <para class="block">Honorable senators are aware that in all Parliaments it is nscessary to provide funds for the carrying on of the service of the Government^ and that when the money provided by the ordinary appropriation is expended, the Government have to come to Parliament for a renewal of Supply. This is the first Supply Bill of the last session of this Parliament. On the first reading of Bills such as this, it is the privilege of every member of the Senate to express his opinion on the administration of the Government, and on all other subjects. We have postponed the consideration of another motion that gives honorable senators an unlimited opportunity of challenging the administration of the Government, and of referring to every aspect of Commonwealth affairs. In the circumstances, I ask honorable senators not to make the first reading of this Bill an opportunity for a criticism of the Government which may be offered on the motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply. I admit that there are questions of such urgent importance that every honorable senator is entitled to, and ought to, take the first opportunity of bringing before the country. Some members of the Senate have made certain questions not merely burning but blazing questions, and I feel almost certain that they will take advantage of this opportunity to refer to them. I can have - no quarrel with them on that account, but I think it would be wise on the part of honorable senators to reserve any general discussion for the debate on the Address-in-Reply. We are asking in this Bill for an amount sufficient to carry on the ordinary services, together with a reasonable and limited amount for the Treasurer&#39;s Advance, to meet lniscell aneous out  1  a y s. </para>

            <para>- It is about the smallest amount asked for in a Supply Bill for one month. Another vcte that is urgently necessary is that for refunds of revenue, for which ,&#163;50,000 is asked Honorable senators are aware that sometimes charges are made which must be refunded, and errors arise which require to be rectified. The amount of &#163;50,000 is necessary at the present time for the adjustment of our finances in that way. We are asking in this Bill for a total vote of &#163;882.768. If honorable senators will look the matter up, they will find that the total appropriation required to meet the ordinary services of last year was &#163;8,495,304. If we deduct from the total amount asked for in this Bill the amounts required for the Treasurer&#39;s Advance  and  refunds of revenue, it will leave &#163;682,768. That is a reasonable amount to ask for one month&#39;s services. The money, if not required exactly  at  the present moment, will be required very early in this month. I think it would be only a waste of time to refer to the details of the vctes5 for each Department, as honorable senators have papers supplied to them giving those details. If any explanation is really necessary, I shall, in reply to this debate or when the different Departments are being  CDnsidered,  see that those explanations, as far as  possible,  are forthcoming. </para>

            <para>- It did not need  a  speech to inform us of that fact. I understood the honorable senator to throw out  a  sort of invitation or challenge to debate this motion, and use the opportunity which now presents itself to ventilate any subject requiring comment. Having done that, it seems to me that the honorable senator turned completely round and implored honorable senators not to speak on this occasion, but to reserve their remarks until we resume the debate on the AddressinReply. Honorable senators on this side are only too pleased to conform to the wishes of the representative of the Government in this Chamber, but they should be made clear before we are held responsible if we fail to recognise what they are. I am going to take advantage of the opportunity presented by our Standing Orders to refer to one or two matters which I think call for a Ministerial pronouncement at as early a date as possible. The matter to which I wish first to direct attention is connected with, and indeed involves, the administration of the Defence Force. The particular point to which I desire to direct attention can scarcely have escaped the notice of honorable senators - I refer to the statements which have appeared in the public press regarding the great deficiency in the attendance of the cadets who have been enrolled under our existing law. </para>

            <para>- If my honorable friend will give me time I may possibly make some allusion to the article of clothing that always appeals to him. I mention this matter in order that the Minister may have an opportunity at the earliest possible moment of making a final pronouncement on the subject, because it seems to me that there is something so radically wrong that unless steps are taken to remedy it the evil will continue to grow. Indeed, even now it is of so serious a character that it represents either an injustice to those cadets who are discharging their duty to the Commonwealth, or a reprehensible leniency to those who are neglecting it. I bring the matter forward at this juncture with the simple object of enabling the Minister, if he sees fit, to make a public pronouncement upon it in view of its great urgency and importance. The figures which have been published in the press of Australia indicate that 83,000 cadets have been enrolled under the existing law, but that only 54,000 have been in attendance at drills. In other words, the attendance represents only. 64 per cent, of those who have been enrolled, leaving 36 per cent, who have not attended the drills. </para>

            <para>- My information dees net disclose that. Whether the absentees number 30, 31,. 32, or 36 per cent, does not matter very rauch. The fact is that a number of boys are discharging, their duties to the Commonwealth, whilst a very large number are abstaining from doing so. I wish to ascertain whether there is a reason for this state of things, and what the Department is doing to correct an unquestionable evil. I quite recognise the difficulty which must confront any Minister in introducing a system of this kind. I have no desire to increase that difficulty one bit, because the principle of compulsory training is a principle to which both parties in this Parliament are equally committed. I approach the matter as a friend of the system which the Minister is called upon to administer at present, but the administration of which in time to; come will fall upon the shoulders of one of his political opponents. </para>

            <para>- The point to which I wish to direct attention is whether the deficiency in the attendance at drills arises from a want of knovvledgs of their obligations on the part of the boys, whether it is due to advice which is offered to them, or whether it is traceable to laxity on the parr of the cffkrals themselves ? I wish to make a quotation from one newspaper which is venturing to offer advice on the subject. Some time ago, when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> quoted from a journal in which objectionable advice was offered to the cadets of Australia, the Minister of Defence said that it was not advisable to bestow any attention upon it, lest we might give it a cheap advertisement. I do not wish to give a cheap advertisement to any newspaper. But the journal from which I desire to quote, in dealing with the fines which were recently imposed upon Holland and Giles, says - </para>

        <para>This paper boasts of having distributed 100,000 copies of this and other issues. In these circumstances, surely it is time that we- considered whether publications of this character are not contributing to the failure of the youth of Australia to respect their obligations under our Defence Act. Tf they are, some penalty should be inflicted upon them. The laiw imposes a penalty upon the lads themselves, and the Minister, I presume, sooner or later, intends to see that the law is carried; out. So far, the prosecutions have been confined to the boys who have made the .default. But when grown men accept the responsibility of publishing matter of that kind, and of disseminating it broadcast, thsy ought not to be exempt from punishment. </para>

            <para>- No ; my honorable friend confused an interjection with my statement. It does not appear to be reasonable or common-sense that we should punish boys, or, if you like, their parents, while at the same time persons, in responsible positions are allowed to offer this pernicious advice and distribute it broadcast throughout Australia. Not merely dees the absence of the boys constitute a weakness in our defence system, but it imposes a distinct hardship upon the boys who are doing their duty, and upon those who have to train them. Where an area officer found that 40 per cent, of the boys were inefficient because of their want of attendance, the boys were given an opportunity of trying to rush im the number of attendances prior to the 30th June. The result was. as the Minister must recognise, that the area officer, who could have handled all the boys as well as he could handle 60 per cent, of them, had to give additional attendances, which wasrunfair to him. He had to crowd in, rush, scurry, and scamp the training, which, if the boys- had attended in the ordinary way, would have been given more effectively. It is stated that the boys, because of rushing their attendances towards the 30th June, are being made efficient on paper, but not in practice. </para>

        </continue>
        <para class="block">At Redfern they have been put on fatigue work, clearing up the&#39; grounds of the area officers, and doing other work on the premises, and the time so spent will be credited thein as parades. </para>
        <para class="block">That sort of thing does not put the boys in the same position of efficiency as their associates, and, to that extent, will lower the level of efficiency of the unit in which they are enrolled. It is not fair to the boys who have attended and honestly discharged the duty which the law imposes on them. Is it fair to the area officers? They were appointed on the understanding that only a portion of their time would be required in that capacity. They were told that they could still carry out civil occupations, giving, as it were, their odd time to the military work. What is the position now ? Because of the number of absences on the part of cadets the area officers have been called upon to give up a very much larger portion of their time than was contemplated either . by themselves or by the Department. That is another reason why I suggest to the Minister that the present state of affairs cannot be allowed to continue. It is with a. view to permit the honorable gentleman, if he sees fit, to make a definite pronouncement that I have brought the matter forward today. I am not quite certain that the Department itself should not take some share of the responsibility for the figures I have quoted - or, at any rate, for the attendances. Here is a complaint which has appeared in the press, and which I am, able to confirm in regard to other areas - </para>
        <quote>
          <para>The Milson&#39;s Point boys have been transferred to the Neutral Bay area (originally of the North Shore area), simply because the North Shore area was too large, and which is still increasing in number. The boys have to go a distance of about  2^  miles to train, whereas it is pointed out they could train just as well at a distance of  1  mile. It would be far easier for the boys living further up on the Shore to train with the Neutral Bay area, and balance the matter. There are  200  boys who attend this drill from Milson&#39;s Point. Another big item to consider in this matter is the tram fares. What about the poor boys who have to travel that distance? It is urged that the Government should issue free passes to boys when travelling in uniform to parade. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">A similar complaint was given to me in regard to an area on the Illawarra line, the exact number of which I have forgotten, but later I can give the information to the Minister if he wishes. The complaint is that in order to meet the requirements of the Department, cadets are put to very considerable inconvenience in the distance which they have to travel, and no account appears to be taken of the facilities to travel. In the case I have referred to the boys are located for training at a given spot. The train and the tram to convey the boys are most inconveniently jointed in, and the result is that they have to leave their homes very soon after the tea hour and to wait a long time on the ground before the drill commences. If it were possible to enable them to train in the adjoining area they could do so without much trouble to themselves and without waste of time. The Minister will, I think, see the advisability of trying not to alter the areas, or, at any rate, making exemptions to enable boys to train at the spots most convenient to themselves. Even if it be necessary to put on an additional area officer or two that should not weigh, especially in the initial stage of the system,, as against the possibility of getting the boys to carry out more cheerfully the work which is expected from them. The Minister will perhaps pardon me if I give another instance which indicates that there is a wrong impression abroad. Here is a statement which appeared either yesterday or to-day in a Melbourne newspaper - </para>
        <quote>
          <para>An impression seems to have got abroad that nothing more serious than a nominal fine will be imposed upon offenders against the Defence Act, and on this assumption it is stated that several boys have, with their parents&#39; consent, stayed away deliberately from drill, intending to meet whatever penalty the magistrate might fix. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">In view of these quotations, the Minister will, I hope, see that he will advantage the whole system and render a service to the country by making a plain and firm statement as to the exact position which the Department intends to take up, and&#39; the exact responsibility which the Act throws on the shoulders of the lads and their parents. And more particularly do I think that the time has come to offer a word of warning to those who are wrongly advising parents and, as it were, inciting them to break the law. </para>
        <para>There is another matter which seems to me to invite comment, and that is a statement in the press to-day that there is a considerable and alarming shortage of officers. Whether the statement is right or wrong, I do not know ; but it indicates that, whereas about 7,600 officers will be required as the result of the transfer of the first draft of senior cadets to the position of recruits in the militia, only 1,870 officers are available, leaving a deficiency of 5,730 if the figures be correct. The newspaper goes on to state that the Department is inviting officers from the reserves or unattached list to revolunteer for the purpose of taking up this duty. If this statement be correct, it almost appears to me that the Department has been slow to the point of danger in taking steps to make the deficiency good. We are actually in the second year&#39;s training, and apparently a deficiency is created before steps ave taken to make it good. One would have thought that, without any special effort, the Department could have anticipated this position months ago, and made provision to meet the requirements. </para>
        <para>May I say a few words as to a practice which I assume is general - it exists m Sydney - and that is the training of cadets in the streets ? I am not referring to the regrettable accident which occurred in Sydney recently, but to the general practice, which must have been brought under the notice of every one who moves about the suburbs of Sydney, and I suppose the same applies to other cities, of training these lads in the public thoroughfares. It is a standing disgrace to this or any other young country which requires its boys to be trained for its defence that no better place can be found for the work than the public thoroughfares. It is not fair to the boys or their officers. While I make allowances for the difficulty of inaugurating a new system, surely Australia is not so bankrupt for open spaces that we have to use the open thoroughfares to train the boys in. </para>

          <para>The Minister of Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Tearce)</inline> recently asked the Minister of Public Works in New South Wales to name a date when the building of the destroyers could be commenced by the State Government at the Fitzroy dock. The answer shows that the State authorities are not in a position to give the information required. It is stated by the Minister of Works that there is not sufficient material on hand yet to enable a start to be made with the vessels, and until more is received it will be impossible to say when a commencement can bc made. It is added that a shipment of material was being landed, and later on some announcement might be made. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> said that shortly he will appoint an officer to look into the matter and say when, in his opinion, the start should be made. The State will be asked to appoint an officer to consult with the Commonwealth representative. No question has arisen as to the cruiser that is to be built by the State, as the Commonwealth has to supply all the parts, and these are not to hand yet. </para>

        <para class="block">When we remember that some three years ago the naval programme which is now being carried out was finally adopted and approved, and that for two years, at any rate, the responsibility of carrying it out has been in the hands of the present Government, it is a little disheartening to find statements being given to the public to the effect that even now it is not possible to say when a start will be made to carry out the contract recently let to the Government of New South Wales. One hesitates to ask when the fleet unit is likely to be completed. The idea, when the understanding was arrived at with .the Imperial authorities, was that the whole of these vessels would be completed approximately &#39;at the same time. Now we find, with regard to two of them, that not only has no start yet been made, but no one is in a position to say when the start will take place. </para>

It is quite clear that we shall be very much behind time in its construction, and it is doubtful whether the <inline font-style="italic">Australia</inline> will not be here before we have the complementary vessels completed in our own docks. That is not a desirable state of affairs.

        <para>With regard to postal matters, a statement comes to me in a letter dated 30th June of this year to the effect that certain- postal officials in one of the country offices in New South Wales complain that their overtime is very much in arrears, and that it has been cancelled except from the 7th March last; that is to say, that the Postal Department repudiate overtime before that date. One of the officials on whose behalf this letter was written claims to be entitled to &#163;47 6s., and another to &#163;46. At the same time, according to these statements, other officials in other offices, also in New South Wales, admit that they have received payment for overtime prior to 7 th March last. In view of these statements, I should like to know what the departmental explanation is. </para>
        <para>I should be glad to know what the Government are doing with regard to the. resumption of land in the Federal Territory. When the Bill was passed, it was provided that land should be resumed at its value as on a certain date - I think the year fixed was 1908. It is now 1912, and these people cannot do anything with their land. It is pretty well known that the Government intend to resume, and &#39;the owners are helpless until the Government do resume. They cannot realize, or make any financial arrangements, and they would be foolish if they improved their lands in any way. As .a matter of business and fair play, the Government should either step in and resume and pay for the lands, or intimate to the owners that it releases them from the restrictions imposed by the Act. This thing cannot go on indefinitely. </para>

          <para>. - In the first place, may I congratulate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> on commencing to keep a scrap-book of all the information appearing in the daily press from time to time? When I tell the honorable senator that at least one newspaper has a gentleman&#39; in its employ who gives all his time to defence matters, he will realize that he will be busily occupied during the next few months in keeping up with the information appearing in that paper. With regard to the attendance of senior cadets during last year, the figures given by the newspapers, which, so far as I am aware, are not the figures of the Department, because no interim return of that kind can be of any value, are valueless, for this reason, that the parades have to be put in during the year, and the year ends on 30th June. It is the practice to have not only statutory, but voluntary parades. If a cadet misses a statutory parade, he can atone for that by attending two voluntary parades. The area officers, in making out their programme for a quarter, provide not only for statutory, but for a number of voluntary parades. An average attendance of 54,000 at every parade, including voluntary parades, out of a total enrolment of 83,000, might represent an attendance at statutory parades of 100 per cent. There is nothing really to indicate what it would represent. It is necessary to know whether the figures apply to statutory parades only. That was the question I asked the honorable senator, and which he did not answer, ff the figures apply to statutory parades only, they are an indication of a low standard of attendance at those parades, but if they apply to statutory and voluntary parades, they may indicate an attendance of 100 per cent, at statutory parades. </para>

            <para>- I have the usual quarterly return supplied to me, but it says nothing about the attendance at parades. It gives only the total registrations, the number of medical examinations, the percentage of medically examined fit, unfit, and temporarily unfit, total exemptions granted in training areas, the number remaining to be&#39; medically examined or exempt, the total number liable for training, and the total number actually in training. But it does not give the attendances at parades. </para>

            <para>- The honorable senator will see that the cadets must put in a certain number of parades within the year under the Act as it stands at present&#34;. The amending Bill now before the Senate will alter that. Under that Bill, prosecutions may take place at any time during the year, but under the existing Act we could not prosecute a cadet for non-attendance at a statutory parade until the end of the year. That undoubtedly has had a bad effect. It has tended to make the cadets believe that, as they were not prosecuted during the year, they would not be prosecuted at all. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> seems to have fallen into the same mistake, because he has been dealing with the matter as though it indicated some negligence on the part of the Department in failing to prosecute cadets for nonattendance at parades. If it be news to the honorable senator, I can tell him now that we found we could not prosecute until the 30th June. Since that date we can prosecute, and instructions have been issued that all those who ha.ve failed to attend the statutory number of parades are to be prosecuted. Those instructions are being acted upon.; but this is only the 4th July, and as legal machinery takes a little time to be put into motion, no prosecutions have so far taken place. </para>

            <para>- The honorable senator is again behind the fair. I have made such an announcement time after time during the last three or four months. Almost every week, when interviewed by representatives of the press, I told them that, unless the statutory number of parades were attended, it was my intention to set the law in motion and prosecute the offenders. There is not a single individual in this country who reads the newspapers who is not aware that that statement has been publicly made time after time. In the circumstances, no cadet can plead that he did not get due warning. I hope to be in a position presently to say what has been the percentage of attendance to the number enrolled. So far as we have been able to judge, it has not been what it ought to have been, or what we should like to have seen it ; but honorable senators must recognise what a revolution this Act was for the people of Australia. From the returns given to me, I find that there are 89,306 cadets actually undergoing training. That represents a revolutionary change in the lives of the youths of Australia who have been called upon for the first time to perform these public duties. It is not to be wondered at that there should have been a few attempts at evasion, or that there should have been a little grumbling. When we come to consider the matter fairly, the success of the Act has been far more astonishing than its failure, in view of the freedom of the outdoor life enjoyed by Australian youths. It is only because we believe that people require only to understand the scheme to conform to it that we have dealt with this matter gently at first. </para>

            <para>- I think so. That explains why there have been no prosecutions. With regard to the notice given, arrangements were made by myself that cadets who had neglected to attend statutory parades should be given a final chance during the month of June to attend special parades in order to avoid prosecution. What fault is there to be found with that ? If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> says that cadets desire to avoid prosecution, he cannot quarrel with that arrangement. It was made in the interests of the lads, and gave them a final opportunity to comply with the law. It was far better for us to take a little extra precaution in that way than to refuse to meet them at all, and come down with the hard hand of the law immediately after the 30th June. The fact that we have afforded them these facilities gives us a better justification for enforcing the law, now that the 30th June is passed. </para>

            <para>- Certainly not. We recognise that as this was the first year the scheme was put into operation, it was a fair thing to give the cadets a last chance. They can have no complaint now if they are prosecuted. With respect to the complaint that cadets on attending for drill have been put to cleaning up offices and arms, I may say that, in some areas, there have been very large attendances at parades, but in other cases only a few have attended. I think I can appeal to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron,</inline> when I say that it would not be sensible to hold a parade and keep a sergeant instructor drilling half-a-dozen lads. In some cases, where only two or three lads have attended, it was impossible to drill them as a section, and they were set to clean up offices and to clean rifles. </para>

            <para>- That had to be done, because they attended the parades, and we were prevented by circumstances from giving them drill. I do not look upon that work as a satisfactory substitute for drill, but the circumstances have justified it. I do not think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> was justified in saying that this has involved very great inconvenience to area officers. In many cases, the area officers are not present at all. The sergeant instructor looks after the boys, and the area officer supervises the work done. The actual drilling is done in most cases by a sergeant-major. I do not know of any case, in which an area officer, though he may have had to attend on an extra evening during the week, has been obliged to lose time in the day in consequence of this. With regard to the alteration of the training area at Milson&#39;s Point, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> will not expect me to reply to a question like that off-hand. There are some hundreds of training areas, and they are continually being altered. </para>

            <para>- Our desire has always been to meet the convenience of the cadets as far as possible. Honorable senators, as well as honorable members of another place, have frequently written to me to point out such difficulties, and wherever I could, I have tried to meet the objections raised. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> will give me particulars of the case to which he referred, I shall see whether it cannot be met. On the face of it, it is foolish to make lads walk a greater distance to drills than there is any necessity for. We have an army of officers doing their best to carry out the instructions given, which were to study the convenience of the great majority of the cadets. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has asked for a plain statement as to the attitude which the Government will take up on the question of making up the deficiencies of parade. The position is that lads who have not completed their service will be prosecuted. We have sent out instructions to the commanding officers, who will conduct the prosecutions, that where the infliction of a fine would impose a hardship apon the parents, they are to ask that section 135 of the Act shall be given effect to, and instead of a lad being fined, he shall be committed to a place of military detention. Where a fine is inflicted, and there is a penalty of imprisonment for nonpayment, the officers are instructed that, instead of the lads being imprisoned in a gaol, they shall be sent to a place of military detention. We wish to remove any criminal taint from these prosecutions, and to see that the penalty inflicted shall be satisfied by drill <inline font-style="italic">arid military duty of some</inline> kind, instead of by the offender having to go to gaol. In cases where a lad&#39;s parents are unable to pay the fines imposed, we wish to provide that the lad shall himself suffer the penalty of his own <inline font-style="italic">misdeeds.</inline> With regard to what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> said about the shortage of officers, the honor able senator did not make it plain whether he was referring to the Senior Cadets or to the Citizen Forces. But I shall make a general statement of the position. Prior to this year, as honorable senators are aware, we had a very small cadet force in the Commonwealth. It was mainly organized in connexion with public schools, and the teachers of the schools were, to a large extent, the officers in charge. The new scheme has altered that position. In the case of the primary scliools, practically all the pupils belong to the Junior Cadets, and they are being instructed by the school teachers. So far as the Senior Cadets are concerned, some of the secondary schools had senior cadet battalions, but in addition to those, we have had to provide for between 60,000 and 70,000 Senior Cadets. Of course, there were not sufficient cadet officers attached to the previous senior cadet organization for the new organization. But officers have been coming forward in considerable numbers, and the present position is that while we require 2,804 as a full staff of officers for the senior cadet organization, we have at the present time 1,994 officers available. That is not a bad record for the year. Although we have 60,000 additional cadets, we are only 810 officers short. As we did so well last year, we are encouraged to hope that next year we shall get the full complement required. Regarding the Citizen Forces, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> is perhaps unaware that under the old defence organization each company of militia - so far as its rank and file were concerned - was kept on a peace establishment. That is to say, in time of war the rank and file would double its numbers. But ever since Major-General Hutton&#39;s time, the policy has been to keep the number of its officers always up to war strength. Upon that basis we require 2,213 officers this year, having .in view the inflation of the forces by the Senior Cadets ; and there are available on the active list 1,510. <inline font-style="italic">We</inline> require additional officers to the extent of 703 to bring them up to war strength. But so far as the peace establishment is concerned, the number of officers is quite adequate. During the past year we have been granting facilities for the instruction of non-commissioned officers in order that they might qualify for commissions. The inducement, has been held out to&#39; them that if they wished to continue in the militia beyond their present term of engagement, the way was open to them to qualify as non-commissioned officers and &#39; officers. A very large number have been so qualified. I am informed that the effect will be that during the coming year we shall experience no difficulty in finding the additional officers required) particularly in the lower ranks ; but I would point out that we have also a large number of officers on the unattached list. The men upon that list are not necessarily antiquated or out of date. They have been placed upon it simply because under the existing organization there were no commands open to them, or because, having completed their term, it was necessary that they should retire to give the next officer a show. We have a large number of these officers, and this new organization will afford us an opportunity of inviting them back to senior commands in our Citizen Forces. In that way we shall be able to meet our immediate needs, and with the additional instructional staff we are securing, we shall be in a position to afford facilities for the instructional officers, and thus get the 703 we require to again bring our forces up to war strength. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> spoke of delay in the construction of the cruiser <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane</inline> and the three torpedo boat destroyers which are to be built in New South Wales. </para>

            <para>- I thank the honorable senator for interrupting me. I find that I had overlooked two matters, namely, the publication of objectionable statements, and also the question of training in public thoroughfares. Now, the position is that each district is divided into certain military areas, and the area officers have to reside in the areas to which they are attached. The area office is often situated at no great distance from a public park or open space. Nobody, I am sure, will suggest that it is good for the boys to do all their drills in drill halls. Both Senators Cameron and Gould will admit that it is desirable that they should get out into the open. In addition to that, we have not anything like a sufficient number of drill halls at present. The cadets are not allowed to take their rifles home, and consequently they have to be kept at the area office. The lads assemble there, their attendance is registered in the books, and they are then formed up and marched off to the places where they have to drill. In some cases, the office may be so distant from a public park that, in case of a night drill, it may not be worth while taking them there. In such circum stances, they may be drilled in the public, streets. But I know that many complaints that have been made regarding the drilling of cadets in public thoroughfares have emanated from superficial observers, who,, seeing the lads marching down the streets,, have at once jumped to the conclusion that they were doing their parade, when as a matter of fact they were on their way to a public park. There are a large number of places in the Commonwealth where we have not proper parade grounds. In other places there are grounds which we have been forbidden to enter lest the grass should be damaged. We have appealed to the local governing bodies for the use of the grounds under their control, and in most cases, I am glad to say, we have had a generous and patriotic response; but in a very few instances we have been met with a slap in the face. In regard to what we propose to do in the future, I can only ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> to restrain his soul in patience until the Budget is delivered. He will then see that we are not unmindful of the discomforts to which the cadets have been subjected during the winter, and that we are doing our best to remedy them. Regarding his desire that we should place the publisher of the journal from which he quoted on the pedestal of martyrdom, I wish to repeat what I stated on a previous occasion. I believe that there is less opposi-. tion to our defence system to-day than there was six months ago, and there will be less opposition to it in six months&#39; time than there is now. As the people understand it, they are beginning to appreciate it. The protests which have been made against it are puny and insignificant. They have scarcely rippled the surface of public opinion. But we should lend them added force, and attract to their authors a certain amount of public sympathy, if we were to make martyrs of them. There is no doubt that many persons who are in a minority, and who are struggling for what they believe to be right, will say things which are actionable and open to prosecution. But one of the strongest features in connexion with the British nation has been the latitude which it has allowed its people in the matter of free speech. That circumstance has tended to make Britain strong, and to quell the spirit of revolution in past centuries. In other countries we see that the policy of repression does not produce such beneficial results as the policy of allowing the utmost liberty. </para>

            <para>- T do not say that that is a fair construction to place upon some of the statements which have been made. There is a reverend gentleman in diis city who preached a sermon the other day which might easily be construed as an incitement to break the law. But we should be extremely foolish if we were to go round endeavouring to put the worst possible construction upon statements of that character. Our defence system will be infinitely stronger if its opponents are allowed their say, and the common sense of the people is permitted to decide the question. </para>

            <para>- No. There has been no hesitancy on&#39; the part of the Government in that matter. Upon the question of naval construction, I wish to say that, had the order for the construction of the cruiser <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane,</inline> and the three torpedoboat destroyers been placed in London, there is no doubt that they would have been built sooner. They would probably have been here as soon as the other ships. But it is equally important to this country that we should commence to make ourselves self-contained, not merely in the manning of ships and the training of officers, but in the construction of the vessels themselves. The decision to adopt that course has occasioned delay. It is the sole cause of delay. I am prepared to allow the public to judge as to who is responsible for that delay. We have done our best to expedite the construction of these ships. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> quoted a paragraph from a newspaper which stated that I had requested the New South Wales Government to name a date when the construction of the destroyers shall be deemed to be commenced. That is due to the fact that, in the warship contract, it is provided that the Commonwealth shall provide the material for the cruiser. On the other hand, the New South Wales Government will provide the material for the three destroyers, and the whole of the ships are to be built within twenty-six months from the date of the commencement of the contract. The contract is to be deemed <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> be commenced upon a date to be fixed by an officer from the Naval Officer and an officer from the New South WalesGovernment dockyard ; and, in the event of their failure to agree, an umpire is to be appointed. Consequently, I have asked the New South Wales Government to fix a date when the construction of the destroyers shall be deemed to be commenced. </para>

            <para>- No; but it is a factor in the matter. We are in possession of information that certain material hasalready been landed. We have asked the New South Wales Government to fix a date upon which the construction of the destroyers shall be deemed to have commenced. They have informed us that they are not yet in a position to fix the date,, but that they hope to be able to do so shortly. Captain Clarkson is leaving Melbourne, either to-day or to-morrow, to confer with them on this question, and inorder that we may get the date finally fixed. I have no doubt that the New South Wales Government will do their best, for thesake of their own reputation, to expedite the construction of these ships. </para>

            <para>-  And it is not here yet ? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator PEARCE.</inline> - No. The question of the delay in the provision of material has caused considerable vexation and annoyance to myself and other members of the Government. But it is a matter upon which we are not the arbiters. There have been a series of delays, not merely with our ships, but also with ships for the British Government, which are very annoying and vexatious, and which we regret as much as anybody else does. I have no doubt that the New South Wales Government have been the victims of these delays in regard to our ships, as we have been in regard to the ships under construction in England. I am sorry to say that the latter ships will not be delivered &#39; until months after the appointed time. That is due to factors which the Admiralty say they are unable to control, and which they regret. We have been trying to bring influence to bear to expedite the delivery of the vessels. As regards the ships under construction in Sydney, we intend to do all we can to expedite their completion, and we have every reason to believe that the State Government&#39; will try to hand them over at the earliest possible moment. With regard to the land an the Federal Territory, the Budget will disclose the intentions of the Government, ;and also the precise nature of the action which they propose to take in regard to the land, and, therefore, I do not propose to say more on the subject to-day. </para>

          <para>. - In supporting the first reading of this Bill, I desire to take advantage of the suggestion of the Vice-President of the Executive Council to refer to one or ;two matters which are not. burning or Iblazing, but which, at least, are agitating the minds of the people. It is fortunate for the Senate that a Supply Bill has been brought down at all, and that its members are given an opportunity to express their opinions on public matters. I regret very much that the Senate had reason to adjourn for a specific period simply because the other branch of the Legislature deemed it wise to have an argument. I entered my protest against the proposed adjournment, . as I shall always protest against an observance of that custom, because I realize that while the two Houses are constituted as they are, work can be found for both. In view of the fact that the Government have admitted that certain Bills are in course of preparation, I think that the Senate could have been very well engaged last week in discussing measures without waiting for another place to settle its fight. One of the questions which are agitating the minds of the people is the increased revenue from Customs and Excise. I admit that that revenue has been greatly increased, in fact, the last returns from the Treasury show that conclusively. As a Protectionist, I would rather see the revenue derived from another source than Customs. Just because this revenue has .increased, and is still increasing, the present Government, as well as the Labour party of Australia have been attacked for not making the Tariff much more Protective than it is. There is no necessity to make such an attack as that. It is not the present Government, or the Labour party, who are to blame for the increased revenue from Customs, but those who, when appealed to in April,  191 1,  refused to vest in this National Parliament the powers which it sought in the shape of new Projection. </para>

            <para>- Yes; but that fact does not entitle us to do certain things which the Constitution says we cannot do. It was because the Government recognised that inability that they appealed to the people to vest in this Parliament the power to establish new Protection ; the people said &#34; No,&#34; and consequently the blame for the ineffectiveness of the Tariff remains at their door, and not at the door of the Labour party or of the Labour Government. I, for one, am prepared to vote for the highest Protective Tariff which can possibly be made, realizing the necessity for doing so. I also realize that until such time as. the Protection which is given at the ports to- the manufacturers is shared by the worker and consumer, the Tariff should remain as it is. Unless glaring anomalies can be pointed out to me, I am prepared to let things remain as they are. Certainly, if any industry is suffering or struggling by reason of anomalies, I would welcome an amending Bill in that direction. But to re-open the whole Tariff, and try to make our Protection much more effective than it is, will be futile until the people recognise the necessity of giving this Parliament the powers it sought in the direction of giving new Protection. We have also been attacked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> and others about out land tax. I claim that it has been beneficial, not only -to the revenue, but to all Australia. It.has been the means of breaking up large, estates which had been held out of use; &#39; It has been the means of increasing settlement in Australia. It has been the means of providing a few of those who have come from oversea with land which they can work and develop. It is impossible to separate the tax on unimproved land values and its usefulness afterwards from the. questions of immigration and defence. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has referred to defence, and as the&#39; Minister of Defence has replied to him, I shall leave that question alone. But, as regards immigration, it is absolutely essential- before the Commonwealth spends a halfpenny in encouraging immigration from overseas, to have large estates broken up. The tax has been very effective in breaking up, at least, some of the large estates. </para>

            <para>- It is so far as Victoria is concerned, and I venture to say, without fear of contradiction, that a similar honus is paid to their agents by other States. If it is necessary at any time to invite people to our shores, the work should be done by the Government, or not at all, and every man in the Immigration Office in London, and every agent of that office, ought to receive simply a yearly salary.  His  pay should be good, but no incentive should be offered to him in the shape of a bonus to send men and women of all classes and descriptions indiscriminately to our shores. The present Government have been asked to spend money in assisting an immigration scheme, while at the same time they were to have no voice in the selection of the immigrants. I venture to say that this Government, or any other Government who may succeed them., would be only too willing to assist, but would always desire to have a voice in the selection. We have been told that things are not as they ought to be in the Postal Department, and I admit that there are still postal employes who -have serious grievances. </para>

            <para>- I dare say that &#34;if the Government had spent a million pounds more there would still be grievances. ;but it is not correct to say that the Government shirked their responsibilities by passing the Public Service Arbitration Act. The present Government have done more for the postal employes of the Commonwealth than any Government that preceded them. They are continuing to improve their conditions, and I dare say that that section of the Postal Service which has not yet received some consideration will  receive it very shortly. The Government have been consistent in their attitude so far as the Arbitration Court is concerned. They have simply suggested that the Public Service employes should avail themselves of the same channel to settle their disputes as do employes outside. There is nothing inconsistent or suggestive of shirking responsibilities in that. The Government of the day had a policy when they faced the people at the last election. That policy was arbitration, and they have given effect to  it.  They say to the Commonwealth employes, &#34; If you are not satisfied with the decision of the Public Service Commissioner, you have your remedy. Appeal to the Arbitration Court, and we, as an employer, will stand by the Court&#39;s decision.&#34; </para>

            <para>- I am glad to see that Australia is steering away from that system, and, so far as I am concerned, I will always advocate arbitration. I come now to the proposal to establish a Commonwealth Bank. It has been established, but on a very humble scale yet. I very rauch regretted to hear the reflections cast by the Leader of the Opposition on the gentleman appointed as Governor of the bank. It is not customary for the honorable senator to be so  jUnjust. </para>

            <para>- The inference to be drawn from the honorable senator&#39;s remarks was that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Miller</inline> was incompetent. I should like to place the honorable senator in the pillory in the same way. Before <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Miller</inline> has even the chance to lay the foundations of the bank, we find the archpriest of finance, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> castigating him without his having a chance to put his views before the country. The attack on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Miller</inline> was unmanly, unjust, ungenerous, and unworthy of the man who uttered it. As to the salary paid to the Governor of the bank, we must give some encouragement to a good man to undertake such responsible work. It was because the Government realized the necessity of getting the best man in Australia that they gave him such encouragement, and it has yet to be seen whether or not <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen&#39;s</inline> unjust remarks can be proved. With regard to the Australian Notes Act, I remember <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon,</inline> when the measure was first introduced here, prophesying utter and absolute failure. </para>

            <para>- I was referring: to the issue. Those figures show that there is no danger to be apprehended from the Act, and that the Government have kept their promise to Parliament to maintain a proper reserve. The Australian Notes Act has proved to be an absolute benefit to Australia. Whilst the Act was despised at its birth, and scorned and castigated by honorable senators opposite, and by people outside, it has proved a boon to several State Treasurers. Five out of six of them have been able to borrow money from the Commonwealth Treasurer under the operation of that Act </para>

All they had to do was to write a note to the Commonwealth Treasurer, asking him to lend them so much money, and they received it. That was the end of it, and as a result the Australian taxpayer has been saved many thousands of pounds. </para>

            <para>- I am not a judge of the honorable senator&#39;s past character or conduct, but I say advisedly that any man who uses such language on a public platform to condemn his opponents is unworthy to be placed in a public and responsible position. After all, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> was only taking the lead from other people. The Government have proposed to grant a maternity allowance, and instead of giving them any credit at all for humane motives, their opponents at once dubbed them as &#34; voteseekers,&#34; &#34; vote-catchers,&#34; and &#34; bribers.&#34; Whether that condemnation is merited or not, there are thousands of fathers and mothers in Australia who will welcome this proposal. Setting party bias aside, honorable senators will admit that at the time of a certain interesting event in a family an allowance of ^5 will be very welcome assistance. It has been suggested by one or two of our opponents that only those who are in receipt of an income of less than <inline font-style="italic">&#163;400</inline> a year should receive the <inline font-style="italic">&#163;5</inline> maternity allowance. Such a proposal is a gratuitous insult to a portion of the womanhood of Australia. It is because the Government do not desire to pauperize one section and exempt another that they offer <inline font-style="italic">j&#163;$</inline> to every mother in Australia, irrespective of whether the family is in receipt of an income of ^10,000 or ^100 a year. To make the differentiation proposed by our opponents would be to insult the greater number of Australian mothers. I know what the people will say when they are appealed to on this question of a maternity allowance for the motherhood of Australia. Mention has been made of the referenda, and we have been told that, because the Government proposals were defeated when they last appealed to the people, the writing was on the. wall, and spelled disaster for the Federal Labour party. </para>

            <para>- I was. I am rather optimistic, and I think it is just as well .to be confident. The reason I am more confident on this occasion is that I think that by the next time these proposals are submitted to the people, they will be sadder and wiser than they were before. We claimed that our proposals should have been carried because of the operation of trusts and combines and unscrupulous traders in increasing the cost of living. This Parliament seeks control over these unscrupulous people. The electors, in their wisdom, when last appealed to, cast a vote of confidence in the trusts, combines, and unscrupulous traders, and, because of that, the trusts, combines, and unscrupulous traders have since further increased the cost of living. </para>

            <para>- I admit that the question of the referenda opens up a very wide field for discussion. I know that the Coal Vend has been prosecuted, and does not propose to appeal against the judgment of the Court. But even that fact does not prove that this Parliament possesses the powers which it sought to have conferred upon it at the last referenda, and which it will again seek at the coming general election. I would ask the Governments of some of the other States to follow the good example which has been set by the Western Australian Government, and to recognise the penalties which have been inflicted upon the people in the way of the increased cost of living, and the imposition of higher rents. We know that rent is a big factor in the lives of most people. </para>

            <para>- We have not. In order to release that tension, the Government of Western Australia are about to establish State brickworks. State timber mills, andi to undertake the erection of workmen&#39;s homes. The Navigation Bill, which is mentioned in the GovernorGeneral&#39;s Speech, will be attended to by another branch of the Legislature when the members of that House have realized the futility of wasting public time as they have been doing during the past fortnight. I hope that when the measure is considered there, we shall profit by the lessons which have been taught By the terrible disaster which befell the <inline font-style="italic">Titanic.</inline> We were told that the Werriwa election would result in the defeat of the Labour candidate, because our proposals at the last referenda were rejected by the people. But that election was a forcible reply to our opponents both inside and outside of this House. </para>

Before <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> can contest an election for a seat in this Chamber, he must agree to abide by the selection of the Liberal party, and sign a pledge to that effect. I come now to the incident to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> made a playful reference a few moments ago.

        <para>The Government have a surplus of about  &#163;2,000,000.  That in itself is an indication that there was never any need to persecute land-holders, or to impose a land tax for revenue purposes. Notwithstanding the statements which have been made to the contrary, it will be found that that tax has entirely failed to achieve its object. As far as I can learn, there has been very little subdivision of big estates. </para>

            <para>- It would have been no more unconstitutional then than it is now, because the present Act makes an exemption up to &#163;5,000 worth of unimproved values. These city lands cannot be subdivided, but the tax on them can be, and has been, passed on. The result to-day is a big increase in rent which the people have to pay, and a big increase in the cost of production which they have to pay. Thus, instead of the housewife having a few extra sovereigns in her pocket - as she was promised - she has to pay more for her household commodities merely because this tax has been imposed on city lands. I do not think anybody can claim that the Land Tax Assessment Act has fulfilled the purpose of its supporters in any way whatever. </para>

        <para>I am sorry that the Minister of Defence is absent from the chamber, because only to-day I asked him whether a certain statement published in the <inline font-style="italic">Register</inline> newspaper, Adelaide, was correct or not. I should have thought that anybody could have given an answer to such a simple question. But, instead, I was asked to give notice of it. Now I am quite sure that the matter to which the question related, namely, the granting of a preference to unionists, is an outrageous principle for any Government to adopt. What is the position? In this particular case a single man, with no family responsibilities, is to be granted a preference in employment simply because he is a unionist. </para>

            <para>- The instruction issued by the Minister of Home Affairs was that preference should be granted to unionists, and after that to married men. So that, if a single man is a unionist, he is to receive a preference in the matter of work over a married man who is not a unionist. But a married man with a family and domestic responsibilities, who may be paying into the revenue, perhaps, five times as much as the single man is paying, is to be refused Government employment, simply because he is a non-unionist. To my mind the thing is utterly preposterous and unjust. Two men are equal before the law and of equal ability, and are contributing to the revenue, but one man is to have work because he is a unionist, and the other is to be refused work because he is a non:uniomst. </para>

            <para>- Because a private enterprise stands in a different position from a Government enterprise. Contrast the position taken up by  President  Roosevelt in America. When the  president  of the Labour Unions went to White House, and asked for preference to unionists,  President  Roosevelt took up the right position, and the one which every Government ought to take up. He said that the duty of the Government was to mete otit absolute justice to every one of its subjects, that in giving employment he could no more recognise the fact that a man was a unionist or a non-unionist than he could consider whether a man was a Roman Catholic or a Protestant, a Jew or a Gentile ; that no men, because of their religious profession or unionism or nonunionism&#39;, could expect any preference from the Government. I protest with all the force of which I am capable against the adoption by the Commonwealth Government of so pernicious and unjust a system as preference to unionists. </para>

            <para>- I would advise my honorable friend not to prophesy until he knows, because that is yet to be proved. The National bank, it seems to me, will have to stand in competition with other banks which are doing exactly the same kind of business. Unless it can give better conditions, can lend money at a lower rate, or do anything of that kind, it is not likely, I think, to get very much business. It is not the National Bank which is to be started first, but the Savings Bank branch. Why is that course taken ? Do the Government want to gather in the people&#39;s savings so as to have money with which to carry on their bank ? What is going to be done with the deposits? We know very well that the State Savings Banks are restricted as to what they can do with the deposits. They can lend money on mortgage, invest money in Government stock, take up municipal bonds, and do things of that kind. What they can do with the deposits is laid down in their Acts of Parliament, from which they cannot depart, and whatever the money earns can be paid out in the way of interest. Now what is going to be done with the money which is deposited in the Commonwealth Savings Bank? Is it going to be taken into the revenue, or is it to be paid into a special fund and used simply for Commonwealth purposes? I do not believe that the Savings Bank will be a very great success, but if it is it will certainly be injurious to the States. What is the position to-day? The State Savings Banks gather in the people&#39;s money and invest it. They lend, for instance, on the mortgage of freehold property. If a man is building a house, and wants some help, he applies to a Savings Bank and it lends him money at a reasonable rale of interest. Or if the Government of a State needs any money, and the Savings Bank has money to spare, the latter can take up Government bonds. A State Savings Bank promotes the interests of the State in every way. I do not hear of any statement having been made as to what is to be done with any deposits in the Commonwealth Savings Bank. It seems to me that the money is going to be used for carrying out any work which the Commonwealth Government have in hand. I do not think that that will be an improvement at all. </para>

              <inline font-weight="bold">-Colonel CAMERON</inline>(Tasmania) &#91;5.5&#93;. - I desire to say a few words on the question of the cadets, which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> raised. I think it is a little early to criticise at very great length our system of universal compulsory training. No doubt, there are certain matters which possibly may be ventilated, and I understood from his speech that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> was drawing the Minister&#39;s attention to them,, rather than indulging in hostile criticism. But no movement of such stupendous proportions as is this movement can possibly be brought into working order without there being some little difficulties to overcome. With me, at present, minor details are of very small importance compared with the grand step which has been taken both in initiating and in developing what has unquestionably been generally accepted by everybody as a national and nonpartyundertaking. I wish the Minister of Defence success in carrying it through as he has begun. I do not intend to say a hostile word concerning this important part of our defence system, because I think it goes in the right direction, and while that is so minor matters should be left for departmental treatment, and not discussed so much here. I feel called upon again to utter a note of warning. I do not think that I shall be out of order in drawing the attention of the Senate, and of the Government in particular, to the fact that ever since the Minister of Defence and his colleagues visited the Old Country a very serious state of affairs has pervaded the world. The amount of com- &#39; bustible material lying about in all directions has vastly increased since the Ministers were taken into the inner councils of the Imperial Government. A vast change has come over the situation, at all events as it is presented to statesmen at Home. When the Minister of Defence was there such a possibility as the Mediterranean Sea being handed over practically to the safe keeping of another Power, no matter how friendly our relations with it were, was not even in contemplation at that period. Within the last eighteen months, also, we have seen the centre of gravity of the Naval Forces of the Empire shifted from the Mediterranean, practically one of the granary routes of Great Britain, to the British Islands. That, in itself, is an extraordinary happening, and must be of great moment to us. There is also a consequent difficulty arising from our position in India. We have had to hand over the Mediterranean practically to the protection of a great friendly Power, with whom our relations are of the closest character, but who at the same time is not an ally ; while in the Pacific Australia is practically under the protection of another ally, Japan. So far as that is concerned, the material advantages have hitherto been mutual, but now the situation is very different. India is in a serious position. It is being denuded of British troops. It contains only a white garrison which has hitherto been considered necessary for the maintenance of our position there, irrespective of outside pressure. The numbers of the white garrison of India were determined upon at a time when Russia was no nearer to us than a line drawn slightly north of the southern end of the Caspian Sea. That was at the time of the Mutiny. Since then Russia has absorbed the Khanates of Central Asia until now she is practically co-terminous with the British Empire in Afghanistan ; and actually Russia and Great Britain have divided Persia into two great sections or spheres of influence. We are actually now, therefore, coterminous with the greatest land force, not even excepting Germany, in the world. When I refer to Russia as the greatest land force, let me call attention to the fact that its population is something like 160,000,000, of which no less than 120,000,000 constitute a homogeneous people, comprising the Slav element. In Russia, therefore, we have to deal, not with a congeries of different nations, but with a solid mass. Fortunately, at the present moment Russia and ourselves are on good terms; but how long is that going to last ? Afghanistan, a buffer State, is in a state of rebellion, and it is very doubtful how long it will take to repress the trouble. In Persia, again, the conditions are ominous, indicating that at any moment a conflict of interests may occur, necessitating intervention on our part. In face of these facts, I venture to say that if Australia were called upon to lend assistance, she could not send a brigade, she could not send even a regiment, of trained soldieis fit to meet the trained soldiers whom the Military Forces of the Empire would have to meet. We cannot admit of a reverse in India. Experts who have spent their lives in that country, and know the native character, have one and all said that a reverse wouid mean the subversion of our authority there. </para>

            <para>.- Without question. There is nothing to prevent it. At this juncture, in all solemnity, and with all the earnestness at my command, I urge the Government, who have an immense majority at their back and an immense following throughout the country, to consider the gravity of the situation. We all admit the necessity for holding this country at all hazards and at all costs; but we must not forget that our ability to hold it may not be settled within the seas surrounding our coasts. That question must be settled elsewhere. I do not urge the Government to pass panic legislation of any sort; but I do call on them to lay the foundation of a system which the present militia or national guard, although a step in the right direction, will not of itself produce. We shall require efficient troops to meet the emergency that is imminent. I want to strengthen the hands of the Government, and of the Minister of Defence, in this matter; and I am sure I speak for the whole of the party on this side when I say they will back the Government up loyally and thoroughly. I make these representations on account of the urgency of the position. Without questioning the policy of other nations, or their right to adopt any policy they like, we must without delay take such a course that, whatever eventuates in the future, whatever the aims and ambitions of other nations may be, we shall be able to still&#34; make good our claim to hold our own and to develop our own in our own way, irrespective of their threats or their desires. I have touched upon the position in the Mediterranean, and I have touched upon the position in the Pacific, where Japan is the Power that practically secures the integrity of this country. I have touched upon the question of India, and all that that means to us. I have also touched upon the difficulties in Persia and Afghanistan, which are certainly sources of great and deep anxiety. I urge the Minister of Defence without delay to put in train the formation of a Military Force of a more permanent character than we have at the present time, with the object of producing an efficient body of troops capable of meeting any requirements. The training to which our youths and young men are being put is a move in the right direction, and will lessen the amount of work that we shall have to give the more permanent men when they are called upon, but it is not enough. Delay is dangerous. I have pointed to the dangers that are threatening us, and- in conclusion I should like to read a few pithy words which put the matter better than I can put it - </para>

          <para>. - None of us will dispute the fact that a man who devotes all his time to any particular profession- or calling - everything else being equal - will become more efficient than one who does not do so, and who may be called an amateur in that profession or calling. The professional soldier idea is out of the question in this country,, and there is no use in bothering about the matter. In Australia, at the present time, so far as defence matters are concerned, the question we have to consider is : How much money are we going to spend on our citizen army ? I have from the start taken a very lively interest in the question of general compulsory training. I think that, with ex-Senator Dobson, I was one of the first to move in this direction in the Senate. Reviewing the history of defence matters in Australia during the last ten or twelve years, I hold the opinion that we have made very satisfactory progress indeed. In the early days of Federation, when about &#163;750,000 was being spent on defence, it was contended by some that too much money was -being spent for that purpose. If we compare our defence expenditure of those days with the amount that Australia is able and willing to spendfor the same purpose to-day, we shall seehow great has been the advance we havemade. Australia has adopted a new principle of compulsory training, and in all thecircumstances it is really astonishing that the system should have been brought; into operation so satisfactorily, and with so very little friction. We know that, inconnexion with our military system, everything in the nature of compulsion wasstrongly opposed in the past. Compulsory service was opposed to the traditions of our people in Australia and in the Old Land. When we bear in mind the opposition that has always been- given to anything in thenature of compulsion, and consider that thisnew system has&#39; been projected in Australia with so little friction, we should be very careful indeed before we find fault with the work which has been done by the Defence Department. I was disappointed tohear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> find fault because there was a small percentage of boys who had&#39; not been prosecuted for non-attendance at drill. If we approach defence matters in that spirit, and display an anxiety to rushinto the Police Courts to prosecute cadets - </para>

            <para>- I addressed you, sir, when I rose to speak, and was continuing to do so when interjections were made which I answered. I hope that if further interjections are made you will call the honorable senator who interjects to order, and not the honorable senator who has the floor. I was saying that, in view of the fact that a great and new principle has been introduced by the Defence Department with so little friction, we have no right to challenge the action of the Department on this occasion. T consider that there is nothing to find fault with, and I was objecting to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> finding fault with the operation of the new principle. If we wish to discredit this great principle of compulsory training, and are looking for trouble, the shortest course we can take is to rush to the Courts to prosecute boys who did not attend their drills regularly. -I should like to add that both sides in politics in Australia recognise that defence is not a party question. Honorable senators on both sides should, therefore, be very careful that no action they take in this matter shall be used for party purposes. If we allow the defence of Australia to degenerate Into a party question, we shall defeat our great national project for the establishment of a citizen army. If this question is dragged into the arena of party strife, the desires of both parties in this regard will be defeated. Honorable senators should, therefore, be very careful not to find fault with the operation of this new principle which, in my opinion, has been so satisfactorily introduced in the defence of Australia. </para>

          <para>- - The vote to which the honorable senator refers is based on the last Supply Bill. I call his attention to information at his disposal, which shows that a Department of the Prime Minister has been created, and has certain work to carry out. He will find that the chief items of expenditure proposed for this Department in this schedule are in connexion with the Auditor-General and the Public Service Commissioner&#39;s branches of the Public Service, both of which have been transferred to the Prime Minister&#39;s Department. A vote of  &#163;1,800  is put down for the Auditor-General, and of  &#163;1,300  for the Public Service Commissioner ; and these amounts, which comprise almost the whole vote for this Department, do not represent new expenditure, but a transference of expenditure from other Departments. Previously, the Public Service Commissioner&#39;s branch was under the Home Affairs Department, and the Auditor-General&#39;s branch under the Treasurer&#39;s Department. </para>

            <para>- His statement - and he is possessed of a knowledge of land - is that in its unimproved condition the land is worth that sum. I have also heard statements to the effect that many of the valuations in New South Wales are notoriously low. If that be so the purpose of the tax is being defeated. If we have not efficient valuators there should be some method of checking their valuations, of ascertaining who are incompetent, and of firing them out without mercy. The Commonwealth is being robbed by reason of these absurdly low valuations. I suppose that, like many other Departments, there is a liability that laxity will grow up among the officers of the Land Tax Department if we do not constantly bring to l-&#39;ght any such facts as may be available. The Labour Government should insist upon getting from the tax every penny which is due to the Commonwealth. These undervaluations are stated by more than one person to be responsible for the falling off in the revenue which has been collected from it. </para>

          <para>- - I may say, for the information of the Committee, that I, too, have heard many complaints of the kind which has just been- voiced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae.</inline> Many of these, when investigated, proved to have no foundation in fact, whilst others were based upon good grounds. I am sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> will acknowledge that the Land Tax Office has been, in existence only a very short time, and that during the first year of its operations it had necessarily to accept to a great extent the valuations of the land-owners themselves. Since then it has been making check valuations, but no matter how exacting a Department may be! so long as there are taxpayers who are anxious to avoid their responsibilities, there will be evasions. I am sure, however, that the Government and the Land Tax Commissioner himself will be only too glad if honorable senators who know of glaring instances of that kind will inform them of the fact. The Land Tax Assessment Act provides such drastic punishment for evasions of its provisions that no taxpayer can avoid his responsibility, even after the lapse of years, if it is discovered that he has undervalued his land. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> can give specific instances of undervaluations steps will at once be taken to institute such inquiries as <inline font-style="italic">mil</inline> prevent anything of the kind recurring in the future. But no good can be accomplished by any honorable senator making a general statement to the effect that something is being done in Murrumbidgee, or Mudgee, or Cootamundra, or anywhere else. </para>

          <para>. - The Vice-President of the Executive Council has informed me that the secretary&#39;s office is a new one, but he has not told the Committee what are to be the duties of this officer, nor the name of the gentleman who has been fortunate enough to secure the position. Merely to say that the office is that of secretary is to leave us in a delightful state of doubt as to the duties which he will have to perform. </para>

          <para>. - In reply to the Leader of the Opposition, I. wish to say that at the end of May last the registrations of the lads who were born in 1898 were some 1.0,000 short of the average registration of other years. But it must be remembered that in the one case we are dealing with the calendar year, and in the other with the financial year. In other words, the year which has just closed permitted of only five months&#39; registration. We may assume, therefore, that the lads who have not registered are gradually being ferreted out and obliged to register. Before many months have elapsed, we believe we shall catch up to the average registration of other years. </para>

I shall not delay the passage of the Bill while the Minister looks up the information, but I expect that he will ascertain for me how far these statements are true, and seek an opportunity when the Senate re-assembles to furnish the information if it is forthcoming. </para>

Quite recently, I have beai in both places. There is an indication of a slight improvement if one&#39;s eye is very critical, but not much more than that. I wish to ask the Honorary Minister if anything is to be done directly and immediately to restore these two magnificent buildings to something like the condition they were in when they were handed over to the Commonwealth ? </para>

            <para>- It is, I understand, a sort of means by which hard-pressed Labour members enjoy a little recreation on Saturday nights. Personally, I do not know what sort of a saloon it is, but I have no doubt that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie does. I should like to know what the Government are going to do with the various establishments which they have taken over in this indiscriminate way ? Do they intend to go into the licensing business, or to run pawnshops ? </para>

But I want to draw attention to this fact : that if the Government intend to take over whole blocks of city properties, the proper place in which to decide the matter is on the floor of Parliament, and it is not for a Minister, as if it was &#34; off his own bat,&#34; to go into a city, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O&#39;Malley</inline> did in Perth, and pick out a valuable block of property carrying a number of business houses, and, without any reference to Parliament at all, resume it. The Minister who was responsible for the big resumption in Perth is the gentleman who proposed to resume the very heart of Sydney. </para>

        <para class="block">I wish to inform <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> that the office of Government Secretary in the Northern Territory was in existence during the last Administration. I understand that there is merely a re-arrangement, and that the amount included in this Bill provides for the salary of that officer and three or four, subordinate officers in . the Department. He. occupies a position corresponding to that of the  Government Secretary in Papua. So far as a new appointment is concerned, that has only been rumour. I shall make inquiries, and let the honorable senator know when we meet again what information I have gathered with respect to the person who occupies the position, and his relation to the Administrator in the Territory. </para>
