While the matter was being discussed in the Senate, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould,</inline> an ex-President, asked that an interjection by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> be withdrawn, and immediately you turned to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> and . asked if he desired to have the expression withdrawn, and he having expressed that desire, the Senate had to take action because <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> had refused to withdraw the statement. When the dispute between <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> and the  Chairman  originated, I asked that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> be requested to withdraw a statement which he had applied to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae.</inline></para>

                        <para>- The  Chairman  informed me that he could not deal with two matters at the one time, and therefore he was of the opinion that the matter had not lapsed. It appears that the Chairman's ruling was upheld by the  President,  because what I should have asked was that the words of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> be taken down. My contention is that a similar answer should have been given to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> when he called upon <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> to withdraw a statement. It has become a. custom here that, when an honorable senator uses an expression which any other honorable senator considers offensive, the mere drawing of the Chair's attention to the use of the offensive language has generally brought about its withdrawal. </para>

                        <para>- Except, unfortunately, when I have asked for the withdrawal of a statement. The same rule of practice should invariably be applied. When I rose on the second occasion in Committee to ask for the withdrawal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen's</inline> statement, my request was ruled out of order because, according to the  Chairman,  the matter had passed ; and his ruling was upheld by the  President.  For that reason, I intend to vote for the motion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens.</inline> I did not think that the matter was of sufficient importance to follow up in Committee; but now that it has been taken in hand by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens,</inline> I think that we should endeavour to get established a system under which each senator will have to obey the same Standing Orders, and follow the same custom, and each side can reckon upon getting an absolutely fair deal. </para>

                    GOULD (New South Wales) [3.12].- There seems to be a reluctance on the part of honorable senators to discuss this matter, and I can well realize why that feeling exists. It is a very unpleasant and disagreeable duty for any one to take exception to a ruling from the Chair; but I put it to honorable senators on the other side : Is it not fair to maintain the actions of the  President  and  Chairman  as far as we can fairly and justly do so? Is it not in the interests of order, not only that decisions, from the Chair should be upheld, but that honorable senators should take whatever action they can to see that they, are upheld.

                        <para>- Very often the presiding officer occupies a very difficult position. I think that die sympathy of honorable senators ought at all times go out to the occupant of the Chair, and it is not conducive to the dignity of our proceedings, or the orderly conduct of business, for any honorable senators to say, " We do not quite agree with the ruling of the Chair, and we dissent. Our dissent will probably- be carried, and it will not matter anything to the Chair whether we do or not." A fair principle for honorable senators to follow is that, so long as they are satisfied that the presiding officer is acting fairly and honestly, it is their duty to uphold him, and not to attempt to belittle his position. </para>

                        <para>- I shall come to the question soon enough. I want honorable senators to realize that it is not fair to attempt to override a decision given by their presiding officer on such a matter as that which arose the other day. If some principle was at stake, or if a ruling had been laid down as to the way in which a certain matter ought to be dealt with, and which could be regarded as a precedent for the future, it would be a very different thing. Now, take the present case : The  Chairman  gave a decision on a point of order raised by a senator. The Committee was not satisfied with that decision, and the matter was referred to the  President,  who took pains to listen to every honorable senator who wished to speak ; and then pointed out that, according to his reading of the Standing Orders, and the statements made to him of what had taken place in Committee, he had no alternative but to uphold the decision of the  Chairman.  Let me assume that there w.as a mistake made there. I ask honorable senators whether, on a future occasion when any disorder in debate arose, they would be one whit worse off. The reasons which were given for the decision of the  Chairman,  must, I think, commend themselves to honorable senators. In the first place, the  Chairman  pointed out that, apart from the fact that the words were not taken down, there was a standing order requiring an objection to be taken to terms immediately, no such objection was taken. </para>

                        <para>- I can only judge from the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> proof. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> made a certain statement, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> said that it was not right, or was not correct. Then <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> uttered a few words, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> said that his statement was a deliberate falsehood. That is a monstrous thing altogether; but, of course, that matter has been dealt with. Then comes the question that certain senators wanted to get <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> to apologize. For what? Nobody has ever stated why an apology is required. I have never heard stated the special words to which exception has been taken. If honorable senators will take the trouble to read the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report, which I assume is absolutely correct, they will be at a loss to find out what disorderly words had been used by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen.</inline> I think that the  Chairman  dealt with the incident in the only way he possibly could. It is distinctly disorderly for any honorable senator to deliberately charge both the  Chairman  or the  President  with having shown favoritism to one side, as against the other side. I could understand some honorable senators saying to the presiding officer, "We think that you made a mistake " ; but for them to say that they are fighting to have both sides treated alike from "the Chair is distinctly out of order. Of course, we want both sides treated alike. I believe that our presiding officers use their best efforts in that regard. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> alluded to the exception that I took to a remark made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham,</inline> what action did the  President  take? He did not take any action on my complaint, but he turned to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> and asked, " <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> do you take exception to the words?" and when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> replied that he certainly did, then action was taken by the Chair. That distinctly showed that, at that time, there was not one rule being applied to one side, and another rule being applied to the other side. If honorable senators will only carry their memories back, they will realize that, under the Standing Orders, no other decision could have been arrived at. Let us assume, for the sake of argument, that a different decision had been given. There might never have been a complaint that there was some favoritism. But if a different decision had been given, though I might have been of opinion that it was wrong, and that it was not a fair thing to make such a charge, nevertheless I should have been inclined to uphold the ruling of the Chair. This is a small matter that might have been allowed to pass without such drastic action being taken. I can only assume that the action has been taken because there was at the time a certain amount of excitement and feeling. I hoped, however, that after a spell of a day or two that feeling would have been allayed, and that honorable senators would have recognised that it was best to let bygones be bygones. Honorable senators are, however, within their rights in taking this action. If it were not for the provision in the Standing Orders that a decision of the  President  is to have the effect of a standing order, perhaps it would not have been thought necessary to submit this motion of dissent. But even though a decision becomes, in effect, a standing order, what is the consequence of it? It only means that, in particular circumstances, in regard to a particular instance, a certain decision was given. There is nothing to bind the  President  in regard to any future decision. I am perfectly certain that, if disorder arose in the future, the  President  would give a ruling according to the circumstances of the case. In this instance the  President  had to give a ruling upon facts reported to him by the  Chairman  of Committees. At the time we had no other report before us. Since then we have had an opportunity of referring to the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report. </para>

                        <para>- Honorable senators will find from that report that there was really no reason to take this exception to the ruling of the  President.  I trust that honorable senators will realize that it is only fair and reasonable that they should maintain the decision of the  President,  even though they may not agree with it altogether, as long as they are satisfied that the decision was given honestly, and with the intention or dealing out impartial justice to both sides. Personally, I am very glad to bear my testimony to the fact that that has been the principle which- has actuated both the  President  and the  Chairman  of Committees ever since they have had the honour of occupying their present positions. </para>

                        <para>- I - I should like to be allowed to put the matter in my own way. -1 cannot see how we can do other than bring in the circumstances under which my ruling was objected to, though I do not desire to go back to settled matters any more than is absolutely necessary. The point was that the  President  was asked to give a ruling, lt is that ruling which we are now discussing. The point of order on which the ruling was required was raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> the gravamen of whose charge was that he was not allowed to make his objection in Committee on the only opportunity that he had. I know that honorable senators merely wish to deal with this matter in a fair way, and I would ask them to turn their minds back to what occurred in Committee. The objection taken by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> was to certain words that were used by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen.</inline> But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> is obviously in error when he says that he took the first opportunity afforded to him. If he had taken his objection at the right time, he would have taken it immediately <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> uttered the words of which he complained. But he did not do that. In the first instance, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> did not take his objection to the words of which he complained in the ordinary manner. It was after <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> had made a certain statement that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> rose to his feet and took objection to something which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> had said. I admit that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> did make that objection, and asked that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> should withdraw the words of which he complained. But he is in error in saying that he took the first opportunity of doing so. </para>

                        <para>- S - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> continues to interject, but his remarks do not alter the facts, as every honorable senator will see for himself, if he reads the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report - presuming the copy which he has is the same as was supplied to me. My recollection, and the report, leave it absolutely clear in my mind that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> did not take his objection at the proper time. I have only this .to say in conclusion - that I trust honorable senators will realize that unless the President's ruling is upheld, it will be necessary to alter the Standing Orders. In other words, if the ruling is disagreed with, the Standing Orders under which we are working cannot be maintained in their present form. </para>

It would be very awkward if, after an incident had been closed, an honorable senator was at liberty to demand that certain words, used, perhaps, a considerable time before, should be withdrawn. We should never be able to reach finality.

                        <para>- It is not a question of feeling. I do not think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe-,</inline> seeing that his position is entirely unassailed as far as the question now before us is concerned, need have intervened. My honorable friend, as  Chairman  of Committees, gave a ruling on Friday against which there was an appeal. You, sir, in the usual manner, in conformity with the Standing Orders, heard that appeal, which was dismissed. Upon that ruling, the present appeal to the Senate was made. That is the whole matter. I do not think, with all due. deference to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe,</inline> that his share in the business is at present in controversy. The whole question is simply whether your ruling, on the facts which were presented to you, is to be upheld. Upon the facts themselves, you had only the report that was presented to you by the  Chairman  of Committees. The words objected to were not taken down in writing. You had to act upon the report made by the high officer occupying the chair. That report was made to the highest officer in the Senate. Many, of us are not competent to form an opinion upon the facts at all. There is provided by the Standing Orders a method by which words which may be used in debate are to be taken down and placed" upon record. That course was not adopted in this instance. many of us are, therefore, entirely in §ie dark in dealing with the question, and coming to a decision upon it. Our knowledge of the course of events, the objections raised, and the order in which they followed or were dealt with we must accept from the  Chairman  of Committees. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe</inline> had no need to defend himself in the exercise of the duties of his official position. He must deal, and we must assume that he will deal, honestly and fairly as between honorable senators in the discharge of his duties. If we once permitted an inquiry into the facts presented to the Senate, and upon which the  President  gives his ruling, we should never know where we were. We must act upon the report of the facts communicated to the Senate by the  Chairman  of Committees. </para>

                        <para>- No; the  Chairman  of Committees may be wrong in his report as to the facts, but the Senate does not sit in judgment upon his report.  His  statement of the facts is that on which the  President  and the Senate act in debating the matter. We cannot in the Senate settle the difference of opinion as to the facts between the  Chairman  of Committees and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner.</inline> The question is whether the ruling of the  President  could be set aside, on the ground stated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens,</inline> that it is subversive of the privileges of honorable senators, and that it is contrary to the Standing Orders. I do not agree at all with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould's</inline> proposition that we must accept any ruling from the Chair. We may disagree with it, although we may fully believe that it was honestly and fairly given. It would be a sorry day for the Senate if we debated the ruling of the  President  on the ground that he displayed favoritism, or an absence of honesty and honour in the exercise of his duty. I disagree entirely with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline></para>

                <para class="block">Gould's proposition, and I say that it is no disrespect whatever to the Chair that any member of the Senate should challenge the ruling of the  President,  and elicit the opinion of honorable senators upon it. That does not involve a reflection upon the Chair, or an imputation of the honour of the  President  or of the  Chairman  of Committees. It is no foundation for a challenge of the ruling of the  President  or  Chairman  of Committees that he gave a preference to one or other side of the Senate. The expressions used by" <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> were, perhaps, susceptible to some such significance, but I do not think the honorable senator really meant that. He was Expressing merely such a sense of injustice as any defeated litigant in a Court of law may consider that he suffers from when a decision goes against him. I am sure that honorable senators agree with me that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> did not intend to impute to the  President  favoritism to one side or the other, or to one senator in preference to another. What is the question with which we have to deal ? It is - Is your ruling subversive ot the privileges of honorable senators, or contrary to the Standing Orders? If it is in accordance with the Standing Orders, and still subversive of the privileges of honorable senators, the remedy is to reform the Standing Orders. So that we may dismiss the first ground stated for the motion, namely, that the ruling is subversive of the privileges of honorable senators. On the point that it is not in conformity with the Standing Orders, let us consider what the ruling was. It was, in substance, that the  Chairman  of Committees was right in ruling that the time had gone by for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> or any other honorable senator to call upon <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> for the withdrawal of the language he used, assuming it to be unparliamentary and offensive. I have said that we are bound to accept the report of the  Chairman  as to what took place in Committee. </para>

                        <para>- We are not dealing with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen's</inline> statement. The honorable senator misunderstands the position. We are called upon to say whether the President's ruling was right, and it was founded upon the statement as to the facts presented to the Senate by the Chair- . man of Committees. The matter was put with great clearness by the Vice-President of the Executive. Council on Friday last. When a certain statement was made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen, Senator Rae,</inline> instead of calling for its withdrawal, as he might have done if he considered it offensive, took the law into his own hands, to use the words of the Vice-President of the Executive Council, and retaliated across the Chamber with an expression which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> regarded as grossly offensive, and the withdrawal of which he called for. The time had then passed, according to our Standing Orders, for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> to ask for the withdrawal of what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> had said, because, to again use the most appropriate expression of the Vice-President of the Executive Council, he had taken the law into his own hands, and had meted out the punishment which he thought fitted the offence against him. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> called for the withdrawal pf <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae's</inline> statement in retaliation. Even then, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae,</inline> according to the statement of the facts submitted to the Senate, might have been in a position to secure the withdrawal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen's</inline> statement by merely obeying the ruling of the  Chairman  of Committees. Instead of doing that he defied the Chair, and said he would not withdraw the statement which the  Chairman  of Committees called upon him to withdraw. That being so, you, sir, were sent for; the usual motion was put, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> was suspended for the- remainder of the siting. Then the business of the Committee was resumed, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> claimed that the language used by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> should be withdrawn. </para>

                        <para>- I am speaking of the facts as they have been presented to the Senate. I may' say that at this particular stage I was present in the chamber, and I know that the honorable senator wanted to make terms. Something was said about <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> first withdrawing what he had said, and then <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> would withdraw his statement, which was regarded as offensive. But the  Chairman  very properly ruled that he must deal with one thing at a time. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> wanted <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> to withdraw his statement before he would withdraw his own later statement. The  Chairman  objected to that - course being followed, and any one who has any regard for the Standing Orders and practice of Parliament must come to the conclusion which the  President  did in the circumstances, and on the facts, as presented by the  Chairman  of Committees, namely, that his ruling in the matter was perfectly right. When the Committee resumed, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> revived the matter at a stage when, under the Standing Orders, it was impossible to revive it in the way proposed, and impossible for any one to call upon <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> to withdraw anything he had said. The matter then came before the  President  again on the objection to that ruling. The Standing Orders are as clear as possible on the subject. We are asked to say whether the President's ruling was in accordance with the Standing Orders. Under standing order 413, offensive words are forbidden to be used, and under standing order 419, to which you, sir-, made reference, the objection to the use of offensive words must be taken when such words are used, and will not afterwards be entertained. If an honorable senator feels aggrieved by the use of language which he regards as offensive, his business in his own interests, and in the interests of the maintenance of good order in the Senate, is to at once ask for the withdrawal of the offensive language. If, instead of doing that, he takes the law into his own hands, by throwing a taunt or some offensive retort across the chamber, that disentitles him to call for the withdrawal of the provocative words previously used.I think that is sound sense. If a man who is insulted takes the law into his . own hands, and knocks the insulter down, he cannot very well afterwards ask the person who insulted him to withdraw his offensive expression. That would be adding insult to injury. The Vice-President of the Executive Council clearly explained that the moment when offensive words are used is the time when an application should be made for their withdrawal. If that application is not made, and, instead, retaliation is made, under our Standing Orders the time for asking for the withdrawal of the provocative language has passed. It is not our duty now to decide whether the  Chairman  of Committees has, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> or <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae,</inline> misstated the facts, but whether on the facts as he stated them the ruling of the  President  waS correct. The case in reality is a trivial one, but it deals with a matter of great importance, and that is the maintenance of order in the Senate, and, I think, to summarize, that we should dispose of this case by supporting the ruling of the  President. </para>

                    <para>. - It is just as well that we should have had this debate, because there is evidently some misconception in the minds of some honorable senators as to what the Standing Orders mean, and the. procedure which should be followed in such cases. I should like honorable senators who are disputing the President's ruling' to imagine what would have been his. position if he had accepted <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner's</inline> request. If at that stage lie had' called upon <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> to withdraw the words which were alleged to. be offensive, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> would have had only to decline to do so, and refer the  President  to standing order 419, and the  President  would then have found that he had taken a course which is contrary to the Standing Orders. </para>

                        <para>- I take the Standing Orders to mean that it is the honorable senator to whom offensive words are used who should raise the point of order. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> did not take that course. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> subsequently took a point of order ; but, granting that a point of order may be raised by an honorable senator to whom objectionable words are not used, the point of order was taken, in this case, at a . time when, under the Standing Orders, it could not be taken. Suppose that we grant that. The time when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> should have taken his objection was immediately after <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> made use of the words, but the former did not take exception . until after the  Chairman  had proposed to deal with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae.</inline> There were only two senators who were entitled to speak at that time - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> 'and any senator who rose to a point of order. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae's</inline> interjection, like every other interjection, was disorderly. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> had wished to do so at the rime, he could have raised a . point of order, notwithstanding <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae's</inline> interjection, but he did not do so. Even assuming that an honorable senator wishes to take the part of another senator, the only time to intervene is when the alleged offence takes place. I think, sir, that if we were to disagree with your ruling, 'we should be allowing our feelings to run away with' our judgment.. It should " be remembered that whatever the rulings from the Chair may be; ' they form the practice of the Senate. ' On this occasion, «ur feelings may be sympathetic towards Senators Rae and Gardiner, hut we should all vote, on the mere question of what is the plain reading of the standing order. </para>

                    <para>- As a general rule, and almost without question. When the Senate is in Committee, the  Chairman  is the judge, of questions of fact and points of order, and when his ruling is dissented from, our final authority is the  President.  Can it be denied that it is from the  Chairman  that the  President  has to take a report of the facts? Any departure from that plain rule would land us in absolute chaos. A reference from the  Chairman  to the  President  is almost in the character of a judicial proceeding. An Appeal Court does not take the report of the facts from the counsel on either side, from the litigants or witnesses on either side, but from the Court which is appealed against, and if there is any doubt on a question of fact, the Appeal Court refers, not to the litigant or the counsel, but to the Court below. I hope, sir, that- your ruling based on a report of facts from the  Chairman,  will always be upheld. In this case, the Chairman's report as to the facts was to a certain extent impugned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner.</inline> We have had comments made by the  Chairman  on the very question of facts which he reported to you, sir, and I submit that his narrative of the facts is absolutely accurate. At the time his ruling was about to be considered, he gave to the Committee a short narrative of the facts, and in his recapitulation of the facts to-day he was as plain and as emphatic as he was on Friday last, when he submitted his report from the Committee. The most casual reference to <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> shows that the point which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> has mentioned arose a very long time after <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> had used- certain, words, to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator. Rae</inline> objected. I suppose that the proceedings would occupy about a foot of space in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline></para>

                        <para>- It is not a question of time, but a question of the Standing Orders and their interpretation. What happened when. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> did intervene? I find that it was not on a point of order that he intervened the first time, but it was more in the nature of an interrogation. At that time he does not seem, according to the report, to have been very much troubled about a point of order. He seems to have been only troubled with ' a question as to where really the disorder was. If your ruling should be reversed, sir, the Senate will not know where it is until the Standing Orders in most important points have been overhauled and. changed. According to the rules of debate, if any senator thinks that an expression used by another senator is disorderly or offensive, exception must be taken at the time. Therefore, so far as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner's</inline> contention can have any bearing on the matter, I submit that no case has been made out against your ruling. On a. previous occasion, I took objection to a remark made by an honorable senator,  f  thought that it was objectionable,' whether it was applied generally or particularly. I drew the Chairman's attention to the; exact words which had been used, and the whole matter was settled in about ten minutes. If any honorable senators on one side or the other' do not take advantage of the protection which the Standing Orders confer upon them, they cannot complain afterwards with any reason. I 'do appeal to the Senate that on a clear reading of the standing order, and the clear narrative of the facts from the  Chairman,  the ruling of the  President  should be upheld, otherwise a reign of chaos and disorder may begin. </para>

I wish to refer to the Chairman's statement that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> raised his objection to a remark some time after the opportunity for doing so had gone by. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has raised the point that no one had the right to object except myself, as the senator aggrieved by the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> as they applied to me only. </para>

                        <para>- Whether that is correct or not, I do not know. On numerous occasions, I have heard honorable senators on the other side object to a remark, even when it was not addressed, to them personally. I think every honorable senator will admit that when an interjection or a statement has been deemed offensive by a senator, without in any way asking that the words should be taken down, generally the senator concerned has withdrawn the words, and, in some cases, apologized for the use of them. In fact, during  the  time that I have been a member of the Senate, I have never heard a request made that words should be taken down. When, on numerous occasions - because interjections are frequently made in this Chamber, and sometimes we get a pretty hard shot in upon one another - requests have been made for the withdrawal of words, the common practice has been for the honorable senator aggrieved to take exception to the language' used, and to ask for a withdrawal.  The  request for withdrawal and-  the  apology have succeeded each other without any formality in the nature of the taking down of the words. If custom makes law, the custom-made-law in this Senate has been for the objection to be followed by the withdrawal forthwith. </para>

                        <para>- My objection was taken instantly. In fact, it was the electric way in which it was taken which led to the trouble. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe,</inline> in making his statement to-day - and -I believe that hearted in perfect good faith- stated that the reason why he refused to take notice of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner's</inline> point of order was, not that the time had expired for taking objection, but that he had not . time to deal with more than one point of order at a time. He was then dealing with the altercation between <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> and myself, -and he held that that claimed precedence' over <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner's</inline> point of order. But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe</inline> - unintentionally, no doubt - has since - raised the point, that the time had expired within which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> might have acted. At the time, however, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe,</inline> as'  Chairman  of Committees, simply said that he could not deal with two points of order at once. Consequently, there was no attempt to deal with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner's</inline> point. It appears to me, therefore, that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> was jockeyed out of his rights altogether - first, by not having an opportunity of raising his point of order ; and, secondly, by the  Chairman  stating that hjs objection could not be raised when he raised it, because if that were permitted, finality could never be reached. </para>

I should be very sorry, indeed, if any honorable senator thought that I would attempt to overrule a decision, either of the  President  or the  Chairman  of Committees, owing tn any feeling of that kind. I do not think that we are such a lot of children as to desire anything of the kind, or even to allow our judgment to be warped, in order to achieve a personal end. As far as I am concerned, I have paid the penalty for what I did. Whether I deserved it ornot,I am perfectly satisfied. I have paid the price, and feel that I got good value for my money. </para>

At any rate, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> did raise the point. It appears to me that if there is any one against whom we should complain in this case it is the lawyers who have intervened in the debate, and who have befogged the matter with technicalities. The three honorable senators who happen to be lawyers who have spoken on this question have, I think, justified the general distrust of the community in the expensive proceedings in which members of their profession are employed. </para>

The  Speaker  of the Legislative Assembly had listened to a report from the  Chairman  of Committees concerning an incident in consequence of which an honorable member had been ordered out for not obeying the  Chairman.  The  Speaker  listened to three other honorable members, each of whom gave his version of what occurred. Without imputing any deliberate unfairness to the  Chairman  of Committees, or insinuating that he had not fairly and completely stated the position, according to the best of his ability, the  Speaker,  after listening to the statements of the other honorable . members, said that on the evidence submitted to him, he did not feel inclined to uphold the Chairman's decision ; and accordingly he gave an order that the honorable member who had offended should be admitted without being called upon to withdraw or to apologize for anything that had occurred. Yet, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger would hold that the report of the  Chairman  must be accepted without question. </para>

I claim that we should have here a democratic" procedure as well as a democratic policy, and that therefore the decisions of the  President  or the  Chairman  of Committees should always be open to review. If honorable senators think that they are not in accordance with the best interests of procedure in the Senate, they should be at liberty to express their opinion quite irrespective of the " dignity of the Chair," or any other consideration.

I was present in the chamber during the whole of the incident that occurred on Friday. I have no hesitation in saying that the Leader of . the Opposition, as usual, proved himself a very clever tactician. I say that unhesitatingly. He uttered some of the most .insulting language that a man could use, but he did so in a fashion that is practically all his own. If I remember rightly - and I think I am speaking correctly - he practically charged <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> with being an anarchist. </para>

                        <para>- I entirely agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> in hoping that the day will come when it will be recognised that the senator against whom a charge is made is the proper person to take exception to it. My own opinion is that the Standing Orders make it abundantly clear that when exception is taken to a statement made by an honorable senator, it must be taken at the time ; and I say without hesitation that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner-</inline> did not avail himself of the proper opportunity. It is not a bit of use trying to argue that he did object to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen's</inline> statement at the time when he should have done so. If he had taken objection to the statement, then T presume that the  Chairman  of Committees would have compelled <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> to make a withdrawal. But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> waited until <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> had been called in question for his refusal to withdraw language which he had used. It was after <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> had refused to obey  the  Chairman  that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> roseto his feet, and asked for the withdrawal of words used by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen.</inline> I an* quite satisfied that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> displayed his usual agility in procedure in reference to what occurred.. </para>

                    <para>. - It is a pity that several honorable senators have imported into the discussion of this motion matters which are not relevant  to  it,, and which, so far from throwing any light upon it, have clouded the issues, and, to some extent, created a false issue. It is most regrettable that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> should have tried to induce the Senate to believe that the motion is a personal . matter between you, sir, and those who. are moving; to disagree with your ruling. On several occasions since I have been a member 'of the Senate motions have been submitted to disagree with the ruling of the  President,  but on no occasion until to-day have I heard it suggested that there was anything personal in the matter, or anything more than a desire to have the question at issue settled in a manner satisfactory to the Senate  and  to the  President.  I can imagine that it. would be of the greatest possible advantage to a  President  or  Chairman  of Committees to have a question referred from their decision to the whole Senate, which,, after all, must be the final arbiter of the conduct of its affairs, and so have a decision recorded which would guide them in their action in the future. I think that you,, sir, would be the last to take any motion of this kind as personal between yourself and honorable senators moving in this direction,, and you would be the last to accuse me of anything personal in the action I have taken. It is also exceedingly regrettablethat <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe,</inline> as  Chairman  of Committees, should have taken up the attitude of threatening the Senate with all' sorts of disaster if we carried this motion. He  says  that if we do so our StandingOrders must go into the melting-pot, and we must create an entirely new procedure- </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">I entirely differ from that line of argument. The  Tightness  or wrongness of your decision in this matter rests upon the Standing Orders as they are, and the decision of the Senate will be an interpretation of the existing Standing Orders, and will not create any necessity for new Standing Orders. With this reference to arguments which have been brought forward, I desire to again briefly state the case which is put before you. Let me here say that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> contended that all you need to guide you, and all, in fact, that you can be guided by in this matter, is the statement of facts as put before you by the  Chairman  of Committees. I hold that that contention, is entirely wrong. Otherwise, why does the  President  ask for, and patiently listen to, other honorable senators if he is bound to be guided only by the statement of facts as put before him by the  Chairman  of Committees? It would be farcical for you, sir, to allow any other honorable senator to discuss a matter reported to you from Committee if, when the  Chairman  of Committees had stated the facts, you were bound to assume that his statement was correct. I admit that you must attach a great deal of weight to any statement by the  Chairman  of Committees, but, like other human beings, the  Chairman  of Committees is fallible, and, in an atmosphere of excitement such as arises when a disagreement occurs between honorable senators, there is considerable confusion, and any member of the Senate may be excused if his recollection of what takes place is not consecutive or very clear. It is because of the value of a consensus of opinion as to what takes place that it is desirable that you should hear, not only the statement of facts from the  Chairman  of Committees, but from other honorable senators as well. But I do not intend to rely upon the statement of facts by any honorable senator. I rely upon the indisputable statement of facts as taken down by the impartial recorders of our proceedings. I believe that it is essential, if we are to have our Standing Orders fairly carried out, and our rights and privileges safeguarded, that we should clearly lay down our procedure. Senators Pearce and Henderson have put forward the idea that the only person entitled to take objection to the use of offensive words is the honorable senator to whom the words have been used. They have cited the Standing Orders in support of that contention. But I point out that it is the duty of the  President  and </para>

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Chairman</inline>
                    of Committees to maintain order, and prevent the use of insulting or offensive words, if they hear them, without waiting for their attention to be called to them by any honorable senator.

                <para>How can an Act of Parliament call attention to the use of offensive words with regard to it? How could the Parliament sitting in Perth call attention .to the use' here of offensive words against it? The merest examination of the contention puts it out of court at once. We know, also, that over and over again in the Senate an honorable senator who has not been referred to has called attention to the use of offensive words. I direct the attention of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger to the fact that when he says that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner's</inline> calling attention to the matter was merely by way of interjection, the report shows that when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> called attention to the matter it was also merely, by way of interjection.

I may briefly go over what occurred. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> made a speech in Committee on a clause of the Navigation Bill. In the course of that speech, he made some reflections upon the magistracy of the country generally, and stated that, although he was one of the unpaid magistrates himself, speaking generally, they were not a very admirable crowd. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> followed <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae,</inline> and, in his usual very clever way, immediately twisted that into a statement by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> that he was in favour of anarchy, or something to that effect.

                        <para>- It has everything to do with the question as to what were the facts, and whether we should allow the ruling which is now taken exception to to be regarded as a precedent. I am not going into the question of whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> was guilty of an offence. I have already dealt with that. I have said that I have no complaints whatever to make with regard to the way in which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> was treated. I consider that the  Chairman  of Committees extended every courtesy and leniency to him. My complaint is, as I have stated before, that the same rule was not applied to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> who admittedly offended <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> by the utterance of words regarded by him as objectionable. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> said that he was ready to withdraw his statement if the  Chairman  of Committees called upon him to do so, and I believe he would have done so. </para>

When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> has endured the punishment put upon him by the Senate for his offence1, no further complaint could be levelled against him ; but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> was not made to obey the standing order, nor was he subjected to any punishment, because, as <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> shows, he was not asked to withdraw his statement. That is where the ruling  of the  Chairman,  in the first .place, was wrong, sir, and your action, in upholding his ruling, consequently, was also wrong. We want the thing to be on a proper footing. If it is complained that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> did not call attention to the incident at the proper time, let me remind honorable senators that the whole thing occurred in a few moments. </para>

                        <para>- Because the  Chairman  refused to open the case after his attention was called by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> to the remark of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen. His</inline> attention was called to the remark by the very fact that- the incident took place. Even while it was taking place, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> pointedly drew attention to it. Immediately after the incident had closed, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline> Millen had risen to. continue his speech, what happened ? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> thought either that some action would be taken, or that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> would voluntarily withdraw the remark; so he sat quietly for a little while to see what action <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> or the  Chairman  intended to take. He then rose and drew attention to the remark of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> and yet nothing has been done. It has been stated that attention to a remark must be drawn the moment that it is used. Now, a case occurred- very recently, where a senator drew attention to certain words days after they were .used, and no exception was taken; even by the senator against whom the. action was directed. We have been  given all kinds of fancy readings of the standing order. Since I have been a member of the Senate, I have never heard a request made that words complained of be taken down. </para>

                        <para>- Perhaps. I have submitted this motion for two reasons. As stated in the motion, the President's ruling, if not reversed, will be subversive of the- due protection of senators. I do not think it is desirable that they should be deprived of their due protection ; but they undoubtedly will be if this decision be allowed to stand, because, just as happened in this case, an honorable senator on this or the other side, may take exception to what another senator has said about him. He may think the statement grossly offensive, highly insulting, or absolutely injurious to him, either as a private citizen or as a member of Parliament, and he may resent it accordingly. As soon as he has resented the remark, he will be hauled up, and, if he refuses to go on the stool of repentance, or to eat humble pie, and apologize to everybody all round, he will be punished, simply because he has. resented a remark which is grossly offensive or insulting to him; and then, after he has been punished, the original offender will escape scot-free. Consequently, the ruling will be subversive, as my motion says, of the due protection of senators. I think it will not be disputed that it is contrary to both the spirit and letter of the standing order, which provides that an offensive statement, when attention is called to its use, must be withdrawn. Attention was indisputably called to the remark of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> at the time it was made. The very interjection of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> that it was a falsehood called attention to the remark. </para>

                        <para>- I have no more to add. 1 have stated, as fairly as 1 could, the case in favour of the motion. 1 believe that the ruling of the  President,  if upheld, will be subversive of the due protection of senators, and I do r.ot think that, even bv a straining of the Standing Orders, it can be construed as being in accordance with them, because they are framed to nf? rd senators due protection from offensive or insulting remarks, or expressions or misrepresentations which may be regarded as offensive. If the ruling of the  President  is to remain, then senators will not have that protection which, I take it, is intended to be afforded to them, both by the spirit and the letter of the Standing Orders. I commend my motion to honorable senators, and 1 hope that it will be decided entirely on its merits. </para>

                        <para>- There are one or two remarks which I wish to make before the question is put. 1 do not think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> meant to apply to myself the remark that honorable senators on the other side of the chamber- are treated differently. I think that I can pass over that remark, because I do not believe that it was intended in the sense in which it would generally be taken. There is no reason why I should take offence at honorable senators generally disagreeing with a ruling, and I trust that no such impression exists. The Chair may, in the opinion of honorable senators, make a mistake, and they are quite justified in taking exception to a ruling. The Chair, T  take it, considers the questions which are raised, and decides on the statements of fact, and the representations made by various honorable senators, lt has' been stated that the practice has not been strictly followed of asking that the words complained of be taken down. I admit that the Standing Orders have not been followed, because the practice has been that, when' an expression has been used which has been deemed to be unparliamentary, some honorable senator has risen to a point of order, and called the attention of the Chair to the fact that unparliamentary words have been used, and the Chair has asked the honorable senator using the expression to withdraw it. On the other hand, when it has been a personal matter, it has been the practice for the honorable senator who took exception to say that the expression was offensive to him. I should like to point out that an expression mav be used which may be offensive to one honorable senator and not offensive to any other honor.nb'e senator. Consequents, an honorable senator who thought a remark offensive, has risen and said that the remark was offensive, and asked that it be withdrawn, and invariably it has been withdrawn. So far as this general debate is concerned, a great deal of extraneous matter has been dragged in. I have nothing to add to the ruling I gave on Friday. I have read very carefully the report of the ruling, and I cannot see that, on the facts which were put before me at the time, or the statements made by honorable senators who were invited to speak, there is anything I can add to what I then said. </para>

                    <para>. - Since we last dealt with this matter,I have had inquiries made as to the necessity for the amendment of the House of Representatives. I am informed, hv responsible officers, that the failure of seamen to join ships at the last moment is unfortunately very common, especially in the case of foreign ships ; and that the consequence is the engagement of substitutes from boardinghouse keepers, and others, which brings about serious abuses. Seamen quite commonly fail to join for some trivial reason, or, perhaps, through indifference ; and there is room for suspicion that, in some cases, where men are eligible, dummies are sometimes put up to sign an agreement with the intention that, after the ship has obtained her clearance, other men who are not eligible to sign, such as deserters from other ships in port, or incompetent men, may be supplied at the last moment to take their place. That practice gives an opportunity for the crimp to pursue his objectionable calling. It is quite true that this clause does not impose a penalty on crimping, hut it does penalize those who are practically encouraging crimping. It is absolutely necessary that there should be some penalty for failure to join a ship. The penalty proposed is a maximum one, anil would only be imposed in very glaring cases. As, however, there seems to be some feeling that the penalty is rather too high as compared with other penalties in the Mill,  1  am prepared to move an amendment upon the House of Representatives' amendment to provide that the penalty should be , £10 instead of  £20.  But I ask the Committee to agree to the amendment made by the House of Representatives, assuring honorable senators that I am satisfied, as the result of inquiries that  1  have made, that the amendment is as much in the interests of the seamen as of ship-owners, because it will help to make crimping more difficult, and will penalize those who allow themselves to be the employes of the crimp. </para>

                    <para>.- I am glad that the discussion which took place last week has had the result of inducing the Minister to propose that the' penalty shall be reduced from <inline font-style="italic">?20 to j?io.</inline> But, nevertheless, I do not think that the clause is going to have the effect that the Minister desires. Personally, I think that we ought to have stringent provisions against men who enter into contracts which they fail to keep. But I point out that this matter has been under the consideration of the Imperial authorities for a considerable time, and that the decision arrived at so far is that, in the opinion of the Board of Trade, it is inadvisable to make a breach of a civil agreement a criminal act. That is really the point. The objection to the penalty in this case is that it does make criminal what is really a civil offence. The Act passed in Great Britain in  1906  provides' that when a seaman fails to join his ship, the master shall retain his certificates and return them to the superintendent. The superintendent is to report to the Board of Trade, and the man will not be permitted to ship in another vessel until the Board of. Trade allow him to do so. That, I think, is a better mode of punishment than fining a man a sum which, in all probability, he will never be able to pay, with the consequence that he will have to go to gaol. </para>

                        <para>- What I said on Friday was that the position taken up by the Board of Trade was the better one. Even in the agreement between- the shipowners and the seamen, it is provided that if a man fails to join his ship, the matter shall be reported, and the man is then suspended from his union. That is our present procedure. Another part of the section of the Merchant Shipping Act dealing with this matter relates to allotment notes, or advance notes. We have abolished advance notes in relation to agreements made in Australia, and 1 am not sure whether, when a seaman engages in Australia with the condition that he is to be paid elsewhere, we can enforce any penalty. We are now dealing with the case of a man who refuses to join his ship,  01  who wilfully misses it, or is guilty of misconduct in relation to joining ; and the British Act provides that, in such a case the superintendent shall keep the seaman's papers until the matter has been determined. If that were done here, the seaman could not ship in any port of Australia until his case had been dealt with by the Minister. </para>

                        <para>- It all comes back to the old position. We want men to have a sense of their responsibility and to realize what the signing of agreements entails, and we do not want to give encouragement to the practice of breaking agreements, because we say that that practice gives the crimp his opportunity. It is always in such cases that the crimp comes in. The evidence taken before the Royal Commission shows that crimps actually get seamen to enter into agreements with the intention of inducing them to break them at the last moment, in order to afford them an opportunity of supplying other men. This penalty will deter men from lending themselves to that practice. I ask the Committee to agree to the amendment of the House of Representatives ; and when we come to the next amendment I shall be prepared to ask the Committee to reduce the penalty from£20 to £10. </para>

                    <para>. - I have listened patiently to the reasons put forward by the Minister for the insertion of this sub-clause and penalty, and I do not think that the amendment of the House of Representatives would prevent crimping at all. Seeing that a seaman would probably have no goods and chattels, there would probably be as good a chance of recovering the penalty if it were £100, instead of £20. It is very hard to impose a penalty upon a man who refuses to go to sea in a ship because he considers her unseaworthy. The whole question hinges on the words " reasonable cause." </para>

                        <para>- In reply to an interjection, the Minister said that an expert would decide whether a ship was fit to go to sea or not. I am in the trade, and I remember pointing out that a certain steamer was unfit to go to sea, and a fireman came ashore from that ship half -an-hour before she left the port.  His  substitute never returned. He was scalded to death before the ship was out one hour. Experts had definitely stated that that ship was seaworthy, both before and after the occurrence ; and under this Bill a man who came ashore in such circumstances, and who would probably lose his life if he did not do so, might be subjected to a penalty of £20. That does not say much for expert opinion. I say that if a man believes that his life will be in danger on any ship, he should have the right to say that he will not go to sea -in her. With <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie,</inline> I do not believe in making the breaking of a civil agreement a criminal offence. I shall vote against the amendment of the House of Representatives. I believe that, in regard to the preservation of life, and in the interests of seamen and passengers, the Bill as it left this Chamber was a good measure; but it has come back from another place a complete wreck, and is absolutely useless, so far as the interests of seamen are concerned. No proper consideration was given to these amendments in another place. Their discussion was confined to about half-a-dozen honorable members ; and almost every amendment, no matter in whose interests it was proposed, was accepted in order to get the Bill through. I hope the Committee will disagree with this amendment, though I am not altogether in favour, of the amendment proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie.</inline> I think it is an improvement on the proposal of the Minister. </para>

With respect to a seaman leaving a ship because she is unseaworthy, an amendment carried in another place provides -  if a British ship is "unseaworthy a seaman or apprentice belonging to her shall not be deemed to have committed a breach of his agreement by reason of his having refused to sail in her while she is unseaworthy ; and any seaman or apprentice so refusing may claim his discharge unless the ship is made seaworthy within a reasonable time.

                        <para>- I am not bringing them into the discussion, unless the honorable senator's reference is to seamen who desert their ship. The question is whether we can have more confidence in the opinion of surveyors than in the opinion of individual seamen. If we were to allow an. "individual seaman to determine w whether ;a. ship was seaworthy or not, every seaman, .would be able to please himself as to whether he sailed in a ship or not. A vessel. "might be the most seaworthy ship in the ..world, and all a man desiring to leave her would have to say would be that, in his opinion, she was not seaworthy. </para>

                        <para>- Provision is made for that to be done. No seaman should be in a position, by merely saying that a ship is unseaworthy, to refuse to sail in her. Such a question might be decided by some skilled authority. It is true that a skilled authority might make a mistake, because of human fallibility j but it is also true that the loss of a ship may not be attributable to her being in an unseaworthy condition. </para>

It would, in my opinion, be very much better to adhere to the Bill to accept the definition of an offence and provide for a penalty. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> ' says that it may not be possible to recover the penalty. That is so; but the seaman would have staring him in the face his liability to a penalty, and that might make him keep his agreement. </para>

                        <para>- - We have a general Act dealing with these matters, and, where penalties are provided for, they may be recovered by distress, or failing that, the offender is liable to imprisonment for varying periods, according to the fine imposed. The suggestion of the Minister that the penalty in this case should be reduced from <inline font-style="italic">£20</inline> to;£io may, or may not, be a wise one, but I point out that the penalties generally provided for in this Bill are very much less than those provided for in the case  of  similar offences under the Merchant Ship-  ping Act, or in previous drafts of thisBill. </para>

When we look to an honorable senator for guidance in this matter, it is unfair that he should refer us to one portion, and not to the whole, of the provisions of the section referred to. Shipping people have pointed out that the penalties provided in this Bill are very small. They fear that they will have very much difficulty in maintaining discipline because of the reduction of the penalties, and now some honorable senators are proposing to further reduce them. </para>

                        <para>- Just so. I have not a very strong opinion as to whether the penalty in this case should be reduced from <inline font-style="italic">£20</inline> to ^10, but I do wish to see something done to make men realize the gravity of the offence of breaking their engagements. A ship is compelled to carry a certain complement of men. The master has engaged all the seamen necessary. The vessel is ready to go to sea, and, at the last moment, several men refuse to go on board. The master is then dependent on the crimp to supply him with men to replace those who left the ship at the last moment, or, in the alternative, to hang up the ship at a cost of, perhaps, ^200 or ^300 a day until he can in a regular way secure men to replace those who have deserted. Honorable senators may have no sympathy with a particular class, but they are here to do what is fair between all classes, and if we find that an offence is committed which places a person at a serious disadvantage, it is our duty to take steps to prevent the commission of such offences, and a penalty being entailed upon people who ought not to suffer a penalty. It is reasonable that the offence dealt with in this clause should be marked in such a way as to deter men from committing it. </para>

The honorable senator has accused me of playing into the hands of the crimp, and' I want to show that .the occupation of the crimp will be gone,1 under this Bill. I come now to another point. When this Bill comes into operation, every man who goes to sea must have :a certificate. It is not a matter of putting any Tom, Dick, or Harry on board a 'ship. The Minister stated that I had mentioned only part of the punishment provided in such a case under the Merchant Shipping Act. Section 65 of the Merchant Shipping Act of 1906 is divided into two sub-sections. The first sub-section deals with the case of men who have been given advance notes, and who desert owing the advance notes. Under this Bill, such a case could not occur, because we have done away with advance notes. The second sub-section of section 65 of the Merchant Shipping Act is, but for the fact that I provide for a reference from the superintendent to the Minister, instead of from the superintendent to the Board of Trade, practically identical with British law. Sub-section (1) of section 65 of the Act of 1906 reads - </para>

They would have as much freedom, and as much space to get about in, and probably be as well fed, except that they would not be earning wages. </para>

                        <para>-  1  am still of the opinion that nothing like justice will be done .to alleged offending seamen unless we either reduce the penalty to a minimum, or strike out the clause, and substitute something different, because we cannot amend the Judiciary Act. The Minister's proposal to reduce the penalty from <inline font-style="italic">£20</inline> to ;£io is altogether insufficient. If be would agree to accept a penalty of <inline font-style="italic">£2,</inline> I should not mind trusting 40s. worth of discretion to a magistrate. Beyond that, I should like every man to have the right to object to his case being tried by summary jurisdiction. </para>

                        <para>- He has Buckley's chance of appealing anyhow, because the average man has not the money with which to appeal. I know that I had to be content -with one loss, without risking another. The average seaman is not a man with a college education ; but, like myself, and  a  few others, he has had to go to work at an early age, and, consequently, he does npt know the intricacies of the law, and cannot avail himself of the opportunity for defence as persons in a high social scale can. I want to protect the sailor from the absolutely savage and inconsiderate way . in which he is treated when hauled before the average magistrate, paid or unpaid. I have no confidence in either section of them. The average magistrate takes the word of the master of the ship or the prosecutor, who, in the first case, can generally afford to employ a lawyer. And any man with common humanity in him - at any rate, any man . with a consciousness of the wav in which his class has been ground down and ill-treated - must have felt his blood boil as he has read the press reports of numerous instances where, on the most trumpery evidence, the average seaman has been fined and convicted. This is simply a scandal, which should have aroused the indignation of this and other Parliaments years ago. Sometimes seamen are sentenced to long -terms of imprisonment, to be served in prison until the ship is ready to sail. </para>

                        <para>- They will not take ariy analysis. If a majority of the men decide that the sheep are wet, they may cease to shear them, but if one individual finds fault, with the decision of the majority, because he believes that the sheep are still sufficiently wet to be injurious to his health, and abstains from shearing them, he cannot be discharged. If a sailor has what he deems to be reasonable cause for not joining his ship, his statement of the cause ought to be sufficient. </para>

                        <para>-  Yes, sufficient for him to cancel his engagement. There is nothing more important to the average person than his life. If a man honestly believes at the last moment, even though his belief may be deemed to be founded on a superstition, that if he goes to sea the ship will probably be lost, I reckon that he should have a chance to get out of his bad bargain. But this clause provides that he shall not get out of that bad bargain except by forfeiting £20. Let me remind the Minister that for a very much more serious offence - one which might endanger the safety of the ship, and even the lives of the crew or passengers - a man may be fined only ten days' wages. </para>

                        <para>- On some future occasion, when another Government is in power - as in all likelihood will be the case some day - and proposes to adjourn to attend a social function, if I objected, I should be met at once with the statement that a Labour Government acted in the same way under similar circumstances. I do not see why the business of the country should be put off for the sake of allowing honorable senators to attend a social function. This abuse ought to be checked'. What have we to do with the society life of this country? We are a body of men sent here to try to frame laws which will bring about such a state of affairs as will completely excise society life as we know it. We look upon people who represent society as parasites. That is my position as a Labour man. I say that the very existence of these people, with their wealth, is to a great extent responsible for any poverty that we have in the country. No elevation of the masses can take place here or elsewhere unless the rich are called upon to suffer in some way. </para>

I do not think it would matter two straws to me if I had a million ; I should still be against the system which produces millionaires. But for that system, there would be no such society functions. Who will be at this ball ? With the exception of a few members of Parliament, invited because of their public position, the whole of the people present will belong to the smart set, the rich people, who have large possessions and who have the. masses in their power. I am speaking now wholly and solely as a member of the Labour party. We are here as a party to secure, if we can, a readjustment of social conditions, and to try to bring about a more equal distribution of the wealth of the country. It is our work to eliminate poverty. I am one who believes that that cannot be done without depriving the rich of a very large proportion of the possessions which they now have. I object to doing anything which will in the slightest degree countenance these functions. I think the question is a most serious one. Indeed, the more </para>

It has been hanging, like Mahomet's coffin, between heaven and' earth. I look upon it as -.». very old friend.

                        <para>- I am firmly of opinion that we ought not to permit foolish social functions to interfere with the performance of our public duties. Some honorable senators  may  say that it really does not matter if those honorable senators who are away attend our sittings' or not. Probably that is, to a certain extent, correct. But it .appears to me that, in this, as in a great many other things, it is the first step mat tells. There is an old Latin verse to the effect that the way to the lower regions is quick and easy. Every political party is in danger of degeneracy. </para>

                        <para>- Yes,  every  party and every individual. Those of us who are students of history must be familiar with the rise, progress, and declension of various kinds of political and social ideas. I can remember very well when I became an active participant in the Labour movement twenty or thirty years ago, how we looked upon those social functions in which some honorable senators now seek to engage. One of the things to which we were particularly averse was the society idea as allied with politics. Indeed, we considered that society, as it is generally understood, was nothing but a combine or trust organized, not only to maintain -the privileges which it already possesses, and which assist in a very large measure in plundering other portions of the people, but to extend those privileges ; and we conceived in those days - probably we were wrong - that if we could -strike a blow at the society idea, we should at least have taken one step in the right direction towards bringing about a new state of affairs. During my connexion  with politics, I have seen no reason to alter my opinion. The qualification for a place in society is not wisdom, or learning, or good character, or anything other than one thing.- The one qualification for entrance to society is the possession of good red gold, or its equivalent. Holding, as I do, that wealth can only be achieved, and that the rich' can only exist because of the poor, I hold that anything which tends to bolster up society ' or to assist it in carrying on its war against the common people - because that is really what is taking place every hour of the day, and every week of the year - is something to which- we, -as a reform party, ought to be consistently opposed. Some honorable senators may say that, being legislators, we ought, if invited, to attend a function given by the Governor-General, who is the representative of the King, and one of the principal political factors in Australia. But I do not really see what we have to do with the Governor-General. We are sent here to try to bring about a better state of affairs for the great mass of the people of this country. Notwithstanding the great prosperity of Australia, there are many in our midst who are strangers to all the luxuries, and not a few of the common comforts of life. We have people who labour under serious disadvantages in every sense of the term. Our business is to try to evolve a state of society that will improve matters and place those who are now on a low social level in a better and higher sphere of life. I do  not think that a war of this kind - for it really is a war - can be helped by assisting at functions such as the one on account of which it is now proposed to stay the proceedings of the Senate. </para>

                        <para>- I should not have the slightest objection to coming back.  1  think we should sit until the business of the country is finished in a workman-like manner. But I know that the majority of the Senate would not be* with me in that. As Christmas approaches, they will be in a hurry to get away, and will be disinclined to give consideration to business. I have bad to complain, on a number of occasions, about the scant discussion that the Estimates receive. The probability is that my complaints will have to be made again this year. We vote away millions of money with very little consideration. It is a most unfortunate, fact that Parliament has little or no power over the spending of money. The whole control seems to have centred itself in the hands of the Government. Parliament is practically impotent. Of course, honorable members of the Opposition may think that that is as it ought to be, but I have a different opinion. I think that Parliament ought to be supreme. I hold that ordinary members of Parliament have as great a responsibility to the country as have the members of the Cabinet. They should be given every opportunity to criticise the administration, and to keep their eyes upon the expenditure. I do not wish to take up the <inline font-style="italic">role</inline> of a Cassandra, but I can see that there are financial rocks ahead. The time is rapidly approaching when whatever Government may be in power, whether a Labour or a Conservative Government, financial trouble will be knocking at their door. Honorable senators, instead of indulging in society pleasures; in which, but for their official position many of them would have nothing whatever to do- instead of being like moths fluttering round the society candle - should be devoting themselves assiduously to the business of the country. They' should be devising ways and means to keep the ship off the rocks which undoubtedly lie ahead. I know that some honorable senators on both sides say, " Do not worry, everything will come out all right. Possess your soul in patience and we shall come out right, as we have always done before." </para>

Some other honorable senators seem to waste their great talents and energies in trying to prevent the Government doing anything, and the honorable senator, who, by interjection, referred to my absence, is probably the chief offender, not only in this chamber, but in the whole Parliament. I know of no member of this Parliament who is so consummate an artist at applying the brake to the wheels of progress as is the honorable senator who occupies the distinguished position of Leader of the Opposition in the Senate. </para>

                        <para>- It is business of a kind which cannot be transacted here. It must be transacted on a polished floor to the strains of music, and we have neither one nor the other here. I may take this opportunity of referring very' shortly to what I conceive to be the perilous times ahead of the Legislatures of the Commonwealth. I have pointed to the. probability of a financial debacle. I believe it is coming; it is imminent, and it is. inevitable. Our Customs revenue is leaping and bounding, and I do not know of a similar revenue being received in any civilized community. Why is . this the case? It is because, instead of having a Protective Tariff, we have a revenue Tariff. As any one who has studied the subject knows, a revenue Tariff is a modern instrument of torture. Something which squeezes the last drop out of the poorest members of the community, which was originally devised to save the rich from taxation, and which is now continued, to my intense disgust, by a party that was sent here to look after the interests of the poor. The flowing river of revenue is very likely soon to become a trickle like the Cotter River at Yass- Canberra. Instead of flowing perennially like that noble stream, the Snowy River, it is likely soon to become a chain of mud-holes, with more mud than water. Our exports are falling off by millions. I think we shall probably be  ^£20,000,000  short in our exports this year, whilst, as every one knows, our imports' are increasing. If we take  , £15,000,000  off the income of the people of Australia they must spend less, the Treasury must get less, and the Customs revenue, instead of going up, as it has been for a number of years, will get on to the down grade. I want to know what is going to happen when that comes about ? Whilst the revenue has been going up expenditure has been increasing at a still greater rate. There seems to be no brake likely, to be applied to that  branch of public finance. Our expenditure is growing continually, and I have no hesitation in saying that in the next two or three years our income will dwindle. What is going to happen then? </para>

                        <para>- No, it will not be the Deluge; it will be the drought. It might be a deluge for the present Government, for I wish to tell the Vice-President of the Executive Council that nothing so discredits a party, or a Government, as non-success in finance, whether they are to blame for it or not. The inevitable end  of a Government, which has evil luck in the matter of revenue, is defeat at the polls. The whole history of representative government shows that, and I see no reason '.why it should be different in the case of a Labour Government. </para>

                        <para>- It is the candid friend very often who is your best friend. It is not because I am hostile to -the- Labour Government or the. Labour party that I say what I do. It is because I believe in the Labour Government  and the Labour party. I desire to take steps which will lead to better results. The Opposition would be glad to get into power, no matter what might be the financial predicament, because it would lay the whole blame for the situation on the Labour party. It would say, " Labour members talk about being financiers, but look at the huge deficit they have left. Everything is in confusion. The country's credit is ruined. Desolation faces the people." That would be an easy tale to tell. </para>

The Labour party is opposed to borrowing for any but reproductive works, and there is certain expenditure which it could not curtail - for instance, that on old-age pensions. We must provide for the defence of the country, which is costing between  £3,000,000  and  , £6,000,000,  and within a few years, should the military authorities have their way, will cost between  £10,000,000  and  , £15,000,000. </para>

                        <para>- There are already heavy taxes on dividends. The honorable senator is endeavouring to be personal because I draw a few dividends. The company in which I hold shares pays income tax to both the English Government and a State Government, and its shareholders do the same, so that ft is heavily taxed. It is assisting to develop the resources of Australia. But the monopolist, whether he holds a huge area in the country or a small block in the town, spends nothing on development. Like a spider waiting for a fly, he waits until his prey is caught and ready to be eaten. The Vice-President of the Executive Council is exceedingly averse from taxing the land monopolist any more.  1  heard him say that he hoped that the  £5,000  exemption would never be reduced, but, from my point of view, revenue must be obtained by means of a land-value tax, whereby the community merely takes back the value which it has created, and which the private owners of land have hitherto put into their pockets. </para>

                        <para>- It is one of the principal reasons. Those who own the land own the people on the land. Australia will not be as prosperous as she should be, nor have a sufficient population to defend her against a foreign foe, until her resources have been developed. Goodness knows what may happen to Great Britain within the next ten years. Germany is building ship after ship with the scarcely veiled purpose of attacking and destroying the British Navy at the earliest opportunity. Should that Navy be destroyed, although the people of Australia would fight as perhaps those of no other country have ever yet fought for their hearths and homes, what could we do with our small population? What we should do, and do quickly, is to get more population by breaking up land monopoly by means of land-value taxation. I do not care whether it pleases my constituents or the people of Australia, I conceive that I am placed in a position where it is my bounden duty to tell them the truth as I see it. I am doing my little best to assist in bringing about a state of affairs which would undoubtedly result, in the very near future, in a large increase of population, not only within our own borders, but from places far beyond the seas. This is one question that calls loudly for the attention of Parliament. We have land monopoly rampant in every State. Even in Queensland - where land is probably more plentiful than in any other State, save Western Australia - when a piece of land is thrown open,- even for grazing selection, in some cases, there are hundreds of applicants for it. That discloses a state of affairs which is extremely hostile to the best interests of the people. This Parliament has the power to deal with land monopoly. Our party has a majority in each House. The people have given us a mandate to deal effectively with this giant evil which is strangling the progress of Australia. Is the Government prepared to take the necessary step? It will need revenue very shortly, and here is a way to secure it. Australia requires population for defence and development, and here, to my mind, is the principal method of achieving that end. I trust that, in the near future, the Labour party outside Parliament will become so seized of the absolute necessity of drastic and effective action in this direction, that it will compel Parliament, however unwilling, to take speedy and effective action. Another question with which the progress and prosperity of Australia is bound up is that of Protection. With this question, there is coupled the idea of the new Protection, which is really by no means new. What is the view of Labour people with regard to Protection ? Is it "protection to the manufacturers? What have we to do with the manufacturer ?

                        <para>- My interest in manufactories is for the purpose of utilizing the resources of the country, and teaching the people to produce, within their own territory, the things they require ; and to do that, and maintain the Australian standard of living, we must have effective Protection. What is the good of living in a fortress if the enemy can shell your town, destroy your goods, and kill the people who live in it ? That is exactly the position in which Australia stands to-day. We have a Tariff which, so far from protecting us effectively against the competition of cheap labour, is absolutely futile. Millions of pounds worth of goods, which ought to be manufactured in the Commonwealth, are pouring over the Tariff wall into Australia every year. Very soon, although, fortunately it is not the case at present, large numbers of our people will be idle, and will be clamouring to the Commonwealth and State Governments to find employment for them. If we had an effective system of land values taxation, and a Tariff which would give us- a minimum of revenue with a maximum of industry, we should be on the highway to a state of affairs in which the people of Australia would be more comfortably and more solidly prosperous than they are even at present. I am utilizing the present occasion to get off my chest a few remarks that have been sitting rather uneasily upon it for some time, and possibly I ought to thank the Governor-General for having, unwittingly, given me an opportunity to say what I have said. I trust that the remarks I have made will not go in at one ear and come out of the other so far as my party are concerned, but that honorable senators generally will rise to their responsibilities, realize that much of what I have said is true, and that whilst we have had for a considerable time great prosperity, the lean years are advancing upon us with rapid strides. Revenue will then go down, when expenditure must be maintained, and new sources of taxation must be tapped. </para>

                        <para>- That would not make the honorable senator either richer or poorer. While the present system is continued - and I say this to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> - under the sanction of law, and with the support of the majority of the people of the Commonwealth,' capital which is invested in industry is just as much entitled to fair remuneration as Labour is. It is no use saying that the man who engages in business is not to make a fair profit if he can. He cannot carry on unless he does. These are aspects of the question which honorable senators would do well to consider. Not one of us living in Australia to-day is responsible for this state of affairs. The land monopolist is not responsible for his position, the rich man is not responsible for his, nor is the business man responsible for his position. The poorest man or woman in the Commonwealth is not responsible, lt is the system under which we live that is responsible. It is the system which produces rich at one end and poor at the other. </para>

From a social point of view, I am not particularly keen as to whether we adjourn or not. I think we must congratulate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> as the candid friend of the Government and of the party which keeps the Government in power. He is the friend who is not carried away by the glamour of the circumstance that the Labour party is responsible for the management of the affairs of this country. He is one who sees clearly what should be done, and who is always prepared to point the finger to show the Government the course which they should take. Although they may not stand up in their places and argue upon the same lines, I am sure that there are a great many honorable  senators who are in entire accord with what he said. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> referred to the millions of pounds' worth of manufactured goods which are pouring over our Tariff wall. I hope that a good many of those millions of pounds' worth of goods will find their way into the hands of the people. That we are importing - as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> pointed out - millions of pounds' worth of goods each year more than we are exporting- </para>

                        <para>- If we could not carry on for a day longer, what we have already achieved is an accomplishment which I shall always look upon with pleasure and pride. I shall always regard it as one of the greatest works attempted in finance by any Australian Government. Look at the huge Trust Funds which have been built up - funds which are in the hands of the Government, and which have enabled them to assist the States very materially. Take, for example, the moneys which have been loaned to Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, Western Australia, South Australia, and Tasmania. Not only have we assisted the last-mentioned State by means of a loan fund, but we have actually passed a Bill to grant her a sufficient sum to tide her over her small financial difficulties. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> has asked me how long this condition of things will last. My reply is, as long as the Australian continent is well governed, and it will be well governed so long as the Labour party is at the head of affairs, for the simple reason that we have in that party clear-sighted men like the honorable senator, who will keep the Government up to the collar. </para>

                        <para>- The Government will benefit largely by this discussion. If they read the lesson aright, and remember the instruction which has been tendered to them this evening, the country will know the benefit which they have derived from the debate upon this premature motion for adjournment. There are other matters upon which I might touch at length on an occasion of this kind. For instance, there is the failure of the Government to provide a residence for the Governor-General in Sydney. To my mind, it is a question of great urgency. I recognise that the Government may have a very good answer to all that has been said about the little incident which caused New South Wales to be without an official residence for the Governor-General. I have watched the whole of the proceedings without any bias one way or the other. It is between the two Governments only a question of a few thousand pounds. I can quite realize that the present Commonwealth Government, having had a residence for the Governor-General in Sydney provided by the State Government for ten years, feel inclined to say, " If the State Government will continue to provide a residence for the Governor-General, we shall still make arrangements for His Excellency to occupy it; but if you ask us to take the responsibility of providing a residence there, we are not going to do it, because Melbourne, Adelaide, Perth, Brisbane, and Hobart might make a similar request." All these great cities have a perfect right, not only to demand, but to insist that the Commonwealth Government, if they find a residence for the Governor-General in New South Wales, shall find a residence for His Excellency in the capitals of the other States. That is absolutely a logical position. I am not taking up the  stand of, shall I say, a New South Welshman, who believes that Sydney is the whole of the Commonwealth, and that the Governor-General should reside there, irrespective of anything which may happen. I believe that we have arrived at a time when the Commonwealth Government should shift its head-quarters to the proper centre, and that is to the Federal Capital site. They should arrange for this Parliament to meet next time on that site, and for the Governor-General to' be provided with a residence there. And if we are having the use of a Parliament House, and a Government House at the expense of the people of Victoria, the people of Australia should be sufficiently independent to say to the former, " It is too big a burden for you to pay for the upkeep of your Governor's residence, and also the Governor- General's residence." I maintain that the Governor-General should be housed at the cost of the people of the Commonwealth. Not only should he be housed at their cost, but his chief residence should be where the Parliament sits; and the sooner Parliament shifts to the Federal Territory the better.  1  believe that temporary arrangements would be more satisfactory than to wait until the complete scheme of the Federal Capital has been carried out. I believe that immediate arrangements should be made for the building of a few halls, a few houses of accommodation, or hotels - a few places where members of Parliament and officers could be accommodated. All that could be done in a very few months,  and from the next meeting of this Parliament the Governor-General could be housed in the Federal Territory ; and, so far as State residences are concerned, a fair, equitable arrangement might be made by the Commonwealth Government. I deplore altogether the statement that if we provide the Governor-General with a residence in Sydney, the Victorian Government will rightly say that we. should pay for his residence here. Not only should we pay for his residence here, but the present Government- </para>

                        <para>- I know that  His Excellency  cannot occupy each house at the same time; but I maintain that the present Government should call together immediately the Premiers of the different States, and discuss with them the question of dispensing with the services of State Governors, allowing the Governor-General to fulfil all functions in regard to important matters, and leaving, as in New South Wales, all unimportant matters in each State to be attended to by the Chief Justice, acting as Lieutenant-Governor. That would involve no additional expense to the States. The Government of each State could reserve the State Government House as a residence for the Governor-General when he goes there as their representative. I venture to say that it would mean an immense saving to the whole of the States. Let us just look at the position. Here is a population of 4,500,000 people, with seven representatives of  His  Majesty within its borders, when one representative of the King would be ample. It would be a link, we will say, connecting us with the other side of the world. We have reached such an enlightened era that the people of Australia, in order to maintain the Empire in its integrity, are spending millions and millions annually. I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> estimated the cost of defence this year at .£6,000,000. Therefore, in considering this subject, there is no occasion to introduce the question of loyalty or disloyalty into the discussion. We are showing our willingness to maintain the solidarity of this country by the amount of money which we are prepared to expend. We are spending, I understand, about ,£3,500,000  011  the building of a Navy, and a considerable sum on our system of military training. This expenditure is undertaken not because of any fear which the people of Australia may have of an immediate invasion, because if ever -an invasion is threatened, we shall have ample time to get ready for it provided that we have the men trained, the arms for them to carry, and not only the ammunition, but factories for the manufacture of ammunition. So far as loyalty to the Empire is concerned, it is our self-interest which makes us loyal, and although some of us may think that our interest does not lie that way, it is merely one of those questions which can be debated, possibly with almost convincing arguments from either side. It is not always the section that boasts most about its loyalty that is most to be relied upon, because, away in the north of Ireland we have a threat by some of the most prominent men in the British Empire that they are prepared to take up arms, shed blood, fight against the flag, and fire upon the soldiers of the King because they cannot get their own way in regard to a certain measure which is before the British Parliament. I am not taken very much by claptrap about loyalty. But as regards the question of the people of the Commonwealth finding the money to house the Governor-General, I think that if the Government have not considered that point the sooner they do so the better. </para>

                        <para>- If every function that attracts the Opposition causes the Government to postpone business, I do not know how long the time will be. I understand that the preparation of the Federal Capital is in the hands of the" Minister of Home Affairs, who is carrying out the work in a systematic manner, and securing plans which will make this one of the first and most up-to-date cities of the world, so far as the best brains can do that. It would, however, be much better to be on the spot now, when there would be no adjourning for a ball at Government House in Melbourne. The Government must either manage the business or go out of management ; we cannot dilly-dally with the affairs of this great Commonwealth. There are many measures of importance, including more particularly the Navigation Bill, that require our close attention ; and I think it was ill-advised on the part of the Minister to propose an adjournment. Arrangements might well have been made for those who desired to go to the ball, leaving those who desired to work to remain at Parliament House; and an excellent opportunity for progress is presented in the absence of the entire Opposition. If the Vice-President of the Executive Council will consent to withdraw the motion, I will sit down. </para>

                        <para>- Then we may be able to negative this motion without offending the Government, although I have seen a State Government resign because a motion to adjourn a debate was negatived. I have offered my protest, though I do not say I would vote against an adjournment if the Government contested the matter. I rose, amongst other things, to compliment <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> on the able manner in which he has placed before the country the duty of the Government on the present occasion. </para>

                    <para>.- The Government ought to be thankful that they have two such candid critics as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner.</inline> There is an old and true saying that a candid critic will, in five minutes, point out more faults that need correction than any other kind of critic will do in five hours. I take strong exception to the action of the Government in proposing this adjournment, and I do that for one reason only, namely, that the work of this Parliament should not be subordinated to any .social function at Government House or elsewhere. I am pleased to see that the proposal is meeting with objection from at least three States - Queensland, New South Wales, and Tasmania - and I have no doubt that before the Government succeed in carrying the motion, if they do so, they will hear a protest from each of the Stages. This is an occasion on which the Government can look for loyal support from the Opposition. At other times, when the Government are in need of support and fighters, they have to look to this side, which they so frequently treat with contempt. </para>

                        <para>- Perhaps it is as well that the honorable senator does forget, because I am not anxious to fall out with him. We have been on excellent terms since I have been a member of the Senate. Many matters might occupy our attention. They will have to be disposed of before the prorogation, which, I presume, will take place some time before "Christmas. Probably, in a week or two, the Government will ask the Senate, to sit at half-past 10 every morning, in order that we may get though our business. I wish to take advantage of the present opportunity to bring a matter before honorable senators which concerns them. I especially invite the attention of the Vice-President of the Executive Council to the facts, because I assert that information supplied to me, and to the Senate generally, by him last session was absolutely misleading. The information was given to the Vice-President of the Executive Council by the leading officer in the External Affairs Department. Upon the Appropriation Bill last year, I brought under the notice of the Government the fact that an officer, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. F.</inline> Savage, had been transferred from the Commonwealth Service in this State to the High Commissioner's office in London. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Savage</inline> occupies a very prominent position in that office to-day. I pointed out that he had not received the consideration that was extended to other officers of the Commonwealth who were sent to London, and who remained there in a temporary capacity for some time. </para>

When this officer was transferred to London, he was not given any allowance, as were other officers who had been sent Home in a temporary capacity. I pointed that fact out to the Government last session, believing that they would recognise the justice of the officer's claim, place him on the same footing as other officers, and give him the regular allowance over and above his salary. The Vice-President of the Executive Council told the Senate that there was never any doubt about the permanency of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Savage's</inline> appointment, and that he went Home to the High Commissioner's </para>

Leaving that matter, and going back to the more important question of whether the Senate should adjourn in order that two or three members of this National Legislature should go and see other people kicking up their heels at some social function in this city, I wish' to say that to me it is humiliating in the extreme that important matters, such as those which appear on our business-paper,  should be hung up for any such function. It is true that the consideration of the amendments made in another place in the Navigation Bill have been postponed until to-morrow, and that they could not be brought on again to-day. That might have been necessary in the interests of the Government. But there are other matters on our business-paper of perhaps equal importance to the people of Australia. Why could we not have gone on with the Workmen's Compensation Bill ? Is that measure so unimportant that it may 'be laid aside in order that some members of the Government and of the Opposition may enjoy themselves socially? </para>

They involve questions relating to the expenditure of nearly ^22,000,000 of revenue. When we do enter upon the discussion of the Budget-papers, no doubt the Government will send round word asking us to curtail our speeches as much as possible, in order that the session may be brought to a close before Christmas. I suggest that their action to-night, without consultation with honorable members on this side, is not calculated to secure from them the allegiance and loyalty they have displayed in the past. I can say, candidly, speaking for myself, that I wish to be consulted in future before any arrangement is made for an adjournment such as that proposed to-night. </para>

In the circumstances the gibe at <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> who was prevented in a great measure through ill-health from being present during the first two months of the session, does them no credit. </para>

                        <para>- I thank the honorable senator for that expression. It describes the proposal that is likely to be made, and I say that if such a proposal meets with opposition from this side, the Government will have only themselves to blame for it. There is a number of matters of great urgency and extreme importance on our business-paper which might have been' dealt with. I do not propose to refer to them now, because I am not anxious to delay the progress of business. I understand that at least eight or nine other honorable senators wish to address themselves to the question, and I shall not detain the Senate at any great length, except to express the admiration I feel for the courage displayed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers,</inline> who is the only member of the Opposition who has remained in his place. I am satisfied from what I know of him that the honorable senator will join in the protest against the suspension of business for the purpose which has been referred to so often this evening. I hope to hear his invectives directed at the Government. In order that I may not be accused of being an obstructionist, I shall not longer delay the putting of the question, contenting myself, in conclusion, with the expression of the hope that this is the last occasion on which we shall be asked to subordinate the business of Australia to any social function. </para>

                    <para>.- Whilst at first I was opposed to the idea of adjourning for a social function, I am convinced, now that I have heard the speeches that have been delivered during the evening, that much good has come from the morion for the adjournment. The country and the Senate would have been the losers had there not been this opportunity provided for the splendid and scholarly address on the land question delivered by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart.</inline> The intelligence of honorable senators has been sharpened and invigorated by the speech of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> who spoke of the need for erecting tents for our accommodation on the Federal Capital site, and added a little homily on the fiscal question. The motion also gave occasion for the striking impeachment of his party which we had from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Long.</inline> It showed the country that many of us who sit on this side are not subservient to the Caucus, but are able, when the occasion serves, as it does to-night, to thunder forth defiance, bloodshed, and murder at the Government that we support. The country will know, too, that honorable senators are ready to take every opportunity to ventilate every little grievance. I am glad that I have not donned my dress suit and gone to the dance. </para>

                <para>I have risen to combat a report persistently circulated by the Opposition, of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers</inline> is at present the only representative, that gold has been driven out of Australia by the policy of the Labour party. This fairy tale has been told especially at afternoon tea parties of ladies. But it has no foundation in fact, as the following figures will show. I have made a comparison between the operations during the last two years of the Fusion Government and those during the first two years of the Labour Government. In 1908, the total imports for Australia were £48,608,921; and, in 1909, £50,115,521 ; or, in the two years, £98, 724,442. The exports in 1908 were £50,120,838; and, in 1909, £56,638,552 ; or, in the two years. £106,759,390 ; an excess of exports over imports for the two years of £8, 034,948. Let me contrast those figures with these for the first two years of the Labour Administration. In 1910, the total imports of Australia were £58,682,391 ; and, in 191 1, £64,997,907 ; a total for the two years of £120,680,298. The exports in 1910 were £69,855,873; and, in 1911, £67,435,172; a total of £137,291,045 for the two years, and an excess of exports over imports for that period of £13,610,747. In view of the large increase of both exports and imports, the excess was not proportionately large, but let us contrast the figures relating to the importation and exportation of gold. In 1908, under the Fusion Administration, our imports of gold specie and bullion were valued at £1,190,352; and, in 1909, . at £1,056,375; a total of £2,246,727. For the same years the exports were £14,190,222 and £8,680,284 respectively, a total of £22,870,504. The excess of exports over imports was £20,623,777 in respect of the two years' period during which the Liberal Administration was in power. Let us look now at what took place during the first two years of the Labour Administration, and refute the statement so current in antiLabour circles regarding the actual position. In 1910, our imports of gold specie and bullion amounted to £1,331,960,andin1911 they amounted to £1,969,581 ; while our exports in 1910 amounted to £4,635,277, and in 1911 to £12,047,086. Our total imports for the two years were £3,301,541, while our total exports amounted to £16,682,363. The excess of gold exported for the two years was only £13,380,822, as against an excess amounting to £20,623,777 during the Liberal Administration. In "other words, we have sent out in round figures £7,000,000 less of gold than was exported during the Fusion Administration. And yet we hear the cry from the house-tops that, under the Labour Administration, gold is daily being sent away to pay our national debt. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator is not an orthodox Single Taxer. I have here a very interesting little volume  dealing with the history of the island of Van Dieman's Land, for the years 1824 to 1835 inclusive, to which is added a few words on prison discipline by Henry Melville. This work was published in 1835, and the man who wrote it was imprisoned for twelve months for writing it. I am informed that there are only eight or ten copies of this work in existence; and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> will, I am sure, be very interested in it. I find that, as far back as 1835, Henry Melville,, who was not only a newspaper editor of considerable literary  ability, but a man who had given the economic question of the land serious consideration, wrote as follows : - </para>

                    <para>Should the Home Government abolish the present system of selling land - which experience will soon point out as absolutely necessary to save the Colony - emigrants would flock to Vain Dieman's Land as they, did five years since; and supposing that the giving away of land can be managed without introducing the corruption and the jobbing hitherto so prevalent, the greater part of the island would soon be studded with villages and farms, containing an industrious, a healthy, and a loyal British people. No doubt that five or ten years of encouragement would find half the island located, and the greater portion to individuals possessing less than 1,000 acres. Till such time as five millions of acres are located, the revenue might be raised as at present, viz., by the duty on spirits and tobacco; but when that quantity of land should be given, then the revenue should be drawn from the real property by  means  of a quit rent. If threepence per acre were fixed upon land under cultivation and sixpence an acre upon all such as remained in a natural state, a sufficient sum would thus be raised for the support of a Government suitable to the number of its acres and its inhabitants. </para>

                <para>I mentioned a few nights ago, that there was a limitation on the area which could be given away in free grants at the time in question, and I was asked for more conclusive proof of my statement. I shall give it now. According to this work, page 134, the largest grant that would be made to any fresh settler without purchase at that time was 2,560 acres;  the smallest  320 acres. Notwithstanding this, we find that many of the forefathers of the present land-holders jobbed and obtained the land on all kinds of pretences from the Government. They practically "peacocked " the eyes out of little Tasmania. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Melville</inline> gives some very striking facts dealing with this matter. I should like to read the whole volume, but I am afraid that even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> interested as he is in this question, would scarcely like me to do so at this stage. </para>

                    <para>Surveyors whose salaries were nominally but trifling, have been most fortunate in the jobbing, and have amassed wealth with a rapidity truly astonishing. What is the most extraordinary portion of the system which has been allowed, is, that the Government surveyors have been permitted to measure their- own land, either granted or purchased - and in a very large grant a few hundred acres, more or less, is of trifling import; it would be invidious to point out any one individual as having so .done, when the system to this day is general. The land jobbing has been carried on from the very highest to the very lowest of Government 06cers, even  'His Excellency  the Lieutenant-Governor, besides possessing large funded property, is a very extensive land-holder; and with such an example before him, some of ,his leading friends have outstripped him in the number of acres, if not in the value of the propetty. </para>

It is beyond dispute, that had the land about Perth and Norfolk Plains been granted in small lots of 500 acres to various industrious individuals, instead of 70,000 acres to one family and 30 to another, there would have now been no scarcity of bread ; for that part of the country alone could grow more wheat than would serve this colony as well as the whole of the Sister Settlement. </para>

                <para>In Tasmania, a holding of 20,000 acres is regarded as a big estate, while in New South Wales, that area would probably be called a farm. But in my own State, these areas are a great block to progress. The land tax, which is operative to-day, does not sufficiently penalize the owners of such estates. Nearly every one of them can pay the tax, and look pleasant. In dealing with this question, I may be pardoned for recounting a little experience which I had recently. I was travelling in the train with two Tasmanian land-owners, who were discussing the Federal land tax, and who did not know that I was a member of the Commonwealth Parliament. One of these gentlemen, who contributes a little over £1,000 a year by way of land tax, remarked to the other that the tax he had to ay represented quite a large sum of money, Just then, we were passing along the Hobart Domain, from which the torpedo boat destroyers, the <inline font-style="italic">Parramatta</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">yarra,</inline> could be seen in the offing, and the other gentleman inquired, " Do you ' see those boats?" "Yes," replied the first speaker. His companion then said, " Those vessels have been built with our money, and you and I will see the day when those jolly unions will have them. They will then bring them up here, and bombard our lands with them." </para>
                <para>I do not take such a serious view of the position as did that gentleman. But in looking through the land assessments in Tasmania, I find that the large land-holders there are not being penalized to the extent, that I imagined they would be. In a number of the most fertile districts, the land is not being subdivided as quickly as I should like to see it subdivided. In these circumstances, why not ask <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Stewart</inline> to prescribe .the remedy ? Let us increase the land tax without increasing the rates imposed under it. Let us make the higher rate apply right down, as was proposed by </para>

                        <para>- That is not enough. Only two land-holders have applied for and obtained relief under section 66 , of the Act. That circumstance shows that the tax does not press harshly upon landowners. If we made the higher rate apply in the manner suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> the taxation on many estates would be doubled, and we should hasten their subdivision for the purposes of closer settlement. Seriously speaking, I, for one, will not rest content, but will seize every available opportunity to force the Government forward until we get the land tax increased. </para>

                    <para>. - During this debate, various matters have been introduced, and as I understand that the Vice-President of the Executive Council wishes to speak for an hour, there is no occasion for me to say a great deal. When this discussion was started, on account of the rather glum looks of some senators who were speaking, and the strained relations that were growing up between the Minister and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Long</inline> and others, I began to think that if such a sacrilegious thing as a cartoon of the Senate could have been sketched, it would have depicted a number of senators with the legend underneath, " These are the blokes that lost their tin." It seemed to me as if disappointed punters were speaking. I know that that remark  does not apply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> because he is not animated by any feeling of disappointment at his share in the Cup debacle. The social function which was supposed to be the reason for the proposed adjournment of the Senate is one in which only very few senators could possibly participate in any circumstances, and the bulk of the people not at all. Therefore, it appears to me that the objections raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> are perfectly valid, that we should not allow the business of the Senate .to be interrupted by functions of this kind, which only concern a very few persons - those who can be well spared, at any rate, for they all belong to the Op-' position. It is true that the Senate has previously adjourned for other purposes, but as we are- approaching the end of the session, it is only right that we should get through with the business of a contentious character as soon as possible, so as to provide time for dealing in an intelligible, and, I might add, almost a leisurely manner with various topics which come up for treatment at that time. A promise has been made by the Leader of the Senate that time will be given to honorable <inline font-style="italic">senators on</inline> both sides to discuss those matters of which they have given notice of motion. There are one or two motions standing in my own name, and motions in the names of senators on both sides of the chamber, nearly all of which provide ample food for thought and room for deliberation. We know that the discussion of private business, while it very rarely leads to legislation being passed immediately after such discussion, does sow the seed, as it- were, which, in many cases, bears fruit a very few sessions afterwards. Under our present conditions it is the best means available for bringing into the arena of practical politics questions which, before they are ventilated in this public fashion, are looked upon as the dreams of faddists. Nothing tends more, I think, to keep the life-blood of new ideas circulating in a healthy manner in the legislative halls than the provision of an opportunity to private senators to bring forward matters which have not yet reached the stage when a Government will take them up. It is, therefore, the most superficial criticism which we frequently hear urged against the condition of private members' business that it is a waste of time and a farce. I know, from my experience in the Parliament of New South Wales, as well as in the Senate, that very many questions which, prior to their being ventilated at the instance of  private  members, were looked upon as mere idle political visions, have been brought into the realm of realization within a remarkably few sessions. 1 may mention such a question as the provision of old-age pensions. 1, recollect the time when, in the New South. Wales Assembly, this was a matter for mere academic discussion on private members'' night. I recollect, too, the time when even one man one vote was rather a matter for debating societies, and womanhood suffrage was looked upon as even a wilder dream than it is now in any part of the civilized' world. There are other matters which will occur to every honorable senator. </para>

                        <para>- I do not wonder at that, because the Imperial Parliament moves very, very slowly, as the Conservative instinct of our British cousins leads them to be slaves to tradition rather than to open their minds to new ideas, as is the case in these younger countries. But, while that is so, I maintain that the time is drawing, nigh when this session must close, or the. Houses be adjourned over Christmas. T think that the promise of the Leader of tha Senate to give honorable senators on both, sides an opportunity of, at any rate, having some discussion on the motions standing, in their names should be redeemed as soon as possible, and that, instead of wasting an evening by adjourning the Senate as was originally proposed, it would be more to the point to have an extra sitting. I believe that this fooling away of time only makes men too lazy to do work even when they are sitting. I think that there would be far more solid work done if, when we started a job, we stuck to it like a man does outside until it was finished. Instead of that, what did we do to-day ? We started with a discussion on a matter which was not of a practical character, and then got on to the Navigation Bill. Practically we did nothing before progress was reported,, and the adjournment of the Senate _ was moved. I hope that the time which has been spent this evening in uttering protests against the proposed adjournment will' make the Government a bit careful about submitting a similar motion in the future. I desire now to refer to a matter which may be of passing interest to honorable senators, as well as to members of the outside public.

                        <para>- :It does not necessarily kill the shrub, but the stalk from which one cuts a Waratah will miss the next year in blooming. I cultivate the flower myself, and, therefore, can fully appreciate its beauty. However, we are not much concerned with that aspect of the question. I wish to point out that we are now afforded a striking instance of how magnificence obtained at an enormous cost belongs to a social order against which the Labour party should be a standing protest. This is a social order which can go to the greatest lengths' in cost in order to tickle the fancy of a few persons only for a few short hours, while the great body of the people, who have to find the money, are impoverished thereby. It may be like sowing seed on stony ground to mention these facts, but I do so as a standing protest against anything which tends to give our support or sanction to a social system which creates millionaires by draining and robbing the poor of their legitimate reward. As a Socialist, I should be very glad to see the crimson Waratah as a fitting emblem of the socialistic people. I like to see Australian industries, flowers, and everything else patronized ; but it is a great pity that we do not as a body better realize the requirements of the whole of the people than to allow the great Labour cause we are here to represent to be, to some extent, dragged in the dust by giving our sanction to a social function, which, if we were in Opposition, or in the rank and file of the party in the country, we should be the first to deride and decry. Feeling as much class-conscious as ever I did when in the ranks outside, I am glad of this opportunity to enter my protest. I do not do this because there is any evil in dancing, racing, or any other  pleasure,  but because I object to a purely class institution, reserved for the wealthy, being made the medium of our wasting time that should be devoted to infinitely better purposes. </para>

                    <para>. - It is as well to acknowledge at the outset that I am entering on a dangerous task in offering an opinion which does not seem to be shared by many of the previous speakers; it is like entering where angels fear to tread- As for the motion, so far as I can understand, it simply means that we are asked to sacrifice two and a half hours' work to-night to enable most, if not all, the members of the Cabinet to attend this social function. If it is contended - and this appears to be the main contention - that we cannot make this sacrifice, then those who hold that view cast a very serious reflection on the work done by the Labour party and this Parliament since it was called into existence three years ago. I hold that we can afford the time - that we as a party in Parliament have put up .an absolute record in the output of legislation since we had a mandate from the people of Australia. It shows, therefore, rather a mean, or I had better say a paltry, spirit on the part of any member of any chamber, or of this Parliament, to begrudge two hours and a half's diversion to the members of the Cabinet in whom we have placed an implicit trust that remains undiminished. The members' of the Government work six, and even- seven, days a week ; and the present circumstances disclose a case, if ever there was one, of the great failure on the part of the average human being to place himself in the position of " the other fellow " when called upon to exercise calm and unimpassioned judgment. The men invited to this social function are representing this Parliament. We were not all invited, and I am amongst the uninvited. </para>

                <para class="block">But that is no reason why I should not put myself in the place of those who have been invited. Let me add that we have delegated our power to the three members of the Senate who sit at the table. Those three men, by virtue of the positions they occupy, were invited to this social function, and I hold that, by reason of their invitation and their representative capacity, we, to a certain degree, were invited through them. As far as the work of the session is concerned, I think that those who sent us here, and who still stand at our backs, are fairly well satisfied with the work that we have done. </para>

                        <para>- I do not say that; but the position, when stripped of extraneous considerations, is simply this : Are we willing to give an opportunity for two and a half hours' diversion to men who have been working so hard to realize the policy which we have intrusted them to carry out ? Let me emphasize that point by saying that members of a Labour Government stand in an entirely different position from members of any other Government of which I ever heard. The men intrusted with conducting the business of the country as Labour Ministers have to undergo the keenest scrutiny, not only from members of the Opposition, but from every single man who sits behind them.. Every action of theirs is scrutinized. The searchlight of inquiry is turned on every corner of their administration. In order that a Labour Minister may do justice to his position and his trust, he must devote every minute of his time to his duties, and must even rob himself of the rest to which he is entitled. Many of them not only devote many hours per day to their work, but also work on Sundays. </para>

                        <para>- All that we were asked to do was to give an opportunity to these men,, whom we have placed in office,, to enjoy two and a half hours' diversion! after a session of nearly six months, and towards the close of a Parliament of three years. If we cannot afford to give them this time, we must be very hard taskmasters indeed. Why should we demand the full pound of flesh from those who have worked so hard ? I have had a trifling experience, 'but enough to make me understand that the man who diligently discharges the work of a Minister of the Crown certainly has no child's play before him. He must work hard and long ; must, master all the details of his Department must make himself acquainted with the Bills for which he is responsible, and must be careful that at no time he is made to look foolish through lack of knowledge of the affairs intrusted to him. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> has referred to the gorgeous scene at Government House to-night; and, as far as I could put any reasonable construction upon his remarks, his objection was because the function was not available to the whole of the 4,500,000 people in the Commonwealth. But is that any good reason why about 150 people should not enjoy themselves there? Let me point out that on Eight Hours Day in Sydney, a banquet took place, at which leading members of the Labour party enjoyed themselves. Certainly the banquet was not available to every member of the Labour party in New South Wales. Yet I am sure that those who were not present did not begrudge those who were there the .opportunity of enjoying themselves. </para>

The banquet at the Trades Hall in Sydney symbolized the same idea as does the function to which reference has been made tonight. Those who were present had an opportunity of enjoying themselves for a few hours. The sons of Labour thought it wise to turn aside from the rough-and-tumble and the turmoil of their ordinary occupations to enjoy a little respite. </para>

Could we not spare two and a half hours, in view of the immense amount of work that has been accomplished in the direction of carrying out the. programme of legislation to which our party is pledged ? For myself,  I say that, regardless of the consequences, I am prepared to let these men off the chain for two and a half hours. Those who are not prepared to do so 'are hard taskmasters, and some who are hard taskmasters will not acknowledge it. On such occasions there is always an indulgence in witticism which is quite understandable ; but, if we view the matter squarely, we must admit that the adjournment of the Senate for two and a half hours this evening would not have prevented us from finishing the work we have set our minds to do. It would not prevent us. carrying out our programme of legislation ; and, if it did, those who have objected to the adjournment would have to share the blame. I believe that the men who have gone to the ball to-night are entitled to the diversion we have given them. </para>

' I say, in all seriousness, that the people of Australia have not sufficient sympathy with the work of their public men. I honestly believe that the men. who, as members of different Cabinets in Australia, industriously apply themselves to the work of their offices, go down to the grave much earlier than they would if they continued to follow an ordinary, hum-drum occupation. We have only to look at the pictures exhibited in our Library to see- that robust men have gone down to an early grave ; and we know that that has been, in a great measure, due to the assiduity with which they applied themselves to the performance of their public duties. We have placed men in such positions who' have never shirked' their work, and we should never begrudge them a respite of two and a half hours that they may reinvigorate themselves to accomplish the 'balance of the work of the session. </para>

                        <para>- There is not the slightest doubt that, in ordinary  circumstances,  we would have adjourned at about this time. I say, in reply to some ' honorable senators who have accused mem-' bers df the Government of a lack of diligence, energy, or industry, that such charges cannot fairly' be made against representatives of the Government in the Senate. At any time in . the past, in the present, or in the future, I have been prepared to sit for twenty-four hours, if necessary, in the interests of the country. I have never shirked a late sitting in the Senate yet ; and, with the help of Providence, I hope I never shall. I am at all' times prepared to give my very best services to the members  of the  Senate, and to the people of Australia*, and so is every other Minister in the Senate. In the circumstances, it is rather mean on the part' of some honorable senators, who have known the representatives of the Government in the Senate for so long, to insinuate that the Government have any sinister motive in submitting the motion, or that they are in any way inclined to pander to  the social customs of the country. I would also say. that it is not becoming of honorable senators, especially on this side, to reflect in any way, or at any time, upon any section or member of the community giving the slightest pleasure to the smallest number of the citizens of Australia. Though I moved the adjournment of the Senate ostensibly to give certain persons an opportunity to attend the function which has been so often referred to, it was for no benefit or pleasure to me. I have enjoyed myself more in listening to the speeches which have been made on the. motion ; and I am willing to sit here as long this evening as honorable senators are prepared to do the business of the country. To speak in the way in which an honorable senator has spoken, of the decoration of any place with the choice flowers of Australia, was, I think, rather mean, and beneath a representative of Labour, because the bringing of those flowers from the different hills of New South Wales, and collecting them here in Melbourne, must have cost a good deal of money; and I would ask, Who benefited by that? Was it better to allow those flowers to die on their stems unseen and unadmired than to pay labour to collect them and bring them down here, even though it should be to give . pleasure to but a few? At almost every. Labour function I have attended, flowers have been freely used in the decoration of the humble places in which those functions were held. On many occasions, I have paid my  2s.  6d. or  5s.  to go to those places, and, with others, have admired the beauties collected there in the form of those natural 'productions of the country ; but, according to the argument of some honorable senators, because I and other people could afford to pay  2s.  6d. or  5s.  to see those things, and hundreds or thousands of other people in Australia could not afford to do so, or . had not an. opportunity of seeing them, those who attended the functions did wrong. I can only attribute such remarks to envy or hypocrisy, and I do not care which alternative honorable senators accept. I wonder whether yesterday's great demonstration in Victoria in connexion with the famous Melbourne Cup race has had anything to do with the irritability exhibited here to-night? Very few people in Victoria who have ever attended a Melbourne Cup race have not looked with admiration upon the scene exhibited on the lawn at Flemington on a fine Cup day. All the citizens of Victoria or of Australia could not enjoy the scene, though <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> or <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Long</inline> may have been present at the Cup race yesterday, and other senators were . there, they could not enjoy themselves on the lawn, I suppose. They were too democratic to mix with society, and, of course, went on to the poor man's lawn, and looked oyer the fence to admire this beauty. Their democratic instincts were too keen, and their hatred of society too marked, to allow them to be seen there. There will be another similar gathering to-morrow. Surely they will not attend it, because society will be represented there in all its gorgeousness. </para>

                        <para>- The business of the country will go on, even if honorable senators are absent. I hope that to-night's discussion may be profitable, but so far as Ministers are concerned, we are at all times prepared to do the business of the country. No one can  -Bay  that I have neglected the work of my office. On behalf of the Minister of Defence, and in the interests of business, I wish to announce that the first business on the notice-paper for Friday will be the Redistribution of the New South Wales Electoral divisions. I can hardly be' expected to move the second reading of the Commonwealth Workmen's Compensation Bill tonight. When I address myself to that measure, I hope for a full attendance of senators, so that the second reading discussion may obviate delay in Committee. If honorable senators desire to stay later to-night, and will negative the motion for the adjournment, I shall be prepared to sit until morning, listening, to the discussion of the motion regarding the Budget-papers of the Treasurer. </para>
