                        <para>- The Bill now before Parliament is not retrospective, and therefore will only affect cases which occurred after the 30th June last. The prosecutions now taking place relate to non- performance of statutory parades for the year ending 30th June last. I am in consultation with the Attorney-General as to the course of action to be taken regarding the cases before the Court. It is obvious that in some instances an injustice is being inflicted because of the minimum fine being fixed at <inline font-style="italic">£5</inline> by the previous Act. I shall have a statement to make in the course of a few days. It is not proposed in the present Bill to deal with cases before the Courts. </para>

                        <para class="block">The justification for taking this course is the fact that serious charges have been made against an officer of the Commonwealth, and ought to be refuted at the earliest opportunity that is presented. I think that all the members of the Senate will agree that when the character of a man is attacked, especially when he is in the employ of the Government, and is to some extent prevented from defending himself, it is the duty of those who know that he is innocent to take advantage of the first opportunity to refute statements which have been made freely in another place. I think that there has been no appointment made by this Government which calls for less outcry than does this appointment. Never, so far as I know, has there been a case in connexion with the Commonwealth where there has been such a tremendous outcry - in my opinion most unwarranted. I hold that the record of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> is such that the appointment will justify itself if it is dispassionately considered on its merits. I think that very good reasons, indeed, can be advanced in favour of the appointment. The charges of which I complain, and which I heard made in another place, are - first, that the appointment was not justified by the efficiency of the officer ; second, that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn's</inline> private character is such as may be termed unsatisfactory; and, third, that it was a political appointment. </para>

                                <para>- I have quoted sufficiently to prove the statement made at the beginning of my remarks, that I could submit testimony which would prove beyond the shadow of a doubt that, from a private and professional stand-point, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> possesses all the qualifications which might reasonably be expected of any man. In the face of these testimonials, it cannot be doubted for a moment that he is an engineer, and, in his private character, a gentleman. We have a gentleman of the standing of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Moriarty</inline> testifying to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn's</inline> abilities as a civil engineer and surveyor from an experience of six years of his work. That testimonial was written in 1885, and if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> was then a competent and able engineer, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Moriarty</inline> says he was, with the experience he has since gained he should be quite competent to fill a position of second in command in connexion with the construction of a railway in 1912. One of the charges made against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> was that no one who had employed him had a good word to say on his behalf, yet we find Messrs. Garnsworthy and Smith speaking of the exceptional ability he displayed as an engineer in their service for eleven years in connexion with all kinds of contracts, including railway contracts. Very few men possess a testimonial from employers equal to that. Then we have <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bowden,</inline> the superintendent of the Metropolitan Water Supply of Melbourne, speaking of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> as a gentleman with whom he has been intimately acquainted for over twenty years, and testifying to his exceptional skill as an engineer. Then we have <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pitt, Chairman</inline> of the Melbourne Harbor Trust, and a large contractor in Victoria, finding himself justified in stating that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> is a thoroughly qualified engineer. We, further, have <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Falkingham</inline> declaring that he employed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> for a number of years as an engineer in connexion with big contracts, and found his work and capacity satisfactory on every occasion. Last of all, we have the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Zeal's testimony, which places it beyond any doubt whatever that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> is a man of some standing in the engineering world. As regards his private character, I should like, first of all, to say that it is about the meanest possible thing that a public man can do to attack the private character of another man so situated that he can make no direct reply to the charge. </para>

                                <para>- Yes, his general character includes his private character. It is these dirty insinuations and innuendoes, instead of straight-out charges, which make such attacks most contemptible. If he could have met on terms of equality, the persons who have made these charges, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> would probably have taken his two traducers and knocked their heads together. Let these men meet <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> on terms of equality, and we shall see what the result will be. It is a lucky thing that these testimonials to which I have referred are at hand. </para>

                                <para>- He is an engineer of ability, as is proven by these testimonials. The honorable senator cannot prove otherwise. I have given the authority of men of undoubted standing in the engineering world as to the competency of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn.</inline> We have testimony as to his private character from <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Madden, who speaks of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> as a gentleman who has been personally known to him for many years, and as a man of high integrity and good professional standing. </para>

                                <para>- If honorable senators opposite, who are prepared to make insinuations, are game to do so, let them stand on their feet like men and do so. They should not sit like so many cowards and make charges which they dare not rise and make in a straightforward way. It is a pity that when these testimonials were presented to the Minister, he did not take copies of them, that they might have been on record from the date of the application. But they are here now, and have been in existence for years. A remark was made in another place expressing surprise that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> did not think it necessary to put all his testimonials on record. That may have been due to his modesty. Though, it was suggested in another place that he had not such a thing about him as modesty, it is quite evident that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> had splendid documentary evidence to prove his capacity, and did not consider it necessary to produce it. Another statement made is that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deane</inline> did not approve of the appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn,</inline> but a reference to the file of papers connected with the appointment will show that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deane</inline> recommended that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn,</inline> with other engineers, should be appointed. </para>

I have now convincingly disproved all the cowardly innuendos which  have been hurled against this gentleman. If I belonged to a party which made such charges, and which declined to withdraw them when they were shown to be absolutely false, I should feel thoroughly ashamed. All these accusations were made for political purposes. Their authors were ready to' take away <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn's</inline> character and to cast any sort of aspersion upon it, merely for party purposes. They were prepared to indulge in all kinds of scandal for the sake of scoring a few political points. That is a mean and vindictive attitude for anybody to adopt. </para>

                                <para>- The name of the gentleman is well known, and only the rules of debate prevent me from mentioning names, and thus making my exposure complete. Never in that gentleman's history has he been known to appoint a Labour man to any position. The present Government have removed that " boycott," hence all this hue and cry. But, having removed it, I hope that in future men holding Labour views will receive a fair deal in connexion with all appointments which require to be made. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> is possessed of very high engineering ability. If the attack upon him had been confined to his professional qualifications, it would not have been qf so mean a nature as it is. But an attempt has been made to cast aspersions on his private character, and it is the duty of those who know him to defend him from such aspersions. I am pleased, indeed, to have this opportunity of placing upon record testimonials which cannot be challenged - testimonials which prove beyond the shadow of a doubt that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn's</inline> private character is good, and that his engineering skill is all that can be desired. I hope that, in future, before any attack is made upon an officer appointed by the Government to any position, their critics will have some ground for their attack. I have shown that, in this case,, they have none. Their only excuse is that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline></para>

Was it necessary for him to obtain the consent of our political opponents before he could become a Labour man? I say that he has as much right to hold Labour views as others have to hold Fusion views. The Labour party can take credit to themselves for having freed the civil servants of the Commonwealth from the political thraldom to which they were subjected in the past. In the future I am glad to say that they will not be victimized in any shape or form because of their political views. </para></speech>

                            <para>. - In seconding the motion, I venture to say that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie has rendered a service to the community, and1 to one citizen in particular. During the past fortnight we have heard a great deal regarding a certain appointment which has been made by the Government in connexion with the construction of the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway. That appointment has been discussed in the press and in this Parliament, and, like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie, I was privileged to listen to the attack which was made upon the Government in that connexion in another place. I would not object to that attack so much as I do, if those responsible for it had been just in their conclusions. Had they any idea of equity, they would not have been so splenetic in their accusations. The genesis of the whole trouble is that the Government dared to place an important public work under the control of a man who holds views consonant with those held by the Ministry. The method of the attack which has been made on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn,</inline> not only in this Parliament, but in a certain section of the press, has been cowardly in the extreme. That gentleman has been arraigned, as it were, not only at the bar of Parliament, but at the bar of public opinion. So far as the bar of Parliament is concerned, he cannot appear there to defend himself, and; as an officer of the Commonwealth, he cannot very well reply to the criticism which has been levelled against him through that section of the public press which has assisted in the attack upon his professional qualifications and his private character. When a man has been appointed by a Government to a responsible position every member of this Parliament has the right to see the file in which all the correspondence relating to the appointment is contained. Therefore, when a member of </para>

                                <para>- When a member of Parliament has the file before him, sir, and is investigating a certain appointment, it is only fair that he should view both sides of the question. As far as this investigation has gone there have been quoted only references which emanated from public men who held Labour views - Ministers of the Crown and members of the State Parliamentary Labour party in Western Australia. I venture to say that, these opportunities being given, it would have been only fair to quote other men who hold entirely different political views from those of the man whom this gentleman was attacking. But it was convenient, evidently, not to quote their opinions, and I heard him say : " We will turn this down," in order that it might be proved according to his own mind that it was a political job. I should not mind the attack on the professional qualifications of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> were it not for the fact that aspersions have been cast upon his private character.

                                <para>- The attack was made on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn,</inline> not only in Parliament, but outside it. That is why I stand here as a member of this Senate to defend a citizen of Australia.  His  ability as a professional man is in question. I notice that after all the spleen which has been vented in various quarters there is a suggestion now that a Select Committee be appointed to inquire into the abilities of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn.</inline> Is it fair first to arraign a man before the bar of public opinion, condemn him, malign him, vilify him, and, after that attack has failed, to ask for the appointment of a Select Committee to inquire into the matter? To my mind that does not savour of British justice. Had that course been taken in the first instance, it would have met with my ready assent, because a Select Committee would have taken evidence from both sides, and not <inline font-style="italic">ex parte</inline> statements. I would have been prepared to stand or fall by its verdict. But once a man has been arraigned at the bar of public opinion, vilified, and condemned, it is useless to ask any body of men possessing a shred of common  sense to hold an inquiry. The opposition to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> has come from a party who failed to do anything which had even the semblance of an attempt to secure the construction of the trans-Australian railway. So soon as this Parliament determined to build the railway, so soon is this opposition brought forward to delay its construction in every sense of the term. It is a case of sour grapes. Because they lacked the ability to do anything, and because the line is now to be constructed, they are acting in opposition to its construction. With regard to the attack made on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chirm's</inline> professional ability, I desire to read two testimonials' which have been supplied to me. The first is from the Melbourne Water Supply, and reads as follows - </para>

I think that we must all recollect a case which was nearly successful. I do not propose to deal with the character of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn,</inline> because, as far as I know him, he can very well look after his own reputation. I have undoubted evidence of his capability, but I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie has produced sufficient evidence that those who have attacked <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> in so dastardly and so cowardly a way ought, if they have any manhood in their composition, to go in sackcloth and ashes for the next four or five years. </para>

                                <para>- I think so, too. The animosity displayed in the attack, as well as its object, must be apparent to the merest school-boy. When it is charged that this is a political appointment, one would almost think that a political appointment was something new in the history of politics. My candid opinion is that the present Government are not half doing the thing as they ought to do, I think that those who have been familiar with Australian politics for the last quarter of a century are aware that every appointment of this character has been made with political ends in view. I do not see the slightest harm in appointing a good man to a good position, even though he is carrying the stain of being a member of the Labour party. Even a member of that party may possess ability ; in fact, some of them have very nearly demonstrated that they do. </para>

                                <para>- Never to my knowledge has a Labour man been appointed to any position by the other side. I do not think that any crime is chargeable against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> other than that he holds political views that are not shared by those who would not only govern Western Australia, but would be kings of the universe if they possibly could. That is precisely the position. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> has the courage of his convictions. He holds sensible political views. He expresses them in an intelligent, sensible manner, and he uses his franchise with the fortitude of a man who knows exactly what he is doing. The only mistake that I think has been made in connexion with this matter - though it may not be a mistake - is of a different kind. I have sometimes wondered, since the discussion on this subject began, and since the evidence became so clear, whether it was not a mistake that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> was not given absolute control over the railway. Taking the evidence of his ability to handle a work of this kind, I question whether any man on the job has credentials equal to his. Therefore 1 say that if a mistake has been made, it may have been made in that direction. Those who have brought this discussion about - the traducers of this man - those who abused their position to traduce him, knowing that he was helpless to defend himself - are out for his blood. They are out for the blood of all Labour men if they can get it. But I do not think they are likely to get it in this or any other case. </para>

                                <para>- That is exactly the remark I was about to make. They have sucked the blood of Labour men long enough, and those who carry Labour principles in their souls to-day know exactly where their friends are. I trust that the present Government will always weigh well the capabilities of any man whom they appoint to any position. I could find fault with one or two appointments which they have made. I could find fault with them not because the persons appointed were Fusionists, but because it would have been much better if more capable men had been chosen. However, I am not going to make any charge against anybody. I am simply going to read another piece of evidence that has come to hand in regard to the abilities of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn.</inline> It is the evidence of honest men - of men who, I think, no one in this Senate will doubt. I am sure that no candid man will think that they put this testimony on paper for the mere sake of doing so. I <inline font-style="italic">have</inline> before me a letter dated - </para>

He carries with him the goodwill and respect of all those with whom he has been associated both for his professional ability and private character.

These people have declared that this man, although he does possess a political faith that is different from theirs, is nevertheless worthy of our confidence because of the high attainments that he possesses, and of which he has given evidence in his professional career. When we come in face of testimony of this kind, it must emphasize the fact that honorable senators opposite and their associates have set themselves with double-dyed purpose to get this man's blood at any cost. </para>

                                <para>- If it be correct, it is quite sufficient evidence for me. If I were asked to give a vote as to whether this gentleman possessed the engineering capacity and ability necessary for the position in which he has been placed, I should have no doubt whatever, after being assured of the fact mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie. I notice Senator Cameron sitting opposite tome with his usual bright smile on his face. I am going to call him as a witness also, because I think he has been over the line to which I refer. I ask him whether a man who could draw the plans for that line, and could successfully superintend its construction, does not, in that very fact, possess a high recommendation for his ability in railway construction? Although I have not been over the route, of the proposed railway from Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta, I have carefully read all the papers that have been presented to Parliament in connexion with it, and am quite certain that no portion of the route presents engineering difficulties in any respect approaching those which had to be overcome on the line from Kelly Basin to Mount Lyell. On the evidence of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> 's work in connexion with that line alone, I should have no doubt of his professional capacity and engineering ability justifying his appointment to his present position. </para>

                                <para>- I have already said that it is not now in use. But the closing of the railway had nothing whatever to do with the engineering skill displayed in its construction, and does not affect the question of whether it is a good line or not. As a matter of fact - and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron</inline> knows this perfectly well- the railway was abandoned because the Mount Lyell Company became amalgamated with the North Lyell Company, and the whole of the amalgamated company's work was done in the other direction, over the old Mount Lyell Company's line. Consequently, there is no use for the line between Mount Lyell and Kelly Basin now. But that is not the fault of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn.</inline> It is due to want of foresight on the part of the directors of the North Mount Lyell Company, who did not foresee that they were likely to amalgamate with the Mount Lyell Company. The professional ability of this gentleman has 'been questioned, not only by public men, but by the powerful newspaper press of Australia. He is stated to be absolutely unfit for the position in which he has been placed. But the fact that he was sufficient of ah engineer to be employed by so eminent a firm of railway contractors as Messrs. Garnworthy and Smith- in the construction of this line, is quite enough to prove that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> then had sufficient engineering ability, despite the smiles of my honorable friend opposite, who tries to question his ability, and fails miserably. </para>

                                <para>- I forgive <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron;</inline> I do not ask his forgiveness. I know nothing whatever as to the correctness of the statement that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> was given his position because he was a supporter of the Labour party at the recent elections in Western Australia, and has been known for years to possess Labour views. I do not know whether he possesses Labour views or not, but I am satisfied that the reason urged had nothing to do with the appointment. The fact that that aspect of the matter has been made so much of in another place, and by a section of the press in Australia, justified <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie in the stand he took today in making his vigorous defence of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn.</inline> However, I shall, in common with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson,</inline> express my view of this matter. If the political sympathies of persons ought to be taken into account in making appointments, it is clear that the present Government have not given many of these important positions to men of their own political colour during the last two and a half years. I believe that on the contrary they have in many instances turned down applicants for positions possessing Labour views, because of a little timidity that if a person appointed to a Government position were well-known to to a supporter of the Labour party his appointment might be questioned. Appointments should in every case be made on the merits of the applicants, and if that principle had been followed by other Governments in the past there would be many more men possessing Labour views holding important positions in the Public Service to-day than there are. In all the circumstances this charge comes with a very bad grace from the quarter from which it has been made. It is a fact which cannot be disputed that for years political appointments were made from one side in Federal and State politics, and it was not from the side of the Labour party. </para>

                            <para>. - I should hardly feel contented if I allowed the debate to close without directing attention to the extraordinary position which has developed this afternoon. Perhaps I should congratulate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie upon the skill with which this matter has been handled. There is not an honorable senator present who could give his word of honour that the quotations made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie as to attacks upon <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> had not reference to a debate in another branch of this Parliament. That being so, although the matter was handled so skilfully as to apparently escape your notice, sir, every honorable senator opposite knew that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie was violating the Standing Orders of the Senate. </para>

                                <para>- I felt it to be my duty to direct attention to this, because if by subterfuge we are enabled to evade our own Standing Orders, honorable senators must agree that sooner or later we shall get into inextricable difficulties in debate. I listened carefully during the debate for something which would . justify the assumption . with which the motion was evidently brought forward, and I say that the disclosures, for I call them disclosures, which have been made here to-day do not help the position of honorable senators opposite. First of all, let me say that, so far as I am aware, no attack whatever was made on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> in another place, but upon the Government who appointed him. I have listened to hear something which would meet the seriousness of that accusation. The statement was made that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> had been appointed to a certain position, not because he possessed qualifications, but because there were recommendations from supporters of the Labour party that he should be given the appointment because of his Labour sympathies. </para>

When this accusation was first launched, it was in the presence of the Minister responsible for the appointment, and in reply he never suggested that the file of papers placed on the table, and covering the appointment, contained any such references as those which have been read here to-day, and which for all I know may or may not be genuine. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable senator who moved the motion absolutely failed in the first courtesy hitherto extended from honorable senators on one side to those on the other. When a motion for the adjournment of the Senate is to be moved, it has been the invariable practice to give notice to the Government, because such a motion is usually taken advantage of to attack the Government for something they have done or have failed to do. In this case the motion was submitted for quite another purpose, and in the circumstances it would only have been courteous if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie had informed members of the party he proposed to attack of the course he intended, to follow. </para>

                                <para>- The Minister himself said that he had nothing to do with) testimonials ; he did not make the appointment because of any testimonials. What did he make it for? I point out that it is. a very curious thing, if these papers were in the possession of the Department of Home Affairs at any time, that they were not put forward with the papers which appear on the file. </para>

                                <para>- Whether it offends; or does not, I take the liberty of expressing., the opinion that when this charge was. made, and the Minister of Home Affairs was on his defence in connexion with it, if he had known of the existence of these testimonials, he would have produced them,, in the hope of refuting the charges which were made. I say again that the fact that these papers did not count in the appointment justifies the statement that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> was appointed, not because of the qualifications he is now said to possess, but because of his political sympathies which were amply testified to in the papers which do appear on the file. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie has said that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deane</inline> recommended the appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn,</inline> and he quoted1 a memorandum from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deane</inline> dated  I 41:n  February last. All I have to say in answer to that is that on the  6th  February,, eight days before, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deane</inline> wrote in a, minute which is included in the file - </para>

                                <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> is quite right. I have not been politically associated with him for a number of years without having been afforded an opportunity of forming an opinion of what constitutes a first-class engineer in connexion with underground contracts. I would be a much bigger fool than my enemies accuse me of being if I had not learned a little. However, I have said all that I desire to say upon this matter. In conclusion, I merely wish to express the sincere hope that in future, when it is desired to bring under review in this Chamber any matter which has formed the subject of debate elsewhere, the proper and orderly course will be followed. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie laughs, but he knows perfectly well that this afternoon he practically placed our Standing Orders at defiance. He will not pretend for a moment that during the course of his speech he was not quoting from the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report of a debate in another place. </para>

                            <para>. - From what has been said by the Leader of the Opposition, it is quite evident that there was abundant justification for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie's  action this afternoon. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has stated that that action clearly proved that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> was appointed to the position of Supervising Engineer of the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway without any regard to his professional qualifications. Seeing that he has listened all the afternoon to this debate, and that he has had an opportunity of perusing the file of papers relating to this appointment, he must be wilfully blind to he facts. I have known <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> for a considerable time in Western Australia as a keen critic of railway matters in that State. There is one phase of this question which should be closely studied, but which has not received any attention - whatever. At the present time we have in power a Government which is backed up by a substantial majority, and which is intent upon building this transcontinental railway in accordance with a policy by which it has steadfastly stood in the past. I refer to the policy of railway construction under departmental supervision - a policy which has been stubbornly opposed by the authors of these cowardly attacks upon <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chirn:.</inline> If honorable senators opposite could forget for a moment that they are steeped in political partisanship, and if they could imagine themselves - I admit that it would be an effort of the imagination - impartial-minded citizens, they would recognise that the first duty of the Government in undertaking a work of this magnitude is to select men to control its construction who thoroughly believe in that policy. Will any fair-minded individual urge that the Government have any other duty cast upon their shoulders? In the past the Labour party have stood solidly for the policy of construction which they propose to adopt in connexion with this gigantic undertaking, and that policy has been consistently opposed by honorable senators opposite. </para>

                                <para>- Yes. This transcontinental railway is about to be constructed under Ministerial control, without the intervention or the presence of a contractor, and that policy has not recommended itself to our critics. Does anybody seriously suggest that it is not obligatory upon the Government to ransack the whole of this island continent in order to secure the best men to carry out this undertaking in accordance with that policy? Yet the . insinuation has been made that the Ministry have wilfully ignored the qualifications, or lack of qualifications, possessed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn,</inline> and have fixed their eyes upon one thing only - his alleged loyalty to, or the service which he has rendered to, the Labour party. But unless Ministers are worse than lunatics, it is obviously their first duty to appoint to these leading positions the very best men in sympathy with their policy who are procurable. Now, there are three officers who are chiefly concerned in this undertaking. First, there is the Chief Engineer, upon whose shoulders will rest the duty of supervising the whole of the work in a general way.  His  lieutenants will be two in number, and upon them will depend the supervision which is exercised upon those portions of the work which are intrusted to their control. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Saunders,</inline> at Port Augusta, must see that he acts loyally to the Government, who desire to demonstrate to the world that the day-labour system is a more economical and a better system than that of contract, from the taxpayer's point of view. The same remark is applicable to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn,</inline> who will be stationed at the other end of the line. He will have to accept his share of the responsibility in that connexion. Honorable senators opposite would have the electors of this country believe that the Government deliberately shut their eyes to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn's</inline> qualifications, and selected a partisan to carry out this important work. Is such an idea feasible to anybody who is not hopelessly steeped in partisanship? Looking at this question broadly, I say that the Ministry would be acting blindly, that they would be unworthy of the trust which has been reposed in them, and that they would be taking the first step towards political suicide, if they placed in charge of this undertaking men who did not possess the very first qualification of their profession. We have been told over and over again that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn's</inline> only qualification is that he has rendered casual service to the Labour party. But I would point out that incompetency on his part, or on the part of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Saunders,</inline> must inevitably mean undermining the popularity of the Labour party throughout Australia. It must mean want of economy in the construction of this important line of railway, and consequently the putting of the Ministry before the country in an unpopular light. For honorable senators opposite to urge that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> was appointed because of some casual service which he has rendered to the Labour party is to admit that they are bereft of all argument. I hold in my hand  a number of credentials relating to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn.</inline> I have some from members of the Liberal party in Western Australia. </para>

                                <para>- I am not going to bandy words with the honorable senator for the sake of giving that party a better description. For a long time in Western Australia a very keen discussion was waged over the railway system of that State, and the opinion was held by both political parties that bad management was clearly in evidence. It remained for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn,</inline> in a series of articles published in the <inline font-style="italic">West Australian</inline> and other newspapers, to point out that there was something radically wrong with that management. So convincing were the arguments which he advanced that men in the Liberal ranks of politics at length recognised their cogency, with the result that they placed their opinions upon record. Unfortunately, I have not time to read the whole of those opinions. </para>

                        <para>But I have no hesitation in saying that the country is under a deep debt of gratitude to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> for the enormous amount of labour he must have put in to make the analysis which have appeared. Evidently the Government recognise it, because - I do not know whether it was in  His  Excellency's Speech or in the policy speech delivered at Bunbury - there is a statement made that the comparison made between Western Australia and Queensland was sufficiently serious to justify a careful examination, and that these various charges would have to be reduced. The Premier has not given <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> the credit for it, but I think it is obvious to any fair-minded person that as the statement was made shortly after the second contribution appeared, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> is deserving of credit. I hope he will get something more than credit, because the task involved a considerable amount of labour and time. </para>
                        <para class="block">I come now to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pennefather,</inline> who for years was a member of the Forrest Government. He held the portfolio of Attorney-General in that Ministry, and his opinion of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn,</inline> who has been so violently assailed by my honorable friends opposite, as expressed during the course of a debate in the Western Australian Parliament, is thus recorded - </para>
                        <para>Having read in the press not so very long ago some cogent, trenchant, and lucid articles written by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn,</inline> members will, I feel sure, realize that these representations have borne fruit. There has been extravagance of an unchecked order, and the sooner it is checked the better for the community. Had the railways been properly and efficiently managed there would have been no necessity to bring down measures for the taxation of land or commodities. </para>
                        <para class="block">In the same debate, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sommers,</inline> Minister of Lands in another Liberal Administration, placed on record his opinion of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn's</inline> ability - </para>
                        <para>The Railway Department has been brought very prominently before us, at least, the great cost of running the concern has; and those able articles written by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn,</inline> referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Moss,</inline> have set people thinking. </para>
                        <para class="block">That I should read these extracts, sir, after all you have heard about the qualifications .of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn,</inline> must look like an attempt on my part to paint the lily, or to add another hue to the rainbow. As regards qualifications, notwithstanding the statement which has: been made elsewhere that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> had not won his spurs, that he had no credentials to offer, save the fact that he had worked for a short time for the Labour party, the Senate has heard an account of what he has done and where he has worked. He enjoys a Queensland reputation, a New South Wales reputation, a Victorian reputation, and a Tasmanian reputation, while in Western Australia he has received unstinted eulogies from men who belong to the political, camp whence this wholesale, unmerited, and contemptible condemnation comes. This is an unworthy, a mean, and a mud-like attempt on the part of honorable gentlemen opposite and elsewhere to slander a man who has no chance to defend himself. </para>

We have heard that he has done a great amount of engineering work in various parts of Australia; that he is a noted engineer; but no evidence has been brought forward in support of that, statement from any person who has employed him. We have merely had a list of names read - Attorneys-General and all sorts of men - but not one of them is an engineer. What effect would a recommendation coming from either of the Ministers opposite have upon a person who intended to employ an engineer ? </para>

                                <para>- It is very little, indeed. I do not suppose that the Minister of Defence or the Honorary Minister knows much about engineering. Recommendations can always be brought forward to show that some man is a great engineer. That is all we have got to-day in the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn. Senator Lynch</inline> has just arrived from Western Australia, and has read statements which have been read before and published in the press. I think that if a man were applying for the position of engineer, the first question he would be asked by any reasonable person who was thinking of employing him would be, " You tell me that you have been in Australia for forty years, but where did you work before ? " I do not want to hear a recommendation of an engineer by an Attorney-General, no matter on which side of politics he may be. I want to hear recommendations of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> from his employers, who, I submit, are the only persons entitled to certify to the work which he has done. Have such recommendations been submitted ? </para>

                                <para>- I do not know whether anything has been raked up during the last eight or ten days, but when this matter was last under consideration the Minister in another place did not bring forward any evidence that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> had a qualification as an engineer. He read extracts and recommendations from Attorneys-General, ex-Ministers, storekeepers, and others. If an honorable senator were going to build a house he would not accept from an architect a reference from a member of the Senate who knew nothing about his qualifications; on the contrary, he would say, " Show me some samples of your work. Get me a recommendation from a previous employer showing that you are qualified." I do not know whether <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> is qualified as an engineer or not. He was appointed, no doubt, for services rendered. I should not find any fault with the appointment if he were qualified to fill the position. We have heard that he was an engineer in Melbourne; but have we found one person here ready to vouch for him? </para>

                                <para>- If any man can say that there is a letter from an engineer in favour of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn,</inline> it is a very weak and poor one, indeed. If I were going to select a manager for a mine, I would not act upon letters of recommendation received from politicians who know nothing about mining ; but I would ask every applicant to prove to me that he was qualified to look after the mine. That is what any reasonable man would do. I leave it to the plain-thinking people of this country who read <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> to say if they would select <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> for this position on the recommendations which have been quoted. He may be the best man in the world, but in my opinion his references are not of the right sort. All that I have heard so far has been that he would make a good traffic manager or a Railway Commissioner. According to some of the letters which have appeared in the press, he was recommended as a Railway Commissioner for Tasmania, <inline font-style="italic">hut</inline> he did not receive the appointment. In Queensland we have a Railway Commissioner who is, I believe, one of the best in Australia, but he is not an engineer. He employs an engineer to carry out the engineering work. A man may know all the details of railway management from A to Z, but that does not make him an engineer. According to the testimonials I have heard, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> is a very good man with his pen. I have known men to apply for a position who could produce a report which would make one's hair stand on end, but for practical work they were of no use. I hope that that is not the case with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn.</inline> The adjournment of the Senate has been moved to-day to try to whitewash this gentleman. If he is the man he is reckoned to be, he needs no whitewashing. I ask the people to say whether they will accept the recommendations which have been produced in support of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn's</inline> appointment. I have known men to come along with a bundle of references, which emanated from persons who knew nothing about the work required to be done. It is a notorious fact that some persons can always get references by some means or other. It is necessary to find out the capability of; the man who gives a reference to another man.

We had an exhibition of that sort of thing at the recent State elections in Tasmania, when the arguments used against our party had relation to preference to unionists and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher's</inline> travelling allowances, whilst our policy was hardly referred to at all. This matter will come in handy for the purpose of attacks on Ministers, and that is why the Opposition have brought it forward. Their tactics remind me of a balloon ascent which I witnessed in South Australia recently. A man went up in a balloon, and while he was hanging on to a trapeze spinning round and round like a tee-totum in mid-air </para>

                                <para>- With peculiar results, judging from what we know of him in the Senate. The testimonials that have been read to-day concerning <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> furnish abundant evidence of his practical ability. When we hear testimony of that kind, we do not want to know whether a man has graduated in any university. As to the value of university training, we have only to look to the Ministerial benches to-day. One Minister has told us that he was once a hod-carrier, and now he occupies one of the highest positions in the country. I do not think that there is one member of the present Ministry who has had a university training. Yet I claim that in administrative ability this Government can challenge comparison with any Government that has occupied the Treasury benches of the Commonwealth Parliament. Ministers have been criticised on various grounds. Sneers have been uttered with reference to the nationality of one Minister. Surely the party opposite must be gravelled for lack of matter when such means are employed. </para>

                                    is measuring other people's corn by his own bushel again - a frequent habit of his. I believe this debate will have the effect of showing the people of Australia that this appointment was not only justified, but was absolutely the best one which the Government could have made in the whole of the circumstances.

                            <para>. - The discussion arising out of the motion of adjournment submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie has had something to do with an engineer, and indirectly with engineering. Apart from that, we have had another manifestation of the attitude of an engineer in engineering other things than railway works. I am reminded of a remark attributed to Daniel O'Connell, who said on one occasion that he never saw an Act of Parliament through which he could not drive a coach-and-four. It is somewhat extraordinary that this discussion should have arisen under our Standing Orders. It may be a matter for compliment or perhaps regret that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie has found a way through the Standing Orders which we thought was absolutely closed, and has driven, not only a coach-and-four, but a whole locomotive through them. It is possible that honorable senators on this side, or, for that matter, any member of the Senate, may better the construction <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie has been able to place upon the' Standing Orders, or it may be necessary that they should be reféred  to the Standing Orders Committee for further consideration. </para>

                                <para>- I do not know whether he has done so, but he is certainly described on the papers as a civil engineer. I have not looked through the papers so closely as fo be able to say that he is or is not a civil engineer in the sense in which the term is understood in the engineering world. When a person is described in official papers as a civil engineer, or when he  so describes  himself, it is understood by engineers the world over that he has a diploma from some engineering institute or some university. It would appear that the Minister of Home Affairs, in permitting <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn'</inline> to be styled on official papers as a civil engineer, is responsible for giving currency to what I believe is an absolute falsehood. If the officials of the Home Affairs Department have permitted <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> to be described" as a civil engineer upon official papers, they have given currency to what, speaking from an engineering point of view, is an absolute falsehood. If by any paper or letter written by himself <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> has led the officials of the Department or the Minister of Home Affairs to regard him as a civil engineer, he is guilty of issuing false currency so far as regards the ordinary meaning conveyed by the term civil engineer, as understood by universities and engineering institutes. If a person describes himself as a civil engineer, or writes the letters "C.E." after his name, it is generally understood that he is a graduate of some university, or is in possession of a diploma from some engineering institute. </para>

                                <para>- I have not challenged him. I repeat that this question has been raised by honorable senators opposite. It is only, from the papers which have been submitted in connexion with the case, that, in my capacity as a member of the Senate, I know that, by himself or by the Department of Home Affairs, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> is referred to as a civil engineer. It appears to be unchallengeable that, in the ordinary sense in which the term is used, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> is not a civil engineer. If he has not so described himself, he is not to blame, but the Minister of Home Affairs is to blame for permitting him to be so described in official papers without any explanation. I take now the extraordinary statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> " stands alone." From one point of view he certainly does stand alone, but it is an absolute absurdity to say of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> that, amongst engineers, he stands alone. That is the greatest humbug that could be uttered. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> wishes us to understand that in the Commonwealth, or out of it, there is not a better engineer, and that, in that sense, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> stands alone, the statement has only to be made to disclose its absurdity. But if it is intended to suggest that, in the particular circumstances of this case, the relation of the present Government to the construction of the Kalgoorlie- Port Augusta railway, and the manner in which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> secured his appointment he stands alone, the remark is amply justified. The professional officer responsible for the construction of the railway is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deane. His</inline> views upon the railway were discussed at length upon a previous occasion in the Senate. This Parliament approved of his report, and of his appointment as the responsible engineer in charge of the work. He should be saddled with the responsibility of saying who should be appointed to assist him in the work. Did <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deane</inline> appoint <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn?</inline> Even the Minister of Defence, with all his dexterity, is unable to dispute the statement that there is a memorandum from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deane,</inline> dated 6th February, in which he says that the Minister had already decided to appoint <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn,</inline> and that he recommended certain other officers to work at the other end of the railway. Why did <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deane</inline> make this distinction between the appointments he recommended and the appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> by the Minister? We have so far had no explanation of that, and I do not believe that any explanation of it is possible. I do not think that Ministers will attempt to explain this most damning ambiguous statement by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deane.</inline> It would not have been unreasonable if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deane</inline> had said that he appointed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. So-and-so</inline> to take charge of the work at one end of the railway, and some other person to take charge of the work at the other end, as his subordinate constructing engineers. But, in his memorandum of the 6th February, he refers to the appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> as one which the Minister of Home Affairs had determined to make. There is a further significance in this memorandum. It must be remembered that the Minister of Home Affairs, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deane</inline> also, knew that he was not controlled by the Public Service Act in making these appointments. He had an absolutely free hand, and, at the time <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deane's</inline> memorandum was written, he had already approved of the appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn. Mr. Deane</inline> directs marked attention to that fact. </para>

During the past few weeks the press of Australia has had: a good deal to say in connexion with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn's</inline> appointment, and complaints have also been made, principally by opponents of the Government. The charge has been laid at the door of the Ministry that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> was appointed to his present office on account, not of his professional abilities, but of _ his Labour principles. I was surprised and disappointed this afternoon to hear the Leader of the Opposition - finding that he had no argument to advance in refutation of the material which had been submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie - sink so low as to say, regarding certain statements, " They may be true, or they may not be true."

                                <para>- The Leader of the Opposition condemned the Government for not having appointed these engineers, and declared that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deane</inline> appointed them. I claim that the Government should have appointed the engineers "of this railway. They are responsible to the people for the carrying out of that work, and next year they will have to answer to the electors for these appointments. It is manifest, therefore, that the Ministry should have appointed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn.</inline> The Leader of the Opposition also stated that the only papers which appeared on the file in reference to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn's</inline> appointment were testimonials from Labour Ministers in Western Australia. May I direct his attention to the fact that on that file there also appears a reference from the Honorable J. G. Foulkes, ex-M.L.A., for Claremont, who is not a Labour Minister. </para>

                                <para>- In that reference, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Foulkes</inline> states that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> brought about reforms in the railway service of Western Australia which saved that State at least ,£100,000 per annum. The Honorable W. J. Butcher, another ex-M.L.A., and a hide-bound Con:servative, makes a similar statement. The file also contains references from the Honorable W. T. Loton, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Randall,</inline> exSpeaker of the Legislative Assembly of Western Australia, both of whom are strong opponents of the Labour party. If the Fusion party affirm that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn's</inline> appointment is a political job, they must admit that they had more to do with it than had the Labour party, because that gentleman has more references from the former than. he has from the latter. He has only three testimonials from members of the Labour party, whereas he holds about fifteen references from members of the Conservative party. The papers submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie this afternoon will, I am pleased to know, be circulated throughout Australia per medium of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> so that the public will have aft opportunity of learning that the charge which has been levelled against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> is absolutely groundless - that as an engineer he possesses high qualifications, and that as a man the utmost reliance can be placed in him. Regarding the objection which has been taken to the appointment of men who hold Labour views, I hope that in future the Government will give preference - all other things being equal to such men. Other Governments have adopted this rule, and the present Ministry should follow their example. I should like to know why consideration should not be extended to Labour sympathizers by a Labour Government in the same way that consideration has been extended by the Fusion party to men who sympathize with their views? I am very pleased that this matter has been brought forward, and1 I am certain that this debate will be productive of a great deal of good. </para>

                                <para>- As soon as the opportunity is given to both sides to state their case, honorable senators opposite want to run away. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> has already pointed out when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn's</inline> appointment was first attacked, only certain portions of the file Of papers relating to it were made public. The other portions were suppressed. It was thus made to appear in the public press that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> had no qualifications whatever. It is the duty of those who are responsible for his appointment to let the public know what are his qualifications. To-day we haVe been told what they are, and I venture to say that they cannot be attacked. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers</inline> clamoured for the recommendations of men who had employed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn.</inline> Well, those of us who knew the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Zeal know that' the whole of his business life, until he entered politics, was devoted to civil engineering. We also know that he was very sparing in his friendships, and in dealing out compliments to anybody. I was surprised to learn that he had paid such a fulsome compliment to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn,</inline> because - as everybody knows - he was particularly chary about giving a recommendation to anybody. He was a recluse practically, and had very little to say about anybody. But he was a practical man, a civil engineer of high repute, and one who made his money in railway contracts. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers</inline> may hold any opinion that he chooses, but I venture to say that no honorable senator opposite will urge that the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Zeal gave that recommendation to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> without 'Knowing the man to whom he was giving it. In addition, three other recommendations were read by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie from persons for whom <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> had worked - I refer to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Garnsworthy, Mr. Moriarty,</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Falkingham.</inline></para>

In view of all these circumstances, I can understand that the Opposition are very anxious that this matter should be lost sight of, at least whilst Parliament is in session and the facts can be placed before the public. But if Parliament closed, we should have the country flooded with literature of the same class as that in which this attack originated. My honorable friends having originated the attack now desire to call a truce till the parliamentary shutters are up, because whilst Parliament is sitting, the public have an opportunity of hearing both sides of the case. And we are quite content to let the public judge cm the evidence submitted here this afternoon, as well as the evidence brought forward by the Opposition previously, both in the press and in Parliament.. We have no reason to doubt what the verdict will be. </para>

                                    cannot prevent that being done. This is the' third attempt to damage the Government. First, we had the Brisbane strike; second, the political appointments in the Northern Territory ; and now,

The condemnation of the Brisbane strike was going to ring in the ears of the people up to the time of the elections, but the Opposition never mention it now. The condemnation of the political appointments in the Northern Territory was going to be kept alive, but the Opposition never mention them now. Now the matter of

                                    Largie has driven a " locomotive" through the Standing Orders. When -the public see that, on the Government side, so far from there being a desire to hide anything, there is a desire to drag the whole business before the country, and when they hear that the Opposition object to the discussion, they will be able to draw their own conclusion as to which party is in the right.

                            <para>. - I rise to direct the attention of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers</inline> to the fact that, in the early part of this debate, there were references read from practical men who had employed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn.</inline> One reference was from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. E.</inline> O. Moriarty, Engineer-in-Chief for Water Supply, in Sydney, and it was to the effect that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> had done work in his department for six years. It is a very high-class recommendation, indeed. Another reference was quoted from Garnsworthy and Smith, to testify that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> was engaged by them as an engineer for eleven years, and they praised highly the work which he did. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> also received references from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Falkingham,</inline> a railway contractor in Victoria, and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Zeal, a civil engineer. I feel quite sure that when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers</inline> made the statement he did he was not aware that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> had received these splendid recommendations from practical men. I rose chiefly to thank <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie for putting me in possession of facts which I never dreamt were in existence. </para>

They' may have really believed that there were some slight grounds for the statements made in another place, which gave rise to considerable discussion in the press throughout the Commonwealth, and which would lead plenty of persons to believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> was appointed, not because of his ability as an engineer, but simply because he had succeeded in obtaining recommendations from two or three Labour men. Until I heard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie this afternoon, it never entered my mind that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> was so highly recommended, and that he was so competent and capable a man in his profession as his references prove him to be. These are not mere professional recommendations, which would be tossed to any person, but recommendations from men who understand and appreciate the value of his services. It will come well from those who have attacked the appointment to do tardy justice to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline></para>

The only thing I regretted when 1 was listening to his speech was that he was not playing with the Australian cricketers in England, because; if ever there was a man who could make the best of a bad wicket, it is he. </para>

                                <para>- I have no doubt that the honorable senator will score under any conditions. For a fortnight at least the press has been spreading the story not only in Australia, but abroad, that a man had been appointed to a high position whose one qualification is that he has a friend at court in the Labour movement. To-day, when references which cannot be questioned are submitted, the position is altered. </para>

I do not object to criticism from the Opposition side, because it is their duty to keenly criticise the actions of the Government. This discussion will not be reported in the press. The facts will be smothered up, and only those persons who get <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> will realize how great an injustice has been done to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn.</inline> I hope that ultimately every justice will be done to this gentleman, seeing that his references have emanated from responsible men. One reference was written after eleven years' experience of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn,</inline> and another inference after six years' experience of his work. </para>

I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers</inline> about the desirability of always getting a recommendation from a man who has had some experience of an applicant's work. Any one who reads or hears read the recommendations of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> must admit that apart altogether from quibbling as to whether or not he is entitled to use the letters C.E. after his name, the recommendations are of a character which justified the Government in appointing him. In my opinion, no other applicant possessed the experience and ability which he did, and there is no man in Australia to-day who can claim to take that position over his head. It was only fair to the country that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie should have taken this course, and I thank him for placing before me facts which I never dreamt were in existence. I cannot imagine that a party would, merely for the sake of getting a passing political advantage, direct a serious attack upon the Government. If we are to judge by the space which has been devoted by the press to the discussion of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn,</inline> this is the worst appointment which the Labour Government have made. </para>

If we are to judge by the space which has been devoted by the press to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn's</inline> appointment, it is considered by the Opposition to be the worst appointment which the Labour Government have made. Although, during their period of office, they have made hundreds of appointments, yet from one end of Australia to the other, this is held up as absolutely the greatest instance of political favoritism on record. When the facts are gone into, every fair-minded man must admit that this so-called bad appointment is justified on the ground that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> holds the highest possible credentials which any man in the engineering profession could possess. If the Opposition are honest, they will admit that the Government were fully justified in making it, having regard to the ability, the experience, the character, and the capacity of the gentleman whom they appointed. </para>

                                <para>- And from that discussion has arisen press criticism. The place where this question was discussed, and the alleged attacks were made on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn,</inline> was the place where his character ought to have been vindicated, if it required vindicating. Moreover, if we are to have duels of this sort between the Houses, we do not know where the matter is going to end. It may be that to-morrow or next week a member of the other House may feel impelled to say something with regard to the debate that is taking place here in order to vindicate his action and conduct, and by that means we may bring the Houses into conflict with each other. If it were impossible to vindicate <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn,</inline> except by bringing the matter up here, no doubt that would be a perfectly right course to pursue. But the point which I wish to make is this - that it is well to observe in spirit the intention of our Standing Orders, that we should not bring on a conflict between the two Houses of the Legislature. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie made some very strong statements. He did not mention the names of those to whom he referred, but every one knew who they were. Suppose that those gentlemen felt called upon to reply to those statements? When would the trouble between the two Houses come to an end? </para>

                                <para>- I am not mentioning names, but every one knows to whom <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie referred. It is deplorable that such incidents should happen in the relations between the two Houses. All the papers that have been read to-day in regard to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> should have been laid upon the table in the other House, and should have been ordered to be printed. Then there would have been an opportunity for members of Parliament to refer to them. But they have been delayed until they were brought up here to-day. The whole gravamen of the charge against the Government is that the appointment was made for political and party reasons, and that the best man available for the position was not honestly chosen. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable senator is quite right - in America they; call it graft. Evidently the Government did not know that such testimonials were in existence as have been read here to-day. The Minister admitted that he did not know of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Zeal's testimonial. We are justified in concluding therefore that the Government made the appointment on the papers they had before them, and those papers made strong reference to the value of the services rendered by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> to the Labour party. </para>

                                <para>- Exactly ; if the appointment was made honestly it must have been made in view of the facts of the case presented to the Government at the time. Therefore the appointment was made simply because of the services rendered to the Labour party, and not because <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn's</inline> professional qualifications were superior to those of any other applicant. If his professional qualifications were the best available he was, of course, entitled to the appointment, no matter what party he supported. But I draw attention to another feature of the case. On the 6th February, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deane</inline> said, " I understand that the Minister intends to appoint <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn,"</inline> and he went on to say what, in his opinion, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> should be instructed to do. On the 14th February, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> was appointed. </para>

                                <para>- No, by the Minister of Home Affairs, who had the responsibility of appointing him. On the 22nd February, eight days later, appeared the advertisement from the Home Affairs Department asking for two engineers to take charge of the Kalgoorlie railway. The applications had to be sent in by the 22nd March, and on the 14th February one of these appointments was filled. </para>

                                <para>- I do not care whether <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deane</inline> recommended him or not j the Minister was responsible. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deane</inline> was the Minister's official, and could not, of course; do anything against the wish of the Minister, who is allowed to exercise discretion in such matters. He could not dictate to the Minister, and it would be deplorable if be could. I want it to be noted strongly that the appointment was made on the 14th February, whilst on the the 22nd February an advertisement was published inviting applications for the positions to be filled. The public notification was, therefore, a sheer piece of bluff on the part of the Minister, and was merely intended to deceive the public as to what was being done. Any one who looks at the whole of the particulars of the case, and at the action of the Minister subsequently, must see that this was not an honest appointment, and that no attempt was made to obtain the services of the best man available: I do not attach much . weight to the point that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> has had the letters " C.E." placed after his name. A man may obtain a diploma from a university and be entitled to use those letters; but, at the same time, many a man who obtains valuable practical experience is called " C.E." by courtesy. Of course, if a man practises in the medical profession without having a diploma, and calls himself " Doctor " he is liable to prosecution, but, nevertheless, any individual who chooses may call him " Doctor." That appears to have been the sort of thing that occurred here. </para>

                    <para class="block">This motion is not brought forward for the reasons for which I submitted a motion in connexion with the Victorian electoral division, because there is no necessity for a change in the number of members to represent Western Australia. In common with Tasmania, Western Australia is entitled to five members in the House of Representatives, irrespective of population. At present Western Australia has one member in the House of Representatives for every 56,423 electors, as compared with one member for every58,265 electors in the neighbouring State of South Australia. So that Western Australia is rapidly approaching the position of States in which the quota is based upon the population, and in perhaps another year it will be actually on a level with those States. With respect to the causes which have made an alteration in the distribution of Western Australia necessary, I may be allowed to quote from a memorandum, as it contains references to a number of figures - </para>

                        <para>An alteration in the number of members to which a State is entitled is not the only ground on which the redistribution of a State may be undertaken. Section 23 of the Electoral Act, which deals with the matter, provides, in addition, for two other cases in which the redistribution may be undertaken - </para>

                    <para>As the variation in three out of the five divisions exceeded the margin allowed by the Act, the Government of the day, on 1st April, 1909, issued a proclamation directing that a new distribution of the State be made. That distribution was duly made, presented to Parliament on 15th October, 1909, and rejected by the House of Representatives on 23rd November, 1909, by 26 votes to18. The election for 1910 accordingly took place on the divisions laid down in the 1906 distribution. </para>
                    <para class="block">So that, at the time of the 1910 election, there was that disproportion in the number of electors in the various divisions. The responsibility for that state of affairs rested with the Government of the day, because, when the redistribution was submitted, we had the singular spectacle of the Minister moving the adoption of a scheme entirely deserted by his fellow Ministers, who crossed the Chamber to vote against him. </para>

                            <para>- I think that the electors will very probably make the right honorable gentleman forsake his birth-place at the next election. It may be remarked here that the reason for the inclusion of the name " Dampier " is that the town of Coolgardie, from which the existing electorate of Coolgardie took its name, is, under the distribution now proposed, included in the Kalgoorlie electorate. Coolgardie would not, therefore, be a suitable name for the new electorate now proposed, and the name " Dampier " has been adopted because it has historic association with Australia generally, and particularly with Western Australia, and with the particular part of the coast line of that State included in the new division. After this redistribution was made, in compliance with the law, copies of it were posted at the various post-offices throughout Western Australia, and objections to it were invited. The following objection was lodged by the Australian Labour Federation - </para>

These districts have never in any way been associated with that portion of the State. All their means of communication and interests, both commercial and otherwise, have been with the Geraldton districts. Further, both the Mount Magnet and Cue divisions have a fairly large percentage of persons engaged in the pastoral industry within their borders, and their number is increasing, and must in the future comprise a greater proportion, consequently it is all the more difficult to understand why they should be cut off from their immediate surrounding districts, and grouped with others some hundreds of miles distant. </para>

                    <quote>
                        <para>It will be observed that the division, as now proposed, includes all the Eastern Gold-fields' and most of the Murchison Gold-fields' State Electoral Districts; in fact, the only such district excluded from the division is the Murchison Stale Electoral District. By this combination, a division has been created which contained on the 19th of December, 191 1, an electoral enrolment of 34,031 based upon the Commonwealth Electoral Department's official figures. The apparent electoral strength of the division on that date is, therefore, as already stated, 3,640 <inline font-style="italic">in excess of quota.</inline> The Commissioners fully appreciated the nature of the " community of interest " existing between the Murchison Gold-fields and the coastal districts round Geraldton, and have given due consideration to these before including the Cue and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Magnet</inline> Electoral Districts in the proposed Division "D." It has also been noted that no means of communication by rail exist between the Eastern and Murchison Gold-fields, and that presumably, therefore, these arguments might be used in favour of including the Mutchison Goldfields with Division " E " principally on account of what may be alleged to be " community of interest." The Commissioners, however, are of the opinion that " community of interest," when applied to a large industry like the gold-mining industry of Western Australia, would not be. correctly interpreted if based upon geographical considerations only. Whilst admitting that the geographical position should be given all the consideration which is due to it, the Commissioners hold the view that a much wider interpretation should be given to the term. </para>
                        <para>There are many interests of paramount importance to all gold-fields, such as the general trend of mining legislation governing the conduct of mining operations, the statutory regulation of labour on mines, the inspection of machinery, the railway rates for gold-fields' supplies, and other important items of consideration which the Commissioners claim should receive prior consideration to purely geographical pointl of advantage or disadvantage. This view, no doubt, has also in the past actuated Commissioners when defining the boundaries of goldfields' divisions, as it will be observed that under the present distribution the " Kalgoorlie " Division includes also the " Phillips River " goldfield, which latter does not appear to the Commissioners to have any more " community of interest " with the " Kalgoorlie " gold-field than have the Murchison gold-fields. Turning again to the existing " Coolgardie " Division, it will be observed that the "Coolgardie" and "Yilgarn " Gold-fields are included in this division, together with the " Murchison " gold-fields, and it, therefore, appears that even under present distribution the " Murchison " fields are included in a division containing the " Coolgardie " and " Yilgarn " gold-fields, which distribution has been suggested and approved under statutory obligation on the part of previous Commissioners to consider " community of interest." On these grounds, the Commissioners considered it their duty to include in Division " D " also the larger portion of the " Murchison " gold-fields, and indeed no option was open to them, as the present "Kalgoorlie" Division was short of the quota to the extent of 10,136 electors on the 19th December, 191 1, and, therefore, an increase was compulsory under the provisions of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. The only direction in which such increase could reasonably be effected was by <inline font-style="italic">adding to that area further gold-fields in which</inline> . 1 sufficient number of electors were included to satisfy the views of the Commissioners that the intention of the Legislature had been given due effect to. </para>

                        <para>Looking at the recent population statistics of this State, it will be observed that in the year 1910 the population increased numerically by 11,496, and in the year1911 by 17,301. For the first three months of 1912, for which preliminary returns are available, the population of the State increased by 3,095, the rate per month by which the population increased in 1910 being 950, in rgn, by 1,450, as against 1,032 during the first three months of 1912. At the time when the new Commonwealth rolls are likely to be put into practical use, viz., about April, 1912, the population of this State must have considerably increased, and in order not to over-estimate such growth, the Commissioners have calculated on an average monthly increase in the total population of about 1,000, which would mean a monthly increase in the enrolment of about 500. During the fifteen months, therefore, between the iqth December, igii, for which the Commonwealth Electoral Department's figures have been used in this Report, and the time of the next general election, there will be an estimated increased enrolment of, approximately, 7,500, which will raise the present quota by 1,500, bringing that figure up to 31,891. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">Up to that point no exception can be taken to their conclusions, because they have not differentiated between one division and another. They have taken into consideration the general increase in the population of the State in order to ascertain what would be the quota at the time of the elections. The contentious part of their case is contained in the subsequent portion of that paragraph, which reads - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>The increasing enrolment, however, is not expected to materially affect Division " D," where for the last few  yeaTs,  as already stated, a constant decrease in enrolment has been recorded, and in the opinion of the Commissioners such enrolment will at best remain stationary for the next twelve months. The reason why the Commissioners expect such comparative improvement in the conditions of electoral enrolment in Division " D " is based upon the assumption that the steady decrease recently experienced may possibly get a check on account of the fact that the commencement of the construction of the Trans-Australian railway will prevent further depletion of electors. It is, of course, impossible for the Commissioners to give an estimate of the proportion of the increase that will be attracted to each of the four Divisions " A," "B," "C," and "E," but it is considered probable that the figures which will be available showing the actual enrolment for the forthcoming elections next year will prove that in no case will there be more than a slight variation from the quota, either above or below. </para>

                            <para>- The Government are prepared to ask Parliament to indorse the scheme. We take up the attitude that, whilst it may not be an entirely satisfactory one, there is not sufficient reason to justify us in asking Parliament to reject it. This is, of course, and I think should be, a non-party question. In my opinion, it  would be a bad thing if the distribution of a State into electoral divisions were made a party question. Those who usually support the Government are quite free to take whatever attitude they think fit, and to vote in accordance with their judgment. </para>

                    <para class="block">The amendment clearly expresses a very patent fact when it states that it does not appear evident that the Commissioners have taken into consideration diversity of interest, particularly when applied to Cue and Mount Magnet, in connexion with the Kalgoorlie electorate. 'I shall deal with that point at a later stage. In my opinion, the failure of the Commissioners has been entirely due to the fact that they overlooked several very apparent points of evidence which they 'might have taken into consideration. They gave the Kalgoorlie electorate 3,640 voters above the quota, and they did that, as the Minister of Defence has pointed out, because of the trend of a shifting population for a considerable number of months. They gave Kalgoorlie this excess of the quota eighteen months prior to the date of the election anyhow. They assumed the right to prophesy. They claimed to know what is going to happen for Kalgoorlie. No matter how wise or clever he may be, I do not see how any man could candidly say that he could for one month tell the future of a district like Kalgoorlie, apart altogether from the possibility of the transcontinental railway taking a very large number of persons to the electorate. It is quite true, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> has interjected, that Kurnalpi has shown signs of a revival, and no honorable senator, not even the Commissioners, dare say that it is not going to be a very large and prosperous field ; and this is in the Kalgoorlie electorate, for which there was no provision made by the Commissioners, inasmuch as the revival has taken place since they made their report. Then Ora Banda is in precisely the same position. Again, the railway will of necessity add a very large number of voters to the Kalgoorlie electorate. Moreover, the Commissioners did not give the slightest consideration to the policy of the Government of Western Australia. Had they done so they would have realized that the State Government have already taken the preliminary step in an undertaking that will very largely increase the population of the Kalgoorlie electorate, and that is by deciding to build a railway between Norseman and Esperance. There is going to be a fairly large agricultural population catered for by the railway. It will open up a very large area of land on which settlers will be found in the very near future. The Commissioners did not take this fact into consideration at all. I have the same right to make a prophecy as they had ; in fact, I do not know that I have not a little more right to do so, because, notwithstanding all their wisdom and knowledge of Western Australia, probably some of us here have had a considerably wider experience, and possess a better knowledge of its industrial conditions, than do some of the men who took upon themselves this kind of work. I might as well prophesy that before polling day there will be 9,000 or 10,000 electors above the quota in the Kalgoorlie electorate, instead of the 3,640 electors credited by the Commissioners'. I  come now to the question of diversity of interest. If I could only take honorable senators with me from Cue to Mount Magnet, and then to Kalgoorlie, they would be rather astounded when they read in the report of the Commissioners that diversity of interest had been taken into consideration by them. If any sane man will tell me that there is the remotest semblance of a connexion between the interests of the people of Cue and Mount Magnet and those of the people of Kalgoorlie,' I shall withdraw the amendment and everything I have said. But I want honorable senators to understand that the Cue and Magnet people have always been connected with the Coolgardie electorate. They have always been connected in every way with the Port of Geraldton. All their business transactions are there centred. There is not the slightest connexion between them and the people of Kalgoorlie. Therefore, how any one can for a moment imagine that the principle of community of interest has been taken into consideration is more than I can fathom. Certainly in putting the Magnet and Cue people into the Kalgoorlie electorate, the Commissioners have succeeded in considering diversity rather than community of interest, to this extent - that it would be impossible to travel the whole world, and find any two communities of people more diverse in their interests than is the case with Cue and Magnet and Kalgoorlie. In order to establish community of interest between those places, you have to come down to Perth from Cue or Magnet, and then go from Perth to Kalgoorlie. That is the only mode of transit that brings those communities into relation with each other, I have .no desire to prolong the discussion. I am more inclined to take a vote than to talk about, the matter. If I talked for a week, I could not add very much more to what I have said, and it can undoubtedly be borne out by every Western Australian senator. The realm of prophecy to which the Commissioners have flown is as ridiculous as the idea that they have established community of interest. It is quite possible that before the election takes place, the difference in regard to the quota will be more than double that which the Commissioners have placed before us. I submit this amendment in order that the Commissioners may have an opportunity of soundly reviewing the position. </para>

                            <para>. -  In  seconding the amendment I have much pleasure in pointing out that in addition to the reasons which have been given by the mover of it, attention should be paid to the danger, in indorsing a report of this kind, of setting up, a very undesirable precedent. It is plainly <inline font-style="italic">admitted</inline> by the Commissioners, in the course of their report, that they have based the proposed distribution mainly upon a condition of things which they imagine may happen in a few years' time. If the Senate indorsed a position of that kind, we should be treading upon a very dangerous path. In this respect, the report is not in keeping with the express instructions given to the Commissioners in the electoral law of this country. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> did not sufficiently emphasize the fact that the population in the district is increasing. The Commissioners take the view that it will decline. But we must have regard to the policy of the State Government, who are going to connect by railway the important port of Esperance with the gold-fields. It is quite plain that by doing so an important seaport will arise there which will be another factor in increasing the population in the division. It is plain to any person who looks at the map that when this railway is built - a line to which the Western Australian Government are committed by a statement in the Governor-General's Speech - not only shall we have a vast area of agricultural land brought into a condition of cultivation, but also a seaport town of very great importance indeed, which will be the means of increasing the number of voters in the division. </para>

                            <para>- Our State has provided many homes for a number of people from the honorable senator's State, any way. As to the prospects in the immediate future, the Commission to which I am referring set it down as a conservative calculation that this unoccupied agricultural land is capable of settling no less than 500 families within a very few years. A country that is capable of providing homes for so many will probably be the means of establishing a couple of towns in the neighbourhood. That development, combined with the seaport to which I have already referred, points to the possibility of an increase of population. Then there is the railway connexion to be tit ken into account. All these factors go to show that an enormous calculation has been made by the Electoral Commissioners. They imagine that the population will decline whereas the factors which have been mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> and myself go to show that a large increase in population will take place within these very divisions. Then there is the broader ground o;&gt; which the Commissioners ought to take their stand, namely, the condition of things as they are, and not as they are likely to be in the course of a few years. I know the country very well, and know what is capable of happening there. There is first the mining centre referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson,</inline> Kurnalpi. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> was out there as one of the early prospectors, and is aware that the district has since absorbed a much larger population. That mining centre to-day is attracting hundreds of gold-seekers. Some of them are on very good gold indeed. The Yarraberidi district floated in London lately a couple of mines, which, on the most modest calculation, are capable of giving employment to at least 300 or 400 men. These developments are taking place in what was regarded in the past as being an abandoned gold-field. These so-called abandoned gold-fields are within the boundary lines of the division where the Commissioners say the population is on the decline. What warrant is there in these facts - the development of gold-mining on' the one hand, and the development of agriculture on the other - for supposing that the population is likely to decline? On the top of these considerations comes the transcontinental railway, which no one can deny will attract population. When honorable senators recollect these facts, they will, I think, quickly come to the conclusion that it would be wrong in practice, and would establish an undesirable precedent to adopt the recommendations of the Commissioners. I venture to say that an error of judgment has been committed which we should take the present opportunity of rectifying. </para>

It asks the Senate to affirm that the report should, be sent back to the Commissioners with a more or less definite direction to them. I tried to raise this point by interjection when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> was speaking, but I was repulsed in such a manner that I regret that I have to call attention to the point now.

If that contention be correct, we must see what the Act lays down. Section 16 of the Electoral Act prescribes that in making a distribution of a State into divisions, the Commissioners must give due consideration to community or diversity of interest, means of communication, physical feature, and existing boundaries of divisions ; and, subject thereto, it is provided that -  the quota of electors shall be the basis for the distribution, and the Commissioner may adopt a margin of allowance, to be used whenever it is necessary, but in no case shall such quota be departed from to a greater extent than one-fifth more or one-fifth less. </para>

                    <para>If we negative the motion submitted by <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> Minister of Defence, the next step is for the Minister to direct the Commissioners to propose a fresh distribution of the States into divisions. The amendment proposes more than that, and my point is as to whether we can give an intimation to the Commissioners in any form. The Commissioners are supposed to know the Act, and we must assume that they have acted under section 16, and have carried out its provisions. Section 22 gives us the power to accept or to negative a proposed distribution, but the question I raise is whether it gives us the power to intimate to the Commissioners that they have not properly interpreted section 16 of the Act. The question arises, also, as to who are to be the judges as to whether the Commissioners have taken into consideration all the provisions of section 16. </para>

The Commissioners are, under the Act, untrammelled in their distribution of a State into divisions; they have sent on to us a scheme which we can either approve or negative, but neither House of this Parliament can, in my opinion, negative a motion for the adoption of any proposed scheme with an intimation to the Commissioners. If that were not so, either House might coerce or force a particular division upon the Commissioners. </para>

We must be guided in matters of doubt by a strict interpretation of the Act of Parliament in question, and in view of the clear terms of section 22, I say that we can accept a proposed distribution or negative it, in which latter case the Minister may direct the Commissioners to propose a fresh distribution, and we can do no more. It may be out of place for senators from other States to interfere in a dispute as to the distribution of Western Australia into divisions; but, in the circumstances, I ask your ruling, sir, as to whether the amendment is in order. </para>

He has asked you, sir, to rule that the Senate cannot do something on which the Act of Parliament to which he referred is silent. That represents the greatest strength of the point of order which the honorable senator has submitted. The Electoral Act says that in certain cases we are to do something, and it goes no further. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger takes up the extraordinary position that, because the Senate is not commanded to do something by an Act of Parliament, it therefore cannot do it. Let me remind the Senate of the attitude which at least one of your predecessors in the chair took up . when asked to decide points of this kind. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Richard</inline> Chaffey Baker, when  President  of the Senate, always took up the attitude that it was no part of his business to interpret the Constitution or any Act of Parliament. It was his business to interpret and enforce the Standing Orders, and no more.

How much less would he have entered upon an interpretation of the Acts of this Parliament, which are the creation of the Senate in conjunction with another branch of the Legislature ? It is ridiculous that the Senate should be bound, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger desires, not to do something which it is not forbidden to do by any law in existence. It was only common sense on the part of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> to propose that, in sending the proposed distribution back to the Commissioners, we should go a little further and give them an intimation of the reason why the Senate has taken this action.

The resolution- then adopted would be, in compliance with section 22, a resolution disapproving of&gt; the proposed distribution. Though it would also contain a reason for the disapproval that would not make it any less a resolution disapproving of the proposed distribution. Whether the Commissioners will take any notice of the reason assigned for our action, or whether that reason will come before them officially, is altogether beside the question of whether the amendment is in order. Clearly, if it be carried, it will express disapproval of the redistribution scheme, and, therefore, it must be in order, even if it be judged from the stand-point of the Act itself. I wish to say, further, that the question of what procedure will be adopted should the amendment be carried is one which does not arise here, and upon which the  President  is not called upon to rule. </para>

The former defines the conditions under which the Commissioners shall act, and? the latter sets forth what the Minister and? Parliament may do with their report after they have so acted. The question as to what the Commissioners may further do if we assign reasons for our disapproval of this scheme is not involved at all. Suppose that the motion for its adoption were negatived. It would then be referred back to the Commissioners, who might make the same redistribution again. It appears tome that we have a right to do whatever we are not forbidden to do by law, provided' that any action we may so take is not inconsistent with any part of that law. To say that we cannot do anything which the law does not expressly empower us to do is to reverse the position that we ought to take up if we wish to preserve the liberty which, we already enjoy. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger has argued that because the Act does not specifically empower us to assign reasons for our action in rejecting this scheme, therefore we cannot assign reasons. I hold that if our reasons are not inconsistent with the general terms of the Act, it is absurd to suppose that we shall in any way invalidate our conclusions by adding our reasons thereto. </para>

The Minister of Defence, in reply to an interjection, stated that the redistribution scheme which is now under consideration is not altogether a satisfactory one. But he gave no reason why it is unsatisfactory. He did, however, say that he did not think the unsatisfactory portion of it warranted the Government in turning it down. Three Commissioners were appointed for the purpose, of redistributing the electoral divisions of Western Australia. They know the country well. I suppose that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stenberg</inline> knows it as well as does anybody. They have gone carefully over it with a view to securing an equal quota for each division. </para>

                                <para>- I intend to vote with the Government, because, so far, no honorable senator has given me a sufficient reason for voting against the motion. There is no reason why I should discount the report of the Commissioners. I have no evidence that they do not possess the necessary ability to do the work. This report, it seems to me, was compiled very carefully. I think that the Commissioners did their work conscientiously, and with a desire to carry out faithfully the duties laid upon them. I am not prepared to send back their report unless I am shown that that course is absolutely necessary. </para>

                            <para>. - I am in very much the same position as the last  speaker.  I feel very great reluctance in recording a vote which, perhaps, might be interpreted by some persons as an evidence of dissatisfaction with the work of a very conscientious commission. On the other hand, having heard the statement of facts made by Senators Henderson and Lynch, I should be very reluctant indeed not to. take their guidance in a matter affecting Western Australia. I am generally inclined to deal with these questions fairly. I think that, on this occasion, the balance will go down in favour of my colleagues here. </para>

                                <para>- Had the Minister of Defence put up an argument in favour of the motion as strong as that given by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> for sending the report back, I think I should be found voting behind the Government, as I generally am when I am wanted. I have another reason for sending the report back. We are up* against another grievance, and that is that the country constituencies are getting altogether too large for individuals to represent. There is a means of giving the country districts better representation. If this scheme be referred back to the Commissioners, the Government may take advantage of the interval to find a means of reducing the size of country constituencies by adding to the number of the senators, as the Constitution empowers the Parliament to do. Take, for instance, the State which I have the honour to represent in common with others. It is almost impossible for individuals to represent the huge constituencies which are to be found in that State, and the time is rapidly approaching when some steps must be taken to do what can be done to limit the size of country constituencies. I hope that the Government will give some consideration to the fact that the Constitution empowers Parliament tr&gt; decrease the size of constituencies, and to increase the number of senators. </para>

                            <para>. - I am sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> will have the sympathy of every honorable senator in the very painful circumstance ir* which he finds himself placed this evening. But I have no doubt that the result of this debate will console him very much, and help him to survive one of the ordeals of political life. This discussion serves once more to illustrate and bring home the fact that Parliament is not a satisfactory place in which to enter final judgment in regard to the distribution of a State into electoral divisions. </para>

I do think that if honorable senators will forget for a moment the particular distribution under consideration, and recall situations in which we have been placed before, they must recognise, for reasons with which we are all familiar, that Parliament is not a satisfactory place in which final judgment can be entered up in regard to the work of Electoral Commissioners. </para>

                                <para>- I do not want to suggest for a moment that Parliament should not be consulted in the matter, because I think it should have the fullest opportunity it can secure to make its views known to the Commissioners. At the same time, I hold that there should be somebody to finally determine whether a scheme should be adopted or rejected. Otherwise, it must be quite obvious that it is possible to reject any scheme which is submitted, and by so doing to retain one which would lend itself to very questionable methods. </para>

                                <para>- Suppose that the Commissioners did exercise the best judgment which they possess, and that the Senate, for reasons which may seem good to it - either good in the interests of the country, or good in the interests of somebody else - should decide to turn down the distribution, the next election must be taken on the present divisions. Every honorable senator will, I think, admit in private conversation that there should be some means of arriving at finality. In my opinion, circumstances will sooner or later force Parliament to de-. vise some machinery by which, after it has made its views known, perhaps two or three times, an effective distribution can be secured prior to an election being held. I do not think that anybody can dispute that contention. </para>

I am not at all certain that they are called upon to do that. I remember that some few years ago the Commissioners for New South Wales took it upon themselves to allot a larger representation, in proportion to numbers, to country districts than they did to town electorates. I am not going to argue whether that is right or wrong, but I deny that the Commissioners had a right to bring their personal views to bear in shaping our electoral law in that way. </para>

It seems to me that the Commissioners for Western Australia have not only committed somewhat the same error, but have also made the mistake of expressing their reasons. On that point I should like to quote one sentence from a paragraph to show how far they assumed that they were entitled to do that which I think the law does not allow them to do. They say - </para>

                                <para>- They are men who ought to have known the meaning of words. I thought at first that they had ,fallen into an error in the selection of terms, but, after looking through other portions of their report, I am led to think that they accepted it as a duty to shape the policy in this regard, and sought to give effect to it. To that extent, I might be inclined to sympathize with some of the views expressed by honorable senators opposite. But we cannot shut our eyes to this fact - that the Commissioners have, in making these divisions, acted entirely in conformity with the Act as it stands. If they had not put in their report any reasons for what they have proposed, I doubt very much whether any one would have found fault with them. They have observed the requirements of the law, as far as the numerical strength of electorates is concerned. The Commissioners propose that the largest electorate shall have 34,030 electors, which is 3,640 above the quota. The alternative suggested by the Australian Labour Federation would give 3,026 in excess of the quota. That is to say, the objection to the present proposal rests mainly upon the fact that the Commissioners propose a district with 3,640 in excess of the quota, whilst the alternative presents us with an excess nearly as large. There must be some other reason than that of mere numbers, and I listened carefully to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> to try to learn what it was. Whilst I cannot speak from personal knowledge as to what would be- the best scheme, I have not heard any argument which disposes of the statements made in this report. One of the chief objections is on the ground of numbers, and a second is the consideration! of equality of electoral strength in order that one vote should have the same value as any other. The alternative method does not meet either objection which may be' urged against the report. The next point is community of interest. There is a paragraph in the report, on pages 10 and n, which reads as follows : - </para>

                                <para>- It might take four days to go from one part of an electorate in New South Wales to another. A place may be so far from the centre of an electorate that it may be nearer to another electorate. These divisions may be nearer "to the electorate from which they are taken than to the centre of the electorate to which they are to be added. That is quite pos.sible; but does not that apply to dozens of -electorates ? </para>

                                <para>- It may mean that. It may mean anything; but I do venture to say that similarity of industry does represent what the average man will regard as community of interests. When you say that a gOld-field is added to a gold-field, there is much more community of interest than was the case when it was proposed, for instance, to put in the settlers to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> referred just now. Let me remind honorable senators of circumstances which I am sure, as they will acknowledge, exist in every State. Take Broken Hill, in my own State. Within a few miles of it a portion of an electorate has to go right away to the chief centre - either Bourke or Cobar, I forget which. The people there might say, "Look at the distance; we have no community of interest with Bourke or Cobar; our community of interest is with Broken Hill." But the requirement of our law - which requires equality of numbers, as far as possible - simply shows that they cannot get to the town to which they feel attached. For these two reasons - the fact that the alternative suggested is only a little better from the stand-point of numbers than the  proposal of the Commissioners ; and secondly, that the Commissioners show that all that they have done is to add one goldfield to others - it seems to me that unless some stronger reason can be given than any that has yet been adduced, we ought not to depart from the report of the Commissioners. If a further reason is required, we have it in the action of the Government itself. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> may be supposed to understand the conditions of his own State as well as any senator from Western Australia. He may also be supposed to be quite as anxious as they are that the interests of Western Australia shall be conserved. Having looked at the objections which we have heard to-day - and probably having had to meet others which we have not heard - the honorable senator is quite. satisfied to adopt the report. </para>

                                <para>- The fact is that the Commissioners have conformed to the law, and have not exceeded the legal percentage above or below which the number of an electorate is permitted to go. But the curious thing about this matter of prophecy is that those who have taken such strong exception to what they say the Commissioners have done, have indulged in the practice themselves. Both <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> while speaking on this matter and finding fault with the Commissioners for looking ahead, treated us to prophecies of their own. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> painted in rosy colours a. picture of the great population which is about to gather in certain districts in Western Australia. </para>

                                <para>- I am not joking when* I say that we have no reason whatever to suppose that any section in Parliament will' arrange an organized opposition to defeat a proposed scheme of distribution in order that the electorates of a State may be gerrymandered to suit its own political interests. If a scheme is obviously fair, and* the reasons in support of it submitted by the Commissioners - should they be foolish enough to give reasons - are evidently just, there will never be found any large number of members of Parliament who will* endeavour to defeat it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> was unjust and ungenerous, as usual, by innuendo, in making out that the acceptance of the Victorian scheme was*due to the fact that it suited the politics of this party. The opposition to the adoption of the proposed scheme of distribution for Western Australia is based" on logical and sound reasons. First of' all, we object to the Commissioners basing; their distribution on mere anticipations which, in a country like Australia, may be proved, in a very short period of time, to be- entirely wrong. The movements of population in a sparsely settled country, particularly if it be a gold-bearing country, are likely to be sudden and extensive. They may not in some instances be permanent, but in other instances the effect produced may continue for a generation. When Coolgardie and Kalgoorlie were discovered, no one dreamt that there would be so large a population settled at each place for so long a time. The same may be said of Broken Hill and of Wyalong. At Wyalong there were but a few persons at first, then there were some thousands of miners settled at the place, and as mining declined agriculture took its place. We are justified in view of such facts in objecting to a distribution based on anticipations of the future. In the next place, a careful perusal of the report of the Commissioners discloses the fact that they have ignored the paramount considerations of community or diversity of interest, physical features, and means of communication. This was a very serious error of judgment 011 their part. There may be difficulty in arriving at anything like evenly-balanced electorates, and in order to justify any serious departure from equality of numbers the Commissioners must show that one or all of the paramount considerations referred to will be served by such a departure. It should be shown that in order to accomplish the greater good it is necessary to commit the lesser evil, but in this case the Commissioners propose a departure from equality, and also from community of interest. They justify one wrong by doing another. They submit a departure from equality as a reason for separating communities which should be connected. They give as a reason for departing from the principle of conserving community of interest the fact that they desire to put more than the quota into one electorate to meet a declining population which they anticipate will continue to decline. A decline in the population of a mining district may continue for years up to a certain point, and then, apart from the possibility of the discovery of new finds, a gradual increase of population may take place through land in a mining district being brought under cultivation. There are many places in this continent which were looked upon merely as mining fields, where, after the mining population commenced to decline, a steady influx of people has occurred, gradually building up, not a sensational, but a permanently prosperous condition of affairs. The districts of Cue and Mount Magnet are so far separated from the centre with which they are associated in the proposed scheme of distribution that to go from those places to what might be described as the capital of the division in which they are included would involve a railway journey which it would take as long to make as it would take to go across New South Wales. A person going from Mount Magnet or Cue to Kalgoorlie would have to go first to the capital of the State, and then in quite another direction for some hundreds of miles. </para>

                                <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> cannot support his argument in this connexion that we, as senators, have to travel very lo:ig distances in New South Wales, because we are dealing here with electorates for the House of Representatives. I consider that it would be a dangerous precedent to adopt a distribution of Commissioners founded on their ideas as to the probable movements of population in the future. It seems fairly obvious that the construction ot a railway to Esperance by the State Government, and the opening up of lands on either side of it, will lead to an accession of population in that part of the division which will quite make up for any reduction in the population of the gold-fields. The Commissioners should have taken the figures supplied by the census, and should have kept in view the paramount considerations of community of interest, physical features, and means of communication. As they have departed from these, not to conserve an equality of electors in the different divisions, but in order to excuse a gross inequality of electors, I  am compelled to accept the reasonable and forcible arguments put forward by honorable senators from Western Australia, and I shall vote for the amendment. </para>

                            <para>.- - I said during the discussion of the point of order that without very grave reasons honorable senators from States other than Western Australia should hesitate to oppose a motion of this kind. I meant to convey that we should in the circumstances be guided very much by the reports received from the Electoral Commissioners, and the action taken by the Government upon these reports.- It is a very delicate matter for an honorable senator from another State to record a negative vote upon this motion for the adoption of the proposed scheme of distribution for Western Australia. I cannot help directing attention to the fact that the Minister of Defence in submitting his motion for the approval of the scheme almost invited the Senate to defeat it. I could not but contrast his attitude on this motion with the pertinacity he displays when submitting a motion or a Bill dealing with defence matters, or with a part of the Government policy which he indorses. There is clearly a conflict in this matter between the Government and their supporters. </para>

                                <para>- Order ! I think the honorable senator should withdraw that statement. The Minister when introducing the motion said that he intended to vote for it. The honorable senator now says that, in his opinion, the Minister would be very pleased if it were defeated. It seems to me that that is hardly in accord with our Standing Orders. </para>

                                <para>- The Commissioners have shown, in their report, that they have observed the Electoral Act in making this redistribution of the electoral divisions of Western Australia. I know that honorable senators are divided upon this matter. The Minister of Defence has advanced reasons why we should support his proposal. But upon those reasons it is extremely difficult for us to decide this question. Though the Commissioners have perhaps gone a little beyond the Act by anticipating population, yet I feel that, on the whole, their report is a sound one, and I intend to support it, believing that by so doing I shall be upholding . the law, the Ministry, and constituted authority. </para>
