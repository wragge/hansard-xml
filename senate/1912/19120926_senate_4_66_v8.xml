                            <para>- I can hardly give a definite answer to the question. The honorable senator will understand that as the Commonwealth is not promoting any immigration it is the officers of the States who would have to see to the examination of persons. All that we can do is to prohibit the landing of certain persons under the Immigration Restriction Act, or the Quarantine Act, and that is being done as far as possible. There are several classes of immigrants coming to Australia, namely, assisted immigrants, immigrants by nomination, and those who do not come within these two categories, and it is only the officers under the Quarantine or the Immigration Restriction Act who can investigate their condition. </para>

                    <para>When the Commonwealth took over the Northern Territory, it did so with a view to the further development of that country, and in the hope of making it a part of Australia that would be fit for the settlement of a considerable population. There may be diversity of opinion as to whether the Government are moving fast enough with respect to the development of the Territory. Some have been blaming us because they consider that we are spending too much money. We can scarcely expect their support in any project that will involve further expenditure. But, in the same breath that they deprecate the action of the Government, those very members of the Opposition are prepared to urge that the only way to defend Australia is by the settlement of a large population. They must recognise the conflict between those two opinions. </para>

                            <para>- The Territory is not one-millionth part filled yet with population of any kind, let alone public servants. Moreover, not one official has been appointed who was not necessary for the promotion of settlement and development. No matter how objectionable the <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> of the officers appointed may be considered to be by some members of the Opposition, they cannot deny the necessity for the appointments. The country must be classified and surveyed, and knowledge must be obtained as to its capabilities before a substantial settlement policy can be carried out. At all events, it must be acknowledged that the country cannot be properly settled without railway conveniences. Consequently, this Bill may be looked upon as only a small modicum of what will be necessary. I shall not suggest that the Opposition will raise any objection to its passage. It is not a measure to provide for construction, but for the permanent survey of a route from Pine Creek to the Katherine. </para>

                            <para>- We cannot do everything at once. There is a limit to the expenditure of public money, and some attention must be paid to that limit. This Survey Bill is a step in that direction in which I am sure every member of the Senate desires the Government to go. Although, however, the survey of 56 miles of country does not necessarily involve the construction of a railway, yet I am sure that honorable senators will recognise that if we carry the Bill we practically pledge ourselves to vote for the construction of the line. To my mind, this railway is urgently required, and ought to be proceeded with as rapidly as possible. </para>

                            <para>- It does not matter what we might as well do; this is what we are proposing to do. I was endeavouring to show why this line should be constructed as speedily as possible. Having taken over the Northern Territory, it is our duty to do all we can for its development. Pastoral settlement is always first settlement of any new country, but the simplest form of settlement cannot be carried on successfully unless those who occupy the lands of a country are given, facilities for the disposal of the produce of those lands. It will be admitted that in order to afford facilities for the disposal of pastoral products it will be necessary to do a great deal more than construct railways. Before they can be effectively dealt with we must have freezing works established at the most suitable port of shipment. The question arose as to the best locality for the establishment of such works in the Northern Territory. Various places were suggested for the purpose, from the west of the Territory, on the shores of the Cambridge Gulf, to the eastern extremity of the Northern coast, on the Gulf of Carpentaria. The advantages and disadvantages of each locality suggested have been carefully considered, and a decision has been come to that the best place for the establishment of works of this description is Port Darwin. If these works are established at Port Darwin, the settlers must be given facilities for bringing their stock to that port. lt has been pointed out that the nature of the country between Pine Creek and the Katherine River is such that stock travelled over it would lose condition, and before they got to Port Darwin would be unfit for freezing or export. The country around Port Darwin is not of such a character that stock might be restored to prime condition upon it. In the circumstances, in order to bring the best country available for pastoral purposes into direct communication with the locality suggested as the best for the establishment of freezing works, it is necessary to continue the railway from Pine Creek to the Katherine River. </para>

                            <para>- All these things, I hope, will come in time. If the honorable senator proposes to wait for a reduction in the price of meat until a railway is constructed from Oodnadatta to the MacDonnell Ranges, he will probably become a vegetarian before his hope is realized. Everything comes to those who wait patiently, and I hope honorable senators will wait patiently until we have the line now proposed constructed, and we shall then be in a position to consider further railway construction. On the subject of the advisableness of establishing freezing works at Port Darwin, it might be as well if honorable senators considered the northern coast of the Territory. Commencing on the eastern side of the Territory, we have the McArthur, Roper, Goyder, and Adelaide Rivers. Then, west of Port Darwin, there are two very important rivers, the Victoria River, which is furthest west, and between that and Port Darwin the Daly River. Some of these rivers are smaller than others, but most are navigable for a considerable distance, and might be made navigable for a much greater distance than at present. It is considered by those who know most about the country that sufficient stock would not be likely to be available for some time on the McArthur and Roper River country. . Going to the west, we find that the State Government of Western Australia, propose to start freezing works on Cambridge Gulf, and if we established ours on the Victoria River or Daly River we should come into close competition with our State neighbours. The officers advising the Government have had to be very careful in reporting upon these questions. The Administrator of the Northern Territory, in framing his report, has taken precautions to secure guarantees with respect to the number and quality of cattle that might be available for shipment at each of the places mentioned, and, taking everything into consideration, he has come to the conclusion that Port Darwin is the most suitable place for the establishment of these freezing works. It is considered the most suitable port of shipment for stock which will be available beyond the Katherine River. The Government have, therefore, come to the conclusion that the sooner we continue the line from Pine Creek to the Katherine the better. There has grown up in the Commonwealth Parliament, as there arises in every Parliament in connexion with certain questions, a certain amount of partisanship. I shall not say party feeling in this case, because honorable senators and honorable members in another place know that the development of the Northern Territory is not a party question. When the Commonwealth took over the Northern Territory from South Australia it was understood to be under a certain obligation to connect the line from Port Darwin to Pine Creek with a line from Port Augusta to Oodnadatta. The people and representatives of South Australia felt that that should be done. That is how I feel myself. I wish to make it as clear as I possibly can that the continuance of the line from Pine Creek to the Katherine River will not be a departure by a hair's breadth from that understanding. If any honorable senator chooses to take a map of the Northern Territory and of South Australia, and to run a straight line from Oodnadatta to Port Darwin, he will see that the deviation necessary to enable it to strike the Katherine River is scarcely noticeable. It is almost a straight line from Oodnadatta through the very telegraph station which bears the name of the Katherine 'River to Port Darwin itself. Consequently the construction of the line, the survey of which is now under consideration, will in no way interfere with the carrying out of the understanding which has been arrived at between the Commonwealth and South Australia. </para>

                            <para>- I will leave the honorable senator to judge that matter for himself. I repeat that from Oodnadatta to Port Darwin is almost a straight line. As a matter of fact, the former is situated on the 135th meridian of east longitude, the Katherine River station is located midway between the 132nd and 333rd meridians of east longitude, whilst Port Darwin itself is a little over the 131st meridian. It will be seen, therefore, that a line from Oodnadatta to Port Darwin would trend slightly west. Consequently, nobody can urge that the proposal of the Government marks a departure in any way from the understanding with South Australia which has already been arrived at. I am not going to say that if the ideas of some honorable senators were carried out, and a connexion were made first with the railway systems of the eastern States, the route followed would be that which the transcontinental line will traverse. I have : nothing to do with that matter. It does not cost me a single thought, because it is the intention of the Minister of External Affairs, as soon as he can obtain properly qualified men, to appoint a Commission, consisting of a railway engineer, an engineer accustomed to harbors and rivers development, and a gentleman who is thoroughly acquainted with land settlement and land survey, and indeed with the Territory itself, to report on railway development in that Territory. Of course, it would be very easy to secure men if one chose to stand at the street corner and call for them. But when we come to examine their qualifications it is sometimes more difficult to make a selection, and I am sure that the Minister of External Affairs regrets as much as does anybody else that up to the present he has not been able to settle upon the individuals who are best qualified to constitute this Commission. But when these three gentlemen are finally appointed, they will go to the Northern Territory, investigate that country from east to west, and will advise the Government as to the route which the railway should follow to connect what will then be the line to the Katherine River station with the railway to Port Augusta. </para>

                            <para>- But that has nothing whatever to do with this question.. That bonus was granted for the export of live cattle. The Government proposals involve a great deal more in connexion with the development of the Northern Territory than the simple export of live cattle. When this Commission has reported the Government will have no hesitation in placing that report before both Houses of Parliament; and arriving at a definite policy with respect to the further construction of railways. I know a little about the railway from Port Augusta to Oodnadatta, and I know that, although various South Australian Governments were repeatedly urged to continue that line from Oodnadatta to the MacDonnell" Ranges, they did not do so. Seeing that they had such a long time to undertake that work, and did not undertake it, I cannot discern any reason why the Government of South Australia should endeavour unduly to hurry the Commonwealth in carrying out that work. They were negligent themselves, and now they ought to be patient. I am sure that the Government will ultimately do everything for the satisfaction of the people of Australia, and for the further development of the Northern Territory. </para>

Is that the way in which he would like to see this investigation carried out? I am sure it is not. He is the last man in the world who would want anything of that kind. When we get the men for this Commission, we have not the least doubt that we shall soon obtain their report, and Parliament will then have before it all the information that is really necessary for its guidance.

                    <para class="block">Pine Creek to the Katherine River will be only  56  miles long, but owing to the country which it has to traverse it will be one of the expensive portions of the transcontinental railway which will ultimately be built in that direction. From Oodnadatta to Pine Creek the distance is 1,065 miles The line, therefore, will only be two miles longer than will the railway from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie. But in spite of this fact, a very learned and eloquent  Speaker  told honorable senators yesterday that it would cost from <inline font-style="italic">£3,</inline> 000, 000 to ^12,000,000 or ^14,000,000 to construct the transcontinental railway from Oodnadatta to Pine Creek, and that the railway from Kalgoorlie to Port August, which is only 2 miles shorter, was going to cost only ^4,000,000 or 000,000. I wish that honorable senators would think for a few moments of the inconsistency of the statements that they make, because if they did, they, would never fall into such errors in the way of exaggeration. I hope that when the ultimate decision has been arrived at to construct a line right through the Territory, it will not cost anything like the amount which was prophesied yesterday, and I have no reason to believe that it will. I believe that, with the exception of a portion through the MacDonnell Ranges, and from the coast up to the tablelands, the line will be constructed just as cheaply as the one from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie. I hope that at all times during the consideration of the Bill, honorable senators will realize that it is a serious question, that this is not a flying survey, simply for the purpose of gaining an idea as to the distance, or anything of that kind, but a permanent survey on which Parliament will be asked to grant the money, and agree to all the conditions in connexion with the construction of the line. Every precaution has been taken to run the line in the right direction. There may be a difference of opinion as to the necessity of a deviation to meet mining prospects' in the country between Pine Creek and the Katherine River, but those have been set aside. It is considered that, as this line is to form a portion of the great transcontinental railway, connecting the north and the south, there should be no additional haulage put upon it, but that it should be taken by the most direct route. And if further development is necessary to the westward in connexion with mining, or, for that matter, to the eastward, that can be carried out by supplementary lines much more cheaply than by the construction of roads in that direction. The seriousness of the whole thing is that the proposed survey is to be the basis for the construction-, of a line, and the line is to form a portion of the transcontinental railway. </para>

                        SYMON (South* Australia)  [3.15].  - I have a considerable difficulty, after listening very attentively to my honorable friend's speech, in finding whether there is really very much to commend" this Bill at present or not. " At one moment, he buoys up those who come from South Australia with the belief that this bit of railway, when it is built, is to be part of the great transcontinental line to connect the south with, the north. But in the next breath, he dashes our hopes by declaring that before that question is determined, even by the present Government, there is to bean investigation by a sort of SelectCommittee, consisting of a railway engineer, an engineer connected with&gt; ports and harbors, though I do not know what that has to do with the construction, of a trunk line, and another gentleman whose functions' are left very vague. These three persons are very hard" to get, but they are going to be found! somewhere.
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline>
                        thought that, they would have to be bred, but when they are found, and appointed, they are to bring; in a report, and then the Government, in the exercise of the great courage which they possess, will have no hesitation in laying the report on the table of Parliament,, and, so far as I could gather, allowing. Parliament to determine the matter. Those are the two alternatives. They have not to do with the making of this survey, and that is why, in perfect good faith, I interjected when my honorable friend was using those fine oracular words that this would involve no departure from the policy of a direct north and south line. Of course, it is all very well to say that it will involve no departure, as he pointed out, if a line be constructed right away to the east, and into Queensland, because the line would have to be carried down perhaps to Powell's Creek, before the diversion, which is suggested in some quarters was. made towards the Queensland border. But that is a very negative thing to say. It amounts to nothing, because, from that point of view, this is a two-penny-half-penny extension. It may not be in itself, but as a portion of the transcontinental line, whatever route that line may take, it is a mere triviality. So- that, when my honorable friend says that it will involve no departure, we need not be frightened about that. What we want him to say is that it is an affirmance of the policy of having a direct line from Pine Creek to Oodnadatta. If he says that, then this is worthy of being regarded as a measure of importance. My honorable friend said, " You must look upon this Bill seriously." I want to do that, but there is no seriousness in it if it is a mere dribble, which is to mean nothing, and to go nowhere. I am not going to oppose a Bill for a survey, if it is necessary. Anywhere in the interior of Australia, a survey is always useful. We may look upon this as a survey by way of exploration, or as a survey for the purpose of, in the dim and distant future, laying down some rails along the route surveyed. It is useful.

                            <para>- It would be useful if my honorable friend brought in a Bill for the survey of a prospective railway from Wyndham, in the north-west of the continent, to the overland telegraph line. It would be useful in that sense, but it would be still more important, and would have a vital significance to Parliament, which, at present, it does not possess, if we were told in " bold and brave language," which the Minister of Defence said the other Governments ought to use, that this line was really intended to be an instalment, though a small one, of the line from Oodnadatta to Pine Creek. We could then understand the position. My honorable friend is quite entitled to put it in a vague way, but as he does not feel disposed to say that it has that significance, we must look upon it simply as a Bill for the survey of 56 miles of country, and we have to ask ourselves whether a good reason for a survey has been made out. Nobody can very well object to a Bill for a survey ; but we have to ask ourselves whether we ought to go to this expense at the present time. </para>

Even if it covers only a mile or two, it warrants support in that direction. My honorable friend said at onetime that, in this matter, the consideration of defence came into play. Can it be seriously suggested that to build a line from Pine Creek to Katherine River is likely to assist the great problem of the defence of Australia? </para>

                            <para>- That reason is gone, so that it is proper that I should not say anything more about it. Then my honorable friend pictured great freezing works being established at Port Darwin. I think that is the main purpose of this proposal. I welcome the idea that there should be freezing works there. My honorable friend enumerated a great many rivers in the Northern Territory - some, perhaps, which we had not heard of before - and described, I believe accurately, Darwin as the place for these works, and said that possibly this line might be useful, as any line would be, to bring cattle there. But he did not tell us what cattle there were to bring. </para>

                            <para>- My honorable friend need not have told us, because we knew that before. It reminds one of the old cookery receipt of " first catch your hare." Before you have the necessity of a railway as a feeding-tube for freezing works; you need to have the carcasses to be supplied to those works. I am not aware of great herds down near the Katherine River that are waiting to be taken to a freezing establishment at Darwin. We have been supplied with no information to show the urgent necessity for this bit of line taking precedence of the declaration of a bold and large policy by the Government as to which route they are going to adopt for the transcontinental railway. That is what I regard as the important thing. The policy of the Government does not depend upon the report of three men going out to inspect this country and reporting upon its natural features, and so on. That is not the element by which a great policy is to be determined; it is the method by which you are to ascertain the exact route which the railway is to take. But the question which ought to be determined at once, so as to relieve the whole people of suspense, is one which it is competent for the Government <inline font-style="italic">to determine</inline> themselves, namely, that they are going to adhere to what my honorable friend has called the understanding, or, as I call it, the solemn contract between the Commonwealth and South Australia that the transcontinental railway is to run from Oodnadatta to Pine Creek. That requires no committee of engineers. That is a question which the Government themselves must determine. It is their policy, and I do not think that they ought to fight shy of it, or try to shelter themselves behind some mythical committee of three men who are to be found in the future. That is what I complain of in connexion with the Bill. It would have gone through this Parliament flying, I am sure, and with credit to the Government, if it had been brought in as part of a declared policy to run the transcontinental railway from north to south. But then my honorable friend said, speaking on the general question of a line from north to south, that there was the great duty of development. That is the great duty. It is one which the Government are not facing by this Bill. They are shrinking from it. This Bill is a mere pretence so far as that great question of policy is concerned. The development of the Northern Territory is, in my belief, if not the greatest, one of the greatest problems of the present moment, and it is not to be solved, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> interjected across the chamber, by the establishment of a great body of civil servants there at enormous expense. ' The Government are beginning at the wrong end. In previous discussions I have never said a word about any individual selection. A Protector of Aborigines has been appointed at <inline font-style="italic">£1,300</inline> a year - I was going to say, for God knows what ! Not a man in Australia would say a word against the appointment on individual grounds. But that is not the question </para>

I feel sure that those of us- and I include my honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> - who are the greatest friends of the Northern Territory and its development, and who desire to secure it as a possession of the Commonwealth for all time, must feel that every pound that is thrown unnecessarily into the creation of the civil side is at the present juncture, comparatively speaking,, thrown away. Our object ought to be to get people to go up and look at the Territory. We shall not get settlers from other countries. My belief is that we shall never get a soul to come from abroad for the simple purpose of inspecting the Territory, with a view of settlement. But you may get people from the settled parts of Australia. Yob ought, therefore, at the earliest possible moment, to build railways that will induce people to go there, inspect the land, and, if possible, choose area's for settlement. </para>

                            <para>- It is the people of Australia, who have the stuff, the stamina, and the training to fit them for developing our own country, who should be induced to go there. In the first instance, you may require to get capital from other countries, but the manhood and experience we can supply. In my opinion, the railway ought to begin from the south end, for reasons of economy and other reasons. A railway built from Oodnadatta would be one of the first things that would lead people from the southern and eastern States to go and inspect that country with a view to settlement. They will not go there if they have to take a ten-days' voyage round more than half the coast-line. But if you open up the heart of the continent with a railway, you lead people to go there. It must also be remembered - and I am putting this to the Government in all seriousness - that from Oodnadatta to the 26th parallel is only about 200 miles, and it is only about 100 miles north of that to the MacDonnell Ranges, which is one of the most fertile and promising parts of this continent. </para>

                            <para>- We know perfectly well that the South Australian people had not the means. They carried the railway as far as Oodnadatta, and then stuck there. You could not expect a people considerably under 400,000  in  number to build such a railway. That is the reason why they did not go  On  with the project. But I think any one who knows that country will bear me out in saying that the MacDonnell Ranges constitute an uncommonly attractive part of this continent. I know, from my own personal knowledge, that there are there mineral resources that have been developed profitably, though they have not been carried on as well as they would have been, because of the transport difficulty. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, and there are other payable resources. I am putting this point with all earnestness,, because I feel sure that we should not be running this railway through country similar to what exists at Oodnadatta. We should be crossing an oasis, from which I am satisfied we should derive a reward in the immediate future. One can understand why there should not have been great results from a place like that up to now, when we consider that machinery and other requirements had to be carried on camel back from Oodnadatta to the MacDonnell Ranges, 300 miles. I think I am correct in saying that the journey takes three weeks for persons travelling on camel back, without a load. I commend that to the consideration of the Government, with a view of assisting them to arrive at a definite bold policy consistent with the arrangement made with South Australia. Probably when the survey is in progress, it will be in the minds of those who make it, that it is desirable . to bring the southern end to a point that will be most convenient for the continuation of the line either from north to south, or from south to north. But it would have been far more desirable had this great trunk line, bisecting the continent and opening up the heart of Australia, been begun from the southern end. I take the view which has been urged in another place and  elsewhere, that the facilities for railway construction at the southern end are far greater. There is already a railway from Port Augusta northward. </para>

                            <para>- I do r.ot want to make an emphatic pronouncement such as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> has made, but I will say that as far as concerns any explanation offered to the Senate to-day with respect to the purpose of this railway. it is just as useless at the one end as it would be at the other. I think that in introducing this Bill- the Government are merely playing with the question. I do not wish to say a word that would wound the feelings of the Vice-President of the' Executive Council, but knowing that this problem of the connexion between the south and the north, the exploration and development of the whole of the interior of the continent, is the great question in the eyes of the people, and, knowing that this problem will have to be solved in the most vital interests of Australia, the Government fly this little flag in order to indicate that they are thinking about it. That is all that this Bill means. On a recent occasion, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> spoke of the desirability of a Government being bold and brave, and foi1 lowing up their bold and brave words with equally bold and brave actions. That was a sound and good principle to enunciate, and I only regret that the Government are not carrying it into effect in relation to this transcontinental railway question, which is a far greater question than that with the inception of which we were concerned the other day. I shall support the second reading of the Bill, but I regret the attitude of the Government in introducing it. I am sorry to say that it will make no contribution whatever to the solution, which we are all desirous of seeing, of a great national question. </para>

We have heard a few remarks from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> on this Bill, but the honorable senator seems very much more anxious about getting a railway which will have its southern end in Adelaide than he is about the development of the Northern Territory. </para>

It was a purely selfish compact ; a: compact which no self-respecting Government would ever have accepted, and which no patriotic Government would ever have asked the people of the Commonwealth to accept. We should all adopt as a cardinal principle in the construction of railways that they shall be built where they will best, serve the people of the Commonwealth. If that is not to be the root principle of our' action with regard to railway construction,, we shall be only so many log-rollers. </para>

                            <para>- I referred to the contract. I said it was an immoral contract, which no self-respecting Government or Parliament would have accepted, and which no patriotic Government would have asked the people of the Commonwealth to agree to. I think that we have here a duty which is far higher than even keeping to the letter of our agreement with South Australia. What we need to do is to develop the Northern Territory in the best way possible. My own opinion is that prior to the making of any proposals for railway construction, exploration parties should be sent all over the Northern Territory. TheGovernment know nothing about the Territory. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> laughs. Apparently he knows all about it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> says we have an oasis in the MacDonnell Ranges, but we have no authoritative report on these things. Senators Symon, Guthrie,, and the other senators from South Australia do not care two raps about whether this railway will pay or not. All they want to do is to drag it right down to Adelaide, so that South Australia will benefit by the traffic upon it. Their purpose and object is so clear that any one can see it. and it is purely selfish. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator said that he was quite satisfied that it would drag it 56 miles anyhow on the direct route. He emphasized that, irrespective of whether the country through' which it will go is good or bad. probably by some other route, much better country would be served, Which would be more easily developed by means of a railway. But that does not matter. If the line does mot go straight down to Adelaide, it will not suit honorable senators who come from South Australia. </para>

                            <para>- That is my contention - that we know nothing of the capabilities of the Territory. I say that that knowledge should come first. My objection to the Bill is that the Government, apparently, are going to build a railway right down through the heart of the continent, whether the country is suitable for settlement or not, and that is the reason why I shall vote against the second reading. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. There is a good deal of political business about this, so far as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> is concerned. I do not blame the honorable senator for that. It seems to be the correct thing in Parliament. It is a very bad thing for the country, but there it is. If the people are exceedingly anxious to do so, they caro purge Parliament of this method of conducting business; but they seem to be just about as good or as bad as their politicians. I think that the Government are putting the cart before the horse in this matter. Let us first know something about the Territory. Information gained now will be money saved later on, and will lead, I should imagine, .to a much better development of the Territory than is likely to be accomplished by a merely haphazard policy such as we have before us at present. The Vice-President of the Executive Council, in moving the second reading of the Bill, said a good deal about the establishment of freezing works. It is rather premature to talk about that until there are some cattle in the country, and until we know where the best cattle country is. The whole thing is gone about in the most unbusinesslike fashion. If we first secure information about the Territory, we shall know what to do and how to do it, and until we have that information, it appears to me that, while any money we may spend may, by some happy accident, be well spent, the probability is that it will be ill spent. I have come to the conclusion that the Government intend to carry out the compact which was entered into with South Australia. I am very sorry for that, because &lt;I believe that compact is opposed to the best interests of the people of this continent. At any rate, so far as I am concerned, the Bill will go no further. I am sure that, after hearing my declaration, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> will vote for it, although he intended at first to vote against it. I again appeal to the Government to withdraw the measure, and to send two or three exploration parties into the Northern Territory- </para>

                    <para>In this Bill it is proposed to amend the labour section of the Sugar Bounty Act 1905-1910. The 1905 Act, as honorable senators will recollect, was the first Commonwealth Act which made  any  attempt to secure to the workers engaged in the sugar industry the payment of fair and reasonable wages. The provision relating to this matter, which was inserted in that Act on the motion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> reads - </para>

If the Minister finds that such rate of wages is below the standard tate paid in the districts in which the sugar is grown to similar white labour engaged in that industry, then the Minister may withhold the whole or any part of the bounty payable. </para>

                    <para>The Bounties Act of 1907 and the Manufactures Encouragement Act of 1908 amplified that provision. The Act of 1905 contained a provision whereby the bounty payable was to be reduced in the year 191 1 to two-thirds of the rate previously paid, and in 191 2 to one- third. After that year, the bounty was to cease to operate. However, in 1910, strong representations were made that it was desirable to continue the bounty, and the Government decided temporarily to continue it, and to repeal the previous Act. When an amending Bill was introduced for the purpose of repealing the Sugar Bounty Act of 1905 in respect of the reduction of the bounty along the lines I have indicated, advantage was taken of the occasion to further amend the labour section contained in that Act. As a result, the following provision was substituted for the section which was inserted in the 1905 Act on the initiative of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> - </para>

                    <para class="block">The Bill which is now before honorable senators seeks to lay down conditions which will supersede those which I have just read. The reason why we desire to substitute the conditions set forth in this measure for those which are contained in the Act of 1910 may be very briefly stated. In the first place, the grower of cane has to deliver his cane to the mills. The sugar is milled and refined, and, after these operations have been completed, the grower can make application for the bounty payable under the Act. The Minister then has an opportunity of ascertaining whether the claimant has complied with the conditions which are prescribed by the Act. If he satisfies himself that those conditions have not been complied with, he may withhold the whole or any part of the bounty. But he can only do so after the whole of these operations have been completed. This Bill seeks to effect an alteration of the law under which the Minister will be empowered to make application to a Judge for a declaration as to what are fair and reasonable rates of payment, so that the grower will know at once what wages he has to pay to his workmen, and the workmen will know what wages they are to receive, in addition to which the grower will experience no difficulty in obtaining the bounty. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. Where there were agreements between the representatives of the growers and the representatives of the workers, those agreements would be observed, and in such cases the rates of wages set forth in the schedule issued by the Minister would not apply. As a matter of fact, there has been much dissatisfaction in regard to the conditions which have obtained in the sugar industry ever since the Commonwealth was established. The grower has been uncertain whether he would get the whole or part of the bounty, and the workmen have been dissatisfied with the conditions that have prevailed. Although the Minister had the opportunity of withholding the bounty from some of the growers, he felt that it would not be right to do so, seeing that some were in doubt as to what was to be deemed fair and reasonable conditions. Further, I think that the majority of the men who had been employed in the cane fields had left the districts in which they were previously employed. </para>

Recently an instruction was issued by the Minister that the men were to be paid during wet and dry weather, that they were not to lose any time. He also laid it down that not more than 48 hours a week should be worked in the fields, and he increased the wages of the men very considerably. </para>

                            <para>- We have taken away a good deal of the discretionary power exercised by sugar-growers, because they have not done what we consider a fair thing by the employes. In regard to this Bill, the main point is that, at the present time, the bounty can be withheld by the Minister after the milling operations have been completed on the ground that fair and reasonable wages have not been paid. We want to alter that state of affairs. We want to take away from the Minister, no matter whether he be a Labour Minister or an Anti-Labour Minister, the power to draw up wage and industrial conditions pertaining to this or any other industry, but particularly this industry. We want ' the Minister to have the power to make an application to a Judge of the Arbitration Court, a Supreme Court, or an Industrial Court, for a declaration as to what a fair and reasonable wage is. When he has that power, no Minister will lay down what he considers to be fair and reasonable wages. The Court will be in a much better position than any Minister to regulate this industry, from the industrial point of view, because it will be its business to inquire into the industry from A to Z, and to lay down what it considers fair and reasonable wages. </para>

But he can only take that step after the completion of the milling operations, before the bounty is paid. This Bill provides that the Minister shall have an opportunity of applying to a Judge before the milling operations are completed, in order that both parties shall understand what wages are to be paid, and the grower will have an opportunity of claiming and obtaining his bounty. </para>

                            <para>. - I had not contemplated making any observations concerning these Budget-papers, because it seemed to me that debate on a matter that has been disposed of elsewhere is rather like whipping a dead horse. I noticed that, when the Vice-President of the Executive Council was introducing this subject, he, like an Irishman trailing his coat on the ground and beseeching any one to tread on the tail of it, challenged the Opposition to say whether they would reduce any of the expenditure proposed by the present Government. He particularly alluded to the payment of pensions. I do not know that the matter of pensions has ever been a party question here. Certainly it was not the Labour party that introduced old-age pensions in the Commonwealth, though, naturally, they hoped to carry the measure, as members of other parties also did. I do not know why it should be supposed that, simply because there is a Labour party in power, the Opposition wished to cut down pensions. There certainly is no disposition to act in that way. But I am free to express the opinion that a careful inquiry ought to be made into the administration of old-age pensions. I have said before, and now repeat, that there is a good deal of fraud and misrepresentation in regard to them. Talking with an official of the Pensions Office only a few da.vs ago he admitted to me that it is known that imposition is rampant, though the officials are not able to get evidence to bring a charge home to those who are perpetrating frauds. Sometimes, when a man has property, he dispossesses himself of it nominally by dividing it up amongst his sons, and then applies for an old-age pension. </para>

                            <para>- Yes; it is known that that sort of thing goes on. We established our pension system to assist, those who are in needy circumstances. It was not to be a universal pension system. Persons in certain circumstances were to be allowed the privilege of drawing pensions. I have not the least doubt that the system is being very much abused at present. I am anxious that no one who needs a pension should be without it. But at present we are faced with the position that some who ought never to apply for pensions, and ought not to get them, are enjoying them, whilst others who deserve pensions do not make application. Of what use was it for the Vice-President of the Executive Council to .ask the Opposition whether they desired to cut down old-age pensions? We do not desire to do anything of the sort,, but we certainly do wish to see the system fairly administered. Again, military and naval expenditure is not a party matter. All parties are committed to our defence policy. There may be extravagance here and there, and expenditure in some directions might well be saved ; but that does not affect the main issue. With regard to the proposed expenditure of ^58,000 on the Northern Territory, we have not been supplied with particulars as to how the money is to be spent, except that ^1,000 is to bo applied to the establishment of a steam laundry. There are in the Northern Territory a number of Chinamen who are supposed to be excellent laundrymen. It seems strange, therefore, that it should be considered necessary to establish there a Commonwealth Laundry- </para>

I listened to his speech yesterday with much interest. He endeavoured to apply a stimulus to his own party with the object of inducing it to carry out the policy to which the Labour party is pledged. He pointed out that the Government are in a more favorable position than any previous Ministry have been, and wanted to know why they did not give effect to their policy. He stated that the land policy of the party is that the State should take the community-created value of land. In other words it should take what is sometimes called the unearned increment.  </para>

                            <para>- No; I am not. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> says that we need to establish industries. We all admit that, and we need also to extend those we have. The honorable senator mentioned two industries in particular, but I could not exactly understand how he proposed to deal with them. He asked why we should not establish a cotton industry; but his idea at the same time is that there should be no duty on imported cotton. He thinks we should pay a bounty on cotton grown in the Commonwealth. I know that cotton grows very well in the Northern Territory. The Curator of the Botanical Gardens at Port Darwin planted cotton seed there some time ago, and very fine cotton is produced there. But if there is to be no duty on imported cotton, and we are to grow cotton in Australia in competition with that grown by coloured labour in other countries, where they pay only as much for labour in a month as we should have to pay in a day, I wonder what sort of a bounty will be necessary, and what price will have to be paid for the cotton grown in Australia after it is manufactured. </para>

The honorable senator also made reference to the woollen industry. That is already established here, and I believe that our woollen mills have as much or more work than they can get through at the present time.

                            <para>- I admit that; but why that should be so is somewhat difficult to understand. The foreign manufacturer has to pay freight and charges on the wool to Europe, and after it is made up, he has to pay the same charges to bring the manufactured goods to Australia, and also a Customs duty of from 30 to 35 per cent. That, it seems to me, should be a sufficient handicap upon the foreign manufacturer to enable the local manufacturer to compete with success. I think that it is, because, from what I can learn, the industry here is very fully employed, and there is no lack of work in any of the factories. They are extending their plants in all the States. I know that, last year, when on my way to London, I met a manufacturer who was going there from </para>

                    <para>Geelong with the express purpose of materially increasing his plant in order to carry out the additional business which he knew was waiting for him. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> has said that, although our factories are in-; creasing, they are not increasing anything like as fast as they ought to. I am not quite sure on that point, because I find that, while in 1901 we had 11,143 factories in the Commonwealth, in 19 10, the number had increased to 13,822. An increase of 3,679 factories in ten years is not, I think, a bad rate of increase. In 1901, the number of employes in our factories was I97&gt;783, and, in 1910, the number had increased to 286,831, or an increase in ten years of 89,048. From these figures, it would appear that our industries have not been languishing very much. They have made fairly satisfactory progress, and I have no doubt that there would have been a very much larger local output if sufficient labour had been available for the manning of our factories. During the last few years, we have had good seasons, and a big demand for the products of our factories, and the output of many of them has not been nearly what it would have been if more labour had been available. Reference was made yesterday to the value of the output of our factories. I have looked up the figures given on the subject by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs,</inline> and I notice that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir.</inline> Sholl, the Statistician of South Australia, supplies very similar figures. I find that of the value of the output of our factories the raw material represents 60.22 per cent. ; fuel and light, 2.18 per cent. ; salaries and wages, 19.77 per cent. ; and other expenses, including interest and profit, 17.83 per cent. It has to be remembered "that from the 17.83 per cent., the manufacturer has to pay fire and industrial insurance. I am not complaining that he should have to pay for industrial insurance, because I recognise that that is a very fair burden upon any industry. It is necessary that the manufacturer should insure himself in order to be able to meet any claims that might be made upon him under the Workmen's Compensation Act, the Employers' Liability Act, the Workmen's Lien Act, or at common law. I think that is quite right, but I say that it is out of the 17.83 per cent, that these charges have to be met. The premium charge for industrial insurance is about 12s. 6d. per cent, on the wages actually paid, so that it represents a substantial burden upon any industry. After all these charges are accounted for, I think it will be found that the manufacturer is left with about 7 per cent., and, when we remember that there is invested in land and buildings in connexion with our factories, something like ^20,000,000, and in plant and machinery another ,£29,000,000, it will be admitted that the manufacturer's profit cannot be regarded as extravagant. In all the circumstances, our industries appear to me to have made very fair progress under the existing Tariff. </para>

                            <para>- I take exception to that statement. I guarantee that if the matter is investigated, it will be found that within the last ten years, the wages in every industry have been substantially increased. I challenge the honorable senator to disprove that statement. Wages Boards and Arbitration Courts have brought up wages in every industry, and the total wage list for the Commonwealth has been increased, according to figures which were published here not long ago, by millions sterling. We are told that we now require to have the new Protection. The old idea of Protection, as I understood it, was that a duty should be placed upon an imported article to enable the local manufacturer of it to compete with the underpaid labour in other countries, and, at the same time, pay a fair wage to his employes. I do not know that any one could complain of that. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> is anxious now for what is called the new Protection, which, according to a statement made in Melbourne not long since by the present Attorney-General, is intended to protect the local manufacturer by means of a Customs duty, and also to provide better wages for his work-people, and, further, to protect the consumer in connexion with the selling price. I do not exactly know how it is to be done, especially if the producer is, under <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart's</inline> scheme, to pay a land tax up to the economic rent of his land, or up to the full community created value of it. I do not know how any member of the Government is going to fix the price of a pound of wool, a bushel of wheat, a gallon of wine, a pound of butter, or any other commodity. The prices of these commodities are determined by the markets of the world, and I fail to see how the new Protection can succeed in protecting the consumer if we increase the duties which are levied upon various articles, or the wages of the persons who are engaged in their production. Only one individual will pay this increased cost, and that is the individual who consumes the goods. </para>

                                <para>- I would have business men. There may be anomalies from a Free Trade and also from a Protectionist point of view. If such anomalies exist, they should be rectified; and I take it that a Board of experts would be appointed as neither Free Traders nor Protectionists, but as men who  would be competent to make inquiries and to submit recommendations. I do not think that 'we shall have an equitable Tariff, until we adopt that course. I have nothing more to say. I am quite sure that, so far as this expenditure set out in the Estimates is concerned, we are committed to it. Even if I desired to object to that expenditure, I am afraid that my objection would not be effective, in view of the composition of the Senate at the present time. </para>

                            <para>. - I propose to offer a few remarks upon some of the criticisms to which the Budget has been subjected, and I also intend to embrace the present opportunity to make a statement in regard to naval development, because of the misconception which exists in the minds of some honorable senators, .and because certain misstatements have been circulated by the press which ought to be corrected at the earliest possible moment. In the first place, I wish to say a few words in reply to the criticism of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> and in answer to the construction which has been placed upon that criticism by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon.</inline> It is not a fact that the Labour party have not given effect to their platform. It is an incontrovertible fact that practically every plank of the platform upon which that party went to the electors in 1903 to which effect can be given without an alteration of the Constitution has already been given effect to. The only plank of that platform which has not become law is the Navigation Bill, and the Government are pledged to pass that before the present session closes. In regard to our attitude upon the land question, there was no uncertainty as to the platform which was put before the electors, either by the Prime Minister in his opening speech, or by other members of the party subsequently throughout the Commonwealth. We declared that we were in favour of a progressive tax on the unimproved value of land, with an exemption of £5,000. That plank has been interpreted by the only persons who are authorized to interpret it in the way that they deemed right, and legislative expression has already been given to their interpretation. So that whatever <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> or anybody else, may say to the contrary has nothing whatever to do with the case. Before that policy can be altered the electors will again be consulted. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> was equally unfortunate in some of the remarks which he made in regard to the Tariff. The Labour party are pledged to the new Protection. That is to say, they are pledged to Protection, provided they have the power to accompany Tariff duties with protection to the worker and the consumer. </para>
                        </talk.start>
                        <para class="block">As a party they have deliberately refused to place Protection upon their official platform, unless it be accompanied by the new Protection. To that plank every member of the party is pledged. At the same time no member of the party is prevented from holding the most extreme views in regard to what is known as the old Protection. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> is quite free, as is every member of the Labour party, to hold and express extreme views upon that matter. But, nevertheless, he is pledged to do his utmost to give effect to the new Protection. When he chides others with not doing their duty in this regard, one would naturally expect that he, himself, was perfect. He has told us that he is in favour of abolishing all revenue duties. Unfortunately he has a record, and before one starts 10 boast it is always well that one should be sure that his record is without blemish. If anybody chooses to turn to <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> for the year 1908, pages 8067 and 8082, 8085 and 8086, he will find that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> voted for a very high duty upon such an article as rice - clearly and distinctly a revenue duty. There was no rice grown in the Commonwealth at the time, and not a single bushel has been grown since. Upwards of £382,000 worth of uncleaned rice, upon which duty to the extent of ,£65,000 was paid, and ,£116,000 worth of rice n.e.i., upon which ^35,000 was paid in duty, was imported into the Commonwealth during 191 1. That duty was imposed with the aid of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart's</inline> vote. So that the value of the rice, imported during the year mentioned, was approximately £500,000, and the duty paid upon its importation was £100,000. It is a revenue duty of the worst kind, because it is a duty upon food. </para>

                                <para>- Of course, we can grow anything in Australia. But, as a matter of fact, we do not grow rice, notwithstanding that there is a Himalayan duty upon it. Then, again, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> had no compunction about voting for the imposition of a duty upon arrowroot. Although he can vote complacently for duties on such articles as tapioca flour, which are not produced in the Commonwealth, he has the temerity to lecture members of his own party because they are maintaining a Tariff which contains revenue duties. The present Government have made no secret of their intention, if they are vested with the necessary power, to introduce a system of new Protection, and to substantially alter the existing Tariff. The electors are not in ignorance of the fact that the Labour party are pledged up to the hilt to make that Tariff effective, conditionally upon their having the power to insure that the benefits of Protection shall be extended to the workers of the community, and that the manufacturers are not allowed a free hand in exploiting the consumers. </para>

                                <para>- That is to say, our present programme. We appealed to the people for that increased power, but we failed to obtain it. We intend to again appeal to the people, and, in my opinion, on the next occasion they .will answer " Yes." However, that is a matter for future history to reveal. I wish to quote a few figures, because an attempt is being made, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> gave voice to it yesterday, to make it appear that not only is the present Tariff not thoroughly satisfactory - I suppose we are all prepared to concede that, in many respects, it could be made more Protective - but it is thoroughly ineffective, and goods which could be made here are pouring in in an ever-increasing stream over the Tariff barrier. To those who take up that attitude I wish to commend some figures. The first Tariff was passed in 1902, and I shall take the figures for 1903, because it was then in full operation, and compare that year with the last year for which we have figures, and that is 191 1. In 1903 we imported £26,013,008 worth of dutiable goods and £11,798,463 worth of goods on the free list, making a total value of £37,811,471. During last year we imported dutiable goods to the  value of £38,276,394, and goods on the free list to the value of £28,691,094, making a total of £66,967,488. Those who have quoted figures have always been careful to merely quote the total imports, and not to analyze the character of the goods; imported. The total increase in the value of the imports in the period I mentioned was £29,156,017, but of this increase only <inline font-style="italic">£12,263,368</inline> represented dutiable goods, whilst imports to the value of £16,892,631, or four-sevenths of the total value, were on the free list, and, therefore, not dutiable at all. </para>

                                <para>- If the honorable senator will look through, the free list; he will find that we have a surprisingly small one when he comes to think of the large number of articles which are taxable. These figures are extremely striking. They show that four- sevenths of the total increase represent goods that are on the free list. It has to be remembered that a considerable proportion of the dutiable goods are subject to what are practically revenue duties of 5 and 10 per cent. </para>

                                <para>- The last general election took place on the 13th April, 1910 ; the financial year ended on the 30th June, 19 10, and the Labour Government assumed office in May, 19 10. Whatever the financial position of the Commonwealth was at the end of June, 1910, obviously the Labour Government could not be held responsible for it. According to <inline font-style="italic">Knibbs -</inline> 1  take the figures from pages 794, 802 and 809 - the revenue for that year was £15,540,669, and the expenditure, £15,991,952, showing a deficit of £451,283. If honorable senators will cast their minds back, they will remember that one of the first Bills which the Labour Government had to introduce was one to validate an action which the Labour Treasurer had to take when he came into office. He found that the commitments of the Fusion Government, and the expenditure which had to be faced before the 30th June, were such that he had to have resort to the Trust Fund in order to make up the deficit, and one of the earliest Bills introduced in the ensuing session was one to validate his action in using trust money for that purpose. </para>

                                <para>- That is so, but they had not been added to by the Fusion Government, and therefore were the product of other Governments. Not only had we to do that in order to meet a temporary difficulty, but the obligation was cast upon us by that Bill to meet the current liabilities for the year, and, in addition, to restore £451,000 odd to the Trust Fund. That we were able to do, and to finish up with a handsome surplus. So much for the statements that are being made to endeavour to lead the public to believe that the greatest and weakest link in the Labour chain is that of finance. The facts are that the Fusion finance left this country with a deficit of nearly £500,000, and that Labour finance converted the deficit, in the short space of a year, into a handsome surplus. </para>

                                <para>- Yesterday we had a statement from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould,</inline> who was dealing with the present situation, and his remarks were typical of the general remarks, of members of the Opposition on the financial position. They quote the huge expenditure. They say, " Here is so much for Naval defence, so much for old-age pensions, and so much for something else," and having trotted out these millions they ask, " Where is it going to lead to? What is the country coming to? How are you. going to meet the outstanding liability?" <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> told us that we -ought now to be laying by a nest egg for future days. He has a pretty long record to his credit in State and Federal Parliaments. It never was typical of the <inline font-style="italic">regime</inline> of the party of which he is so distinguished a member,, when they flourished in the State Legislatures, to make any provision for a rainy day, and the magnificent legacies which they have left to the people of Australia are the enormous State debts, now amounting to about .£300,000,000. That is the way in which they provided for the future. As to our provision, we have challenged the members of the Opposition to lay their fingers upon, a single item, and say that it is a needless expenditure. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> says that it is the duty of the Treasurer to run his pencil through items, and to use the amount which he thus saves to meet liabilities which may occur in the sweet by-and-by. Let us consider the statement. Here is a country which to-day we all admit has an enormous revenue, and that revenue is being paid apparently without any hardship to the taxpayers. We can all, perhaps, disagree with some of the sources from which the revenue comes, but there it is. When money is pouring into the Treasury, and we look around this country and see the demand for expenditure in this and that direction, and find upon inquiry that it is absolutely justifiable, would ir be sound finance to borrow money to carry out the works, and to put the surplus revenue into a Trust Account, or something of that kind, for possible contingencies in the future? or, on the other hand, strike the works out altogether, and leave them as a legacy to the future. The need for them will increase as time goes on, and the demand for them will not die out. If you strike a particular work out of the Estimates this year, and refuse to provide money for it, you have not done away with the necessity for it. The probability is that the demand will face you in the future, when you have not the revenue available ; and then you will be forced to borrow. The Government have taken the wiser course. They have decided that, having the money available for necessary works, they will spend it now. If it is found in the future that the revenue is not sufficient to enable us to continue this policy, it will be for the Government to determine whether they will refuse to go on with works, or whether they will proceed with them and either impose additional taxation or borrow the necessary money. Those alternatives are always open to us. I think, therefore, that we are working on sound lines in proceeding as we are going. Now I wish as succinctly as possible to lay before the Senate the position in regard to naval expenditure. I admit that there has been some confusion, possibly because of the way in which the report of Admiral Henderson was submitted, and afterwards affected by the proposals of the Government; as well as in consequence of the figures supplied by the Budget-papers. Perhaps some misunderstanding was inevitable, because Admiral Henderson was dealing with proposals for which he could give only forecasts of expenditure, whilst we are dealing with proposals which are tangible, and for which we can furnish actual estimates. In order to make the position clear, I wish to give a brief summary of Admiral Henderson's proposals. When the Labour Government assumed office in 19 10, they found that negotiations were in progress with the Admiralty for the construction of vessels of a Fleet Unit. The Government decided to take the advice of an officer recommended by the Admiralty. </para>

                                <para>- It is to consist of one battleship cruiser, three second class cruisers, six destroyers, and three submarines. We decided to obtain the advice of an experienced naval officer recommended by the Admiralty, so that we might have a well-defined plan upon which we could set to work. The Naval Conference of 1909 merely laid down plans for the creation of a Fleet Unit, and for the co-operation of the Dominions in respect thereto, but did not take into consideration the local provision for manning, and matters of that kind. The Labour Government also decided that of the Fleet Unit one of the second class cruisers and the three destroyers should be built in Australia. Admiral Henderson, on the advice of the Admiralty, was selected to prepare a report. His report is dated 1st March, 191 1. In regard to the construction of the vessels of the Fleet Unit, on 8th December, 1909, a cable was sent to the Admiralty asking them to arrange for the construction of the vessels. Contracts were accepted on 18th June, 1910, for the <inline font-style="italic">Australia,</inline> on 20th February, 1911, for the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney,</inline> on 25th February, 191 1, for the <inline font-style="italic">Melbourne.</inline> The contracts were signed by the Admiralty on behalf of the Commonwealth. The contract for the supply of material for the <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane</inline> was signed about the same time, and contracts for the building of the <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane</inline> and the three destroyers in June of this year. The time fixed for the commencement of work upon them was August. I wish to say a word or two about Admiral Henderson's report, to explain the figures which I shall give, and to show that the charge that we have not kept up to date in regard to carrying out the Admiral's recommendations is unjustified. The statement that we have not done  the things which he suggested we should do is also insubstantial. In paragraph 19 of his report, Admiral Henderson says - </para>

                            <para>In order to obtain the necessary efficiency with the minimum cost, continuity of policy is essential, and the development of the Commonwealth Naval Forces must proceed on definite lines with a definite goal in view, so that each step taken will advance the completion of the whole, and the development must be regulated by her resources both in population and in wealth. </para>
                            <para class="block">The reason why I quote that statement is this : We have been taunted several times that we have not said whether we accept the whole of Admiral Henderson's proposals or not. In that paragraph Admiral Henderson himself recognises that his proposals as a whole must be tentative, and the carrying out of them must be governed by the two factors of population and wealth. I quote from page 9 of his report his recommendations, in which he summarizes his proposals, and places them in order. He says - </para>
                            <para>I have divided my recommendations into three parts, comprising - </para>
                            <para>Part 1, the completed fleet (the goal to bc attained). </para>
                            <para class="block">Part 2, the initial stage - requirements of the fleet unit and first seven years (the foundation). </para>
                            <para class="block">Part 3, successive stages of development (culminating in the completed fleet). </para>
                            <para class="block">There we have the necessary stages. This is what Admiral Henderson says as to the four eras within which the requirements of the completed Fleet should be divided - </para>
                            <para>It is recommended that the requirements of the Commonwealth completed fleet should be divided into four eras, consisting respectively of - </para>
                            <para>First era, seven years. </para>
                            <para>Second era, five years. </para>
                            <para>Third era, five years. </para>
                            <para>Fourth era, five years. </para>
                            <para class="block">Making a total of twenty-two years. In paragraph  7,  he says - </para>
                            <para>The total period of 22 years is taken as the maximum required; the higher ranks of officers cannot be obtained in a shorter period, and a period of 22 years is also convenient because it is the length of service, from the age of 18, which continuous service men in the mother navy are required to complete to be eligible for pension, and is the period which is recommended for adoption for " long service " in the Commonwealth Fleet. </para>
                            <para class="block">It will be seen, therefore, that Admiral Henderson, in making his recommendation as to a twenty-two years' period, was governed entirely by that consideration. He himself would be the last to prophesy that in twenty-two years a battleship, as we know it to-day, would be the chief item in our Fleet. It may even be obsolete. </para>
                            <para class="block">But, as he pointed out, he had to formulate a plan extending over a number of years, and he had to show in each era the provision that would have to be made for the next both in manning and provision. In paragraph 9 of his report, he says - </para>
                            <para>It is specially recommended that the first era should cover seven years, as this longer era will give the Commonwealth time and opportunity for devoting her energies to providing and equipping the necessary harbor establishments, naval bases, &amp;c., as well to putting the recruiting system on a sound basis. </para>
                            <para class="block">It is well to know the importance that Admiral Henderson attaches to those things as compared with the building of the Fleet. On page 15 of his report, paragraph11, he says - </para>

The following is a statement of numbers required to be recruited in Australia for the Fleet Unit, together with a statement of the numbers available. The number required is 863.

                                <para>- In England; she is a special type of ship of which the Admiralty have the plans. No vessel of the kind has ever been constructed in Australia. The other vessels mentioned will be here in sufficient time if they are ordered within the next two or three years. It will be time enough even then to have them within the time Admiral Henderson has set down for their construction. The time allowed for the construction of a torpedo boat destroyer in Great Britain is twelve months, so that if the order were given in 1915 the vessels would still be constructed within the time for which Admiral Henderson allowed. I contend from these facts that not only have we kept within the time limit laid down by Admiral Henderson, but in certain respects we are in advance of what he thought we should be able to do. </para>

The actual expenditure upon the construction of the Fleet Unit up to the 30th June, 1912 - not the appropriation, but the money actually expended - amountsto£1,875,999. Some confusion in the matter arises in this way: A sum of£3,750,000 has already been appropriated by Parliament for the Fleet Unit. Only £1,875,999 has been expended of that amount, and the balance is there to meet future liabilities. </para>

                                <para>- I shall refer to that, but I wish now to indicate what the works to be carried out by this expenditure are. In the Home Affairs Department they include the Naval College at Jervis Bay, £130,000; the Naval College at Geelong, £8,000 ; the Flinders Naval Base, £200,000; and the Williamstown Gunnery and Torpedo School, £12,000. Towards these works there are included  on  the present Estimates £95,000, leaving a balance to be voted of £255,000. Under the Naval Department the works include the Flinders Naval Base,£400,000;. Cockburn Sound,£45,000 ; Port Stephens, £15,000; dredgers and plant,£100,000; or a total of£560,000, of which amount £200,000 is provided for on the present Estimates, leaving a balance of £360,000- to be subsequently provided for. As regards the Cockburn Sound and Port Stephen's Naval Bases, no estimate can be given as to the final expenditure upon, them, for the reason that the work now being carried out is merely survey work on which to establish data to enable us to frame our estimates of cost. Therefore, these figures do not include any money for Cockburn Sound and Port Stephens Naval Bases, except to enable us to provide preliminary data, or for Sydney, for which no final scheme has yet been proposed. It is further estimated that the expenditure indicated by these figures will be spread over four years. Now as to the cost of maintenance and of the Naval Forces. The Fleet Unit for last year, 1911-12, cost for maintenance, repairs, upkeep, salaries, and pay, £248,738. For the current financial year, during part of which we shall have the <inline font-style="italic">Melbourne</inline> in commission, and the battleship, and one of the other cruisers in commission possibly for a couple of months, the estimated cost of <inline font-style="italic">maintenance</inline> is £659,378. In 1913-14, on the assumption that we shall have in commission the complete Fleet Unit, including the depot ship and the ships being constructed in Sydney, the annual expenditure for maintenance and upkeep is estimated to amount to£1, 086,000. </para>

                                <para>- No; there is nothing included in that estimate for depreciation. The statement has been published that Admiral Henderson foreshadowed an expenditure of £15,000,000 on works. I was very much puzzled by this figure, and so were the members of the Naval Board. We could not understand how it was obtained, but I think we have discovered how it has been arrived at. Admiral Henderson introduced some estimates on the last page of his report. Prior to the introduction of those estimates, he assumed, for the purpose of making his point, that the Government would spend on the Navy, say, £3,000,000 a year during the first seven years, and £4,000,000 a year in subsequent years. On the basis of the Fleet which he suggests, he set down so much for recurring charges, and so much for nonrecurring charges, and he assumed that the balances which would be left - and according to his figures a balance would be left in each year - would be utilized by the Government for works. He could give no estimates for works, because, obviously, he had no data on which to base them. As I have already said, we are unable at present to give any estimate for the naval bases at Cockburn Sound and Port Stephens until surveys have been made to secure the necessary data. So, in a rough and ready fashion, Admiral Henderson said that for the purpose of his calculations, he would assume that the Government would spend £3,000,000 a year in the first seven years, and £4,000.000 in subsequent years, so much in each year for recurring, and so much for non-recurring charges; and the balance left each year, which might be £1,500,000, or £2,000,000, wOuld be spent on works. Those who have discovered the figure £15,000,000 have done so by adding up the assumed balances for each year, and they contend that Admiral Henderson said that we should spend that much on works. As a matter of fact, he never said anything of the kind. The statement made is misleading, and does not represent the views of Admiral Henderson. </para>

                                <para>- No ; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Harper</inline> is only one of many who have made statements. I am dealing with many statements which have been made. I am trying to put before the Senate the actual position and to explain exactly what we are doing, how it fits in with Admiral Henderson's scheme, and what our immediate commitments are. The position which the Government take up with regard to the scheme and its commitments is this : We say that if Parliament is going to adopt the scheme, complete the naval bases, and build the. ships proposed in the seven years' period, the amounts which I have mentioned indicate what it will be called upon to vote. It will be for Parliament to say each year whether it is prepared to vote them. There is a reason why Parliament should know, and should, 111 a sense, give a tentative approval to expenditure ahead in connexion with naval defence. In Germany, I understand, they have one great advantage over the British Admiralty, inasmuch as their naval estimates are brought in under a naval law. which practically authorizes expenditure over a certain number of years ahead. Having passed that law, they can go on expending money on the Navy up to the limit of the law they have passed, and, should the necessity arise, they can amend the law. </para>

                                <para>- With the modification I have stated, and which I need not again repeat, it is being carried out up to time, and in some respects we are in advance of what Admiral Henderson thought it would be possible for us to do. As to the cost, Admiral Henderson accepted the estimate of cost of the Fleet Unit as set out at the 1909 Conference. But what are the facts? The original estimate of the 1909 Conference of the cost of the Fleet Unit proposed was .£3, 695,000. We asked for certain alterations in the second-class cruisers, to render them more suitable for our seas. Allowing for those alterations, the amended estimate of cost was £4,040,000. Then we decided that certain ships should be built in Australia, and again we had to amend our estimate, with the result that £4,256,000 is now estimated to be the cost of the Fleet Unit, which was originally estimated to cost £3,695,000 </para>

                                <para>- It will be necessary to appropriate £500,000 more for the Trust Fund than is provided for on the Estimates. That will increase the Trust Fund to the total sum I have mentioned of £4,250,000. I do not think there is anything further I need say on this matter, but it was desirable that honorable senators should be given a clear idea as to where we stand, and that Parliament should know exactly what are our liabilities for the future in this connexion. I do not know that any other remarks which have been made by members of the Opposition call for any reply. Members of the Opposition shelter themselves behind such statements as, " We attack the Government Estimates of Revenue and Expenditure, but it is not for us to suggest what alterations should be made." That is all very well. But I would point out that we are approaching a general election. The expenditure behind the Budget involves political principles of a very high and important character, and Opposition and Ministerial supporters alike are responsible to*" the people. It is the people's money which is being expended, and if the Opposition condemn that expenditure, they should tell the electors which item of it they condemn, and why they condemn it. They should take their courage in their hands, and say boldly, " We are going to oppose the maternity grant ; we condemn old-age pensions and also the expenditure upon defence." But they will not do that. What, then, must we assume? Whilst they are endeavouring to create a feeling of unrest in the minds of the taxpayers, they will not inform them of what they would do to remedy the existing state of affairs if the taxpayers were so foolish as to place the destinies and the finances of this country in their hands. </para>

I trust that when the Leader of the Opposition speaks he will tell us to which items of the Budget he objects, and what sources of revenue the Opposition would exploit as an alternative to those which we are exploiting. When the Land Tax Assessment Bill was under consideration in this Chamber, we know that members of the Opposition objected to it. Consequently, it is a fair thing to ask them on the eve of a general election, in view of their repeated statements that it is an iniquitous measure, whether they are prepared to repeal it? </para>

Honorable senators opposite affirm that it is iniquitous. Very well. Let them outline their measures of taxation, and let the country judge between us. Is the Leader of the Opposition going to say, " We do not believe in the progressive land tax. We think it is confiscation. It is wrong and iniquitous, but, because the Labour Government spent so much money, we feel that we must spend the same amount. Therefore, we are going to accept the revenue which is derived from the land tax, tainted though it may be. We will do so just to keep up the reputation "- </para>

                                <para>- If the Opposition came into power to-morrow, it would be perfectly open to them to bring down the expenditure next year to the figure at which it stood when the present Government came into office. That is, of course, assuming that they are prepared to wipe out of existence the measures which they have denounced in this Chamber. They say, " We are very sorry that we cannot repeal any of these measures. But we must retain the progressive land tax, notwithstanding that we are opposed to it." The people of this country may be very gullible, but before honorable senators opposite can attain the cosy shelter of the Ministerial benches again they will have to tell them a little more freely what they propose to do in regard to the Budget. </para>

                            <para>. - No doubt, sir, when you took the chair this afternoon you noticed- the subdued air which marked honorable senators occupying seats on your right, due to that speech which was delivered last evening by the militant member of that militant party, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart.</inline> We are deeply grateful to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> for stating from the ranks of his own party what, so far, has not been denied, and what has been stated frequently, though less effectively, by honorable senators upon this side of the Chamber. We thank him for his declaration that the Labour party have failed to redeem the pledges which they made to the electors two and a half years ago, and we have also to thank him for bringing the Minister of Defence to his feet this afternoon in a belated attempt to traverse some of his statements. It is interesting to note that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> stated that the party to which he belongs have failed to make good the promises which they made to the electors of this country in regard to land monopoly. The Minister of Defence endeavoured to counter that charge by declaring that the party had redeemed the pledge which they gave to the electors by reason of having passed a progressive land tax. But it was not merely the tax which was promised. Honorable senators opposite declared that the operation of the tax would achieve certain results. In other words, the tax was not the end itself, but merely the means to the end. They said it was" the mere instrument. They were going to destroy land monopoly. </para>

The pledge which honorable senators opposite gave to the people, which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> was indiscreet enough to put in black and white, and to publish, and which Senators Pearce and Findley gave from a thousand platforms, was that they would destroy that land . monopoly f which, they affirmed, was throttling Australia. That is the pledge which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> affirms his party have not kept. That they have put a Land Tax Assessment Act on the statute-book of the Commonwealth is perfectly true; but has it been effective for the purposes for which it was introduced ? </para>

                                <para>- I am dealing with the pledge of my honorable friends regarding what they would do if the electors trusted them with their votes. The electors kept their part of the bargain. What have my honorable friends done? The answer was given by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> who cited the number of applicants that there were for certain blocks of land. It is only a little while ago that, for a few allotments in the Forbes district in my own State, there were over 1,000 applicants. </para>

                        <para>I wish now to say a word or two in regard to the Tariff. Here, again, I must remind honorable senators - as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> did - of the different picture which is presented to-day, when the attitude of honorable senators like Senators Russell and Findley is contrasted with their attitude of two or three years ago. I should be only indulging in a very pardonable figure df speech if I said that it was nothing short of a miracle which saved the roof of this chamber on many occasions when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> rose to denounce the failure of a previous Government upon this Tariff question. Both he and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> frequently became pathetically indignant at what was not being done. The Labour Government have had two and a half years of office, with the strongest majority behind them that has ever been behind any Government in this Parliament, and yet these honorable senators have sat as quiet as tame tabbies, quite content to be dragged at the tail of their party, rather than to give effect to their public utterances: The whole position may be summarized in this way : That the Labour party not merely promised the electors bread, but bread heavily covered with jam, and promised that it would be served up on a silver salver. Now they come here and contemptuously fling a stone and say that, because they have been successful in securing the enactment of certain laws, they have redeemed their pledges. </para>
                        <para>Passing from this matter, I wish to turn to the Budget. I am not at all sorry - indeed, I am rather glad - that the Minister of Defence has given me an opportunity of contradicting a statement which fell from his lips, and of repeating what I have been saying, not only in the New England electorate, but in the metropolitan districts of my own State, and what I propose to say whenever I have occasion to deal with the Budget figures. I venture to think that the Senate will believe what I am about to say, unless honorable senators are going to impugn the figures presented by the Government themselves. I am about to state facts, and my deductions will follow. The facts which I placed before the audiences, in New England in particular, were that two and a half years ago, prior to the advent of the Labour party to power, the cost of the Federal Government was £8,000,000; that the Federal Government then collected, approximately,£16,000,000, out of which they returned, approximately, £8,000,000 to the States, leaving £8,000,000 which was available for Federal purposes, and which was found sufficient for such purposes. Two and a half years later, the Labour Government collected £20,500,000, and returned to the States only £6,000,000, leaving £14,500,000 in the hands of the Commonwealth, being an increase of £6,500,000 on the expenditure of two and a half years ago. But, in addition to that increase, they are drawing upon the surplus revenue - and here is an expression which may have given rise to some misunderstanding - of their predecessors to the extent of £2,250,000. </para>

                                <para>- It is not the . surplus of last year, because there was a surplus in the Trust Fund before last year. Let me put the thing in another way. Two and a half years ago, the Federal Government cost  £8,000,000,  but to-day it costs£16,500,000, so that there is an increase of over  100  per cent. in the expenditure. </para>

                                <para>- Every one of these figures is to be found in the Budget. The serious part of it is that this year, with the biggest revenue that the Commonwealth has ever had, and with the big revenue which the Treasurer estimates to receive next year, we are unable to live within our income, and the Government would be absolutely face to face with a deficit this year but for the fact that there is a surplus to draw upon. Judging from the utterances made, not merely by the Treasurer elsewhere, but by spokesmen on behalf of the Labour party, it is quite clear that there is no intention, either next year, or the year following, if the Government have their way, of cutting down the expenditure. On the contrary, there is every justification for saying that the demeanour of the party indicates a tendency to swell the expenditure still further. That being so, one has to ask whether we are not immediately in sight, should the Government remain in office, of additional taxation. They have avoided a deficit this year by having a surplus of previous years to fall back upon, but they cannot live upon that for ever. That surplus is being exhausted, and it will not be long before it disappears entirely, and if the present rate of expenditure is continued, it is quite clear that next year they will be under the necessity of proposing a heavy increase in our taxation. </para>

Not only are the public not better served as the result of the increased expenditure, but the Department is not more contented. It was reported only a few weeks ago that there was to be taken in a branch of the postal service in Sydney, a ballot as to whether the men should strike, and to-day there is as much dissatisfaction in this great service as there has been at any time in its history. </para>

                                <para>- The men are complaining - I think with every justification - that whilst they were promised certain definite things the moment the Labour party got into office, the Labour Government not only handed them over to the Arbitration Court, but then turned round and questioned the jurisdiction of that Court to deal with their grievances. No men were ever sold more like a lot of bullocks than were these public servants. Having persuaded the men that they would be allowed to go before the Arbitration Court, and the men having gone there, the Government did just the same thing as many employers have done. They questioned the jurisdiction of the Court itself. </para>

                                <para>- It is about as good a get-away as the honorable senator can find, I have no doubt, but the fact is that it was not the promise given by the Labour party to dissatisfied public servants. </para>

                        <para>I want to deal now with the claim which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has raised, and which is repeated frequently by honorable senators opposite, who ask what we have done. They say, "Your party left a deficit; we paid that off, left a surplus, and spent so much more money." Surely, when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> talked just now of a statement of mine not being wholly accurate, he must admit that that statement is entirely misleading. It is perfectly true that the Estimates presented by the last Government clearly faced a deficit. We knew that within the next year the Commonwealth would, owing to the expiration of the Braddon section, receive an augmentation of income, and have a financial freedom not previously enjoyed, and we said, therefore, that the plain 'and sensible thing to do, rather than impose additional taxation to meet the deficit of one year, was to meet the deficit by a temporary overdraft. That was a plain, business-like proceeding. </para>

                                <para>- No; that was to be spread over a period ; but, at the same time, it was not a deficit; we made provision to meet it. There was a deficit of£450,000. In regard to that paltry deficit, I wish to say that our proposal to provide for it for twelve months, and to meet it the moment the Braddon section expired, when we should be able to handle larger sums, was a businesslike act on the part of a Government which did not believe in going in for additional taxation. </para>

Getting back to my point, I wish to remind the Government that, during the three years they will have been in office at the end of this year, they will have handled  £18,000,000  more than did their predecessors in a corresponding period. Surely they ought to do something with that. </para>

What <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> pointed out was that  £14,000,000  was the extra amount of Customs and Excise revenue handled by this Government, because of the expiration of the Braddon section; but, in addition to that, they will have collected, at the end of this year,  £4,000,000  in land tax. When they make this bold boast about what they have done, they ought to state that they have done it by reason of taking  £18,000,000  more out of the pockets of the people in the three years. </para>

                                <para>- I am not dealing with that point now. If the honorable senator can show that, whilst handling the same amount of revenue, they have done more than we did, it will be something to boast about; but the mere fact that they have been able to spend  £18,000,000  more than we did in three years, does not seem to me, by itself, to constitute any sound reason for the boast in which they indulge. </para>

                                <para>- That is quite true; but the effect of the Government retaining this larger portion of the Customs revenue has been that the State Governments, having received less revenue, have had to impose additional taxation.

When my honorable friends talk about penny postage, and a variety of other things, they should admit, if they want to be fair, that they were able to do those things, not because they had the courage, but merely because they had that measure of financial freedom which came to them with the disappearance of the Braddon section. </para>

                        <para>I do not propose to enter into details concerning the Budget itself, because I recognise that the debate elsewhere and the discussion in the public press have rather made it a threadbare subject; but I do want to take advantage of this opportunity of dealing with the position of the public finances in relation to the very serious financial position which I conceive to be developing in this country, and which I venture to say that honorable senators opposite admit to be developing. I shall do that by mentioning one or two very important factors. Having just stated the increased cost of Federal Government, I shall give in very bald outline an account of the expenditure in my own State, New South Wales. I should also like to give figures for other States, but have not been able to get them. New South Wales, however, contains one-third of the people of the Commonwealth, and therefore its financial system must have a bearing upon the whole Commonwealth. If money were to become short in New South Wales, or if a financial crisis were brought about, the other States of the Union would necessarily be affected. Another reason why I wish to refer to the matter is that my accusation against the party opposite is that it is invariably reckless and extravagant. At this stage it is suggested to me that I should ask leave to continue my remarks on a subsequent occasion. </para>

                        <para>- If the price of sugar were not brought down it would be the fault of the Government themselves. They could reduce the import duty on sugar. The remedy lies in their own hands. Some years ago the Government of India offered a reward of .£10,000 for a machine that would successfully cut and top sugar-cane. That reward was never claimed, because the machine was not invented. In 1895, in Louisiana, a reward of £250 was offered for a cane-cutting machine. In Louisiana sugar-cane is grown to a greater extent than in the whole of Australia. No invention followed the reward. In 1901 or 1902 the Hawaiian Sugar Planters Association opened a competition, in which I myself, with the assistance of a civil engineer, took part, and offered a reward of ,£5,000 for a completed cane-cutting machine, £1,000 for a machine which, with alterations, would be successful, and ,£250 for detailed plans of a' practicable machine. I mention these instances to show that the matter has not been neglected. In Queensland it has been seriously considered. A civil engineer named Tyler, in 1894, made a remark which I believe to be very true. He said - </para>

Later on, in Louisiana, Le Blanc successfully worked a machine for this purpose. But in Louisiana, the conditions are very different .from those of Australia. There crops of cane are usually grown for about ten months, and are then cut down, and practically buried, to avoid the frosts of the winter season. In Australia, we do not bury our crops. </para>

                        <para>- The difference is that in Louisiana cane grows straight up to a height of not more than 6 feet. It grows like wheat, and can practically be reaped ; but in Queensland any crop over 45 tons to the acre will lie down. You then have to deal practically with a mass of cane lying on the ground. If crops were very poor, the Louisiana machine could be employed, but we do not desire to grow poor crops in order to use an American machine. We have not neglected this subject in Queensland. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Paul,</inline> a son of the late Judge Paul, invented a cane-cutting machine, of which I have a photograph here. The machine is worked by compressed air with reciprocating chisel action. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Maxwell,</inline> in a report upon the machine, stated that he believed the prospects of its success were encouraging. I do not think I am betraying confidence when I say that the late Judge Paul told me, when I asked him why further work had not been done upon this machine, that it was absolutely due to want of funds. In 1902, an anonymous correspondent - I do not know who he was - suggested that a special kind of cane should be grown to suit the cutting machine. Later on, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> Edwards pointed out that inventors had already spent a great amount of labour, time, and money in the preliminary investigation of various machines, leaving out the rewards that had been offered, of which there have been a considerable number. There is a machine known as Hurry's machine, and another known as Bravo's. I am not standing as the advocate of any of these machines. T have no axe to grind, except that I honestly want "to reduce the cost of producing sugar-' cane in Australia. I hope honorable senators will take my word for that. I have seen a machine called the Little Giant, which I think was made in South Brisbane. I shall not say whether I think it is constructed on right lines or not. I have also seen <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hurry's</inline> machine in Melbourne. I believe he has spent something like £4,000 or £5,000 upon it - no small amount certainly. It is a large machine, a- good deal larger than the Senate table, and is run by a motor. To my mind, it must be a most expensive machine. If, however, it will do the work required, it will be of great benefit. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bravo,</inline> the inventor of another machine, is, I think, the manager of the Queensland Molasses Company, which carries on business in Melbourne. Some years ago, I inspected his machine, the principle of which was something like that of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Paul's.</inline> It cut and topped every individual cane. It introduced into cane-cutting a machine somewhat on the lines of a sheep -shearing machine. Sugar canes grow of different lengths. They are not planted on the flat, as wheat is, and some have to be cut higher or lower than others. My personal opinion is that each cane will have to be cut separately. Thousands of pounds are being spent to produce an apparatus likely to successfully cut and top cane. I do not see why the CommonwealthGovernment, who apparently can give bonuses for the production of the physical features of members of the community, or of certain agricultural products, should be debarred from giving a bonus for the production of a successful new invention in machinery. </para>

                        <para>- I shall go over to that side in due course, next year, after the elections. I wish now to direct the attention of honorable senators to a most important point. In Europe, machines are employed which dig, top, tail, and load sugar beets at  4½d.  to5d. per ton. A ton of beets contains as much sugar, on the average, as a ton of sugar cane. An acre of land will produce as many tons of beets as the number of tons of sugar cane which are produced on an acre of land in Australia. Roughly speaking,10 tons of sugar beets, or  10  tons of cane, will produce a ton of sugar, so that a ton of beet sugar can be harvested for  4s. 2d. </para>

                        <para>- It does ; but we are very prone here to compare  88  per cent. beet sugar with  99.7  per cent. cane sugar. Taking quality for quality, the average price of beet sugar is almost exactly the same as that of cane sugar. Chemically, the quality of both is the same. The old idea that beet sugar is not as good as cane sugar has been exploded. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know that that matter is worth discussing. At the present time,  88  per cent. beet sugar is worth11s.10½d. per cwt., f.o.b., Hamburg; and  88  per cent. Queensland sugar is worth within a penny or two of the same price. The cost of cutting cane runs from  4s. 6d.  to  7  s. per ton, or from  45s.  to  70s.  per ton of sugar. As I have said, the cost of harvesting sugar-beets is from  4d.  to5d. per ton, or from  3s. 4d.  to  4s. 8d.  per ton of beet sugar. One might safely say that, if we can get a machine which will do for cane what machinery is now doing for the harvesting of sugar-beets, we shall save  £2 10s.  upon every ton of sugar produced in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- According to the newspapers they are. I admit that I have not been in the countries in which they are used; but these machines have been advertised for the last ten or twelve years in the German, Belgian, and French trade journals, namely, <inline font-style="italic">Die Deutsch Zuckerindustrie, Le Sucrerie Indigene,</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Les Fabricants de Sucre.</inline> Setting aside altogether the question of whether we are prepared to make things easier for sugar producers in Australia, it is quite certain that, if we could reduce the cost of producing sugar in this country by £2 10s. per ton, the Government would be perfectly justified - and I say this deliberately, and with a thorough knowledge of the sugar industry - in asking Parliament to reduce the import duty on sugar. A day might come when other sugar-cane growing countries would Introduce similar machinery, and then possibly we should have to reconsider the position. If we could do what I suggest should be done for  the cane-sugar industry, more would be done for the benefit of the people of the whole world than Napoleon did when he introduced the cultivation of sugar-beets into Europe. I have mentioned various machines not on the market, but in course of manufacture. I have seen <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hurry's</inline> machine several times. He has taken it up to Cairns, into the  Mackay, Burdekin, and Bundaberg districts, and further south. He has spent enormous sums of money upon it. I believe I am correct in saying that he has practically ruined himself in connexion with it, and the machine is very nearly right. Honorable senators require to remember that the inventor of one of these machines must make provision for its construction in a big industrial centre, and it cannot be tried in a big industrial centre. He may have to travel 2,000 miles before he can put it into practical use. I am asking for a bonus, not for any particular individual or machine. I am asking that the Government should fall into line with, the Indian Government, and with the Louisiana, Hawaiian, and Java Sugar Planters Associations, and see whether they cannot discover amongst the engineers of the world one who will be able to do for the sugar industry, and therefore for the consumers of sugar, what has been done in other directions by the men who invented sheep-shearing and other machines which have done so much to benefit humanity as a whole. I ask the Government to treat this proposal seriously, and not as a joke, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> seems inclined to do. The matter may be considered from a practical as well as a sentimental point of view. If a man can invent a machine which will benefit the people engaged in the settlement of the tropical portions of the Commonwealth, who are building up a white wall of flesh and blood against the yellow hordes of the East, and which will reduce the cost of sugar, which is at a famine price at the present time, I ask that the Government shall not hold back and say that while they are prepared to give a bonus for this, that, and the other, they will not give any similar encouragement for the production of a machine which will reduce the price of sugar. </para>

                    <para>In submitting this motion for the consideration of honorable senators, I think I may fairly repeat the statement made by the Vice-President of the Executive Council this afternoon in introducing the Pine Creek to Katherine River Railway Survey Bill. He said that when the Northern Territory was taken over by the Commonwealth it was expected that every effort would be made by this Parliament to develop and settle it. Some time ago, feeling that no move had been taken by the Government in that direction, I asked whether it was their intention, during the present session, to take any steps towards the development of the rich mineral areas to be found in the southern portion of the Northern Territory. The official reply which I received was - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>The matter will be brought to the notice of the Director of Mines and Government Geologist for the Territory who has recently been appointed, and is coming to Melbourne next week to confer with the Minister before taking up his duties in the Northern Territory. When that officer has studied the situation and made recommendations, the Minister will give this important subject full consideration. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>That answer seemed to me to imply that the matter was to be delayed for a very considerable time. If the Government Geologist is first to be afforded an  opportunity of examining and reporting upon the Territory, it is obvious that some months must elapse before any practical steps are taken to develop it. That would be a serious mistake. Last year an opportunity was given to the members of this Parliament to visit the northern part of the Territory. Many of us had a prior acquaintance with that portion of the country,  and, in common with others, I felt it would be a good thing if a parliamentary party could be, afforded an opportunity of inspecting the southern portion of the Territory - in fact, of making the trip right through from Oodnadatta to Pine Creek. I know that several members of the Parliament expressed their anxiety to undertake that trip. I went to some little trouble to gain information in regard to the equipment that would be required for such an undertaking, and the cost that would probably be incurred. I supplied full particulars to the Minister of External Affairs, but the only reply which I received was that the Government had decided that nothing should be done in that direction at present. I propose to show that we have ample evidence of the quality of the country that requires to be developed in the southern portion of the Northern Territory, and of the urgent necessity which exists for the extension of railway communication in that region. I intend to place before the Senate the testimony of a number of men who have travelled through this country, who know it well, and who are eminently qualified, by reason of their training, to express an opinion as to its value. The gentleman who has kindly supplied me with information as to the best route to be followed, and the equipment which would be required by a party to cross that country, is Mr.' T. B. Wells, of Adelaide, who has been through it a number of times, who is a practical farmer, who has been engaged in pastoral pursuits, and who possesses a fair knowledge of mineralogy. At my request he has furnished me with a description of the land lying between Oodnadatta and  Birts  Well, which is a few miles north of the MacDonnell Ranges..  His  letter contains a lot of valuable information, which I hope will have the effect of dispelling from the minds of honorable senators the idea that this is a desert country, and that it would be a waste of public money to build a railway through it. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wells</inline> writes - </para>

                        <para>In fulfilment of my promise I am now forwarding you a few notes of my impressions of <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> country between Oodnadatta and Birts Well, north of the MacDonnell Ranges. I have been, four times over the country, spending in alf fifteen months on the trips, and from a practical experience extending over thirty-five years of our Northern country I feel, without wishing' to be egotistical, confident to speak with some degree of authority regarding its possibilities from a mining, pastoral, and agricultural view. </para>
                        <para>Leaving Oodnadatta the country commences to improve at Storm Creek - 18 miles out - and the Wire Creek Bore is met 3 miles further on, the overflow from which goes about 7 miles in a north-easterly direction over a comparatively level plain, well grassed in ordinary seasons %. between there and the Alburga Creek low sandhills for 3 miles are met with, then  2  miles further on the Stevenson, a large gum creek is crossed and Macumba Head Station is come to. A few miles to the eastward these two creeks junction, and a large area of flooded flats - growing immense quantities of feed after ordinary rains. Country being timbered with gums in the creeks, and to a lesser extent wilh mulga on the sandy rises. Ten miles north of Macumba Station a bore has been put down on the edge of the Stevenson, and a large supply of water struck. To the ' north and east of this point, lies Dalhousie Station, on which are the famous Dalhousie Springs (artesian). The next bore met with is the Hamilton - approximately 70 miles north of Oodnadatta - this bore has been re-cased lately, and an enormous amount of water is running daily into the Stevenson.. At ros miles Bloods Creek Station is come to - here we are getting on to the outer edge of the artesian area, and the water does not come within 50 feet of the surface, in this neighbourhood are stations owned by Kidman, Bailes, Harvey, and Sandford, stocked principally with sheep - wool from here is scoured and sent by teams to the rail head. Settlement to the west extends for over 100 miles, and to the east 75 miles, when the Anacoora sandhills are met with. Sixteen miles further north the Adminga Creek is crossed - country each side, low ranges with rich flats, small creeks with mulga, well grassed. At 135 miles the Charlotte Waters Telegraph Station, the southern border of the Northern Territory, is reached. The country here is flat, covered with gibbers, large and small, but carrying good grass with a small rainfall. A bore has been put down here, but water only rises to within 70 feet of the surface, from where it is pumped to the surface. Following the telegraph line, New Crown Point cattle station is met, but another track going N.N.W. passes through magnificent country, well wooded and grassed right through to the Goyder Creek. Undulating ranges fairly well' timbered and grassed are crossed when Old Crown Point on the Finke is reached. The same description of the country applies until Horseshoe Bend cattle station, on the Finke, is reached. Westward of this station lies Erldunda cattle and horse station, 3 miles north,, the depot sandhills have to be crossed, and at 15 miles the depot well is reached. These sandhills are covered with desert oak - many of the trees are from  2  to 3 feet in diameter - the wood is impervious to white ants, and would, be invaluable for cabinetmakers if a means, could be' found to get it to market. When dry it is exceedingly light in colour and weight.. An enormous quantity is available. After rain. these sandhills are covered with "parakyla' - a succulent growth on which cattle fatten and can go without water for weeks. Twelve miles further on is the Alice Well, on the " Hugh," the head station of the " Hayes " - father and sons who own <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Burrell</inline> and Undoolza, in fact, the whole of the country north from here to the centre of the MacDonnell Ranges. At 22 miles the Frances Well is come to  -  country in between low sandhills - clay flats with mulga - well grassed between here and the Deep Well. Sixty-five miles south of Alice Springs the country is undulating with stony rises and well grassed. From the Deep Well to Temple Bar reek - 12 miles south of Alice Springs - the -same class of country is met with, but to the eastward the ranges commence to get much bolder, rockholes become more frequent. . Between Temple Bar Creek and Hearitree Gap - (the entrance to the MacDonnell Ranges at this point) - occurs the Emily plain, of enormous extent, and in an average season heavily grassed. Alice Springs, which is situated on the " Todd," and about 3 miles in the ranges, is on a sandy flat surrounded by hills. Eastward 12 miles is Undoolza Station, through which the track to Arltunga passes' (75 miles distant)'. North is Bond Springs cattle station, south-west Owen Springs cattle station, and further west Henbury and the Mission Station. The area of pastoral country to the westward unoccupied but fit for pastoral purposes, is enormous, and the same thing applies to the country north of Bond Springs station, and eastward from Arltunga to the Queensland Border. </para>
                        <para>With the exception of the Quartzite and Granitic Hills or Ranges, the whole of the MacDonnell Range country that I have passed over, is magnificently grassed, the schist hills to the top fairly well covered with mulga and well grassed. </para>
                        <para>North from the MacDonnell Ranges and eastward we come upon the long rolling tablelands, unstocked, but well grassed, and capable of Carrying millions of head of stock. The great drawback to this country is the lack of rapid and cheap communication with the sea-board. With a railway, provisions would be at least -50 per cent, cheaper. Boring plants could be get for testing likely, localities for local artesian supplies, and country now lying useless could be put to a profit. It is pitiful to see the enormous areas of well-grassed land without a hoof on them. The same remark applies to most of the country north from Oodnadatta. </para>

                        <para>With a railway, abattoirs, and freezing works at several places along the line, an enormous trade could be opened up in frozen goat, mutton, and beef with the "Straits Settlements" and adjoining Eastern countries. From Oodnadatta to Pine Creek and the country east and west, it would be the rankest of rank folly to attempt to grow wheat or other cereals - it would only mean ruin to whoever attempted it. The country is purely a pastoral one, and with proper means of communication there is an enormous future before it. The Angora goat industry would yield enormous profits' - the mohair is in great demand - three clips are obtainable every two years, and the carcases if frozen would; as I have already stated, command a ready sale in the East. </para>
                        <para>Minerals. - So far as is known no payable minerals exist south from the MacDonnell Ranges to Oodnadatta. In the Ranges itself- and I can speak from practical experience - gold exists, and in payable quantities. The best deposit by far is the White Range, and if proper facilities for mining were given, the group of mines at this place would eventually prove to be one of the biggest gold propositions in Australia. In a diorite belt (3 miles north of the White Range) about 8 miles long and 5 to 6 miles wide, are hundreds of small fissure lodes all carrying good gold, some of these which have been sunk on are increasing in width at depth (75 to 100 feet) and carry values from 30 dwt. "to 3 oz. per ton. (The White Range lodes are fissures in quartzite.) Genuine prospecting would no doubt eventually lead, to many other discoveries. </para>
                        <para>Mica. - Very large deposits of clean mica exist in the Hart Range, 40 miles north from Arltunga, the sheets are large and very clean, unspotted ; and small consignments sent to London have commanded too price, but the cost of labour, transit, &amp;c, was so high, that after £2,000 was spent, operations were discontinued. </para>

The country, although of such a sandy nature, cannot in the strict sense of the word be termed a desert. Large areas of these sandhills are richly grassed, and the flats of the Finke and Hugh Creeks, after a fair rainfall. are clothed with rich herbage and grasses. The latter also stand well in dry seasons of reasonable duration. This country is fit only for pastoral purposes, and several cattle stations are now formed in its centre as evidence of its suitability. </para>

                        Winnecke, who had charge of an expedition known as the Horn Expedition in, I think 1894, and who spent three years in the MacDonnell Ranges surveying, has made a report. I might mention here that I have in my possession his original plan showing the country to a very considerable extent. He describes the character of the country right along the route of the telegraph line, which, in all probability, will be the route of the transcontinental railway from Oodnadatta to Pine Creek. With your permission, sir, I shall have the map hung either in the chamber or in the lobby, in order that honorable senators may make themselves conversant with the character of the country. It is a very valuable map, and ought, I feel sure, to be very instructive.

                        <para>My experience of the Northern Territory extends over 35 years. I have been astounded at the frequent mention of desert country. My experience is that some of the finest pastoral country in the world is found in Central Australia. Water, principally artesian, is more abundant than supposed. Gold is scattered all through this vast area, one quartz range showing gold for fully 36 miles. The Orabarra Reef, in the Jervois and Tarlton Ranges, has never been visited by any white man but myself. Professor Tate and Experts Watt and Achimiovitch (members of the Horn Expedition, of which I was commander) all stated that the best indications of diamonds exist to the west of Charlotte Waters. Coal of good quality is found in the MacDonnell and more northern areas. It speaks for itself that more than a fourth of the Territory is settled with stations, mines, &amp;c. I have no hesitation in declaring that it will be the finest and most remunerative country in Australia. The extent of auriferous country is simply unknown, and a railway would increase all these resources a hundred-fold. My past remarks on the fertility of the Northern Territory should be a guarantee that I am not in error. </para>

A few miles off the route to the eastward are found the wonderful nest of springs called Dalhousie - a group of springs nestling in a hollow surrounded by low hills. Here we find hot springs, cold springs, and intermittent springs, all fresh drinkable waters. Some with fish, some without. An inexhaustible supply for all purposes, including irrigation. Some are on top of mounds, some are on level ground. The growth of acacias, grass and reeds show the water is fit for irrigation.

Along the Coglan Creek there is rich pasture land. Salt and cotton bush and grasses and herbs of many descriptions. Water is of the finest quality and inexhaustible. Along the Finke River, which has a wide sandy bed, a fair number of gum trees grow luxuriantly. Numbers of sleepers could be obtained in this locality.

                        <para>I find the general average of the stone raised in bulk from the nine principal claims on the White Range for the past half year is 10 dwt*, of gold per ton. This, with a moderate amount of sorting, could be increased to probably <inline font-style="italic">i'.</inline> dwts. or 12 dwts. per ton by picking out the large barren portions that contain little or no cellular stone. This yield would not be of a sensational character, but with a good supply of water, economical management, and with the appliances indicated should prove remunerative and a fair mining investment. </para>
                        <para>The present mode of working is chiefly confined to the surface and to a vertical depth of from 15 feet to 30 feet, following the seams, vughs, and cellular quartz that contain the most valuable material. Below this depth the vein matter and enclosing rock are exceptionally hard, and the question of its size and value remains to be determined. </para>
                        <para>The mines that have been worked in the other parts of the field are not of such hard, dense nature, the enclosing rock being principally schist and granitic formations, but, in most instances, the veins are smaller, and the stone raised requires the same careful selection to bring the yield up to a payable standard. This is partly necessary owing to the high cost of transit from the claims to the reduction works and the gold contents not being equally distributed through the vein matter.- </para>

                            <para>- The stone actually yielded that amount of gold. With regard to the mica fields, I have here a comprehensive report by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Schlosser,  an expert imported to report upon the subject for a foreign company. He estimates that there is at least 7,000 square miles of mica-bearing country, and that the mica is of a payable character. They get sheets up to 12 inches, which is an extraordinary size. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Schlosser  quotes the value of mica as procured in other parts of the world. Sheets 2J inches by 6 inches are valued at 2s. 6d. per lb; 3 inches by 6 inches, 6s. 6d. per lb. ; 3 J inches by 8 inches, 8s. per lb. So that it would appear that the mica field alone would be of immense value to Australia, and would lead to the employment and settlement of a large population, quite apart from the gold deposits. </para>

                                in his report, says that they can be obtained np to 9 inches. All this evidence goes to prove that the MacDonnell Range country is eminently adapted to carry a large population. lt enjoys one of the finest climates in the world. There is an immense extent of the range country, extending from east to west  400  miles, and from north to south from  20  to  50  miles. The area is roughly estimated at  10,000  square miles. Nearly the whole of the country is at an altitude of over  2,000  feet above sea level, varying from that to  4,000  feet. There is a good, though not heavy, rainfall amounting to about  11  inches, and plenty of water can be procured by boring and sinking. Quite a number of precious stones have been discovered. At one time, what were believed to be rubies were to be obtained almost by the bushel, but it was afterwards stated that they were garnets. They are certainly handsome stones. Genuine rubies have been found there, and also diamonds. There are immense possibilities, because the country has never been fairly developed. The cost of carriage from Oodnadatta to the MacDonnell Ranges amounts to is. per ton per mile.

                            <para>- If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger had to pay is. per ton per mile on everything he ate, drank, and wore while searching for rubies, he would require to find an enormous number of stones to pay the cost. I' have said enough to show that the country is worth developing. When the Commonwealth took over the Northern Territory it became responsible for the railway from Port Augusta to Oodnadatta, upon which there is a deficit of about  £80,000  a year. The reason for the deficit is that the line really stops in a desert, whilst, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wells</inline> tells us,  40  miles further on the country begins to get better. There is every reason to believe that if the line were pushed into the good country it would be made payable. The sum of  £80,000,  capitalized at  4  per cent., amounts to about  £2,000,000.  Surely it would be wise, instead of allowing the deficit to increase - for it is growing at the rate of about £3,000 a year - to borrow  £2,000,000  at  4  per cent, to carry the railway into the good country, make it profitable, and get rid of the deficit. In the country occupied by sheep, the wool has to be carried by teams, and in very dry seasons by camels, from  70  to  100  miles to Oodnadatta. That shows the disadvantages under which the pastoralists are working, and the enormous development which* must follow the construction of a railway. A preliminary survey has already been made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Graham</inline> Stewart. He surveyed three alternative routes, and I have before me a copy of his report, with plans explaining exactly the character of the country traversed by the line. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Graham</inline> Stewart thoroughly agrees with what I have quoted as to the value of the country. </para>

I assume that the Government would in this case do the same as they propose to do in the case of the Pine Creek to the Katherine railway, namely, construct to carry a  4-ft. 8J-in.  gauge railway, and lay down rails on the 3-ft. 6-in. gauge in order that supplies may be conveniently carried until the line is finished. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Graham</inline> Stewart, in concluding his report, gives this very valuable advice to the South Australian Government, which I recommend the Commonwealth Government to follow.

                        <para>In conclusion, I would respectfully urge the advisability of having the route of the transcontinental railway between the Angle Pole and Pine Creek definitely fixed by trial survey. The advantages of such a course would be - 1. That the line could be constructed in sections as required, with the absolute certainty that the best route had been selected. 2. That the water supply could be provided along the route in advance of the construction. Before the trial survey could be extended north of the MacDonnell Ranges it would be necessary to make an examination of the country between those ranges and Pine Creek, similar to that recently completed from the Angle Pole- northwards, which forms the basis of this report. </para>

The Federal Government have made- a start in taking the line from north to south, and with their proposal in that connexion I am in entire agreement. I think that a line from Pine Creek to the Katherine River is necessary for the immediate development of that part of the Northern Territory. But I desire to impress upon the Government, and upon the Minister of External Affairs particularly, that the rational way in which to develop the Northern Territory is to construct the line from south to north. If it is decided to construct the line from north to south we shall have to send men round to Port Darwin by a long sea voyage. They will be landed in a tropical region, and in conditions to which they are unaccustomed, and, in all probability, the majority of them will become invalided in a few weeks, or months, and will desire to return to the south. </para>

                            <para>- Undoubtedly the climate of the high, central table lands of Australia is the best in the world. In the summer time, though the days are warm, the nights are always cold, and the air is dry and very healthy. It would be a comparatively easy matter to construct the railway from south to north. We could draw the men required for the work from the southern parts of Australia, and many of them would, no doubt, take their families along with them. They would not remain permanently at work on the railway, but would engage in prospecting and mining, and so would settle the country as the railway progressed. By the time it was completed as far as the MacDonnell Ranges, there would, in all probability, be a large settlement in that salubrious district. As the line progressed further north, into the tropical regions, some of the men from the southern parts of Australia engaged upon it would probably suffer from malaria, but, instead of having to go to a hospital at Port Darwin, or round to Sydney, they would find, in the MacDonnell Ranges country, a magnificent sanatorium to assist their recovery. Everything points to the fact that the difficulties of developing the Northern Territory from the north are immensely greater than the difficulties in the way of its development from the south? The Federal Government have had possession of the Northern Territory for two years, and all that they have attempted to do in order to develop it has been to repeat what the South Australian Government did for forty years without success. But the Commonwealth Government are doing what South Australia did in a very much more expensive way. As they have more money at their backs than the South Australian Government had, no doubt the country will be developed under the Commonwealth, but the process will be very costly, and must necessarily be very slow. The South Australian Government proved, years ago, by experimental farms, that almost all kinds of products can be grown in the Northern Territory, and that is what the Federal Government are now endeavouring to prove by' the experimental farms they are establishing. When it has again been proved, how will the Government induce people to go there? People will hesitate to take a long sea trip and settle in a tropical country so long as land is available for them in the southern districts of Australia. I do not think I need detain the Senate any longer. I commenced by quoting the first sentence of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor's</inline> speech in introducing the Pine Creek to Katherine River Railway Survey Bill, and I may appropriately conclude with a sentence which the honorable senator used a little later in the same speech. He said it is the duty of the Federal Government to endeavour in every possible way to develop the great Northern Territory. In my opinion, the best possible, and the only effective, way to develop this great territory speedily is by constructing a railway from Oodnadatta into the MacDonnell Ranges, to open up for settlement that enormous area of rich country. </para>

I say so because, whether the honorable senator intended it or not, his speech was a corollary to much that I said yesterday in dealing with the Budget. As a South Australian representative he has quoted authorities whom he is entitled to regard with respect, and assuming that their descriptions of the MacDonnell Ranges country are correct, the honorable senator, and every other representative of South Australia, are entitled to ask the Government to reconsider their policy in this matter. </para>

Assuming that the reports quoted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Story</inline> are correct, the Government who are committed to the transcontinental line through the Northern Territory should not hesitate for a moment to advance the line from Oodnadatta, and to say just what they intend to do in the matter. Although <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie are smiling, they both recognise the dilemma in which they are placed. o </para>

                            <para>- By smiling is the only way in which honorable senators meet their difficulties. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Story</inline> towards the conclusion of his speech mentioned that we have to face a deficit of  £80,000  or  £[90,000  per annum on the railway from Port Augusta to Oodnadatta, because it terminates in a desert. He said that; by the extension of the line, we should be able to make it pay. I was delighted to hear so faithful and consistent a supporter of the Government ask them why they hesitated to borrow money to advance the line from Oodnadatta into the MacDonnell Ranges, because I said, yesterday, that, sooner or later, the Government would have to take such action in connexion with all these big railway proposals. Knowing the financial policy oE the Government, I was delighted to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Story,</inline> in asking for the continuation of the Oodnadatta line into the Mac-. Donnell Ranges district, recognise that the Government must undertake the construction of the railway by loan moneys for the benefit of South Australia, and indirectly of every other State in the Commonwealth. He is quite right.  His  conclusion is perfectly sound, and it is the duty of the Government to investigate the soundness of the premises upon which he bases that conclusion. The same remark is applicable to the other railway undertakings which are necessary for the development of Australia. I make this statement with the usual reservation that lawyers attach to their written statements " without prejudice " to any future action that I may take in regard to further railway extension either towards Queensland, or north and south. I have very much pleasure in supporting the motion, and if the districts the Northern Territory are what they are represented to be, the Government are in duty bound to answer the question which has been put to them by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Story,</inline> " Why delay ?" If we have not sufficient money to build this line out of revenue, why do not the Government boldly submit a loan policy for its construction? I shall support the motion. </para>

                            <para>- I am not discussing the question of who has courage. But there are some New South Wales representatives in this Parliament who believe that it would be wise to adopt the proposed eastern deviation. From what study I have given to this question - and I have read a good deal upon it for years past - I believe that the transcontinental line to the Northern Territory should be continued from Oodnadatta to Pine Creek, and that it should not go by any circuitous route through Queensland. Whether the people of New South Wales, as a whole, differ from me or not, I do not know, nor do I verv much care. I am of opinion that a good many persons in New South Wales and Queensland desire a more eastern route, and I am rather suspicious that there are some Western Australians who think that it would be better for the line to traverse a route in the direction of their State. But all the evidence we have in our possession is in favour of the proposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Story.</inline> I go further, and say that the Northern Territory Acceptance Act, which embodies the agreement that the Commonwealth entered into with South Australia, should be honoured irrespective of whether or not the Oodnadatta to Pine Creek route is the best. Having deliberately adopted that agreement, it would be a scandalous breach of faith if we failed to give effect to it. We are not a lot of children who enter into agreements without responsibility. </para>

                            <para>- While it would be a scandalous breach of faith to adopt any other than the direct route, it would be a very much meaner breach of faith if, because no time is mentioned in that agreement, we postponed the project indefinitely. That would be keeping the word of promise to the ear, and breaking it to the hope. The manifest and inescapable obligation is thrown upon this Parliament, whatever Government may be in power, to proceed with the construction of that line at the earliest possible moment. In the best interests of the people of Australia, I believe that we should proceed with the building of it from the south to the north. Had I thought that there was the slightest possibility of defeating the Government proposal for the survey of a line from Pine Creek to the Katherine River, I would have voted against it, because I believe it is like attempting to climb a tree from the top instead of from the bottom. If we build the railway from the north to the south, and the Eastern menace ever materializes, we shall be offering it facilities to invade the country by giving it a base from which to fight, and by doing exactly the opposite of what a nation inspired by common sense would do. The arguments which have been advanced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Story</inline> as to the advantages of using the existing line to Oodnadatta for the carriage of the materials required for its extension northwards are so obvious that it is almost a shame it should be necessary to repeat them. Yet while everybody tacitly acknowledges that the agreement with South Australia should be honoured, no active move is being made to give effect to it. </para>

Territory, we have a right to expect that some substantial effort should be made, not merely to recoup ourselves those losses, but to carry out the work which she failed to carry out.

                            <para>- It is all very well for the honorable senator to talk about South Australia's lack of pluck. There is no doubt that the resources of Queensland enable it to start works from different points which were quite out of the question in the case of South Australia. The whole of our Defence system, on which we are spending millions of money, will be a farce unless we do something to effectively defend the Northern Territory. To commence building a transcontinental railway from the north to the south is to offer our assets to the enemy. </para>

                            <para>- Certainly we shall be offering a probable prize, and for that reason I would oppose the construction of the Pine Creek to the Katherine River extension, ignoring the plea that it will provide a link in the proposed transcontinental line, if my vote would effectively settle the matter. We should have the pluck to say what route we intend the transcontinental line to follow without fear of the consequences. The electors of this country would rather support a party which did that, than they would a party which indulges in shilly-shallying. In regard to the financing of the project, I can see no great difficulty. Admittedly the construction of a railway from a place distant from the sea-board - I mean from Oodnadatta - to Pine Creek, would not be a rapid undertaking. A considerable time would be occupied in obtaining proper surveys of the country, and in transporting the necessary material to the points where it would be required. The work would take years to complete, and that is the reason why not a moment should be lost in commencing it. The very fact that it w'ould take years to complete renders it possible to construct the line without resort to borrowing. I can well understand <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Story's</inline> idea that the pastoral and mineral possibilities of the MacDonnell Range country might make the railway a payable one when it reached that region. I submit that, if we can construct a Navy without the aid of borrowed money, we can also build this line out of revenue. For some years, at any rate, it would be principally a strategic line, and I am of opinion that it could be constructed on a cash basis. </para>

                            <para>- The determination of the route is a matter of policy, which can be settled irrespective of finance, because, whether we start from the north or from the south, or link up with existing lines in Queensland, money will be required. I think that there should be a declaration, without any delay, that this Government intend, whether they are able to start now or not, to honour the agreement which was solemnly entered into by this Parliament, and that so soon as they can fix up the financial proposals necessary, the construction of the line will be commenced from this end with the determination to carry it through as one means of effectively defending Australia in the future, and, at any rate, as a necessity if we are to open up this vast Northern Territory. The authorities quoted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Story</inline> did not prove that the country is all that we could wish. We must all admit that, not only there, but in the inland parts-of the large States, there is a great deal of country which is a long way from being first-class, mainly, of course, by reason of its deficient rainfall. No one could follow the extracts from the diaries of the friends of the honorable senator without realizing that there are large stretches of sandhills from time to time met with, that there are places where there are rocks and stones strewn over millions of acres, and so on, and that we cannot expect to find it equal to the best of the fringe of country which has been settled along the eastern coast. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, it was shown that much of it is fair pastoral country. I take it that if a means of transit were provided very much of that country now carrying cattle would carry sheep, and would be much more remunerative. We find that in the other States country which, at the outset carried cattle, became, after development had taken place, more fitted for sheep, and returned a very much larger profit per mile from sheep than it formerly did from cattle. I believe, therefore, that while the coastal fringe and that country which grows dense strong grasses and rank herbage will not, perhaps, be suitable for other than cattle, the inland part will carry millions of sheep in the future. For that purpose, there is no doubt that a railway is absolutely necessary. It is far easier to transport wool through dreadfully uneven, rough, mountain country for a short distance than it is to take it for a long distance on even open plains, in country such as is sketched, without railway transportation. For settlement, development, and safety, the construction of this railway should be commenced at' the earliest possible date, and this or any other Government that do not honour the agreement solemnly entered into by this Parliament are not worthy of the support of any honest man. We should get to work as soon as we possibly can to give effect to the agreement, first, by deciding upon the route, and then by taking the necessary steps to commence the work. </para>

                        <para>- - To-day, I asked the Minister representing the Postmaster-General a question, without notice, with reference to the provision of wireless stations at Brisbane and Rockhampton, but I was too late to give notice of the question for to-morrow. I beg to inform the honorable senator that to-morrow I shall ask the question, without notice. I have since heard that the wireless station at Pinkenba is under construction. I should like to have an intimation as to when the Department think that that station, and the one at Rockhampton, will be working? </para>

                        <para>. - I wish to make a personal explanation regarding a statement I made during the debate on the Budget-speech yesterday. In answer to an inquiry with regard to the gold reserve of Canada, I said that the Dominion, with regard to its notes, held gold or its equivalent up to 80 per cent. That statement was not quite correct. I was speaking on the authority of an article which I had read. </para>
