          <para>. - I shall be pleased if the Minister in charge of the Bill can tell the Committee what is likely to be the total cost of the store at Darling Island, Sydney, for the purposes of public Departments. Generally speaking, a person obtains an estimate before he starts a work of this magnitude, and is able to say what the total cost may be. In my speech on the second reading of the Bill yesterday, I asked the Minister to give the Senate and the country an idea of the probable cost of this store at Darling Island, in respect of which we are asked to re- vote &#163;7,517, and to pass a new vote of &#163;983. </para>

A few weeks ago the Senate made an order for a return of particulars relating to the construction of this building. A long time seems to be taken in preparing the return. It ought to have been ready before this time, I should think. </para>

        <para>It may be noted that the State Public Works Department (Victoria) prepared an estimate of cost of constructing a building of about the same size as the structure now in question. Such estimate, presumably made on a &#34; contract &#34; basis, involved a greater cost per cubic foot than was contemplated in the estimate adopted by the Department of Home Affairs in connexion with the execution of the work by day labour. </para>
        <para>The State Public Works Department&#39;s estimate was &#163;27,000 for a gross Boor area of about 33,000 square feet. The estimate of the Department of Home Affairs was &#163;27,000 for a gross floor area of 41,000 square feet. The building  is costing about &#163;3,000 more than the original estimate, accounted for by the general increase in the cost of building construction. for the purpose of further comparison, it may be  mentioned  that tenders have recently seen received by the Commonwealth for a large building in Adelaide, and the price of the lowest tender is  20  per cent, mure per cubic foot than the cost of the new offices in Melbourne.  t do not think that the honorable senator will derive much satisfaction from that return. The portion of the building for which tenders were called has been constructed by day labour at less than the lowest tender, and although 8,000 square feet have been added to the space origina71 v contemplated, the building will be completed at a cost within  .&#163;3,000  of the Department&#39;s original estimate. </para>

            <para>- No. I am referring to a Commonwealth building. The estimate of the Department was  ,&#163;27,000  for a floor area of  41,000  square feet, and  1  he State Department&#39;s estimate for constructing a building of about the same size, presumably on a &#34; contract &#34; basis, involved a greater cost per cubic foot than was contemplated in the estimate of the Department of Home Affairs under the day-labour system. The estimate of the Department of Home Affairs for erecting a building of  33,000  square feet was  &#163;27,000,  and the actual cost of completing a building which contains  41,000  square feet has been  ,&#163;30,000.  I contend that in this case, which has been pointed to as une of the failures of the day-labour system, a comparison with similar work performed by contract in a neighbouring State, will show that a saving of  20  per cent, has been effected, and that the cost of the building has been kept well within the Department&#39;s original estimate. So that my honorable friends opposite will get no change out of that. </para>

            <para>- No, but 1 am pointing out how easy it is to give an appearance of supplying information whilst at the same time suppressing some. The Minister of Defence has read out figures to show the estimated cost of the building in question exclusive of certain items. The figures he gave do not represent the total cost at all, because the whole thing was; subject to certain items which were excluded.  Throughout the whole thing  we  had &#34; excluding this,&#34; &#34; excluding that,&#34; and &#34;excluding the other.&#34; I have no doubt that honorable senators opposite will go round and tell people that this return shows  that  the actual cost has exceeded the estimate by only &#163;3,000. But they have cut  out  a lot of items. </para>

            <para>- Exactly; and therefore it is difficult to take one particular case and say, &#34; Under these circumstances a job was carried out by day labour more economically than it could have been carried out under the contract system&#34;; and the reverse position is equally true. We cannot arrive at the truth in that way. We can only get at it by observation and investigation over a very much wider area, and conducted by more impartial judges than those who are directly involved in the management of one or other of the two systems. I do not expect an officer employed by a Government Department to carry out work on the day-labour system to give an impartial report on that system, nor would I expect a contractor, when giving his views of the situation, to be an unbiased judge. He is not. </para>

          <para>. - Arising out of the explanation which the Minister of Defence has given, I desire to point out that we are called upon to vote nearly &#163;3,000,000 of money, and it is highly necessary that one or two things should accompany the request of the Government for this expenditure. We ought to have details furnished with sufficient fullness to guide us as to what is the estimated cost of buildings proposed to be erected. We ought also to have information as to whether estimates of works in progress are being exceeded or not. Thirdly, we ought to have a general report to guide us more or less in our deliberations, and as to the votes we give. We should not have had so much discussion on this matter if such information had been supplied in connexion with the present Bill. I also point to the necessity of having if we are to spend enormous sums or buildings, an independent Public Works Committee, which will not be at the mercy of the reports of officers, who, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has pointed out, necessarily tend to be biased on the side on which they are working. </para>

But the moment this return is supplied, the Leader of the Opposition gets up to throw discredit upon it. He says that it is worth nothing ; that it is necessarily biased, and, therefore, no one should pay any attention to it. I venture to say that if the return had been the other way, the Government would have been condemned outright, and would hardly have ever heard the last of it. The facts disclosed show that day labour in this case, instead of being ineffective, has been more effective and economical than if the work had been carried out by a contractor. </para>

            <para>- That is not so, because the strong room in the Treasury building is contained in the building, but is not built into it. One of its peculiar features is that it is open all round and underneath, as well as on top, so that any one attempting to interfere with it may be easily detected. It is connected with the building only by the small steel pillars, 6 or 7 feet high, on which it stands. So that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> is quite at sea in this matter. The whole trouble is that our honorable friends opposite are very much concerned because contractors are no longer given the opportunity to make huge profits from Government works. </para>

            <para>- There are several other cases nearly as bad as the Robb case. 1 venture to say that our honorable friends opposite are aware of many places in which contractors have made a competency out of Government contracts. So long as they did it in the ordinary course of business, I have no objection, but I hold that the Government have a right to find a way by which they can save these enormous profits from people who have to find the &#34; boodle.&#34; Is it any wonder that our honorable friends opposite, who represent the people who generally grab all the unearned profits and unearned increments, are always ready to rise in arms against a system which deprives those persons of huge profits ? I hope that the Government will adhere strictly to the day-labour system in carrying out all public works, including railways. I would remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> that were he leading the Government here to-day, he would have had to turn to this officer for a report when he wanted information regarding the construction of the Treasury building. Is it fair for him to say that officers are biased when they are simply quoting actual figures in regard to the cost of the building as compared with the original estimate? No. I trust that the Government will use their best efforts to see that the day-labour system is honestly carried out, and if that is done, I feel satisfied that the people will save very large sums in addition to having their public works carried out more faithfully than possibly could be done under the contract system. </para>

          <para>-  I have listened very carefully to the long discussion on this item. My complaint is that, except by asking for a return, we have no means of knowing the estimated cost of any work included in these Estimates. It is impossible for any honorable senator to bear in mind all the votes towards the cost of a building, which have been passed. It is utterly impossible when a Bill is brought forward on Friday to search the records of the Department for years to find out how much a particular building has cost up to date. </para>

            <para>- If the information were available here, it would shorten the consideration of the Estimates to a large extent. I maintain that it should be available now. I do not know why <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> asked for a return regarding the construction of the Treasury building. I have no objection to day labour so long as <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> work is done for the money. If you have a good man, and he cannot get as good work out of the hands as a contractor could, he should be dismissed. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> knows the place from which I come, and is aware that I have been there for forty years. T have never been in favour of contract labour there. I do not think that many men have a better record than that. My desire is to see that the money is spent to the best advantage of the country. I wish to know if proper estimates of the cost of public works have been made. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Long,</inline> who has been the manager of a mine, knows that if he had gone to the directors for permission to put in a  200-feet  level, they would have immediately asked for an estimate of the cost, and that  if he had exceeded the estimate by very much, he would have been &#34;hauled over the coals.&#34; Instead of dealing with a small sum we are dealing with millions, and in the dark, too. I do not care whether the Government go on with contract or day-labour, so long as they get a fair return for the taxpayers. If you have good men I prefer day-labour every time, but unless there is a proper system of supervision you will not get a fair return. Sufficient information regarding the Treasury Building in Melbourne has not been supplied to us. In his speech the Minister of Defence said something about  .&#163;56,000  for the building, but I notice that it has got down to  &#163;33,000. </para>

            <para>-The whole thing has got so mixed up that no honorable senator can find out what is correct. Our whole contention has been that we have not been furnished with a proper estimate of the cost of the building. We are now told that a certain portion has cost  &#163;33,000.  But I want the Committee to see if that is a fair thing. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> said that there were certain matters to which I referred ; that things were costing a good deal more now than they did when the estimate for this building was framed.

            <para>- Yes; but the report is too long for me to remember. The Minister of Defence compares the cost of the Treasury Building with that of some building for which tenders have been called in Adelaide, but he said nothing about the material being so much dearer now. I want the whole thing to be put plainly before the Committee so that we may all know what we are doing. If we are provided with that information I am prepared to pass the item without further talk. I suggest that before we rise to speak the Government should tell us the estimated cost of any work towards the cost of which we are asked to vote a certain sum. I believe that if they adopt my suggestion they will shorten the proceedings. </para>

          <para>. - I am somewhat astonished that honorable senators on the other side should want figures other than those which have been presented in order to substantiate the position taken up by the Ministry regarding this item. Surely from the report presented by the Minister of Defence for the Home Affairs Department, it is self-evident that nothing but the best of work has been put in, and that nothing but the closest of scrutiny has been exercised.I feel satisfied that otherwise the first estimate would not have been so closely adhered to as it has been according to the report. I think that it demonstrates the desirability of the Government constructing public works by day-labour in preference to employing a contractor who might be able to make a very large fortune. I remember one or two contracts with which I came very closely in contact, but I presume that, as they do not relate to this particular building,  1  should not be justified in referring to them. We have had, for once, a refreshing breeze from the other side through <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers.</inline> I wish to compliment him upon his stirring declaration that he has always been in favour of day-labour against the contract system. </para>

            <para>- But there has been a good deal of other expenditure incurred. One has only to peruse the personal columns in our daily newspapers to see that there is a perfect pilgrimage of officers from the Department of Home Affairs to Yass-Canberra and back again. As a matter of fact, motor cars are even located at the railway station nearest to the Capital site to enable them to make frequent journeys to and from that site. </para>

            <para>- Either we mean to go seriously ahead with the building of the Federal Capital, or we do not. If we do, .the way to do it is not to vote small dribbling sums such as &#163;68,000, for the purpose. The expenditure of these small sums means that a generation will elapse before we shall have anything to show for our money. In the meantime, we are losing interest on the sums already expended, and we are sacrificing an equal amount by reason of the time of officials which is wasted in travelling backwards and forwards to the site. Those honorable senators who wish the building of the Capital to be proceeded with without delay, equally with those who desire to see the work at a stand-still, will agree that I am laying down a sound business proposition. At the j. resent rate of progress, we shall be just as far off having a Federal Capital in ten years&#39; time as we are now. </para>

            <para>- The same statement was made last year. If these items represent preliminary expenditure which is necessary to enable the Government to embark upon a thorough business undertaking next year, the Minister should outline what is the nature pf that undertaking. The Government evidently think there is something to be done there, because they have found that the Territory can no longer get along without it being placed under the control of &#34;  His  Excellency.&#34; Indeed, the Ministry are much more energetic in making appointments with these high-sounding titles than they are in transacting the business of the country. If we are only going to spend these small amounts, where is the necessity for appointing a Governor for the Federal Territory? Tt is quite possible, I suppose, that in the near future we shall have a Government House there. Indeed, we mav be inundated with invitations to attend Government House balls. Instead of rushing in to create new titles, and to make fresh appointments, the Government would be very much better employed in pushing ahead with the real work which requires to be done in connexion with the Federal Capital. </para>

          <para>. - In connexion with all big undertakings, it is necessary, before a large expenditure can be embarked upon, to carry out numerous works of a minor character. It would be folly to attempt to carry out the larger works until the preliminary undertakings have been completed.

A suitable clay for brick-making purposes has been found and tested with excellent results at a site close to the City, and it is hoped that bricks will be made and delivered on the site for about 25s.

        <para>It is obvious that, whilst we may make the bricks at the Capital, a large quantity of material will have to be brought there.

        <para>The roads throughout the Territory are now in fair condition, but it is necessary that a certain amount shall be expended to maintain them in that state. Tt is also proposed to proceed with the deviation of the road to the Cotter River from the Capital Site on an easy gradient to be formed and made for heavy traffic. Additional roads will be opened up where necessary, with a view to providing the best means of intercommunication possible between all parts of the Territory. </para>
        <para>A further stock of Australian timbers to the extent of some &#163;5,000 will be specially selected for joinery purposes at the City. These timbers will be stored and seasoned on the City site for use as required. </para>
        <para class="block">As a joiner myself, I say that that is a very necessary expenditure. and should be undertaken, at an early stage, because, whilst we have plenty of local timbers which are equal to any timbers in the world for joinery purposes, our difficulty is to get seasoned timber. Last year we purchased some timber for this purpose, and the amount on these Estimates is intended to add to our present stock - </para>
        <para>A nursery for afforestation purposes has been prepared at &#34;Acton,&#34; where trees, plants, and shrubs will be propagated for use where necessary.

        <para>The surveys of the boundaries of the Territory, the triangulation, classification surveys, surveys of holdings, &#38;c, will be pushed on with all expedition. At the same time the survey for the location of a railway line from Jervis Bay to the Capital is in progress, and will be continued to completion. So far this survey has disclosed no serious engineering difficulties. </para>
        <para class="block">That is an outline of the work that is to be commenced under this vote. I say that to spend money on other works before these are put in hand would be merely waste. The proper course is the one that we are taking Whether it should have been commenced earlier or not is another question. The proper way, I maintain, is to carry out the work in such a manner as to make the subsequent work as economical as possible. The designs for the Capital have now been accepted, and a committee is at work to decide as to how much of those  designs can be put into effect. By the time the plans are prepared for the Government buildings, the railway, the power plant, and the lighting works will be well in hand, and all things will be ready to proceed further. It will then be for Parliament to push forward with any speed that it desires with the-actual building of the Capital. But it is obvious that this preliminary essential work will take some time. The power plant itself has had to be ordered from England, owing to the fact that no electrical plant of that capacity could be made within the Commonwealth at a reasonable cost. It will take some time for the plant to be supplied. To suggest that we should proceed with building without the power plant, the railway, and the water supply, is not to recommend an economical course of procedure, but one which would entail a waste of money. The document I have read shows that the Government are proceeding expeditiously on economical and sound lines. </para>

            <para>- I do not care about that. Reading the report in conjunction with these Estimates, and with the Minister&#39;s comments, I should say that it proves exactly the opposite from what has been represented. Take one of the last items read out. A sum of  ,&#163;25,000  is put down for the building of a railway from Queanbeyan to the Capital. The Minister was asked by way of interjection if that sum was to come out of the  &#163;110.000  included in this Bill. He replied that so much of it as&#62; will be necessary in carrying out the preliminary work will come out of the sum to be voted. I say that if the Government were in earnest the whole sum necessary for the construction of the railway would be spent this&#39; year. A Government which cannot build 6 miles of railway in twelve months cannot be said to be in earnest. </para>

            <para>- Then there is-  &#163;25,000,  or thereabouts, for a power plant ; there is the dam on the Cotter River, the pipe line, the pipe-head reservoir, and the reticulation scheme. According to the details read out by the Minister, the  .&#163;110,000  is not nearly sufficient to cover expenditure on these various works. The Minister recognised that fact, because he was careful to say that the sum covers as much of the cost as can be undertaken this year. I say again that if the Government were really in earnest in the matter, the whole of the works now contemplated1 could have been completed at the &#34;present moment. </para>

            <para>- I have never declined to vote money after the site for the Capital was chosen. I admit that I put up a good fight before the selection was made, because I did not believe that Yass-Canberra was the best site. I am of the same opinion now. But Parliament selected this site, and I am prepared now to spend all that is necessary to complete the work. To show that the Government are not in earnest, let honorable senators remember that every Commonwealth industrial project that we enter into is always started somewhere else than in our own Federal Territory. We have established a Small Arms Factory at Lithgow, and a Cordite Factory in Melbourne. I venture to say that if the Minister of Defence will call for an unbiased opinion from his military advisers, they will tell him that from a strategical point of view, the very worst thing that could happen is to have the Cordite Factory in Melbourne. </para>

            <para>- But we always contemplated having a Federal Capital. This Government is no more guilty than any other in the matter I have mentioned, except that it has more opportunities for commencing Commonwealth activities. But this Government, like its predecessor, appears to be disposed to establish these activities anywhere but in the Federal Capital. No doubt they will say that the place is not suitable. But they forced the site upon a reluctant Parliament, and carried the selection against a majority of their own party in the Senate. Yass-Canberra was then represented to be everything that was desirable. It was one of the most beautiful places on earth. Ministers were almost prepared to disrupt their own party rather than accept a vote against this most desirable site. But now it is not a fit place to start anything in ! If the Government were in earnest in this work, they would have recognised that the first essential for a city is a water supply. Two years ago, all the plans were made out for a water supply for the Federal City. Everything was ready for the making of a dam &#39;on the Colter river, the pipe lines were marked down, the site for the pipe head reservoir was mapped out. Yet nothing has been done. The Government might have completed those works before to-day. I have seen a water supply for a city of 25.000 people, involving quite as much work as this will do, carried out in six months. Yet the Government reluctantly come along, and tell us, through the mouth of the Minister of Defence, that only a small amount can be spent this year towards carrying out all these projects. There ought to be no doubt about them. The railway ought to be built. The water supply ought to be completed before the end&#39; of the present financial year, and the Government to be in a position by that time to carry out the necessary work on the Capital itself. We have been given, as a reason why the Commonwealth Clothing Factory, the Woollen Factory, the Harness Factory, and the various other industrial activities could not be started in Yass-Canberra that there were no people there to do the work. There will never be people there until there is profitable employment for (hem ; and as soon as there is profitable work people will flock there wholesale. <inline font-style="italic">Soon</inline> there will be more hands than employment can be found for. But. we shall never get this place occupied, and establish a town - we shall never have anything hut a wilderness - unless we provide profitable occupation for the people. Let us establish industries there, and we shall have more hands than we need. But the Government want to placate Geelong on the one hand, and Lithgow on the other, and some other constituency in connexion wilh some other work, and consequently these various Commonwealth activities are scattered all over the country, to the neglect of our own Territory, which the Government themselves forced upon a reluctant Parliament. If Yass-Canberra be so desirable a situation, why do they no.w tell us that it is of no use at all ? So long as they pursue a policy of trying to placate various sections in this way, so long will Yass-Canberra remain a wilderness. I have no axe to grind in this matter. I was, as every one knows, strenuously opposed to the choice of Yass-Canberra. I did my level best to prevent its selection, because I believed then, and I am convinced now, that it was not the best possible site. But this Parliament, having made the selection, something more should be done than has been done up to date. We should be in earnest about it. If we are not in earnest, we should not bother about the matter at all, but if we are, we should take steps to establish the Capital there at the earliest possible moment. At present, we are housed in the most inconvenient fashion in Melbourne. The State Government, it is true, has done everything possible to make things comfortable for the Federal Parliament. I say so much gladly, and give them every credit for it. They have given us the use of this magnificent building free of rent, and have placed many other facilities at our disposal. But if a member of this Parliament has occasion to visit the Commonwealth offices, he has to search round Melbourne to find some of them. They are here, there, and everywhere, in all sorts of odd corners. We are paying enormous rents, and suffering great inconvenience. In our own Territory, however, we have land at prairie value - obtained for a mere song. If we establish our Commonwealth activities there, we shall soon create a large population. The first result would be that this land which we have acquired would be enormously increased in value, and the people of Australia would make an enormous profit out of it. But it appears that some member of Parliament, or some constituency, some State, has to be placated, and the people of Australia do not matter. But I am here to see that the people of Australia get a fair deal in this matter. Another point which I want honorable senators to consider is this : We have been told that it would not pay to establish factories at Yass-Canberra, because the facilities are not there. But have all the disadvantages been taken into consideration? Has the enhancement of the value of bur. land been taken into consideration ? 1 Has the amount per head that we have to I pay . to the various States been considered ? </para>

            <para>- It is not so bad in Queensland, and no thanks to the successive Governments, but because the capital of the State is situated in a corner, and the long coastline of Queensland does not conduce to centralization. In New South Wales, the population of Sydney is nearly a third of the whole population of the State, notwithstanding the existence there of such large cities as Broken Hill and Newcastle. That is not a system which is beneficial to Australia. When we have the opportunity to establish a new city in a considerable area of country which is now a wilderness we should avail ourselves of every possible means, not to add to the population of already congested cities, but to form an industrial centre in our own territory. </para>

            <para>- No. I desire, instead of adding to the number of people in Melbourne, to place them in an area of country that is now a wilderness, where we have obtained the land at a prairie value, instead of having to pay from <inline font-style="italic">&#163;10</inline> to  &#163;15  a foot frontage for it, as residents of Melbourne are obliged to do. All the facts go to show that the Government are not in earnest in this matter. The fact that nothing has been done after two years towards providing water supply, or towards the building of a little railway of 6 or 7 miles in length, is proof positive of that. The Minister of Defence has carefully explained that these votes are intended only to be towards the cost of carrying out the works mentioned during the current year. The Government may not spend half of this sum this year, and it is clear that they do not mean business. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> that we should either let the whole thing slide or go about the work seriously. If the Government, tackled the problem seriously there is no reason why, inside of five years, we should not have the Federal Parliament and officers of the central Federal Departments comfortably housed in the Federal Capital. </para>

          <para>. - I spoke in a somewhat similar strain on this matter yesterday, and while not wishing to go over the ground traversed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> I may say that, although a representative of New South Wales, I cannot be charged with parochialism in this matter. I had to bear a good deal of abuse, and some criticism, from my own colleagues for being the only representative of New South Wales in the Senate who voted against the selection of Yass-Canberra as the site for the Federal Capital. In? similar circumstances I would do the same again, although I was threatened that I should be burnt in effigy if my vote caused the selection of the present site to be rejected. Whilst voting against the selection of this site I stated that once the matter was finally settled I should be no party to further obstruction, and would vote for any sum in reason that might be asked for to make a practical beginning with the establishment of the Capital. The statements made by Senators Millen and Givens are obvious. It is clear that very slow progress indeed is intended if  &#163;110,000  is to cover the whole of the expenditure during the current financial year on the various works referred to. </para>

            <para>- The leisurely way in which things are going on justifies the criticism. I read some time ago that, in India, a railway for military purposes Was constructed at the rate of a mite per day, because there was some urgency for it. The only imaginable reason why we could not construct 7 miles of railway in twelve months would be that it was impossible to obtain the steel rails required. If it is possible to obtain the necessary rails there can be no difficulty in constructing 7 miles of railway in a few months. If this is to be the rate at which railway construction by the Commonwealth Government is to be carried on the Lord only knows how long we shall be in constructing the transcontinental railway. With reference to the provision for a water supply I may say that the moment the selection of this site was decided upon it was known that a water supply would be required. From the memorandum read by the Minister it appears that a 90-ft. dam is to be constructed to provide a sufficient supply of water for twelve months. I should be sorry to think that that is the way in which the work is to be carried out. A water supply, sufficient for the needs of the city, which may be expected to grow up on the Federal Capital site within the next few years, should be provided for at once. What apparently is to be provided for would be sufficient for only a handful of people. </para>

            <para>- Then I must have misunderstood the statement read by the Minister. I should still like to point out that if such a work is really to be hurried on it will absorb very much more of this vote of ,&#163;110,000 than will be available if the railway and the other works referred to are to be gone on with. The whole of this vote of .&#163;110,000 will be more than absorbed by three or four of these items, and, consequently, there can only be a very small expenditure intended upon each during the current financial year. The Minister&#39;s argument, that we must first complete certain preliminary works, is sound, but there is still undue delay in the completion of that preliminary work, and an insufficient expenditure is being provided for. </para>

            <para>- Of course we could. We might spend <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1,000</inline> on one work, and &#163;&#91;1,000 on another, and the trees which have been planted might be forest trees before we have begun with the serious construction of the Capital. . Perhaps some of our Victorian friends feel at home in this building, but there are many good reasons why honorable senators from other States should be housed in their own home free from the domination of the city newspapers of either Sydney or Melbourne, especially when by residing in the Federal Capital we should be enhancing the value of the land for which the Commonwealth has to pay, and which must remain idle until it is utilized. If there were art earnest intention to get on with the preliminary work, so as to enable us to lay the foundations of the permanent work of the Capital, there would be a larger amount of money provided for upon these Estimates for expenditure during the current financial year. T can imagine that the capacity of employing hands and in spending money might, in* certain circumstances, be limited. It might not be possible to have more than a certain, number of men employed in the construction of a dam, but when we have so many works which might be carried out at the same time, there is ample scope for the expenditure during the year of a very much larger vote than that which appears in the schedule to this Bill. If there is to be something like reasonable celerity in giving effect, not merely to the letter, but to the spirit of the Constitution in this matter, a very much larger sum than is set down here should be provided for in these EstimatesSenator SAYERS (Queensland) &#91;4.5&#93;.-- I thoroughly indorse what has been said by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens.</inline> I know of a local authority representing a population of only 25,000 people that erected a concrete dam, 24 feet at the base and about 130 yards long, inside of four months. Here we have the Commonwealth Government, after two years, submitting a vote on account for a dam, and the money we are voting might not be expended within the next twelve months. Each of these works may be carried out separately. I have been to Queanbeyan, and I am sure that the Government could get an estimate from the Works Department or from people outside on which they could call for tenders for the railway to the Federal Capital, and have it constructed inside of nine months. We are told by the Minister that this wort will be done if it can be done. The statement is laughable. The Department have all the money they need in hand, but they prefer to dawdle along. Two years ago we hear&#39;d a lot about the water supply which was to be provided for the Federal Capital.. I travelled from Sydney with  Colonel Owen,  the Director-General of Works, and I understood from the conversation I had with him that the water supply would be all fixed up within six months. Now we are told that the Government are going to begin the work. Do they mean to establish the Federal Capital, or do they not? To say that no more than about &#163;100,000 can be spent in the Federal Territory to provide for a water supply, a railway, and the other works mentioned within twelve months is to make us a laughing-stock for people outside. We might spend twice that sum to advantage. We have purchased the land, and the money with which we purchased it is lying idle, without interest, whilst we are paying large sums for the rents of Federal offices in Melbourne. </para>

            <para>- I say that we are carrying on the Federal Territory at a loss every year. Judging by these Estimates the Government do not intend to proceed with the construction of the Federal Capital in a business-like manner. I do not think that any member of this Parliament, with the exception perhaps of some Victorian members, objected to the amount which was placed on the Estimates last year for expenditure on the Capital, but we find that even that amount was not expended, and a portion of it is put down to be re-voted this year. If I represented the State of New South Wales I should want to know whether the Government intend to deal with this business in a workmanlike manner or not. I noticed the other day that the Victorian State Government are considering whether they should not ask us to pay interest on the cost of this building. I would not blame them if. they charged us <inline font-style="italic">si</inline> Per cent., because we are not taking proper steps to erect our own parliamentary building. </para>

            <para>- Yes, and justly so, too. If the Commonwealth had to pay rent for a residence there, !&#39; do not &#39;see why they should not do so here. In my opinion, they should have come down with an energetic programme of public works for the Federal Capital. At the rate at which we have proceeded during the last three years, fifty years will elapse before we are settled there ; and none of us will be alive then. Apparently the Government will not carry out these works, and very likely their successors may say, &#34; We will shift the Capital to another site,&#34; and all the expenditure there will have been wasted. </para>

          <para>.- Although I did not agree with the selection of Yass-Canberra, I think&#39; it is necessary for us to proceed in this matter in an up-to-date and business-like manner. I am not complaining of the Government at all, because I recognise that  &#163;110,000  will go a long way towards initiating the various works which are essential for a Capital such as we desire to establish. In refuting statements which have been made by some honorable senators, I wish to put on record a few figures showing that, from the standpoint of finance, the Federal Capital, established, as I think, in not the best site, will not be the white elephant which some of its opponents would lead the country to believe. According to an official statement I have received from the Minister of Home Affairs, the expenditure up to date on the Federal Capital has been a little over  &#163;99,000,  which, of course, covers the cost of surveys, &#38;c. The amount paid by the Commonwealth Government for the rental of buildings in Melbourne for public offices which will eventually be transferred to the Federal Capital, is a little over  &#163;9.000  per annum. The amount of rental received from properties acquired by the Commonwealth in the Federal Territory, and now leased, is  &#163;4,800  per annum. Yet <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers</inline> says that we are getting no return, no interest on the expenditure which we have incurred. </para>

            <para>- No. If we are paying in Melbourne a total rental of  &#163;9,000  a year for buildings which will eventually he transferred to the Federal Capital, that, capitalized at  5  per cent., would mean  &#163;180.000;  whereas, according to (his return, we have only spent in the. Federal Capital Territory  &#163;99,000.  The rental of  &#163;4,800  from the leased lands, capitalized at  5  per cent.,  would mean1 &#163;96.000. Yass-Canberra is, I repeat, not  the  best site that could have been chosen ; but I am prepared to loyally abide by the decision of both Houses. It is necessary that this amount should be appropriated for works and buildings. We cannot dilly-dally with the building of the Federal Capital. Either  we  must make the best job  we  can of an unsuitable site, or we must do nothing. The Government are to be commended upon grasping the nettle firmly with the hand and going on with the construction of the works which are essential. I am glad to have had this opportunity of placing on record these few facts to show that all the money which has been spent there has not been placed in one great sink, but that some of it has remained on the surface and  we  are getting some return. </para>

            <para>- Out of respect to you, sir, I will desist. Even although this or any other Government have not erected a weir at the Cotter River at a height of  82  feet, it does not follow that they are not carrying out their duty of providing a supply of water to the few inhabitants in the Federal Territory. It is of no use to go on with all these works and expend money until there is a population there to receive the benefit, whether it be of water supply, electricity, gas. sanitation, or sewer age. There is no analogy between the cases of the country towns which have been cited and the case of the Federal Capital. I am pleased to know that the Government are proceeding in a straightforward way to expend upon the Federal Capital the money which is voted by Parliament. I trust that the work of building that city will be carried out in the best interests of Australia. </para>

          <para>The requirements will prove to be extensive; in fact, although Commander Brewis has only dealt with the Northern Territory, Queensland, Victoria (south-east coast), and Tasmania, he considers an expenditure of . &#163;382,000 will be necessary to bring these coasts into an efficient state. </para>
          <para>It is, of course, impossible to spend that amount in any one year, and, in addition, certain requirements are more urgent than others. </para>
          <para>In regard to the extensive requirements it may be mentioned that in all States the total is larger than it ordinarily would be, owing to the fact that the States have not kept pace with the requirements during the last ten years, because of the probable transfer of the lighthouse service to the Commonwealth. </para>
          <para>The proposed cost of construction when spread over a period of six years is moderate when it is considered that in Great Britain - where coastal lighting has been steadily proceeding since the year 1685- -the expenditure on new construction and improvement of existing lights for the six years ended 1905 has reached , &#163;95,853 per annum. </para>

I intend at <inline font-style="italic">a.</inline> later stage to explain how it is proposed to spend this money, and why we are not in a position to furnish particulars as to sites.

        <para class="block">Liverpool. Is that what we know in Sydney as the military encampment area? If so, a question is involved as to the expenditure of money upon it. My recollection is that the area belongs partly to the State and partly to private owners, and is used by the military for encampment and manoeuvre purposes. Negotiations were in progress some time ago to enable the Commonwealth to procure proprietary rights. It is desirable, before any money is spent, that some definite arrangement should be made to enable the Commonwealth to become either the proprietor of the land, or to have an agreement that will give security for the money we spend upon it. Item 21 is one of  &#163;&#91;10,000  for the site for remount depot for artillery horses at Liverpool. ls that site within the Liverpool encampment area ? It is undesirable to spend a considerable sum of money on an area over which we have no control. At the time I last inquired, it was not at all certain that we should remain there. </para>

            <para>- As far as I am aware it is. The sum includes, in addition, the final payment for a subsidiary engine. With that exception, the money is to pay off liabilities previously incurred. The. expenditure of  ,&#163;1,000  on improvements and water supply at the military site, Liverpool, is necessary, whether we purchase the area or not. The area has been used for many years as a military training ground, and will continue to be used, whether the Commonwealth acquires possession of it or not. </para>

            <para>- Yes, wherever we can. With regard to the resumption of the Liverpool area, negotiations have been proceeding for a considerable time. Part of the land is owned by the State. Some of it is privately owned. The State Government made the proposal that it should resume the privately-owned land, and lease the whole area to the Federal Government. That has been the basis of negotiations. I understand that finality has not yet been reached. </para>

            <para>- I admit that they have been pending a long while, but not for lack of pushing on the part of the Federal Government. I understand that the prospect of coming to an agreement is now more hopeful. One of the factors that was retarding the settlement was the question of the payment of 3 per cent, on transferred properties. That difficulty has now been adjusted, and we are hopeful that we may come to an arrangement. The remount depot, on which we are spending &#163;10,000, is also at Liverpool. The depot is situated on what is known as Cunningham&#39;s Farm. We not only have the farm itself, but a large area of land which is used for training horses. </para>

            <para>- No, they are officials of the Department. Whether the whole of the Liverpool area is acquired or not, it is considered desirable that this remount dep6t should be owned by the Commonwealth. We now have horse depots in all the States. The horses for the artillery are given a certain amount of training during the week, and are also used to some extent for cultivation. At our depot at Maribyrnong, for instance, we have land on the river flats, under lucerne cultivation. In that way we keep down the expense of maintaining the horses. The men in charge of them take them in to the batteries when they are required, and take them back again when the training is over. </para>

            <para>- If we had, the cry would probably be that the balance-sheets would give us only the word of the managers of the factories, and that the Auditor-General should have been asked to certify them. They will be audited long before the session closes, and honorable senators will have an opportunity to bring the Government to book&#39; if they show that the factories have not been a success. I can only say that, from the figures supplied to me, both the Harness Factory and the Clothing Factory appear to be making their goods at less than contract prices, and are also turning out good articles. With regard to the honorable senator&#39;s second question, it is true that the Post and Telegraph Department formerly did a lot of this work. We are hoping that the Commonwealth Harness Factory will be able to do it in future, and that is why we are asking, on these Estimates, for a vote to extend the factory. None of the men who have been doing the work of the Post Office will be displaced as a result. . </para>

I wish to know whether the Government are prepared to take Parliament into their confidence as to the truth about the wonderful explosion that took place some time ago in the fort at Thursday Island. It may be said that on high political grounds it is unadvisable to reply to this question, but I want to know how the explosion came about. It was believed that certain members of the Defence Force stationed at the time at Thursday Island deliberately tried to blow up the fortifications. I ask the Government whether they are prepared to state their view of the matter, or whether, on the ground of high policy, they think it better not to answer the question. </para>

          <para>. - At page 12 of the schedule, there is a vote of &#163;100 set down for &#34; Fortifications,&#34; under the expenditure for Queensland. At page 13, there is another vote of &#163;200 for new works under the same heading, and at page 15 there is a vote for &#163;250 for the Thursday Island magazine, Green Hill fort. I do not think that Parliament will grudge any necessary expenditure for fortifications. Looking through the reports of defence officers, I find that the matter has occupied the serious attention of the Inspector-General of the Forces in connexion with the training of officers and men for the permanent garrisons of our forts. The votes to which I have referred seem to be small, but if they represent part of a well considered scheme of fortifications, I should not be prepared to raise any objection. From a superficial knowledge of the subject, I am inclined to believe that perhaps the most important position for an Australian fortification is Thursday Island, and probably the next in importance is Townsville. Townsville is one of the richest ports in Australia, and that it requires consideration ii&#187; the matter of fortification is mentioned in Lord Kitchener&#39;s report, as well as in other military reports. I should like to know whether the Minister of Defence is satisfied with the work being done at these two places in this connexion. </para>

          <para>. - These are always difficult questions for me to deal with in the open. There are some statements which I cannot make, but which  1  shall be quite prepared to give honorable senators privately. The item of &#163;100, referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger, has little or no significance; it simply provides for an addition to the fort.&#34;- at Lytton. Regarding the item of &#163;200 for fortifications, on page 13, that &#39;is for a new work, and it also is of very little significance, but item 12, which the honorable senator overlooked, and which deals more particularly with what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> raised - an item of &#163;1,500 - is a very important one, because it is towards a total cost of &#163;35,000, and does involve the question of Thursday Island. The Inspector-General has just returned from a visit to Thursday Island, where he was sent to investigate this question, and the Council of Defence is to again discuss it. As to what the intentions are I cannot say, but in regard to the point about Townsville I can only say that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> is quite mistaken if he thinks that Lord Kitchener recommended the retention of the fortification at Townsville. There is no such recommendation either by Lord Kitchener or by Admiral Henderson, and there is no item on these Estimates for an increase of the fortifications there. </para>

            <para>- In any case, there is no recommendation by the naval or military advisers of the Commonwealth, past or present, for the extension or the retention of Townsville as a fortified port. As regards Thursday Island, I can only say that the Government do regard, not Thursday Island itself, but that locality, as a very important point, and we hope to be able during the present year to take action which will make that fort, at any rate, more effective than it is at present. It will probably involve a radical departure from what has been done, but more than that I am not in a position to say at the present time. </para>

When I was up north last year  1  was informed that a large number of young men had applied for a rifle range, and, I believe, done most of the work. For some reason or other the application has been hung up for twelve or eighteen months, although a sum of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1,200</inline> was unexpended last year. The place I may mention is Yungaburra. The young men could get nothing done; they could not even get a range proclaimed.

          <para>. - I am almost disheartened at the position regarding rifle ranges. It is almost an impossible position. A rifle club is formed and a range is selected. The range is sometimes on private land, but, generally, the club tries to get Crown land for the purpose. When the club applies to the Defence Department to be gazetted, an officer is sent up to see whether the site is, or is not, suitable. On his return he makes his report, and if he says that the site is suitable the Department tries to obtain the land. If it is private land we have to ask the Home Affairs Department to resume the site, but if it is Government land we have to ask that Department to approach the State Government. We have to wait till the State Government grant us a permissive occupancy before we can do anything at all. After that permission has been granted the Home Affairs Department proceeds tq get out the plans, and construct a range, or the Defence Department may take the initiatory action. </para>

            <para>- I hope so; though I should like to see more evidence of it. Seeing that with the modern rifle a lot of land is needed to cover the danger zone, it would be impossible to provide the requisite number of rifle ranges by means of acquisition, because the cost would he prohibitive, lt has been suggested that the Defence Department might take on the work of constructing rifle ranges without the intervention of another Department. That is a matter on which I am conferring with the Minister of Home Affairs. It would, at any rate, confine the work to two Departments, instead of three. At present it is not always easy to say which Department is the one to blame for any delay. I am convinced that some different system will have to be evolved before we can prevent the delays which now occur. The present system is intolerable, and undoubtedly does a great deal to discourage riflemen throughout the Commonwealth. </para>

I understood that an officer of the Defence Department had been there, and that the rifle range for which the club had applied was cleared by the men. It is a scattered district, and although thirty or forty young men are prepared to put their hands in their pockets and help the Government, up to the present time they have not been able to get a satisfactory statement from the Department. The Minister has pointed out the difficulties with which he has to contend, but I think that if this matter were tackled in the right spirit something would eventuate. We want people to prepare themselves to defend the country. These long delays thoroughly disgust the men, and cause some of them to throw up the whole thing. That is not a good spirit to create in the country. I shall bring this matter under the Minister&#39;s notice later, and I hope that he will be able to do something before all these men get disgusted with the way in which they are treated. </para><interjection>

These Estimates include several items dealing with the supply of horses in the various States. On page 8 we find an item of &#163;3,500 for stabling and other buildings for military horses in New South Wales; on page 15, an item of &#163;3,000 for stabling and other buildings for military horses in Queensland; on page 16, an item of &#163;24,000 towards the cost of barracks, quarters, gun-parks, pharmacy, stores, stabling, and other buildings for military horses in South Aus&#39;tralia ; and on page 20, an item of &#163;5,000 for the acquisition of land for agistment of military horses in Tasmania. All these are new votes. Roughly speaking, the sum of &#163;35,000 is provided on these Estimates for the stabling of military horses. I am inclined to think that it is wise for the Government to take steps to breed &#34; gunners &#34; and horses of a lighter type, for military purposes. But I fear we are being misled to some extent when we are invited to authorize an expenditure of &#163;35,000 merely for the stabling of military horses. </para><interjection>

            <para>- In following the course which I am pursuing I am merely anxious to conserve the time of the Committee. The sum of &#163;35,500 appears upon these Estimates for the stabling of military horses, and it impresses me as being rather an excessive amount, unless the Government intend to undertake, not merely- the stabling, but the breeding of horses to a greater extent than they have indicated. One cannot overlook the fact that the American Government have recently made large purchases of horses in Australia for &#34; gunners,&#34; and that they are breeding these animals on the highlands of the Philippines. I obtained my information from the men who purchased them and from American officials, who assure me that first rate &#34;gunners&#34; can be bred on the highlands of the Philippines. We might, perhaps, follow the example of the Americans by breeding horses on the Barklay Tableland, and the Creswell Downs. There we could breed horses which would make good &#34; gunners,&#34; or a lighter type which would be suitable for cavalry purposes. </para>

            <para>- If they did that they would be doing better than they are by spending &#163;35,000 merely for the stabling of military horses. I note that it is proposed to establish stables in New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, and Tasmania. Why is it not intended to provide them in South Australia and Western Australia ? The Government have given ns no indication of how they intend to fill these stables. I would remind the Minister of Defence that, no matter what breeds of horses may be crossed, not more than 20 per cent, of the foals will come up to the requirements demanded of them. I know that the Minister of Defence favours the establishment of horse-breeding dep&#244;ts If we are going to expend &#163;35,000 upon the stabling of military horses, do the Government intend to develop regular horse-breeding stations? </para>

            <para>- In addition to stables, we have to provide a depot where the horses may run during the week. In Victoria we have purchased land at Maribyrnong near the Cordite Factory, for this purpose. There we are putting the horses of the Field Artillery and of the Army Remount Section. The men of the latter force will look after the horses during the week, and on Saturday will bring them into South Melbourne, where we are erecting stables for their accommodation. The Militia and compulsory trainees will go to the stables on Saturday, find their horses ready for them, take them out for parade purposes, and afterwards return them. That is the scheme which is at present being carried out in Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland, and Tasmania. It is proposed to follow the same plan in South Australia and Western Australia. In Tasmania we have the horses, but we have not yet got the land, although negotiations with that end in view are in progress. </para>

            <para>- If we are going to spend the sum of  &#163;&#91;35.000  upon the stabling of horses, the Minister should tell us what the Government intend to do with those stables. The item appearing on these Estimates in respect of Tasmania relates only to the &#34; acquisition of land for agistment of military horses.&#34; In the colder parts of Australia, the horses are to run free. If the Minister thinks that the Department is doing the right thing, he will have to answer for it if arrangements go wrong. Meanwhile, I am perfectly justified in drawing attention to the fact that  &#163;&#91;35,000  is being spent either on the stabling or the agistment of horses, whilst the Minister has only given us the vague statement that it is a good thing for the Department to own its own horses instead of hiring them. I do not deny that. Probably it is the best thing for the Department to own its horses.  I believe that we have  5,000  or  6,000  military horses. On these figures it will cost us about  &#163;&#91;7  per head a year, merely for stabling and feeding them on grass. I do not think that the Government have yet taken Parliament into their confidence. They have not told us what is at the back of their skulls when they put forward proposals of this kind. </para>

For instance, I notice  &#163;1,700  for a rifle range at Toowoomba. That amount was on the Estimates last year, and is now being revoted. There is also a sum of  &#163;&#91;5,000  for a manoeuvre area at Beerburrum. That also was voted last year, and has not been spent. Of  &#163;&#91;3,164  for a rifle range at Brisbane,  &#163;&#91;1,164  is a re-vote,  &#163;&#91;2,000  more being required. The same sort of thing applies to the Bundaberg rifle range. At Ennogera,  &#163;4,000  is to be spent on railway and tramway construction in connexion with the rifle range. Is it the intention of the Government to proceed with these works ? Surely they ought to be able to spend the money voted for such purposes within a year. </para>

            <para>- The Ennogera rifle range is the principal rifle range for the metropolitan area, Brisbane. The amount set down is  &#163;4,000.  We shall not be able to spend that money at all in the sense of doing the work ourselves. The reason is that at the present time the Ennogera range is at some distance from the means of communication. The riflemen have urged the Commonwealth Government to make arrangements to enable them to reach the range more conveniently. A railway is being constructed bv the State Government in that direction, and we have undertaken to pay this sum to the State Government on condition that they make a deviation with their railway to give connexion with the rifle range. We cannot hasten the work. We have to wait until the State is ready to do it. It would be folly for the Commonwealth to build this little bit of a railway. The State will make the line, and we will pay for the deviation. </para>

          <para>. - 1  notice an item,  &#163;1,250,  for rifle ranges, Western Australia, of which sum  &#163;1,000  is a re-vote. I believe that on account of difficulties some rifle clubs have been unable to get the grant to which they were entitled during this year. I will mention an instance. The Black Range club made application on nth October for a grant for an addition to their range. The object was to make the range safe. In March, I, myself, wrote to the Minister, and received the usual reply that the matter would be considered. Some time during the present month 1 received a notification that the rifle club at Black Range were entitled to the giant, and would receive it. If there is one section of the Defence Force to which we should pay special attention, it is the rifle clubs. Their members devote a good deal of time and labour to their work. The Black Range members have spent their own money on making their range safe for passers by. I am given to understand that the difficulty arises from the fact that the Government have only, one inspector for Western Australia is that officer&#39;s duty to visit every rifle range after a request is made for a grant. If that be a fact. I hope the Minister will consider the advisableness of recommending the appointment of additional inspectors, so that when an application is submitted to the Department the officer may be sent along, and the matter attended to immediately. </para>

          <para>. - The difficulty in the case referred to is that which has been suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Buzacott</inline> himself. That is to say, we -have  &#39;a  limited number of inspectors who can be sent to rifle ranges. At present one inspector has to do the whole of the work for South Australia and Western Australia. That is a pretty big order. It means that the inspector can pay only rake visits to each State. That was the cause of the delay affecting the Black Range club. This year I am asking for a larger vote in order that an additional number of range inspectors may be appointed. We hope by that means that we shall be able to facilitate the work. Undoubtedly the staff is too limited at present, and that leads to delay. </para>

        <para class="block"> <inline font-weight="bold">Senator PEARCE</inline> (&#34;Western AustraliaMinister of. Defence)  T5-S3&#93;-  - A sum of  &#163;760  was spent last year on the barracks at Hobart; the work is proceeding. The barracks and buildings for the Army Service Corps are to be at Launceston. The reason for the re-vote in that case is that we did not obtain the land in sufficient time to spend the money last year. But the land has now been acquired, and the buildings are being erected. I promised to make a general statement with regard to drill &#39;halls, and will do so on the item  &#163;80,000  for &#34; Acquisition of sites for and erection of mobilization store buildings, and drill halls.&#34; In making provision for the training of Senior Cadets there were many things that we had to learn. We had had no previous experience. It is no doubt an easy thing to say that the Department ought to have foreseen this and that. Many things were not foreseen. One of them was that, with the initiation of compulsory training, and particularly of night drills, a greater number of drill halls would be required. In the winter time particularly discomfort was caused. The demand has become clamant, and there is undoubtedly a real grievance at the back of it. lt became necessary, therefore, to prepare for a much larger expenditure than usual on drill halls during the forthcoming year. At the same time, it is quite obvious that we cannot at once provide all the training areas with drill halls, since the minimum estimate of the cost involved is  -&#163;500,000.  It is clear that this expenditure must be distributed over a number of years. We therefore decided to ask the Home Affairs Department to prepare a design for a cheap type ot drill hall, that we might spread the money available over the greatest possible area. The Chief of Ordnance and the Adjutant-General on the Military Board have been instructed to collect data to enable us to decide where this money should first be expended. In view of the great area of Australia, and the vast distances to be covered in many training areas, such a report will necessarily take some time to compile. We have been getting the necessary information from Audit Officers and Brigade Majors, with reports from </para>
        <para class="block">District  Commandants. The officers referred to have been sifting these reports, and will in time submit recommendations as to the halls which should be erected. It is impossible, in the short time at our disposal for inquiry, to indicate where drill halls will be erected during the coming year. All I can say is that they will be erected first in the areas where the greater number of military units and cadets are stationed. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell,</inline> who has referred to the matter, did not quite understand the position of the Department in regard to the voluntary offers of assistance in providing drill halls or land for the purpose which have been made by municipal bodies and others. The attitude of the Department in the matter is this : We quite admit that it is the duty of the Government and the Defence Department to provide drill halls wherever possible, and, so far as money is available for the purpose, we are prepared to do so. At the same time, if any municipal council, or the people of any locality, are prepared to make available for this purpose accommodation in the shape of halls already in&#39; existence, or land on which halls may be erected, we should be churlish, as well as foolish, to refuse such offers of assistance. But we have laid it down that no offer of such co-operation will give any district any advantage over another. </para>

            <para>- I am glad to say that there have been a considerable number. I am also glad to be able to say that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> is not quite correct in his statement that the system will lead to wealthy districts getting drill halls first. It is a singular fact that, in the honorable senator&#39;s own State of Victoria, offers of assistance have come from some of the poorest districts. One of the districts that has taken this matter up in the most active fashion is the district of Footscray, and I think no one will say that Footscray is a wealthy suburb of Melbourne. Other suburbs have made similar offers of assistance, and I am hopeful that the movement will spread. </para>

            <para>- I am sorry to say that, so far, Toorak has lamentably failed to do anything in this matter. The Government welcome this co-operation, as it will enable them to provide a greater number of drill halls. In addition to drill halls, the vote provides for mobilization stores. &#39; These are a new departure&#39;. Owing to the widespread nature of the de1 fence system under the new organization, it has become necessary to decentralize, and to establish mobilization stores in districts where previously none have been required. These stores will be more costly structures than the drill halls, but, happily, will be very much fewer in number. It is difficult to outline the exact site for these stores, but, speaking generally, they will be established in centres of an important military district.  1  trust that, with this explanation, the Committee will agree to the vote, because the work is urgent. </para>

            <para>-  I am just going to give that information. I have here a plan of; a first class drill hall, which honorable senators may inspect.  If I can secure the co-operation of the Home Affairs Department, I propose that we shall have three types of drill halls. Number one, the type for which this plan has been prepared, may be erected at a cost, based upon Melbourne prices, of &#163;1,600, with a steel roof - with, a wooden roof the cost would probably be &#163;100 less - and &#163;350 additional is estimated for necessary fencing. This plan will provide for a hall of 150 feet by 50 feet, with a large number of offices and store-rooms. Number two type would be a hall of, say, 100 feet by 30 feet or 40 feet, with a smaller number of offices, and suitable for a district in which a smaller number of units are stationed. Then, in Queensland and Western Australia, I understand that completely enclosed drill halls will not be required. I believe that the practice in Queensland prior to Federation was to build drill halls open at one side, with offices attached to them. Such a building could be erected for very much less then a completely enclosed building with&#39; windows and -necessary provision for lighting. I believe that such a building will be&#39; found suitable practically throughout Queensland, the greater part of Western Australia, the northern parts of South Australia, and, probably, also in the western districts of New South Wales. It would be a much cheaper building than the other types referred to, whilst it would give all the facilities required. </para>

          <para>. - We should have some more information from the Minister as to the attitude crf the Defence Department in relation to matters concerning the Federal Territories of Papua, the Northern Territory, and the Federal Capital area. A new vote of &#163;80,000 is put down under the heading &#34;Various States and Federal Territory,&#34; towards the cost of the &#34; Acquisition of sites for, and erection of, mobilization store buildings &#34; - which is a wonderfully vague expression - &#34; and drill halls for the Defence Department.&#34; I wish the Minister of Defence to tell &#39;the Committee what portion of this vote of ,&#163;80,000* is to be allotted to Papua, to the Northern Territory, and, finally, to the various States. I think it is within reason that the Government -should tell us what they believe will be the ultimate cost of the additional magazines for the storage of ammunition for the Field Artillery. As regards the item of &#163;45,000 towards the cost of establishing a Military College for Australia, I think that we are justified in asking &#39;the Government to tell us what is likely to be the total cost of the building. Again, we find an item of &#163;50,000 towards the cost of Naval Colleges, Naval Barracks, and so on. Are the Government prepared to tell us what they believe the ultimate cost of these buildings will be, or do they want us <inline font-style="italic">tq</inline> sign, as it were, a promissory note for &#163;50,000, not knowing what the ultimate cost may be? Next, we find an item of &#163;8.000 towards the acquisition of a site, and the construction of a building for the famous Woollen Mills. The Government do not tell us that this building is not to be established, like the Military College, the Naval College, and the additional magazines, in the Federal Territory. It is up to them, too, to tell us why they propose to spend &#163;8,000 in Geelong, if they are prepared to carry out the decision of both Houses to establish a Capital as soon as possible. Why should we spend &#163;&#91;8,000 at Geelong instead of laying down Woollen Mills at Yass-Canberra ? I ask the Government to give us information on these points. </para>

          <para>. - I have already given a long explanation regarding the first item, which met the points raised, and I may mention that no portion of this &#163;80,000 is to be spent- in Papua, the Northern Territory, or the Federal Capital. As regards the sum of &#163;&#91;8,000 for additional magazines, the amount is towards a total cost of &#163;&#91;14,000. Regarding the other item, no estimate of the total cost of the Military College can well be given. I think that those who have read anything about the Military Colleges of the world can well understand that. Many of the present buildings are of a temporary character, and may last for twenty-five or thirty years. The idea is ultimately to erect permanent buildings. Any estimate of the total cost would be misleading, because we might not spend any of the money during the lifetime of honorable senators. At the present time we cannot give an estimate of the total cost of the Naval College. The first lot of buildings, although they will be of a permanent character, will not by any means complete the College, and the expenditure on them will be progressive for a number of years. As regards the establishment of Woollen Mills, the Department has not yet been able to complete an estimate of the total cost of the buildings, which will be of a very plain and inexpensive character, and probably of brick. </para>

          <para>. - Surely the Department has some idea of what the ultimate cost of any one of the items referred to is likely to be. One would think that before an estimate was brought down here, the Department would have furnished the &#39;Minister of Defence with some information as to whether the Naval College is likely to cost half-a-million or a million, or two millions. I do not suggest that it is proposed to complete the building during this or the next year, but surely the Government have some plan or scheme. Apparently, the Department do not wish to give an estimate of the probable cost until the building has been virtually completed. Any fool could find out then what the cost was likely to be. I think that if the officers are earning their salaries, they should be able to give the Minister the information which we desire. Surely there is a plan or a scheme to be carried out. </para>

            <para>- That would be harder still, but I do not wish to be too hard, because I know the Minister is in a bit of a fix. Surely he does not expect us to pass the item without being supplied with full information. Apparently he does not know what the Naval Barracks are going to cost. We want to know, and the country wants to know, what this scheme may cost. We are hungry for information, but we cannot get it. The least which the Minister can do is to say whether it is proposed to spend half-a-million pounds on the Naval College. We also want to know if the Government have any plan, or can give the country an idea of the expenditure to which this item of &#163;45,000 towards the cost of the Military College is likely to commit us. </para>

I desire to know whether there were any conditions surrounding that offer, because I think that if we are going to incur a large expenditure there, we should not consent to any conditions which would 6 be outside the general scheme of things in order to cadge &#163;40,000. In the huge expenditure which we contemplate tor military and naval purposes, a few thousand pounds are neither here nor there. </para>

            <para>- I would not kow-tow to them, or accept humiliating conditions such as the erection of a particular room, tower, tablet, or other &#34; flim-flam tomfoolery &#34; in order to perpetuate trie bogus patriotism of the crowd who tried to rush the country into a stupid bit of Jingoism. I am referring to the proposed Naval College, regarding which 1 understand negotiations were entered into Between the Government and the trustees of the <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> fund, and certain conditions were either stipulated or proposed to be stipulated. If the conditions will in any way prevent the Government from carrying out their proposals with a free hand, they ought to be spurned. I cannot see why we need a temporary Naval College at Geelong. If it is going to involve a great deal of expenditure, it necessarily follows that it will involve a good deal of time in order to equip the College. Therefore, the amount of time saved by the establishment of a temporary College will not be great enough to justify any departure from the original scheme of establishing the College in the Federal Territory. We know that once a thing is established in a place there is a tendency to find numberless excuses for keeping it there. </para>

I think that the best way for the Government to show their <inline font-style="italic">bona fides</inline> would be to proceed to build the Naval College in the Federal Territory straightaway, and not to bother about erecting a temporary affair. I object to any temporary schemes unless their urgency is made manifest. Even supposing that we get our Fleet Unit constructed, I do not see that the difference in time between the erection of a permanent building at Jervis Bay and the erection of a temporary building at Geelong is sufficient warrant for this extraordinary expenditure, much of which will be thrown away. </para>

            <para>- And upon certain alterations which will have to be made in the present buildings. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> asked what was the reason underlying the proposal to establish a temporary Naval College at Geelong. That reason has been supplied by the honorable senator himself. I have heard him protest against the importation of military officers into Australia. I have heard him denounce the Government for appointing imported officers to various positions. Now, we cannot pick up naval officers on the beach, and, in order to meet the view that we should have our own naval officers as soon as possible, we have decided to establish a temporary Naval College at Geelong. As this site was offered to us free of cost, we thought it would be worth our while to enter our cadets there, and thus gain a year in turning out our own naval officers. The idea underlying the proposal is a desire to have Australian naval officers available a year earlier than would otherwise have been possible. In the meantime, the College at Jervis Bay is to be pushed forward, and the Department of Home Affairs has promised to have the buildings there ready for the reception of the first batch of cadets in February,  1914.  As regards the <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> fund, the original proposal was to- hand over to the Commonwealth a sum of &#163;40,000 conditionally that the money was expended near Sydney. Since then the Government have announced that they will not accept the site proposed near to that city, and have decided to establish the Naval College at Jervis Bay. The trustees of the fund have finally determined to make the grant without that. condition. </para>

          <para>. - In regard to the proposed vote for the establishment of Woollen Mills at Geelong, I take this opportunity of drawing the Minister&#39;s attention to a telegram which appears in the press this evening, and which makes certain statements concerning the non-supply of clothing to the garrison artillery in Sydney. These mills, I take it, are intended to turn out the material with which to clothe our soldiers, and I propose to read the telegram in question, with a view to showing the way in which they are not clothed. Is it the intention of the . Government to keep these men without clothing until the factory is in operation? The paragraph reads - </para>

        <para>Following upon the recent Garrison Artillery trouble comes another in connexion with artillery. </para>
        <para>This time it is the permanent men who are grumbling. The following is a list of grievances voiced by the lower ratings :  - The regiment is in a ragged state, as no clothing has been issued for a year ; fifty men taken on in the last six months had to perform service in white canvas suits in the middle of winter, nothing else being available, and even that now cannot be obtained ; sergeants are drilling the men in military coats and civilian tweed trousers. </para>
        <para>I should like to hear from the Minister of Defence whether that paragraph is an effort on the part of the scribe or whether there is any justification for the statements which it contains. If there be a vestige of truth in them, it is not at all creditable to the Commonwealth. I should also like to know whether the factory has been started, and, if so, what is the extent of the operations which it is proposed to carry on. These are questions, I suppose, which may be asked, irrespective of the view which one may take of whether it is desirable to extend the list of Government functions. </para>

          <para>. - I am sorry to he obliged to admit that there is something in the complaint which has been made, and that is one of the reasons why the Government decided to establish our own clothing factory, and one of the reasons why we provide on these Estimates for its extension. Under the existing system of contract we have found it impossible to obtain anything like a regular supply of uniforms. This result is very largely due to the fact that our private factories are already fully employed, and do not. care whether they get the Defence contracts or not. They are simply indifferent. In connexion with almost every contract for which tenders are called we have to approach the tenderers and ask them if they will take up the balance of the orders? </para>

            <para>- I think that he is. We experience the greatest difficulty in getting our contracts carried out up to time. As a result we are unable to supply clothing in the way we should like. It has now <inline font-style="italic">been</inline> decided to make the uniforms for our Permanent Forces in our own factory, and to endeavour to obtain a more speedy and regular supply than we have secured in the past. We have also to consider the question of the supply of cloth, which has not been too satisfactory. Some contractors, and notably one in New South Wales, have come to our rescue splendidly, but still we have experienced very great difficulty in placing all our orders during the past eighteen months. All these difficulties have tended to delay the supply of uniforms to our troops. I regret this circumstance very much, but, as things are, we are practically helpless. I shall be only too pleased to see this Bill passed so that we may get our clothing factory extended, and proceed with the establishment of our woollen mills. </para>

            <para>- It is not. But, obviously, when contractors only consent, as a matter of grace, to take up the balance of our orders it is very difficult to enforce conditions. In our tenders we stipulate that a contract shall be completed within a certain time. . But when all the tenders have been received we find that the whole of our orders have not been taken up, and, consequently, we have to approach the contractors, and say to them, &#34; Will you take up the balance? &#34; Their reply usually is, &#34; We will, provided that you give us an extension of six months.&#34; The position is so intolerable that I regret we did not start our clothing factory earlier. The woollen mills have been planned by the manager, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smail,</inline> upon the known requirements of our Forces during the next ten years. It is intended to erect a mill which will be capable of supplying practically the whole of the cloth for the Commonwealth Forces. It is proposed to turn out cloth and cord, and also putties. </para>

            <para>- But the Government &#34;Laving decided that that Territory was good enough for all our requirements, why was that course necessary ? I have no sympathy with the two-penny-halfpenny parochial feeling which is rampant in Australia. We have, one member scheming against another member to get every possible concession and advantage for his district. We have districts rivalling each other in their cadging propensities. We have their representatives going round looking for this, that, and the other work to be established by the Federal Government in particular localities. We have State showing jealousy of State; and we have always the miserable squabble raised by the Melbourne newspapers that because such-and-such a thing has been done in Sydney the same sort of thing ought to be done in Melbourne. The rest of Australia does not seem to count at all. The only parts of the country that are treated as important are Sydney and Melbourne. The whole business is ridiculous. The consideration first and last, the consideration all the time, should be Australia. If Yass-Canberra is good enough to be selected as a site for the Capital of the Commonwealth, surely it ought to be good enough as a site for our various industrial activities ; and if it is not good enough for them, undoubtedly it is not good enough for the Federal Capital. &#34; </para>

            <para>- Whatever the opinions of other honorable senators may be, I have never held the view that either Sydney or Melbourne is a proper place for the Capital of the Commonwealth. I have always voiced the idea, rightly or wrongly, that it is a bad thing, to have the political Capital of the country identical with one of its chief commercial centres. For that reason I entirely approved of the provision in the Constitution that required the Capital of the Commonwealth to be somewhere outside any capital city of a State. When the expert, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smail,</inline> went round looking at various suggested sites for the Woollen Mills, he visited! Yass-Canberra. I should like to put on record a few things that he said on the subject - </para>

          <para>My first visit was to Yass-Canberra, the site of the Federal city, embracing from Queanbeyan to the junction of the Cotter Ri vCr with the Mumimbidgee, Duntroon, and Acton. Although the climatic conditions are not up to my idea of the requirements, it would be quite wrong to say that a woollen factory could not be established there, because, with the development of the city, it is certain to have factories of all descriptions, and, no doubt, conditions will then prevail whereby cloth manufacture could be fairly successfully accomplished. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">He said that by-and-by, as the Capital City is developed, industries may be established there. But how are you going to develop a city unless you have some industries in it? How are you going to have a considerable population there unless you have remunerative employment for the people to pursue? If we had begun by putting our Harness Factory, our Clothing Factory, our Cordite Factory, and our Small Arms Factory there, we should have had a fairly large population at Yass-Canberra al ready. </para>

It is the fault of the Government, which has had two years in which to do things, and has done practically nothing. We could have had an ample water supply there within two years. All the plans were laid out. Everything was ready -for carrying out drainage works. Everything was ready for the immediate initiation of an efficient water supply - provided sufficient water was obtainable there, and the Ministry assured us that it was when they asked us to accept the site. </para>

            <para>- I am not forgetting that part of the case. Would any man consent to enhance the value of the land of another fellow, whilst leaving his own a barren wilderness? We must remember that if this factory is going to be successful, a large number of hands will be employed. Those hands will have people depending upon them. The employment of them will call into being a number of shops, and exchange agencies of various kinds, to supply their wants. I venture to say that a really successful woollen mill will call into existence an extra population of some. to, 000 people. For those 10,000 people we shall have to pay  25s.  per head to the State in which they live. So that the establishment of this factory elsewhere than in the Federal Territory will simply have the effect of enhancing the value of the property of private individuals, whilst the Commonwealth will have the privilege of paying  25s.  per head, on account of the employes, to the State in which they reside. The whole position is ridiculous. Meanwhile we are going to allow our own Territory to remain a barren wilderness. It must continue to remain one unless we turn it to profitable use. One of the profitable uses to which it might be applied is for carrying on the industrial activities of the Commonwealth. But if the Government are going to try to placate one State with a sop in the way of a Commonwealth factory, we shall have other States demanding similar concessions. We shall have a continuous rivalry amongst the States and districts, as well as amongst the representatives of those districts, who will &#34;barrack&#34; for one favour after another. In the meantime the interests of Australia can go hang all the time. I am utterly opposed to a policy of that kind, and intend to take pretty drastic action on the present occasion to express my opinion about it. This is the only remedy that is left to us. Time after time honorable senators have voiced their opinion that the industrial activities of this Commonwealth should be established within the Federal Territory. We have little enough of our own to establish anywhere. Why should we be looking round to establish industries elsewhere than in our own Territory? We have previously expressed our opinion emphatically by placing a resolution on record affirming that Federal factories should be established within the Federal Territory. If the Government turn a deaf ear to our repeatedly-expressed and emphatic declarations of opinion, there is only one, course open to us. The action that I propose to take on the present occasion, with a view of marking our disapproval, is to move, as I now do - </para>

            <para>- It is not  fair  to hurl such a charge at the manager. It was immaterial to him where we decided to establish the factory. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smail</inline> was engaged by myself when I was in England. He comes from a woollen factory in Scotland, in which he held a responsible position. I was assured by the High Commissioner, who had gone through the testimonials of various applicants, that he was regarded as one of the foremost men in the woollen trade in &#39;Scotland as a working foreman. He knew nothing of Australia so far as parochial interests are concerned- </para>

        </continue>
        <para class="block">He was supplied in England with data respecting Australia, which he studied. The instructions  1  gave him were that it was the desire of the Government that, if it could possibly be shown that the Woollen Factory could be successfully established in the Federal Territory, it should be established there. I told him that, when he came out to Australia,  1  wished him to give his first attention to the Federal Territory. He was to thoroughly examine it, and to bear in mind the wish of the Government to establish the factory there if it were at all practicable. He visited the Territory, and made an exhaustive examination of possible sites. He also had an analysis made of the water, and he told me that he could not recommend the establishment of the factory there under the present conditions. He said that if it were established there under present conditions it would be absolutely &#34;impossible for it to produce woollen cloth at anything like a reasonable cost or at anything like the cost for which it can be produced by many private factories in Australia to-day. I ask honorable senators whether, in the face of such a report, any Government was justified in establishing the factory in the Federal Territory at the present time. To do so would spell disaster to the system of Government enterprise. Immediately the returns, came out, and it was found that the cloth produced by the factory was costing more per yard than that produced in private factories, there would be an outcry for the abandonment of the principle of Government enterprise in this -direction.  1  he surest way in which to bring contempt upon, and defeat, that principle would be to insist upon the establishment of the Woollen Factory in the Federal Territory. </para>

            <para>- The honorable senator may think so, but it is a fact. I impressed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smail</inline> with the fact that it was still the desire of the Government to establish the factory in the Federal Territory, if at all practicable. He wished to be allowed to see other parts of Australia,  and I agreed that he should do so. He visited every State and all suitable places in them for the purpose. We. have his report before us, and in it he puts Geelong first, as the best place, in view of all the -circumstances, for the establishment of this factory. He was convinced that there are several places in the Commonwealth . in which the conditions are such as to make them more suitable for the establishment of the factory than is the Federal Terri tory. The Government had no option, in my opinion, than to accept his report. It is quite unfair to charge <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smail</inline> with any bias or prejudice in this matter, because, if he could have had any, &#39;it must have been distinctly in favour of the Federal Territory in view of the desire of the Government, so strongly impressed upon him by myself before he came to Australia., and again after he arrived here, that the factory should be established -in the Federal Territory. </para>

            <para>- I think it is only fair in connexion with this matter that I should remind honorable senators that Geelong is a part of the Commonwealth. Some possible sites for this factory are spoken of as if they were in foreign countries. If the factory is established at Geelong, while it may benefit that particular town, it will also benefit Australia. I cannot follow the arguments of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> that because Yass-Canberra is good enough for the Federal Capital it should be good enough for a woollen factory. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smail</inline> says that after the Federal Capital is established, and a population is settled there, it may be that the conditions will be all that could be desired for the establishment of -a woollen factory, but he points out that one great essential in deciding upon a suitable site is the supply of labour. By interjection, the statement has been made that we could get the labour if we had the factory established in the Federal Territory, but I may inform honorable senators that we have found considerable difficulty in securing labour for the construction of the Military College at Yass-Canberra under anything like the conditions on which it can be secured elsewhere. In the building of the Military College we have had to pay special rates, higher than the Sydney rates, for labour employed, and in many cases allowances have had to be made which are higher than are given in the different capitals of the various States. </para>

            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> is aware that that is not the question that we are considering now. lt is because there is no prospect of Yass-Canberra becoming a considerable city within the next few years that it is unsuitable for the establishment of this factory. A lot of preliminary work must be done there before population will be attracted to the place. There is another featuree of the labour question upon which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smail</inline> lays considerable stress, and its importance is borne out by all who have had any association with the woollen trade. In older countries, certain industries have become specialized in particular centres, and the people of those places become specially skilled in certain kinds of work. It has been found that where there are a number of factories of the same kind established in a particular centre, the people attain a higher skill in the industry than do the people of a place where there is only one such factory established. This is admitted to be one of the reasons for the success of Sheffield in the manufacture of cutlery, and the success of Manchester in connexion with another industry. In centres where industries are specialized, the operatives become highly skilled, and are able to produce a better article at a cheaper cost than are the people of other centres where those industries axe not specialized. </para>

The people there have been associated with the industry for a number of years, and we should have less difficulty in manning our factory there with the necessary staff than perhaps we should have in any other place in the Commonwealth. </para>

            <para>- That is so, and the &#39; labour employed at that mill is on the market, or has been diverted to other industries. I have no doubt at all that in. view of the superior conditions which will be offered by the Commonwealth Woollen Mill, we shall be able to obtain the best labour, even though it may be drawn from the existing private factories. That has been our experience in connexion with the clothing and harness factories. We have had complaints from the Chamber of Manufactures that the Commonwealth Harness Factory has attracted all the best men in the harness-making business. It is not correct to say there is no labour difficulty in the Federal Capital. There is a real labour difficulty there which will continue for a number of years. It has always been the practice for private enterprise to establish factories only where there is a big supply of labour, and in centres in close touch with ready means of transport, and offering a good market for their products. </para>

            <para>- Private enterprise has not gone to the Federal Territory, and&#34; if the conditions, including a supply of labour, were present in the Federal Territory for the establishment of factories, private enterprise would not have hesitated togo there. If we are to place upon these Commonwealth enterprises the responsibility of peopling the Federal Territory, we shall&#39; make a hideous failure of the enterprise. I wish to point out to honorable senators what may be the effect of the moving of this. amendment. I can see that we are likely to have a junction of forces. We are likely to have a combination of those who desire that this factory should be established  in the Federal Territory with those who desire that it should be established in some place in the Commonwealth other than Geelong. I think that is regrettable. No doubt honorable senators from Tasmania recognise that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smail</inline> has put Launceston in a high place. I say frankly that if Geelong were disapproved of, I should recommend the establishment of the factory at Launceston rather than in the Federal Capital. We may have honorable senators from Tasmania supporting the amendment, not because they believe that the factory should be established in the Federal Territory, but because Launceston being given second place in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smail&#39;s</inline> report they may hope that it will be chosen. I think it ought to be understood by the Committee that it will not be a question of Geelong <inline font-style="italic">versus</inline> Launceston, but of Geelong <inline font-style="italic">versus</inline> the Federal Territory. If the amendment be carried, it will be a direction to the Government not to establish the factory at Launceston, where it could be conducted as an economic success, or at any other place in which it could be economically conducted, but in the Federal Territory. By supporting the amendment honorable senators will be tying the hands of the Government to the establishment of this enterprise where it must be an economic failure. </para>

            <para>- That is not the spirit in which the honorable senator&#39;s interjection was made, because he said it would demonstrate that the Federal Capital was in the wrong place. I ask, is that the spirit in which this question ought to be approached ? I do not think it is. Regard should be had, especially by those who de sire to see these Woollen Mills a success, to the best economic place. I think that an amendment of this kind ought to carry with it some direction to the Government. I appeal to those who want to see the Woollen Mills a success not to support the amendment, because it will tie the- hands of the Government in such a way as to insure the failure of them from the economic point of view. Honorable senators can judge for themselves what effect that will have, and how that argument will be used against the extension of this principle. I trust that the amendment will not be carried, because it will have a very serious effect upon the policy of the Government in this regard. </para>

There will be, so to speak, the battle of the sites over again. We shall, no doubt, find <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Long,</inline> in his desire to have the Woollen Mills in Tasmania, voting against the Government, in the hope that, eventually, he will be able to defeat the wish of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> that they should be established in the Federal Capital. It is most amusing to one who has always taken notice of the statements of the honorable senator, and who recognises that he puts up a keen fight, and generally advocates the principles he is in favour of with all the. earnestness and sincerity at his command, to find him advocating the establishment of woollen mills at Yass-Canberra, a place which he has condemned in scathing terms, especially in regard to one of the principal essentials to woollen mills, and that is the quantity and the quality of the water supply. Speaking here on a memorable occasion, on 13th September, 1910, he said - </para>

          <para>Why should we choose the worst site of alL and the driest in the whole of Australia? . . ,. I say, without hesitation, that anybody who will take the trouble to look up the Statistical Register of New South Wales must come to the conclusion that in one dry year experienced  there  when water was most valuable, Canberra had the lowest rainfall of any place available to us as a Federal Capital site. Its rainfall was only ir inches, and I contend that the rainfall of any place must be judged by the &#39; fall recorded <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> the driest year. </para>

            <para>- That will not have to be done at Geelong, because it has a water supply suitable to the manufacture of woollens. It seems most peculiar that, after the scathing denunciation which the honorable senator made, not only on the  13th  September,  1910,  but on many other occasions, he should now be found advocating the establishment of any industries or mills in a locality which he has described as one of the worst and the driest in Australia. I have always recognised that when he was stating a case, or opposing a proposition, he, gave fairly the evidence pro and con. Yet we find that, on this occasion, he quoted only certain extracts from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smail&#39;s</inline> report in connexion with Yass- Canberra, and only certain extracts from his report in connexion with Geelong. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie.</inline> - He did not want to read the lot. </para>

In face of the advocacy which has been shown by certain honorable senators, and in face of the remarks which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> has made against the Federal Territory, we can do nothing else but accept the recommendation of the expert, whom I do not know, but who, I assume, is one of the best experts whom the Government could have at their command and under their control. Any unbiased person must be struck by the reports which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smail</inline> made on the thirty-three places which be visited in Australia, and the strong recommendation which he made about Geelong in this concluding sentence - </para>

            <para>-  I do not say that. My contention is that Geelong is peculiarly adapted for the establishment of woollen mills. It is the second - at any rate, one of the largest - wool markets in Australia at the present time. It attracts a larger number of buyers from all parts of Australia than does any other market. The best clips are sent to Geelong from the  whole of the Western District of Victoria, which, honorable senators know, is one of the best merino- raising districts in any part of the Commonwealth. There is another aspect of the case, and that is that the land on which the Woollen Mills are to be erected at Geelong is to cost the Commonwealth nothing. If we had to purchase land from private individuals, I might say that, perhaps, it would be better to establish the Woollen Mills on land of our own. </para>

            <para>- I do not know what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt</inline> has said. I do not take any notice of hearsay. All I know is that, in an official report, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smail</inline> makes the deliberate statement that the Harbor Trust of Geelong offers the land free of cost. There was another point upon which the Minister of Defence did not touch when he was pointing out that in Geelong the people were conversant with the manufacture of woollens, and that is the fact that Geelong has one of the best technical colleges in connexion with teaching the whole process of woollen manufacture to be found in the Commonwealth. I refer to the Gordon Technical College. The youths, who we hope will assist the Commonwealth to make the cloth with which the uniforms for the Postal and Defence Departments are to be made, will be trained in that school, and thus we shall have a recruiting ground practically at the back door of our Woollen Mills. I trust that the Committee will reject the amendment. I feel that we cannot, so to speak, go behind the report of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smail</inline> ; but, irrespective of where the Woollen Mills are to be established - whether in Victoria or the Federal Territory, or Tasmania - we should be guided by the recommendation of the officers in whom, up to the present time, we have every reason to place full confidence. </para>

          <para>.- It cannot be said by any honorable senator that in expressing my views on this subject I am influenced by any votes which I may want to give in the future. I am not going to stand again for election, and, therefore, having no votes to catch in Geelong, I can speak quite impartially. I know Australia very well, having been over pretty well every part of it, except the far distant districts. I think that if honorable senators go against the expert advice of an honest man, brought out from the Old Country to advise us in this mat-&#39; ter, they will make a fatal mistake. </para>

            <para>-&#34; Brither Scots&#34; are not very bad men. They control London ; they control many parts of the world, and do not make very many mistakes. They are at the head, of all the big establishments. I am not a &#34; brither Scot.&#34; but a Canadian. I would point out that woollen mills have been established in Geelong for many years, and have been a great success. It will be sheer madness on the part of this Commonwealth to attempt to start Woollen Mills at Yass-Canberra. </para>

If it were right and proper for me to do so,I would lay immense odds that the Woollen Mills will be a failure from the start if they are established at Yass-Canberra.

            <para>- It will be almost impossible to get labour to remain there. Honorable senators must recognise that expert labour will be required. Why are all our match factories established in large centres of population? Because it would be difficult to obtain suitable labour in the country. If this factory be established at Yass-Canberra . I predict that it will be a failure, and that no expert will be able to make it a success. It might possibly be a success in ten, twenty, or thirty years&#39; time, but undoubtedly it will be a failure immediately. We know that our factories at Geelong are a success. I hope that honorable senators will not fly in the  face of the opinion of the expert to whom the task of selecting a suitable site was delegated. </para>

          <para>.- It was most interesting to listen to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Blakely&#39;s</inline> outburst of patriotism, which I am inclined to think was inspired by the fact that it is proposed to establish these Woollen Mills in Victoria. I intend to support the amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> at the present moment, not because I believe that Yass-Canberra is the most suitable site for the erection of a woollen factory, but because that amendment, if carried, will mark the first step in the direction of diverting attention from the present unsatisfactory site at Geelong to a site which has been specially designed by nature for a mill of this character. Before the Government decided to erect a woollen mill they ought to have made absolutely certain that the necessary land would be available to them. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smail,</inline> in his report, states that the Geelong Harbor Trust has offered a suitable area to the Commonwealth free of cost. But to-day we have the Premier of Victoria declaring that the Trust had no authority to make that offer. Consequent! v. before the&#39; mills have been erected at&#39; Geelong, the Commonwealth has been evicted by the Victorian Government. </para>

          <para>. - I have listened with a great deal of attention to everything that has been said upon this question, and more especially to the remarks of the Minister of Defence, because I recognise that he has the ability to make out the best case for the side which he advocates. I was very much impressed by his arguments, although some of them will not hold water when dissected. Take, for example, the excuse which he offered for flouting the decision of the Senate, that all Commonwealth factories should be established within the Federal Territory where practicable. It is unfortunate that so many persons who are not prepared to press things to their logical conclusion should have insisted upon the insertion in that motion of the words &#34; where practicable.&#34; They remind me of a gentleman who was asked if he desired to go to heaven, and who replied, &#34; when practicable,&#39;&#39; by which I suppose he meant that he would like to go there when he could no longer stay here. Why were the words &#34; where practicable &#34; inserted in the motion which was adopted by this Chamber? It was because we recognised that certain things relating to the Federation, such as dock-yards, and possibly the Naval College, could not established at an inland town. </para>

        <para class="block">Bay then. It was not handed over by New South Wales to the Federation at that time. Indeed,  1  am not sure what the position in regard to it is even now. What I have mentioned is the sole reason why those who favoured <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall&#39;s</inline> motion permitted the words &#34;where practicable&#34; to be inserted. It was intended not to make the whole thing a ludicrous farce by providing that we should establish every new service in the Territory, including those which necessarily require to be on the coast. I do not like a Government to make excuses for flouting the declared will of Parliament or of one House of Parliament ; and I say that the reason advanced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> is merely an excuse, because every one here at the time recognised that those qualifying words were not meant to provide an excuse for having none of these undertakings in the Federal &#39;Capital. Let us consider some of the reasons urged by the expert-. I was very much struck by his statement that we should require a large number of hands to work the Woollen Mill, 60 per cent. of whom would be unmarried females. Probably the reason for that is that this gentleman has come from the Old Country, where cheap labour and female labour are so largely employed ; and apparently he has made up his mind that he must, for the same reason, have 60 per cent. of female labour at this Woollen Mill. I do not know very much about the woollen industry, having merely visited a mill or two; but I do say that, whilst female labour may be especially suitable for some portions of the work, in all probability the chief reason for the large employment of female labour in woollen factories elsewhere is its cheapness in comparison with male labour. But I do not think that even in order to make this factory a success commercially, nor even to advertise a State enterprise, we should consent to the tactics of employing underpaid and sweated female labour. The desirableness of producing a favorable balance-sheet will not, I hope, induce us to consent to that. </para>

            <para>- The chief recommendation for its employment elsewhere is that it is cheap. Whilst deftness of hand may make that kind of labour particularly applicable to some portions of the woollen industry, I am satisfied that nothing like  60  per cent, is necessary ; nor would that percentage be employed, except that female labour is so very much cheaper than male labour. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> says that the expert had no axe to grind, and that it is not fair to attribute bias to him. But there is a very good reason why <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smail</inline> should be biased. He says that he cannot see how, if we establish the factory at Yass-Canberra, it could comply with rule  3.  I asked the Minister whether this gentleman was. to be the manager of the factory, and he replied in the affirmative. Now, rule  3  provides that the manager is to be responsible for the financial success of the factory. Naturally, if he is to work it as a financial success, he would like it to be where labour is cheap and most readily available. That is the reason why he did not favour establishing the factory at a place like Yass-Canberra. So that, whilst not attributing any unfair motives to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smail,</inline> I say that the Government, by employing him as manager,- and giving him the choice of the situation for the factory, for the financial success of which he is made responsible, obviously caused him to desire to select a site where the cheapest and most abundant labour would be available. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> presented a pretty well unanswerable argument why this factory should be established at Yass-Canberra; and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> presented another one quite unconsciously when in mournful tones he implored the Senate not to be induced to vote for the amendment on the ground that many honorable senators might support it, not for the sake of Yass-Canberra, but for the sake of getting a &#34; look in &#34; for- their own favored sites. He pointed mournfully to the probable fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Long,</inline> on the one hand, would vote against the Geelong site, in the hope of getting the factory established at Launceston ; and that honorable senators from other </para>

        <para class="block">States might vote for the request with similar ends in view. Suppose that we all voted for the amendment for such reasons. What would it show ? lt would show that, in our opinion, now is the time to prevent that kind of thing from occurring. It would show that, in our opinion, now is the time to put an end to such parochial jealousy by sticking to the terms of the re-, solution passed by the Senate that the services under the control of the Common-: wealth should be established in Commonwealth Territory. I was rather amused by some of the arguments advanced by my venerable friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser.</inline> I am sure he will believe me when I say that it was with a measure of regret that I heard him say publicly that it was his intention not to seek the suffrages of the electors at the next election. Because, whilst we may fight and try to overcome our opponents, we may nevertheless look with kindly feelings on one another, apart from campaign work j and I think we can express an honest feeling of regret at the prospect of parting from one of our friends opposite. But there is one thing that somewhat reconciles me to the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline> is leaving us. </para>

I was dealing with the Minister&#39;s argument, in which he deplored the fact that some honorable senators would vote for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens&#39;</inline> motion, not for the purpose of favoring the selection of Yass-Canberra, but from the ulterior motive that they favored other sites in their own States ; and 1 say that that is a strong argument why any Government should endeavour to carry out faithfully the terms of the resolution passed by the Senate a year ago, and use every effort to secure the establishment of Commonwealth factories in Commonwealth Territory. The statement of the Minister that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smail&#39;s</inline> report is binding on the Government seems to me an admission that we have to run to somebody else for our policy in everything. </para>

            <para>- Not necessarily; but I should take as much of his advice as I thought fit. As a matter of fact, I never remember having had to send for&#39; a doctor. Whilst we may be guided by the advice of experts on purely technical matters, I say that this is a matter of principle and policy, and not a technicality; and if the Government is going to shelter itself behind the views of some expert, who naturally has a bias in the direction of working the factory as cheaply as possible, even with the aid of a lot of girl labour, I am very sorry that such an admission should be made. We have heard from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Blakey</inline> that the land for building the factory is to be offered by the Geelong Harbor Trust. But that only puts the site on a level with Yass-Canberra, because there we shall have free land of our own. Moreover, by attracting a population to Yass-Canberra, we shall help to send up the value of surrounding land, which is also owned by the Commonwealth. I venture to say that Ministers who set this bad example, and honorable senators who are attracted by their excuses for not establishing the factory at the Federal Capital, have never realized the value of the Capital at all They have been compelled by the Constitution to conform to the letter of the law ; but the spirit is not in them, or they would not be haggling over such matters as the respective advantages of Geelong, Launceston, Ipswich, and other places. </para>

        <para class="block">They would realize the desirableness of establishing Commonwealth enterprises at a place which belongs to the Australian people as a whole, and where we can build up land values in such a way as to make the Capital site still more valuable. We ought to try to make this Capital a Mecca for all Australia, the one spot to which the energies of the Commonwealth should be devoted in making it an ideal city, owned by the whole people of Australia, cherished as a monument of their nationhood. I do not think that the Minister&#39;s arguments were any better than special pleading. As to the argument that sufficient labour is not available at Yass-Canberra, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> has pointed out that by placing a perpetual bar on the establishment of industries there we shall prevent the aggregation of population. Does any one imagine that when the Federal Capital is built the head officers who are housed there will put their sons and daughters to factory life? Not if they can help it: Does any one imagine that the members of the Federal Parliament will reside every month of every year, in the Federal Capital? There are obvious reasons for asserting that they will not. They will necessarily have to visit their respective constituencies. If we are going to wait for population before we do anything at the Federal Capital we are, while, perhaps, keeping the letter of the Constitution in establishing a place to be known as the Federal Capital, taking every possible care that it shall never be more than a paltry village. </para>

            <para>- We may, perhaps, know more than the Canadians do about some things. With all respect to my venerable friend I hope we shall not go to Canada to learn how to establish a Federal Capital, though, by going there we might avoid some of the errors which the Canadians have fallen into. Having obtained a fairly large Territory surrounding the site of the Capital it is our obvious duty to make it a payable asset to the Commonwealth which is charged with finding the money to develop it. I hope that honorable senators will not be influenced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator. Pearce&#39;s</inline> argument about the hereditary qualifications of the people of Geelong for the manufacture of woollens. There have been two or three woollen mills established there for many years. They have nearly gone &#34; bung &#34; on many occasions, and have been struggling infant industries since I can recollect. </para>

            <para>- I am aware of that. The first time I arrived at the dignity of a suit of clothes it was made of Geelong cloth, but the people of Geelong have not made such a marvellous success of the woollen industry as to have bred up a whole race of persons as deft at the business as are the people of certain towns in the Old Country. The fame of Geelong, as a centre of woollen manufacture, has not become as widespread, and as hallmarked, as the fame of Nottingham for laces, or Birmingham for buttons. The fact is that there is only a small percentage of the people of Geelong who know anything of the woollen industry. It is playing a little low down to ask honorable senators to swallow very much of that kind of &#34; flap-doodle.&#34; The woollen industry has not been established on anything like so large a scale in Geelong as to have bred up generations of people specially skilled in the industry. We can brush all that kind of argument aside as very special pleading. Honorable senators frequently claim to be acquainted with remote distances of this continent, and they must be aware that big populations have often been attracted to spots that previously had been in the actual wilderness whenever they offered inducements in the shape of a high remuneration for labour. It is an absurdity to say that we could not get a sufficient supply of labour for a woollen mill at a place that is only a three or four hours&#39; run by rail from Sydney. It is only 6 or. 7 miles from Queanbeyan, which is on a line running almost to the Victorian border, and is connected <inline font-style="italic">via</inline> Goulburn with the main line between Sydney and Melbourne, and at no distant date will have a further connexion with that line at Yass. Whatever defects may attach to Yass-Canberra, it is certainly centrally situated, so far as New South Wales is concerned, and is easily accessible by rail from almost any direction. It is unthinkable to suppose that we could not get a sufficient supply of labour there when the place is only three or four hours&#39; run from the biggest city in Australia. The Minister has referred to the difficulty of getting special men for casual jobs at the Military College without paying them an additional rate. But the employment of men in a city is a very different thing from their employment at Duntroon on the class of work at which the men engaged at the Military College are employed. With regard to the water supply, 1 may be allowed to point out that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smail</inline> does not condemn it, but says that it is not available. We must have a water supply for the Federal Capital, and the same water could be used for the woollen mill. We have been considering only this very day a vote for this water supply, and we must secure such a supply if the establishment of the Federal Capital is ever to be advanced a single stage. Personally,I should prefer to delay the establishment of the woollen mill for another year, rather than that it should be established anywhere but at the Federal Capital. I should be prepared to say the same with respect to the establishment of any other Commonwealth factory. I want to put an end to the scrambling by representatives of different States of the Commonwealth for the establishment of Federal enterprises in their particular States. </para>

            <para>- It comes in in the fact that every Victorian representative would&#39; rather die than not get up and say a word for Geelong. Some honorable senators are against the establishment of the factory at Geelong, because they wish to have it established in some other part of the Commonwealth. The Minister of Defence has himself afforded one of the best arguments why we should not have these questions settled according to the way in which they affect particular States. </para>

        <para class="block">Territory. The statement about the labour difficulty has been blown to the winds. To say that we could not find a sufficient supply of labour when the Federal Capital is only three or four hours&#39; run by rail from the biggest city of the Commonwealth is unadulterated humbug. The fact that the expert was only in one place for a few moments before he &#34; jigged&#34; away to another does not justify those who have been in Australia all their lives in accepting his judgment. Probably as a man fresh from the Old Country he would consider a place at a distance of half-an-hour&#39;s walk quite inaccessible, while those of us who have known what it is to carry &#34; bluey &#34; would think no more of going 1,000 miles than he would think of travelling as many yards. </para>

            <para>- I am not cornered at all. The answer to those who talk of cornering me about the establishment of the Harness Factory in Melbourne is that it was because the Ministry departed from the proper principle by wandering all over the Commonwealth in order to placate political supporters or to sweeten this or that locality, to find a place in which to establish Commonwealth factories, that we decided to make the Federal Capital a real thing, and not a sham and a farce, by carrying the resolution which has been referred to. When I ask honorable senators now to act upon that resolution I am greeted with abuse. </para>

The Minister of Defence has done the best he could with a rotten case, but he has failed to make out a case which should convince any one who has at heart a desire to make the Federal Capital a real thing and not a sham and farce, as I am reluctantly compelled to believe the Government desire to make it. </para>

But when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Long</inline> gets up to assist <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> in his amendment for the reduction of this vote he does not exhibit the same spirit. The honorable senator is anxious to support the amendment, not because he wishes the Woollen Factory established at Yass-Canberra, but because he is anxious that it should be established in Tasmania. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> says that the Government influenced the report of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smail.</inline></para>

He visited thirty-three places, and in making these visits he took into consideration the water supply, the quality and the quantity of the water, the drainage, the climatic conditions as regards the manufacture of woollen cloth, the comfort of employes, the proximity to wool markets, the railway and shipping facilities, the conditions of labour, the geographical position as a distributing centre, and the local conditions in regard to effect and economical working.

            <para>- The Clothing Factory at South Melbourne is managed economically, and the work is turned out there more satisfactorily to the Department, and more cheaply, although the workers&#39; are better paid, and their conditions are immeasurably better than are those prevailing in any private establishment. I do hope that the Committee will not follow <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> in his desire to have the amount on the Estimates reduced. I can understand Senators Rae and Givens having that desire, but it is not consistent on the part of some of those who are supporting the latter, when they desire the industry to be established, not in the Federal Territory, but in Tasmania. I do not know what combination has been brought about, but I hope that a majority of the Committee will vote for the retention of the amount, and that the Woollen Mills, as recommended by the expert, will be established at Geelong. </para>

            <para>- The Geelong Harbor Trust is invested with certain powers and has certain lands under its control. If it believes that it is rendering a good service by making this offer to the Commonwealth Government, and subsequently recommending it for adoption, I have not the slightest hesitation in saying that it will be gladly availed of, and adopted by the Victorian Government. There is a big principle at the bottom of this discussion, and it is that the Government are pledged to the establishment of certain industries in connexion- with defence. These industries, in the experimental stage, will do a good deal of harm to this principle if they are not a commercial success.  1  do not mean that they are to be run on the ordinary grad-grind principle of commercialism, but they should be given every opportunity to succeed, and to do that they should be established under such conditions as will give them an equaL chance with ordinary private industries. </para>

            <para>- I admit that. How long shall we have to delay the establishment of the Woollen Mills to get a sufficient water supply brought there by means of pipes? So far, there has never been a suggestion made to Parliament to bring water in a sufficiently large quantity to Yass-Canberra that would lead one to believe that there would be a supply available for the working of woollen mills. Look at the capital expenditure which would have to be incurred. It would cost at least 20 per cent, more to erect woollen mills anywhere near the Cotter River. Before we could get to that river, or to a suitable site for the factory, we would have to cross the Mumimbidgee River, and the very cost of carting the material would place a great handicap upon the industry, which we wish to be a success. </para>

            <para>- The Minister stated that it was necessary for woollen mills to be established close to a big centre of population, where a certain amount of female labour would be available. That is quite a different matter from declaring that he desired to avail himself of that class of labour. I wish to see these mills a success, but I desire only the best labour to be employed in them. If necessary, I should be prepared to sanction &#34;the importation of expert labour with that end in view. I say that Geelong possesses a settled population which includes a number of young persons who have had a large experience of work in woollen mills. It is in direct touch by rail with Ballarat, Warrnambool, and Castlemaine, in all of which places similar mills have been established. </para>

            <para>- The places which I have mentioned are all within 70 miles of Geelong, so that their position is quite different from that of Marrickville. I believe that Geelong is a suitable spot for the establishment of Commonwealth Woollen  Mills from every stand-point. I regret that antagonism is aroused by any proposal to start an industry in Victoria. I believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smail</inline> is possessed of sufficient knowledge to be classed as an expert in the matter of the selection of a suitable site. He has chosen Geelong, and I think we should adopt his recommendation. I believe that the Government are embarking on an industry which is destined to be a very big one in Australia. I would like to see experiments conducted in these mills, with a view to developing and extending that industry. I hope that the amendment will be negatived, and that we shall speedily see a woollen factory established at Geelong, which, after all, is in Australia. </para>

          <para>. - When addressing the Committee, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> said that extraordinary affirmations had been made during the course of this debate. He well might make that statement, seeing that he proceeded at once to add to those affirmations. I venture to say that nothing half so extraordinary has been addressed to the Committee as one of his own statements. After finding fault with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> for moving this amendment, he went on to say that he found equal fault with other honorable senators for not having submitted a similar amendment last year. But what was the position then, and what is it now? During the past twelve months a good deal of money has been expended upon the Federal Capital. It was reasonable to assume that, as the Federal Territory was developed, the Government would bring Commonwealth enterprises into that Territory. Yet we find that their policy is to put those enterprises anywhere but in Federal Territory. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> referred to the site of the Small Arms Factory, at Lithgow, and affirmed that no protest was entered against its adoption. Does he not know that that site was selected before the transfer of the Federal Territory took place? That is a complete answer to his statement, and the same reply is applicable to one or two other sites chosen for factories in Victoria. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I have not the slightest word to say against the suitability of the site at Geelong. I believe it is entirely fitted for the enterprise which it is proposed to establish there. Consequently, my vote must not be regarded as in any way questioning its suitability. But it is reasonable to suppose that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smail</inline> never considered the matter of policy at all. As the manager of these mills, he probably asked himself where he could start them with the best chance of making them a commercial success. </para>

            <para>- I quite accept the Minister&#39;s statement. But is it reasonable to suppose that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smail</inline> was competent to nicely balance the two opposing advantages? The consideration which would appeal to him most strongly was how he could make these mills a commercial success at the earliest possible date. On the other hand, we have to recollect that we have taken over a Federal Territory with the intention of carrying on certain works there.  We have to face a very considerable financial outlay, and the only way in which we can make the enterprise justify itself is by putting imp it every expenditure of public money that we can, realizing that every pound that <inline font-style="italic">we</inline> spend there, and every additional inhabitant that we attract, will impart an increased value to its lands. Suppose that the establishment of these Woollen Mills in the Federal Territory did involve a loss at the outset. What is the position? Is it intended to make the factory at Geelong a permanent one? </para>

If these are arguments why we should &#34; not establish woollen mills in Federal Territory, and if practical effect had been given to them in the earlier history of this country, there would have been no Geelong today. The pioneers would have said, &#34; There is no technical college here now, there is no industry which has a population trained to its needs, and, therefore, we will not start a factory.&#34; </para>

            <para>- There is one spot where the industry was started first of all. It is a peculiar thing that the pioneers generally make mistakes. I do not attach any importance to the fact that the Federal Territory is to-day labouring under certain disabilities. But if that circumstance is. to restrain us from starting Commonwealth enterprises there, we shall never establish a single factory within its borders. Do those who rely upon that argument intend to keep these enterprises out of the Territory for ever? If the Government had been desirous of giving effect to the resolution which the Senate adopted last year, they would have said, &#34; Even if we lose a little upon our initial venture,  in order to secure a start within the Federal Territory we will establish these Woollen Mills there, knowing, as we do, that every enterprise so established&#39; will make it less difficult for other enterprises to succeed there.&#34; I approach this question  from the stand-point of the enhanced land values which may be created by our own expenditure in Federal Territory. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline></para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para class="block">Givens has suggested that if these Woollen Mills were started there they would attract a population of  10,000.  Let- honorable senators, reflect upon the value of lands in towns which have a population of  10,000.  Orange and Bathurst, I suppose, boast a slightly larger population, which numbers, perhaps,  10,000  or  12,000.  &#39;I ask honorable senators to reflect upon the values which attach to business sites there. Yet, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens,</inline> those values would represent the result of establishing only one factory within the Federal Territory. One factory employing  10,000  souls  would give us land values approximating to such as are found in a place like Bathurst to-day. If we can, by establishing one or two Government enterprises in the. Federal Territory, create those values, we at once provide a fund from which we can build most of the city, and a good many of the public buildings as well. It is solely from that point of view that I approach this matter. If it were merely a question of removing the woollen factory from Geelong to Botany, near Sydney, I should be against it. But it is a matter of hard-headed business to try to spend our own money where we can get the increment of value which will result from the expenditure. If we were discussing this as an abstract proposition, every one would say at once that-our own Territory was the proper place in which to spend our money. But we must consider the practical difficulties of the situation. I have already said that Government money, as far as possible; ought to be spent on Government property. But I cannot shut my eyes to the fact that, at the present time, for reasons which I think constitute a charge of negligence or indifference against the Government, it is quite obvious that the Federal Territory is not fully developed as we should like it to be, and is not, perhaps, sufficiently developed to entitle us to establish a factory there now. That is a. fact which we have to recognise. </para>
        <para class="block">The statement made by the Minister, matters pointed out by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smail,</inline> and other matters which occur to our minds instinctively suggest that the Territory is ill-equipped at present for the establishment of factories there. But who is to blame for that? Not this Parliament. The Government have to accept the responsibility. Ministers have been two years in office, and have never approached this House asking for a grant for the development of the Federal Territory that has been refused. Nevertheless, they have failed to take the matter up in earnest, and in a practical way. We certainly had a right to hope that they would have proceeded with the development of the Territory at a more rapid rate. But&#39; can we say that it is a fair, right, and justifiable thing to start the factory at the Federal Territory at the present moment? </para>

            <para>- I recognise that if we do decide to start the factory there now, it will mean some delay as compared with starting at Geelong ; how much delay will depend entirely on the intentions of the Government in regard to public works at Yass-Canberra. If the Government merely mean to proceed at their own snail&#39;s pace, it would certainly tie up the factory for two or three years. But it is possible so to speed up work as to make the Territory fit for the factory within a few months. </para>

In twenty-four hours, with his good and powerful aid, in this city, I have not the slightest doubt that I could form a syndicate which would undertake to create the city for the Commonwealth, and give it all the&#34; public buildings it required, if allowed to take the unearned increment for the short space of  100  years. That is the position. The Federal Capital business can be made the best business undertaking that has ever been entered upon by any Govern&#34;ment in Australia. </para>

            <para>- When there is a chance of championing the unearned increment, its so-called champion runs away from it, and tries to give an unearned increment to the private land-holders at Geelong. I believe that we ought to spend every possible pound in the Territory, but, nevertheless, I recognise that it is useless to affirm that we should establish the Woollen Factory there unless the Government intends to proceed with the building of the city at a more rapid rate than it shows any inclination to do at the present moment. Only &#163;68,000 was spent last year, and I presume that no more will be spent this year. If the Government are going to stand idle, it is  useless to place Commonwealth factories there. That is the crux of the position. If the Government only intend to spend such a small amount each year for a number of years, it will be a long time before we can safely start factories, and our aspirations in that direction must be indefinitely postponed. But, on the other hand, if the Government determine seriously and earnestly to take in hand the building of the city, and will postpone the erection of the Woollen Factory for a few months, we can make the Capital fit for the undertaking then. What are the Government going to do? The answer is to be found in this Bill. I think that it is not the intention of the Government, if they can help it, to proceed vigorously with the building of the city ; and if they have made up their mind not to push ahead with the work, we must wait and endure the evil results of their action. I shall vote for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens&#39;</inline> amendment, not because I think that the factory can be established at Yass-Canberra at the present time, but as a protest against the lack of earnestness shown by the Government in making preparations to place this and other Government enterprises within the Federal Territory. </para>

          <para>. - I had made up my mind when this amendment was first submitted that I could not support it, but the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> and others have caused me to consider other questions and aspects before I can give a vote. I can understand the anxiety of the honorable senator to keep the Woollen Factory in Victoria. I can understand the strength of the argument that there is a better class of factory labour in Victoria than in New South Wales. Personally, I hope that it will continue to be so. I have had some experience of factory life, and I hope that when it comes to be a question of increasing that class of labour, Victoria will always be ahead of New South Wales. She has had about thirty or forty years of Protection, and it may be that she has trained a large class of factory hands who are superior for work of this kind. The fact that many of the men of Victoria have been attracted by work in the more healthy States has left a&#39; large proportion of women workers, whose&#39; help may be necessary in&#39; factories of this kind, available in Victoria. That consideration weighs with me a good deal. If it were merely a question of voting out this proposal in order to place the factory at Botany I would not help the movement a bit. Even if we succeeded in carrying the motion I doubt whether we should get the factory at Botany, which, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smail&#39;s</inline> report, is one of the most suitable places in the Commonwealth. I doubt whether we could get it at Liverpool&#39; either, which is also a place in which I am directly interested. But action of that kind would simply mean hampering the Government in establishing a Woollen factory, and would possibly bring about another scramble such as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> condemned so justly. I should like to give a vote with&#39; the object of closing up this matter altogether until such time as a factory can be established at Yass-Canberra. I desire to see the Federal Territory sufficiently developed to make it desirable to have Federal enterprises located there. But if the factory is to be at Geelong in the meantime,. I should like to know what the Government intend to do in regard to insisting upon acquiring&#39; sovereign rights over the land upon which it is built? When it was proposed that the Naval College should be in New South; Wales, the Government were not satisfied to take a grant of land from that State, but. insisted on the land being handed over to them with sovereign rights over it. I am wondering whether they will insist on the same conditions in regard to this factory. If there are good and ample reasons why the Commonwealth should have sovereign rights over land for a Naval College, there are just as good reasons for having them over land for a Federal factory. It has to be remembered that under existing conditions the Commonwealth will have to hand over to the State of Victoria 25s. per head for every unit in the State. Evidently the payment of that money will be saved so far as the employes of the Woollen Mill are concerned, if the Government insist on having sovereign rights, not only over the land on which the factory is built, but also over the area on which the employes live. Suppose there are  2,000  or  3,000  employes. Reckoning them and their dependents, it will mean that the Commonwealth will have to pay the State Government  .&#163;5,000  or  &#163;6,000  on account of them. That large sum would go a long way towards paying the interest on the money expended on the factory. That expenditure can be saved by the simple method of insisting on the same terms from Victoria, in regard to this factory, as were demanded from New South Wales in respect of the Naval College. I cannot believe that this Government will deal with Victorian&#39; interests in one way and with New South Wales interests in quite another. If I thought there would be any unfairness in that direction, I do not know what I should do. I observe that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smail,</inline> the expert, inspected thirty-three places, which were supposed to have claims to the establishment of the Woollen Factory. He must have been going at express speed, and is now entitled to a rest at the expense of the Government. </para>

            <para>- He certainly has not had too much time in which to visit thirty-three places from Yass-Canberra to Portland, and carefully inspect them all. For one thing, I must commend <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smail.</inline> He has put his comments upon the various sites in a very few lines. It is quite refreshing to get information of this description compressed within a couple of sheets of printed paper. That is much more convenient than having to wade through a volume an inch thick. He puts Geelong first, Launceston second, and Botany third. I can remember hearing of Geelong tweed as long as I can remember anything, but the fact that Geelong is not much of a place, even now, suggests that  the woollen industry has not been developed there to a very great extent. Is it either that or some other reason with which we are not yet acquainted? </para>

            <para>- It may be due to the Protectionist policy. We know that the spoon-feeding policy assists industries up to a certain stage, but they must still be spoon-fed after they have reached that stage. I find that this expert visited thirty-three places. Judging by his summing up of his opinions of the different places, I should say that he was quite impartial in his judgment. He&#39; gives Victoria the first place, Tasmania second, with Launceston and Hobart. Botany, because of the labour and other facilities there, is given third place; Liverpool is considered rather an excellent place from the fact that Henry Bull&#39; &#38; Co. manufacture woollens there to a very large extent. I have to congratulate the expert upon having discovered in Australia so many places suitable for this particular industry. To me it is idle to quibble as to whether the industry should be established in New South Wales, Victoria, or Western Australia. </para>

            <para>- Western Australia is getting a railway, for which the rest of the people of the Commonwealth will have to pay for many years to come. That, I suppose, is quite enough for one twelve months, and I think the Western Australian people are pretty well satisfied. Adelaide has also been visited by this expert. Viewing the whole of the thirty-three places mentioned in the report, and noting the small difference between them, I am firmly of opinion that when the Australian Government is .in its own home at Yass-Canberra, we shall find that industry after industry will be established there. They can be linked up by the power which will be generated by the rivers which our Victorian friends are never tired of sneering at. It will be only a matter of the development of the Australian sentiment when we shall do what Senators Rae, Millen, and Givens wish us to do now, and establish all our industries at Yass-Canberra. </para>

            <para>- I do not think that any one who voted for the resolution referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> will be prepared to say that we should adhere to the letter of it, irrespective of commercial advantages and whether it would be common sense to do it or not. On the evidence before us, and having a knowledge of the greater part of the Commonwealth, with the exception of Western Australia and Tasmania, of which States I have no great personal knowledge, it appears to me that this factory might be established almost anywhere in the Commonwealth. The only feature which gives Victoria the advantage, and which weighs with me, is that there is in this State the class of labour most suitable for factories of this kind. A reference has been made to the establishment of the Small Arms Factory at Lithgow, but it cannot be placed on the same footing as a woollen factory. Irrespective of any resolution of the Senate to have all Government industries established at the Federal Capital, I should never dream of removing the Small Arms Factory from such a place as Lithgow, which is specially suitable for the purpose, not merely because there is iron and coal there, but from a defence point of view. We know that if anything like a serious attack were made upon Australia, a factory for arming our people for their - defence would be one of the chief points of attack ; and the natural defences of Lithgow render that place almost impregnable. That is a matter which should be taken into consideration in the establishment of such a factory. I have no wish to remove the existing Ammunition Factory from its present site in Victoria ; but I do think that an ammunition factory should be established at Lithgow for the same reason as that which makes it so suitable for the establishment of a small arms factory. The comparison of a small arms factory with a woollen factory is not altogether a fair one. I find from the report of the expert that although he did not visit the Rockhampton and Gladstone districts, he made exhaustive inquiries concerning them, and found that the climatic conditions were not any more suitable than at Ipswich and Brisbane. I think we can agree that that is so. Adelaide apparently is quite a possible place, but has no special facilities, and is quite out of the running against Geelong. Perth, Guildford, Bridgetown, and Collie have no outstanding features in their favour, and in spite of the proximity of coal at Collie it is regarded as quite an impossible place for the establishment of such a factory. </para>

            <para>- I have done a little travelling, and I should not regard such a run round the States as this expert had as a holiday. I am surprised that the Government did not instruct the expert to report upon half-a-dozen places that are known to be suitable for the establishment of a woollen factory. Liverpool, Parramatta, Botany, and Marrickville are all places at which woollen factories have been carried on for years. Then we might take Victorian centres, commencing with Geelong. We know that there would be no difficulty in establishing a woollen factory at any of these places. I . do not exactly know what is the purpose&#39; of the Government in the establishment of this factory. Is it intended only for the manufacture of cloth for the Defence Force and Government employes? If that be so, it is possible that we are making too much fuss about the matter altogether. </para>

            <para>- The honorable senator knows very well that the only reason he is supporting the request moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> is that he hopes the decision arrived at by the Government may not be adhered to, and that he may get the ear of the Minister and induce him to establish the factory at Launceston or Hobart. I rather admire the fight which has been put up by Senators Russell, Barker, and other Victorian senators who have taken time by the forelock and have already got the ear of the Minister, and possibly also the ear of the expert. I do not mean that they have secured the ear of the expert in any underhanded way, but that they have taken advantage of opportunities to impress him with the special advantages of the Geelong site. I am sorry that I have not yet learned their up-to-date methods of fighting for my own State. </para>

            <para>- If Packer&#39;s brigade is strong down there that might be a very good reason for the establishment of this Woollen Mill there because I believe that people of that character are very suitable for this factory work. I had the advantage of a run through Great Britain, and what I saw there of factory work and workers did not fill me with any great desire to have factories established in my State. I say that the conditions inseparable from the manufacture of woollen goods are such that I hope that the majority of our people will always be able to enjoy a better, healthier, and more independent way of making a living. I am satisfied to let Victoria have this factory. The Victorians deserve it. They have educated their people down to it. I did intend, when I rose, to speak until 12 o&#39;clock, but I do not wish honorable senators to miss their trains. I assure Senators Givens, Rae, and Millen that as soon as Yass-Canberra is established as the Federal Capital, as soon as the Parliament of Australia meets there, and as soon as industry after industry is established, and successfully established, there, with the necessary population, I hope to be with them in fighting to have woollen mills built up where those added values which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> spoke of so logically will be given to the land by the presence and the needs of the community in the Federal Territory. </para>

            <para>- Whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> did argue in that or any other way, there is no getting away from the logic of his argument that it would even pay a private company to undertake the erection of all the public buildings in the Australian Capital if the Government would give them just 100 years&#39; right to the unearned increment. With that enormous prospect before the Government, I cannot understand them not getting along with the establishment of Yass-Canberra at the rate of speed at which one would think it would be got along with under the able and capable management of the present Minister of Home Affairs. I was delighted indeed to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Blakey</inline> state that already there is an income of nearly &#163;5.000 a year. But with the immediate establishment of the Capital, and an up-to-date and rapid development of the Federal Territory for all the purposes for which it can be developed, I venture to say that in a very short period that sum will increase to &#163;50,000. That is a reason for a more rapid development, and when that takes place this little place which honorable senators are too much inclined now to look at as part of New South Wales, will generally be recognised here as Australian Territory. I wish that the Government would enter into negotiations with the New South Wales Government to get more territory than they have secured, and to run a line straight from Jervis Bay, 200 or 300 miles inland, and then direct south, taking in the whole of the south-eastern corner of New South Wales and a piece of Victoria as well, and thus get a Federal Territory which we could develop. </para>

          <para>. - I feel that I cannot give a silent vote, because of some remarks made here to-night which involve the State I represent. The first consideration which will influence my vote is : which is the most suitable site in Australia for this factory to be run under Federal Socialism? I belong to a party whose members are pledged to a principle which we believe to be right, and that is that in many channels of industry the municipality or the State or the Commonwealth can do better work for the taxpayers than can private enterprise. Rightly or wrongly, I hold that view. Here is an instance in which the Commonwealth has entered into the channels of industry. I do not want to see anything placed in the way of these Woollen Mills becoming the greatest success which it is possible to make them. When I listened to some remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> to-night I fancied I could hear him addressing some of the large audiences which he will address in New South Wales prior to the next election, and quoting the Commonwealth Woollen Mills as one of the striking instances in which Commonwealth Socialism has failed. </para>

            <para>- I am quite satisfied that I shall be able to quote the Federal Territory as an instance of success and not failure. I can quite understand the reason of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> for moving the amendment, and of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> for supporting him. I am satisfied that they believe that it would be a splendid thing to establish all Commonwealth factories in the Federal Territory, but there are limits to be observed. If I could bring myself to believe for a moment that these Woollen Mills would be a success if established in the Federal Territory, I* should vote for the amendment. Not because I think it might upset the whole arrangement, and incidentally give Tasmania a chance again, but because they would be established within the Federal Territory. I was vain enough to hope, when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smail</inline> was imported from England and sent to the different States, that he would, if he could not recommend the Federal Territory for the establishment of the Woollen Mills, recommend Tasmania. I hoped that my State would come first after the Federal Territory. But, after I* had carefully digested his report some weeks ago, I had not the temerity to place my lay opinion against that of an expert who came here with splendid recommendations. What reason could he possibly have for recommending Geelong before the Federal Territory, or any other supposed place, unless he actually believed, without any bias; that it was the best place for the purpose? I must believe that this expert, after having carefully considered all the factors which go to make for the success or the failure of woollen mills, came to the honest conclusion that Geelong was the most suitable place in which to establish them. That being so, I, as a representative of Tasmania, have, rather reluctantly, to agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smail</inline> that Geelong takes first place, even before any of the places in that State. That is the reason why I intend to vote in favour of Geelong. At the same time, I trust that it will not be very many years before these disabilities which are stressed so strongly by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smail</inline> in his report, and which place the Federal Territory outside the range of choice, will be removed. </para>

            <para>- I accept <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smail</inline> as an expert without bias. What possible bias could he have in recommending Geelong, or any other place? He came here an entire stranger, and was engaged for a specific purpose. He was instructed by the Government that, if it were possible to make a success of these mills in Federal Territory, they desired that they should be established there. In the face of those instructions, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smail</inline> submitted his &#39;report, in which he recommended the selection of a site at Geelong. That is the reason why I intend to support the Government proposal. I believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smail</inline> is &#39;best qualified to judge of the merits of the different sites, and because I am strongly of opinion that the establishment of the mills at Geelong will give them a better chance of success than would their establishment elsewhere, 1 shall vote for the item as it stands. </para>

          <para>. -  To-night we are called upon to decide a very important question indeed, and one which will have very far-reaching results to the whole of Australia. I have refrained from speaking till this late period of the debate because I was anxious to hear the opinions expressed by the leaders upon both sides of the Chamber. This is a question upon which one cannot afford to be dogmatic. 1 have listened attentively to its discussion with an entirely open mind. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para class="block">It appears to me that we are now confronted with the aftermath of the Federal Capital question, which was decided in this Chamber two years ago. On that occasion, we did not, in my opinion, choose the best site in the interests of Australia. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline>has proposed that, upon the unsuitable site which was then selected, we should establish Commonwealth Woollen Mills. As a representative of Tasmania, I naturally concur in the views expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Long</inline> in regard to the desirableness of establishing these mills in that State. I believe that we have there sites which fulfil every possible requirement. But whether the motion be carried or not, the Minister of Defence has given us to understand that we cannot hope for Commonwealth Woollen Mills to be started in Tasmania. However, I believe that the time is not far distant when the Government of that State will erect woollen mills there. The Labour party in the Tasmanian Parliament, which I am convinced will come into power before very long, has upon its platform a proposal to establish State Woollen Mills. When effect is given to that proposal, I believe that Tasmania will be able to turn out a product equal to any in the southern hemisphere. </para>
        <para>The Government ask us to consider this question from the stand-point of whether Commonwealth. Woollen Mills are likely to prove a commercial success in the Federal Territory. On the other hand, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> invites us to regard it from the stand-point of which site will be in the best interests of the people of Australia. I quite recognise that, from the point of view of its probable commercial success, the Government have the better of the argument. The expert who selected the site is in a position to offer an opinion which we are not competent to criticise. But we have decided to establish a bush Capital, and. in my opinion, it would be utterly ridiculous for us to spend public money in laying out a great city if we neglect our opportunities to attract to that city a large number of inhabitants. We know that the establishment of woollen mills in the Federal Territory would attract to it a big population. </para>
        <para>As one who has had some experience of woollen goods, I do not think the difficulties to be encountered in the Federal Territory are so great as to forbid the possibility of Commonwealth Woollen Mills there being made a success. I admit that the difficulties would be far greater than at Gee- long, but the advantages to be derived from the adoption of that course would more than compensate for those added difficulties. Consequently I shall vote for the amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens.</inline> Although the representatives of Tasmania will be divided upon this question, I believe that each one of them will be able to satisfactorily explain to the electors the motives which actuated him in this matter. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Long</inline> that Tasmania offers splendid facilities, which have not yet been availed of, for the production of woollen goods. </para>
        <para>I shall record my vote, not from a party stand-point, but from an honest belief that to-night we are called upon either to affirm or reject a principle which will have an important effect upon the future Capital of Australia. </para>

          <para>.- I have listened carefully to the arguments of the Government as the authors of this proposal ; and, so far as they have any force at all, they can be placed under two heads. The astonishing thing to me is that one of these arguments is such as could have been reasonably expected, not from a radical Labour Government, but from an ultra-Conservative Government. Shortly stated, it is the old Conservative argument that &#34; the time is not yet ripe &#34; - that the Federal Capital might be a splendid place for Commonwealth factories by-and-by, but not yet. lt is said that there is no means of communication, and no water supply ; but if the Government were in earnest, and made a start even now, all the necessary works could be completed by the time the factory was ready. The other argument is that there is not the necessary population, and that in consequence a labour difficulty is to be feared. We are told that it is a great advantage to have such works in centres of population, where labour is at once available; but the town of Bourneville, established by the Cadburys, and the town of Port Sunlight, established by Lever Brothers, are certainly the most successful in the world, and were built far from centres of population. These firms went, as it were, into the wilderness and established ideal settlements, far superior with all their advantages, to any of the slum districts in which factories are usually to be found in the Old Country. Could not the Government have followed that good example, and begun these factories in their own Territory under new conditions, with nothing to undo? It is altogether futile to talk about a labour difficulty. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> pointed out, there can be no labour difficulty in a district which is a few hours by rail from Sydney, the most populous city in Australia. I have known places, out in the Never-Never, not only hundreds of miles,, but, in one case, thousands of miles from any popular centre, where there was not a soul, and yet within three or four months, great cities have grown up with every modern convenience. If that can be done in the case of gold rushes, and so forth, why cannot it be done by the Government, with all the facilities at their command? If we ask why the people of Geelong are so anxious to have the Woollen Mills there, the answer presents an argument in favour of selecting a site in the Federal area; because the real reason why they are prepared to give the land for nothing, and other concessions, is that the establishment of. a new factory would lead to a large accession of population, and enormously increase the value of privately-owned land. In such cases as these, it is the landlord who reaps the benefit; and the Government, by establishing the factory there, are presenting to the landlords of Geelong something that they have never earned, and have no right to possess, namely, the unearned increment. It is really the credit and enterprise of the people of Australia that establishes this factory, and any unearned increment ought to be received by the people as a whole, a result which could be brought about by establishing the factory on the middle of land owned by the people. The Labour Government, from whom we had a right to expect better things, have gone out of their way to establish this factory at Geelong, and it was rather ungenerous of the Minister to twit us with the statement that this is the first time that we have taken such drastic action as this. I explained, when I moved the request, that we had on several occasions expressed our opinion most emphatically in this regard, and that the Senate had gone to the length of placing its decision on record that all these Government enterprises should be established in the Federal Capital. It was only when we found our remonstrances were in vain, and were flouted by the Government, that we were compelled to take this drastic action, and if it were not for the fact that some honorable senators do not like to see the Government &#34; put into a hole,&#34; the Government would be hopelessly beaten. </para>

            <para>- I am satisfied that the honorable senator, as Minister, has not done so, but rather that he has been subject to those insidious influences which always place the man on the spot at an advantage, as compared with the man at a distance. I do not doubt the ability of the expert as a woollen manufacturer, but I do doubt his ability as a judge of the suitability of a particular place in Australia for carrying on this work. He had been here, so to speak, only twenty minutes, when he issued a report, as if he had known all the conditions, climatic and otherwise, of all the places visited, for the last twenty years, but he could not have sufficient knowledge on which to form a trustworthy judgment. An angel from Heaven could not in such a short time have an acquaintance with the conditions necessary to give an authoritative opinion. For those reasons I intend to call for a division, and 1 hope the majority of honorable senators will be in favour of the national policy of placing national works on national territory. </para>

            <para>- The proposed adjournment, from my point of view, is altogether wrong. We have not yet proceeded with the discussion of the Budget-papers, and I have always objected to adjournments of this character whilst any serious business remains to be transacted. Honorable senators have complained again and again that a reasonable opportunity is not afforded them to discuss the financial statement; that it is presented at the last moment, and when, because of their desire to return to their homes, they have been forced to pass the Estimates practically without discussion. To this complaint the Government have replied, &#34; The Budget-papers have been before the Senate for some time, and you have had ample opportunity to discuss the whole question, but have failed to avail yourselves of it.&#34; No matter what Government is in power the resumption of the debate on the motion that the Budget-papers be printed is always placed at the bottom of the business-paper, and we find to-day that, although we have yet to discuss the Budget it is proposed that we shall adjourn for a month. It is said that honorable senators desire a rest, and wish to return to their homes, or visit their constituents. Such an adjournment as that now proposed would not permit of my visiting my home in North Queensland. I could not leave Melbourne: until Wednesday next, and even if I travelled night and day I should not be able to spend more than three days in my home at the back of Cairns. Whilst there is business on the notice-paper to be done we should object to any adjournment. We should do the work that we are paid to transact, and when we have cleared the business-paper we should have such an adjournment as would give us a reasonable opportunity to visit our constituents, and to make ourselves acquainted with the wants of the country. But the &#34; tiddlewinking &#34; adjournments that we have had, particularly during the present session, are of no value to us. It is wrong that we should be compelled at the bidding of the Government to agree to this adjournment at a time when the most important subject of the year - the Budget statement - remains to be debated. We are to free the Government from criticism, and to adjourn for a month simply because the Government ask us to do so. I shall vote against this motion. </para>

We all know what happened last year in connexion with the discussion on the Budget-papers.

            <para>. - I wish to call attention to a matter of some importance to other honorable, senators as well as myself, the imperfect distribution of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> I have had occasion to complain of this on several occasions, and yesterday wrote to the Government Printer on the subject, as I had already done before, more than once, and spoke to the officers of the House regarding it. On making inquiry, I find that I am not the only one who has cause for complaint, but my case is particularly bad, and shows the need for some new arrangement, or some means of enforcing the present arrangement. Last year the bound volumes of the debates to which I was entitled failed to reach me, and some time after I had received the notification that they had been sent, I made inquiries about them, but could learn nothing definite. Eventually I found them in a news agency, fourteen miles from where I live. They had been taken there by a carrier who, when written to by the Government Printer after I had complained about the matter, stated that he had my receipt for their delivery. If he had a receipt, it had been forged, because the volumes did not reach me until I had paid for their carriage from where I found them. This year I have not yet received the bound volumes of last session. On inquiring why they had not come to hand, I was informed by the Government Printer, some weeks since, that they had been sent two or three weeks earlier. He promised to find out why they had not arrived, but I have not yet heard anything, although I wrote twice. I have been informed that the Government Printer of Victoria publishes and undertakes with a contractor to deliver the bound volumes of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> to every member&#39;s home. Members of the House of Representatives have the same complaint to make as I am making; indeed, I have been informed by old members that these delays have occurred ever since the beginning of Federation. Early next year members of both parties will desire, in view of the approaching elections, to be able to refer to the official reports. It is useless to complain without suggesting a remedy, and, therefore, I say that if we are at the mercy of the State Government, and therefore cannot control the distribution, we should arrange for an officer of the Commonwealth to take charge of it, or it should be understood that each member must call at the Printing Office for his own copy. I trust that the Government will see if this grievance can be remedied. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>. - I ask the Minister of Defence to give consideration during the adjournment to the case of New South Wales warrant officers and drill instructors who are about to be retired, although in the prime of life, at the age of  60,  or thereabouts, after thirty or forty years&#39; service in the Military Forces, first of the State and then of the Commonwealth. I understand that they are still well fitted for the work which they have done so ably, and that there is no provision by way of a bonus or pension to alleviate the hardship of their retirement. In New South Wales it is the practice on the retirement of Government employes, whether maintenance men employed on the roads, or men in other positions, to give a bonus of a month&#39;s pay for every year &#39;of service. It is a sorry spectacle to see a man too old to remain in the employ of the Commonwealth and too young to be eligible for an old-age pension, retired without any monetary consideration. The men to whom I allude have served a lifetime in a very poorly paid service, for many years not getting more than&#163;3 a week. I should have brought the matter up in another way, but for the peculiar circumstances of the session. I hope that during the recess the Minister will determine to follow the example of New South Wales, and grant to retired officers a month&#39;s pay for every year of service. </para>
