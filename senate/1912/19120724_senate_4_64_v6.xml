Molloy, the Commissioners for the purpose of distributing the said State into divisions, in their report laid before Parliament on the 19th day of June,1912, and that the names of the divisions suggested in the report and indicated on the map referred to therein be adopted, except that the name &#34; Henty &#34; be substituted for &#34; Caulfield.&#34; </para>

                    <para class="block">In the Representation Act of 1905 provision is made for determining every five years the number of members for the House of Representatives to be chosen by each State, and for that purpose enumeration days are appointed on which the number of the people of the States has to be ascertained, and the number of members to represent each State has to be determined by the method set out in section 24 of the Constitution. The day on which the census is taken every ten years is, by that Act, determined to be an enumeration day, so that there is one enumeration day between one census and another, because the period is five years, and the census day itself is an enumeration day. That has been done because, by the census, we get an accurate numbering of the people of the Commonwealth. A census of Australia was taken on 3rd April, 191 1, which was, therefore, an enumeration day. In a return which was tabled on 6th December last, the Chief Electoral Officer certified that he had, in the manner prescribed in the Representation Act, ascertained the number of the people of the Commonwealth and of the several States as on the then preceding enumeration day, and that they were as follows: - New South Wales, 1,646,734; Victoria, 1,31,551 Queensland, 594,514; South Australia, 408,558; Western Australia, 274,841 ; and Tasmania, 191,211; making a total of 4,431,409. In a further return, tabled on the same day, this officer notified that lie had determined the number of members of the House of Representatives to be chosen in the several States to be as follows:New South Wales, 27; Victoria, 21; Queensland, 10; South Australia, 7; &#34;Western Australia,, 5 ; and Tasmania, 5. The effect of this determination is that Queensland gains, one member, and Victoria loses one member. It is, therefore, necessary to distribute Victoria into twenty-one divisions, instead of twenty-two, and Queensland into ten divisions, instead of nine. The names of the Commissioners appointed to distribute Victoria are mentioned in the motion. I only need to direct attention to the factors which have to govern Commissioners in determining their distribution. They are -  &#34; The Commissioners shall give due consideration to - </para>

Further, the average number of electors in the nine metropolitan divisions is 38,318, while the average in the country divisions, is 29,441 only. </para>

                            <para>- Those are the figures on the present enrolment, according to the old boundaries. I am quoting them to show the necessity for a re-arrangement of boundaries. The number of members in each of the proposed new divisions, together with the extent to which those numbers differ from the quota, is shown in the following figures : Metropolitan electorates - Balaclava,  1,763  below the quota; Batman,  1,181  above the quota; Bourke,  225  below the quota; Caulfield,  2,111  below the quota; Fawkner,  805  above the quota; Kooyong,  313  below the quota; Maribyrnong,  553  below the quota; Melbourne,  2,110  above the quota; Melbourne Ports,  1,925  above the quota ; Yarra,  2,366  above the quota. Country electorates - Ballarat,  1,363  above the quota; Bendigo,  309  above the quota ; Corangamite,  36  below the quota ; Corio,  730  below the quota ; Echuca,  148  above the quota ; Flinders,  1,330  below the quota; Gippsland,  93  below the quota; Grampians,  749  above the quota; Indi,  753  below the quota; Wannon,  890  below the quota; Wimmera,2,166 below the quota. Under the proposed redistribution the average number of electors in each of the ten metropolitan divisions will be  34,990,  while the average in each of the eleven country divisions will be  34,336.  I do not know that I need add any more. Honorable senators will, I think, recognise that  a  redistribution is needed. Apparently the Commissioners have adhered to the provisions of the Act in making their scheme of redistribution. It now becomes the duty of Parliament to say whether it will or will not accept the proposals of the Commissioners; and I move the motion standing in my name in order that the Senate may give its assent to the proposal. </para>

                    <para class="block">I regret very much that there seemed to be some necessity, in the view of some honorable senators, for delaying this matter last week. In my opinion, it might have been allowed to be dealt with as a formal matter. That, however, was not done, and consequently we are called upon to discuss the motion this afternoon. It is desirable in the interests of the Commonwealth that such an opinion should be expressed ; but whether it was necessary to take action in this form is another question, seeing that action had already been taken by the Government some time previously. The Government, when they first saw the intimation in the press that differential treatment was to be given to American shipping using the Panama Canal, communicated with the only authority with which they had any right or power to communicate, namely, the Imperial Government. They pointed out the desirableness of taking action in this matter, and also that what was proposed was a violation of the arrangement made at one of The Hague Conferences. They intimated that the United States of America, if the reports circulated were correct, was proposing to do what, in the opinion of the Government of Australia, and also they hoped in the opinion of the Imperial Government, would be a wrong thing. We quite admit that the United States has a right to do anything it pleases, within its own territory, as long as its action does not seriously affect the national interests of other countries. But the Panama Canal is being constructed outside the territory of the United States. </para>

                            <para>- My statement is correct, that the Canal is outside the territory of the United States, although the United States Government have acquired eights in another country. We contend that lithe powers assumed are in violation of an arrangement or agreement made at the Conference I have already mentioned. Reports inform us that the United States Government are prepared to give substantial preference - I might almost say freedom - to vessels owned in the United States when passing through the Canal, whilst vessels belonging to any other country in the world are to be charged at the rate of 6s. per ton on goods carried through the Canal. . I am sure that, we should not presume to advise the Government of the United  States as to how they should conduct their business, but we have a right to express an opinion on such a matter as this. The Government -of the United States would have a perfect right to say that the people of that country or of any favoured nation might pass over the railways of the United States if those railways belonged to the Government, as at present they do not. They would have a tight to give any privilege they pleased to their own people or to the people of any favoured nation, whilst denying the same rights to any foreigners. They would have an equal right to compel foreigners to pay different rates for passing over the railways of the United States than those paid by their own people. </para>

He knows that supporting a poor, weak party is not forming a Fusion. Consequently, the Labour party cannot be charged with having formed a Fusion with any other party in the Commonwealth. But, leaving that aside, I think that, seeing that in the very near future, when this Panama waterway is completed, we may presume that a large portion of the trade and commerce of Australia to and from other parts of the world will make use of that channel, it is rather alarming to the people of this country to learn that our goods are to be charged at the rate of 6s. per ton, whilst goods carried on ships belonging to the United States are to be carried free. We have a right to conserve our commercial interests, and the present Government take great care to secure the protection of all interests in the Commonwealth. They do riot confine themselves to preference to unionists, but consider every interest in the Commonwealth, believing that if any be injured the injury will be reflected upon the whole of the people. Consequently action was taken by the Government to make representations to the Imperial authorities, which will be likely to result in something being done to secure that fair play should be shown, not only to the people of Australia, but of all other parts of the world, in connexion with this matter. We are, of course, chiefly interested in our own affairs, but we hope that the people of all other parts of the world will also be treated fairly, so far as the use of this great waterway is concerned. I have, therefore, very much pleasure in submitting the motion, which I hope will be carried unanimously. </para>

                        SYMON (South Australia) &#91;3.43&#93;. - The Vice-President of the Executive Council deprecated being drawn aside from the subject in hand by an interjection from this side. I think it is rather a pity that he should have allowed himself to be diverted from his purpose by any interjection, because this is a motion which should enable us to rise above the ordinary recrimination of party politics. Whatever view we may take of the desirability of carrying this motion, its subject-matter should raise us into a very much higher arena than that of the ordinary business of the Senate, however important it may be. *

                            <para>- It is not a party question in any way whatever ; it is a great national question. The justification for a motion of this character is first of ali that it may indicate the national feeling of Australia to the Imperial authorities, who have the sole responsibility of dealing diplomatically with matters of this kind. The motion is one which should be carried, if at all, with absolute unanimity. It has another advantage which I may be permitted to point out. It emphasizes and brings before us one of the great benefits arising from the Federation of Australia. </para>

                    <para class="block">If the circumstances which have given rise to it had occurred some twelve years ago a motion of this kind would have been practically impossible. Tt would have been necessary to have brought it before six different Parliaments. The New South Wales Parliament, being deeply concerned in the trade of the Pacific, would, no doubt, have been greatly interested in the matter. It might have received a colder reception from the Parliament of Victoria, owing to the natural and, perhaps, reasonable trade rivalry that exists between the two States. In the State of Western Australia it might have been viewed with less interest than in any of the other States, because Western Australia is 2,000 miles away from the Pacific, and her interests are more directly concerned with commerce from the west and crossing the Indian Ocean. But here we are in a National Parliament, representing the trading and commercial interests of Australia as a whole, and we are able, with a force and influence which could not otherwise be demonstrated, to express our views, which, for the reasons I have indicated, ought to have more weight in the quarters to which they will be conveyed than we could expect under other circumstances. That is not a small matter. Although I am sure we do not wish international differences to arise between countries, still it is not an unmixed evil if they do arise, and we are given an opportunity on occasion to rise above the ordinary work to which our minds are directed, important though it is, and to consider these great international questions and their influence upon us. I should have been pleased if the Vice-President of the Executive Council, in submitting the motion, had referred to the present position of the negotiations in connexion with this matter. We are all aware that there have been negotiations proceeding between the Imperial Government and the Government of the United States. We know that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs has communicated with the State Department of the United States, and asked that the decision of this matter should be postponed until the British Ambassador has returned to his duties, and it can be fully discussed. Since then various cablegrams have been received, and I am a little uncertain as to whether there has not been a definite arrangement made, and if not a complete settlement, at least an approximation to a settlement, of the question between the Imperial authorities and the United States authorities. It would have been of interest to the Senate, and would have assisted honorable senators in dealing with the motion, if the Vice-President of the Executive Council had been in a position to tell us the actual position of affairs. Of course, if the matter has been settled this motion is unnecessary. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator may be much more familiar than I am with the progress of political movements in the United States, and &#39; I am not going to venture upon a prophecy as to what the effect of the communication of a motion of this kind to the United&#34; States authorities would be. I merely say that sometimes an interference, however slight and well intentioned, has not so conciliatory an effect as we might hope for it, if it is made at a time when two contending parties are approaching a friendly adjustment of their differences. If the Vice-President of the Executive Council has- any information on the subject of the actual position of affairs in this matter, I am sure the Senate will be glad to hear it. If the matter is still unsettled, there can be no two opinions as to the desirability of passing some such motion as&#39; this, first of all in order to indicate the feeling with which Australia regards the attitude of the Imperial Government in communicating with the United States, a country which is, I think, friendly to, and has great trade relations with Australia. We may be detrimentally affected by such proposals as have teen made with a view to giving preference to the shipping of the United States passing through the Panama Canal. It is certainly desirable that some such motion should be passed for these reasons, and because of the great and vital importance of the question to the commerce of Australia, and to Australian interests in the Pacific. Without going into details at all, the proposals which have been made, if given effect, would, in my opinion, make the eastern Pacific an American lake. We know what the shipping policy of the United States is in relation to their coastal trade. They are at liberty, as we are, and as we seem inclined to insist in our Navigation Bill, to make what regulations they please regarding their coastal trade. Of course, two can play at that game; but this particular matter involves a great deal more than the protection of coastal trade, and the proposals made would establish a discrimination in favour of American shipping, and a barrier against the shipping of all the rest of the world, in respect of trade conducted from the Atlantic to the Pacific. This alone, it seems to me, in view of our great interests in the Pacific, and trade with the islands of the Pacific, would justify us in being on the alert to give all the sympathy and support we possibly could to the Empire of which we are a part, and to those in authority in the Old Country, whose duty it is, on behalf of the centre of the Empire, as well as on our behalf, as one of the greatest of the outlying Dominions, in their endeavours to secure the interests of the whole of our trade. But I think an improvement might be made upon the terms of the motion, and I propose to submit an amendment which, I think, will make it more comprehensive and satisfactory. It reads - </para>

The United States is perfectly justified, and has complete authority to give whatever bonuses and rebates it pleases. Honorable senators may have noticed in some of the recent cablegrams that it was suggested that whilst observing all the terms of the Hay-Pauncefote treaty of 1901, and leaving the Canal open to the whole trade of the world without preference or restriction, there was nothing whatever to prevent the United States giving to American shipping passing through the Canal a bonus or rebate at least equivalent to the charges made. That is a detail, and what we really desire to prevent, if we can, putting it in its mildest form, is preferential treatment generally. We might possibly give offence by a motion directed specifically against something which the United States Government have a perfect right to do. I therefore move - </para>

It seems to me that we should frame nur motion in this way in order to avoid particularizing action which the United States Government have a perfect right to take under their constitutional and municipal laws.

                        <para>. - It is refreshing at times to get away from party questions in the Senate. The most ardent party fighter becomes somewhat tired of continual wrangling over party matters. This is a question into which the party element should not enter in the slightest degree. I agree with all that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> has said in that connexion. </para>

                    <para>I am inclined, also,, to agree with the  i  amendment he has submitted. The more closely we adopt the phraseology of the Hay-Pauncefote treaty, the more secure our position will be. It provides for equality of treatment being meted out to the commerce and shipping of both nations in the use of the Panama Canal. That treaty was entered into between Great Britain and the United States, and there can be no doubt whatever as to what the intention of the parties to it were. It is explicitly stated that the treatment to be meted out shall be equal, and that there shall be <inline font-style="italic">no</inline> discrimination shown to the shipping of any one country. If our  protest were made more closely in accord with the terms of the treaty we should be on safer ground. I do not know how far we can alter the terms of the resolution in which we are asked to concur, but I certainly hope that the wording of the protest will be materially altered in that regard. It is laid down in the Hay.Pauncefote treaty that not only ships of commerce, but also ships of war, may use the Canal on equal conditions with the vessels of the United States. We know that as regards the coasting trade every country has the right to so frame its law as to suit its own shipping, but that question is not involved in this motion, because Panama is not part of the United States coast. </para>

                            <para>- It is not at all an obvious fact.  1  have yet to learn, unless it is of recent occurrence, that Panama is territory of the United States. A treaty between the United States and the Republic of Panama granted, on an annual payment of 250,000 dollars, the use of a zone nf 5 miles on each side of the Canal. The United States has police and sanitary control within this zone, but the cities of Panama and Colon are controlled by the laws of Panama. I think it will be found tint the United States acquired the concession which was granted to a French company. If we go back we shall find that several schemes were propounded by the United States for building a canal across this neck of&#39; land, but while a number of European countries, and also the United States, acquired concessions, no real practical work was undertaken until after the Suez Canal had become an accomplished fact. It was then that the famous engineer de Lesseps acquired a concession from a French company which was formed some years before. </para>

                            <para>- Under the concession and treaty I have referred to, the United States Government acquired the right to police the zone across&#39; the Isthmus, but Panama is still the Republic of Panama. The first French company was formed to build the Canal under the guidance of Lieutenant Wyse, of the French Navy. The company formed by de Lesseps acquired that concession from Lieutenant Wyse, because the first French company became insolvent, I think in the early eighties, and the second French company which was formed and went on with the work also came to financial grief. It was then the United States Government came into the Panama scheme. After an investigation, the United States Government discovered that the route adopted by America, viz., the Nicaragua route, would not be nearly so cheap or so good as that of the Panama route. The French company, which, as I said, was financially involved, sold out to the United States Government, which dropped the scheme under progress, as it would have meant a longer canal, involving greater engineering difficulties, and also requiring a much larger capital. Seeing that the Canal scheme has been in the hands of several nations, more 01 less, it may reasonably be termed an international concern. No&#39; one nation can say that the Canal is its work, because quite a number of countries have undertaken the task. Many countries surveyed various routes, and several companies were formed to carry out the project, but none of them has succeeded - even the United States Government have not yet succeeded, because the Canal is not yet an accomplished fact, although I think it will be before very long. Spain surveyed a route, as afterwards did Holland j but it was not until de Lesseps had finished the Suez Canal and undertaken to build a canal through Panama that any real work was undertaken. This is truly an international work. I would point out that, whilst it is the same canal which de Lesseps undertook to build, it is being constructed on an entirely different engineering policy. He started to build a sea level canal, without locks, which, of course, meant a very large expenditure, and involved greater engineering difficulties than would a canal with locks. The high level canal, with locks, was undertaken because of the enormous expense which was going to be incurred if the low level was to be maintained right across the neck of land. The enormous cutting which had&#39; to be made through the hills required such a large amount of capital that it practically brought two French companies into a state of insolvency. I am not going to say that there was not corruption in other ways in connexion with those companies. It will be remembered that when de Lesseps came to grief with the second French company, there was very corrupt administration of the Canal work. That has had a great deal to do with discrediting the famous engineer. It was seen then that to build a sea-level canal would require a great deal more money than the French company had to spend, and so it was agreed that they should undertake a less expensive proposition, in the shape of a lock canal. The United States Government acquired the concession -granted to the French company, and that is the concession which is being operated upon at the present time. Whilst the United States have had the work in hand for a considerable number of years, they have had very serious difficulties to encounter, and a number of engineers have had to resign from one cause or another. No less than three engineers-in-chief have been appointed to carry out this work under the United States Government. I think that if I quote a few passages from the </para>

                        <para>In May. 1879, an International Congress, composed of 135 delegates from various nations - some from Great Britain, United States, and Germany, but the majority from France - was convened in Paris, under the auspices of Ferdinand de Lesseps, to consider the best situation for, and the plan of, a canal. After a session of two weeks, the Congress decided that the canal should be at the sea-level, and at Panama. Immediately after the adjournment of the Congress the Panama Canal Company was organized under a general law of France, with Lesseps as  President,  and it purchased the Wyse concession at the price of 10,000,000 francs. An attempt to float this company in August, 1879. failed, but a second attempt, made in December, 18S8, was fully successful, 6,000,000 shares of 500 francs each being sold. The next two years were devoted to surveys and examinations, and preliminary work upon the canal. The plan adopted was for a sea-level canal, having a depth of 29^ feet, and bottom width of 72 feet, involving excavation estimated at 157,000,000 cubic yards. The cost was estimated by Lesseps, in 1880, at 658,000,000 francs, and the time required at eight years. </para>

                        <para>In connexion with the re-organization of the commission a board of consulting engineers, five being nominated by European Governments, was appointed in June, 1905, to consider the question, which so far had not been settled, whether the canal should be made at sea-level, without locks (at least except tidal regulating locks at or near the Pacific terminus), or should rise to some elevation above sea-level, with locks. The board reported in January, 1906. The majority, (eight members out of thirteen) declared in favour of a sea-level canal as the only plan &#34;&#39; giving reasonable assurance of safe and uninterrupted navigation ; and they considered that such a canal could be constructed in twelve or thirteen years&#39; time, that the cost would be less than $250,000,000, and that it would endure for all time. The minority recommended a lock canal, rising to an elevation of 85 feet above mean sea-level, on the grounds that it would cost about $100,000,000 less than the proposed sea-level canal, that it could be built in much less time, that it would afford a better navigation, that it would be adequate for all its uses for a longer time, and that it could be enlarged if need should arise with greater facility and less cost. The chief engineer, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stevens,</inline> also favoured the lock or high-level scheme for the reasons, amongst others, that it would provide as safe and a quicker passage for ships, and therefore would be of greater capacity  ; that it would provide, beyond question, the best solution of the vital problem how safely to care for the flood waters of the  Chagres  and other streams, that provision was made for enlarging its capacity to almost any extent at very much less expense of time and money than could be provided for by any sea-level plan; that its cost of operation, maintenance, and fixed charges would be very much less than those of any sea-level canal ; and that the time and cost of its construction would be not more than one-half that of a canal of the sea-level type. These conflicting reports were then submitted to the Isthmian Canal Commission for consideration, with the result that on the 5th of February it reported, one member only dissenting, in favour of the lock canal recommended by the minority of the board of consulting engineers. Finally this plan was adopted by Congress in June, 406. Later in the same year tenders were invited from contractors who were prepared to undertake the construction of the canal. These were opened in January, 1907, but none of them was regarded as entirely satisfactory, and  President  Roosevelt decided that it would be best for the Government to continue the work, which was placed under the more immediate control of the U.S.A. Corps of Engineers. At the same time the Isthmian Canal Commission was re-organized. <inline font-weight="bold">Major G.</inline> W.

                    <para class="block">It will be seen, I think, that the Canal is undoubtedly an international work. If we were to allow our shipping to be handicapped by any breach of the  HayPauncefote  treaty, we could be rightly charged with having neglected our duty. If there were anything in our competition which was unfair to the United States - if, for instance, this were a. cheap-labour country - the United States might, possibly, find some reason for discriminating in favour of its own shipping. But it is well known that the shipping from. Australia to other countries is by no means manned by cheap labour. Our labour is as well paid as is American labour, and, therefore, our rates cannot be said to be unfair to America. From the trade stand-point, it cannot be urged that we desire to take any undue or unfair privilege or advantage over the shipping of that country. Having read the treaties very recently, I hold that the proposed discrimination is a breach of our rights under, not only the  HayPauncetote  treaty, but also under the ClaytonBulwer treaty, which was passed sixty years ago when the Nicaragua canal was mooted, and which also provided for the fair and equal treatment of the shipping of the two countries. The more recent Hay-Pauncefote treaty is a mere repetition of the earlier treaty. This shows that it was considered before the United States acquired the controlling influence that it was right that this international highway should be open to the shipping of all countries on equal terms. In view of the fact that the United States Government, as we are informed, is proposing to give preference to their own shipping, there can be no manner of doubt that we are acting wisely in stepping in before any harm is done, and before Congress has actually passed legislation and fixed charges. We recognise that negotiations with America at present are likely to be at a stand-still, because a Presidential election is in progress. Perhaps - I do not say that it is actually so - the reports which we have heard in connexion with the Canal may be of the usual electioneering character, and may have very little foundation. But, whether they are well founded or not - whether they are mere electioneering rumours or not - I think we are acting wisely in entering our protest in time. I feel quite sure that the United States Government will give every consideration to it. There is an excellent feeling between Australia and the United States. It would be remarkable if there were not a good understanding, and it would be a pity indeed if anything were done to injure such a feeling in any .shape or form. We have much in common with the United States. The people of that country are sprung from the same stock as ourselves ; we speak a common language, and in many ways they are in closer unity with us than any other country outside the British Empire. I consider, therefore, that anything which we may do to keep up that good feeling, and anything that may tend to cement an even better feeling, if possible, will receive full consideration from the people of the United States. Therefore, I support the motion, whilst thinking that the wording of it might be improved. </para>

As to whether the United States owns territorially, or has the disposition or control of, the particular portion of Panama through which the Canal passes, I think any one who knows anything about the question will say that we in Australia are not qualified or competent to judge. I mean to say that, internationally, the United States stands before all other countries in the world as the country that has the control and disposition of that particular piece of territory. The Canal is being constructed. That its construction involves great advantages to commerce no one will deny. Everybody must realize that the bringing together of the Atlantic and Pacific, and the different countries bordering upon both oceans, constitutes an era in commercial enterprise that was scarcely anticipated, or even realizable, a generation ago. The United States is doing this work. All that we wish to affirm - all that we wish to ask - is that, so far as we are concerned, there should be no differential treatment which would give an advantage to American coastwise or other shipping over shipping that we have authority to regulate or control. That is all that we can ask. </para>

As far as the United States is concerned, we will pass that by. The United States claims and asserts a right. We are not concerned as to whether the Government of that country is right or wrong. Great Britain will look after that. We can be perfectly sure that, so far as the dependencies and dominions of the Crown are concerned, Great Britain will look after any attempted usurpation of right on the part of any foreign Power. All that Australia asks, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has reminded me, is that we shall not be placed in any disadvantageous position. Let us, therefore, see that, whatever motion we pass, we do not in any way attempt to question the right of the United States to do what it is doing. She is doing this work. </para>

If we once do such a thing as that, we raise at once amongst a certain portion of the representatives of the United States the idea that Australia is attempting to dictate to them as to what they shall do in their own affairs.

We have to take the fact that the Panama Canal is being constructed ; that the United States is responsible for it, and that the United States is going to regulate it.

I assume that a motion of this kind, if carried by both Houses of the Federal Parliament, would be regarded as a public expression of opinion of which notice would be taken by the Imperial Government, and that our action would support them in making any representations which they saw fit to make to the United States Government. It might be pointed out that, amongst other protests, there was a protest from Australia indicating that it would be detrimental to the interests of this country if any discrimination were made against British trade through the Panama Canal. I think we have a perfect right, as a portion of the British nation, to say what our treaty obligations - the treaty obligations as between Great Britain and the United States - with regard to the construction of the Canal are.

                    <para class="block">While that treaty remains in existence, it appears to me that the United States would be guilty of a very serious breach if an attempt were made to carry out differential treatment. But we may, I think, rely on the good sense and patriotism of the representatives of both nations to see that treaty carried out fairly and honestly ; unless, of course, any good reason should arise for denouncing the treaty, or for making a fresh one. I think that if we point out that, in our  opinion,  differential treatment will certainly be detrimental to our interests, the Home Government will regard our resolution as one reason for insisting upon compliance with the terms of the treaty. It has been asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> in what way differential charges would be detrimental to our interests. We know perfectly well that, at the present time, the Suez Canal is very largely used by shipping, and that enormous sums of money have to be paid for its use. All the money that is paid for the use of the Canal practically comes out of the pockets of the producers or travellers who make use of it. </para>

                            <para>- A large portion; but that is beside the question. Our object is to insure that whatever trade there may be between Australia and the United States, or between Australia and England, any of that trade which&#39; may be facilitated by the utilization of the Panama Canal, shall not be placed in an unfair position as compared with&#39; the trade of any other nation which also uses the Canal. We desire that trade shall be conducted on fair and equitable terms. We hope that, in the future, the trade between Australia and the United States may become very much larger than it is at present. Consequently, all the facilities granted to us in the use of the Canal will be greatly to the advantage of our producers. Australia can produce many of the things which are required in the United States, and that country will, I am satisfied, be disposed to take increasing quantities of goods from us. The cheaper we can supply those goods, the larger, we may depend upon it, will our trade be, and that increase in our trade will increase the prosperity of our country. I do not think it is open to question that a special charge upon our shipping of 6s. per ton in excess of charges made on American ships will be to our detriment. It is only a matter of common prudence that we should attempt to point this out, and, at the same time, endeavour&#39; to insure to our shippers and producers that they shall be able to trade on the same terms as the shippers and producers of any other nation - even of the United States, lt must be borne in mind that the Canal is not being constructed through the territory of the United States itself. It is true that a zone in Panama has been granted to the United States of America for the purpose of the  construction of the Canal. I hold in my hand <inline font-style="italic">The Statesman&#39;s Y car-Book</inline> for 1912. On reference to page 1096, under the heading &#34; Panama,&#34; I find it stated- </para>

                        <para>On November 18th, 1903, a treaty between the United States and Panama was signed, providing facilities for the construction and maintenance of the inter-oceanic canal. In this treaty, Panama grants in perpetuity the use of a zone (Canal Zone) five miles wide on each side of the Canal route, and within this zone the exclusive control for police, judicial, sanitary, and other purposes. For subsidiary canals other territory is ceded, and for the defence of the canal the coast-line of the zone and the islands in Panama Bay are also conceded. </para>

                            <para>- That treaty, I understand, remains in existence, though the United States may say that the circumstances are so entirely different now from what they were when the treaty was negotiated that its terms can no longer apply. At that time the United States had not had this territory ceded, although they had obtained the title which the French people had when they began the Canal. In view of the fact that the United States contemplated building the Canal, the Imperial Government proposed and entered into the Hay-Pauncefote treaty. If honorable senators take the trouble to read the history of Colombia, they will find that there was a revolution there, as the result of which the independent State of Panama was created. There is a very strong suspicion that the United States Government was behind that revolution. </para>

                            <para>- That is so; and after the revolution they recognised the independence of Panama, and, as a consequence, certain rights were ceded to the United States Government. Although promises had been made by the Colombian Government for many years before, they had always been evaded in some way, and it became a practical necessity that there should be an independent State of Panama under the protection of the United States if difficulty were to be avoided in the construction of the Canal. </para>

                            <para>- I have endeavoured to do so. As a producing country, we are surely interested in promoting trade and commerce with the rest of the world, and it must be better for us to conduct our trade and commerce with our own ships rather than with American ships. lt should not require much argument to convince any one that the preferential treatment of American shipping using the Canal would be detrimental to the interests of Australian trade. It is my intention to support the amendment, but if it is not adopted, I shall support the motion as submitted by the Government. If amended as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> has proposed, the motion will make, perfectly clear what we desire should be known. </para>

That is a matter, however, which may be dealt with later on. It does not now arise for consideration. The fact that the motion, if amended, will not be in exactly the same terms as that passed in another place should not prevent us from amending it. It is within our competence to invite another place to concur in our amendment of the motion if it be carried.

It may be asked what business it is of ours to be passing motions of this kind. In this connexion I wish to suggest to the Vice-President of the Executive Council the addition to the motion of the words &#34; as part of the British Empire.&#34; By adopting such an amendment we should make it plain that our desire is to back up the Imperial authorities in the action they have taken. </para>

If we add to the motion the words I have suggested, we shall be backing up the action of the British Government. By adopting <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon&#39;s</inline> amendment and extending the motion in the way I have suggested we should add to its force and influence, and should assume our proper position, not as a nation protesting to the United States, but as a part of the British Empire backing up the Imperial Government. </para>

                            <para>. - I wish to say a word or two on the motion, because I was the senator who objected to its going through as formal. If we expect the motion to carry any weight, it should not go through as a purely formal motion, and I regretted to hear the Vice-President of the Executive Council say that he was surprised that any one should call &#34; Not formal &#34; to the motion. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable senator desired that is should be carried very hurriedly, and with but a few senators present. I join entirely with the Government in the intention underlying the motion. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> that the form of the motion might be improved. We should not say merely that we object to preferential rates on the Canal because they would be injurious to Australia. That, in my opinion, would be placing the matter on much too low a level. I had an amendment in mind which I shall not propose, because the last thing I should like to do would be to create the impression that the Australian Parliament is divided in opinion on this subject. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon&#39;s</inline> amendment be carried, it will give the Government an opportunity to recast the motion so that it may appear that we are protesting against the imposition of differential&#39; rates as injurious to the interests of the British Empire, including Australia. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable senator is stealing my thunder. It is true that the United States of America have an exactly similar law. What I wish to point out is that, in carrying this motion, we are not asking that the United States of America should alter their law with respect to their coastal trade. We are asking that they should not impose differential rates on what is going to be an international highway. I take, for instance, the portion of Torres Straits between Thursday Island and the mainland, lt might be argued that, as a number of rocks in those Straits should be removed, and it is an expensive highway to keep open, we should be justified in charging dues on vessels going through the Straits. </para>

                                <para>- I have travelled on all kinds of steamers through the Straits, and I never discovered from anybody that differential light dues had to be paid, except, possibly, according to the different tonnage of vessels. I presume that the Government will not transmit this resolution to the Imperial authorities without an accompanying letter, and my point is that it should be made clear that we do not protest against the preferential legislation of the United States of America with respect to their coastal trade; otherwise,- in view of our navigation proposals, we should place ourselves in a false position. </para>

                                <para>- It is all very well for the honorable senator to say so ; but, under the Hay-Pauncefote treaty, the United States of America was given the right to do all the necessary work in connexion with the Canal, and to control and defend it. So far as one can judge from the best English newspapers, the United States of America was given the right, under that treaty, to rob Colombia or Panama of as much land as it pleased, so long as it made the Canal, and left it open to the shipping of the world1 on an equal footing. I am entirely with the object of the motion, though I may disagree with the wording of it. I think we should make it clear that our object is to back up the British protest, and that we do not recognise that the trade through the Canal should be treated as coastal trade of the United States of America. </para>

It is part of our duty as promoters and guardians of the interests of Australian shipping to express strongly our view that this is a matter of vital interest to the shipping of Australia, which forms part of the trade and commerce of the Empire. So far as Australia is concerned, there cannot be the slightest doubt that it is of vital importance to us that the highway of the Panama Canal should be as free as possible for our trade. I support the motion in the form in which it has been submitted, because I think it accords with the distinct understanding entered into between the United States Government and the Imperial Government under the HayPauncefote treaty. It was then recognised that the cutting of the Panama Canal would be equal in its influence upon trade to the cutting of the Suez Canal. It was in anticipation of that that the Imperial Government, in their wisdom, entered into diplomatic negotiations with the United States Government to bring about, in connexion with the Panama Canal, the conditions existing in connexion with the Suez Canal. All the nations of the world using the Suez Canal have been placed upon an equal footing, and it was understood and expressed in the Hay-Pauncefote treaty that the -course followed by Great Britain in connexion with the Suez Canal should be followed by the United States of America in connexion with the Panama Canal upon &#34;its completion. </para>

                                <para>- That may be so. Whilst the United States Government might, through the Imperial Government, call attention to the defective wording of the resolution, I am not quite sure that they would not, possibly, be placing themselves in a more delicate position than we should if we placed the resolution before them in its present form. With regard to the wording, as with regard to other things, there will always be room for dispute; but I cannot get away from the fact that the object of the motion is to strengthen the hands of the Imperial Government. I.t may be argued that the United States Government might reply to us that, as they have complete control over any system of bonus or rebate of Canal dues in the territory through which the Canal passes, any Government, including not only the Imperial Government, but the Government of Australia, who send a message in that form, are intruding upon a sphere in which they are supreme. I am&#39; not quite sure whether such a reply would not be in worse form, and produce a worse effect, than if we were to allow the motion to go as it is, notwithstanding that, technically and verbally, its form might be improved. I have much pleasure, from another point of view, in supporting the motion. As regards the use of the Suez Canal, the shipping of the world is placed on an equality, and there is no discrimination or preference shown with regard to the trade of any country. Surely the United States Government must see that the Panama Canal is in the same relation to the trade of the whole world as is the Suez Canal. Suppose that the Imperial Government, with regard to its dominant position over the trade of the Suez Canal, were to seek to give preferential treatment to British trade, all the world would complain against that Government for taking that advantage of their position. All that the Imperial Government, it seems to. me, ask for is that, in the matter of international trade and commerce, the Panama Canal shall be open to the shipping of the world on, if not the same terms, at least on the same principle, as is the Suez Canal. I agree straight away with the form of the amendment which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> has proposed. We ought to remember that in communications from one Government to another it is necessary to be careful with the wording. I should say that a verbal amendment from that point of view would be an improvement ; but, seeing that it has been carefully considered by the House of Representatives, and has received the approval of the Prime Minister, I think that, rather than make a mere verbal distinction, which really would not amount to much, except as an act of diplomatic courtesy, we should agree to the motion in the form in which it is submitted. It might raise one of the most fruitless of discussions as to the better form of words to be used if we were to send the resolution back to the other House. I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> will not persist with his amendment. I think he will agree that, while the wording of the resolution might be improved, no such opening will be availed of, in case our communication is technically open to attack. Our desire is that the United States Government shall not impose any differential or preferential restrictions on that part of our trade which passes through the Panama Canal, and which is certain to increase as we become a more populous nation. We also express the view that the intention of this Parliament is that international shipping should not be subject to differential treatment. Apart from the form in which we convey our request, it is highly desirable, in the interests of the Australian trade, that, through the Imperial Government, we should strongly and courteously express our opinon that we, as partners in international trade, should be placed on an equality with other countries in the use of the Canal. </para>

                                <para>- Tha That is only extending my privilege, sir, and, therefore, I shall speak to the amendment. I hope, though, that in doing so it will not be out Qf order to refer to the motion, because the mover of the amendment asked for certain information from the Government. So far as I can gather, this question has not been dealt with by the . Imperial Government and the United States Government. There is no evidence yet that the former have communicated with the latter. The Senate is asked to concur in a resolution to be sent, not to the United States Government, but to the Imperial Government; and, of course, we have no right of communication with the former, so far as negotiations are concerned. The only evidence of anything transpiring in the direction indicated in the resolution has been gathered from the press. Whether, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie has remarked, the press rumours are merely the outcome of electioneering tactics in the United States, I do not think that anybody in Australia can say. In consequence of the &#39;reports in the press, the Government have already communicated with the Imperial Government, and pointed out the inconvenience, and, in fact, the injustice which would accrue to the trade of Australia and other parts of the world if a system of differential treatment were adopted in connexion with the use of the Panama Canal. We have received no reply yet. We do not know whether the matter will g0 any farther; but reports are still being published in the press. In another place this motion was proposed and passed in its present form. That is why I say that, although an honorable senator might suggest improvements, if the motion were materially altered, it would show a want of unanimity as far as this Parliament was concerned. </para>

                                <para>- When a proposal has to go f.rom, one House to the other several times, it is shown that we are not unanimous regarding it. It is only when a proposition is passed by both Houses without a difference of opinion that we can be said to have arrived at a unanimous verdict. That is what I want to secure in this instance. The honorable member who introduced this proposal in another place mentioned that comments had been repeatedly made in the press with respect to the relationship which, as far as trade possibilities were concerned, might arise between the United States, Great Britain, and other countries, and which would also affect Australia. It has been asked what difference would it make to the people of Australia if the United States Government, having control over the Panama Canal, charged 5s. or 6s. a ton <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> all vessels which use the Canal, and, by a system of rebate or bonus, paid the money back to the owners of American vessels? Would not that be just as bad as if the United States Government were to charge 5s. or 6s. a ton to the ships from other parts of the world, and to allow American vessels to have the free use of the Canal ? There would be no difference in effect. </para>

                                <para>- If the honorable senator had paid attention to my remarks in the beginning, he would know that I am not cavilling at the amendment. My point is that this amendment, if adopted, would show to the rest of the world - to the Imperial Government and to the Government of the United States - that the Commonwealth Parliament itself is not unanimous with respect to the form of words that should be sent. We want to show our own unanimity first. </para>

                                <para>- We cannot be unanimous if we adopt an amendment upon a resolution that came up to us from another place. We cannot have a unanimous Parliament under those circumstances. We cannot be unanimous in the Senate if a division takes place, and there are thirteen votes on the one side and fourteen on the other. There is nothing in the terms of the motion itself to prevent any honorable senator from voting for it. Even those who are prepared to accept <inline font-weight="bold">Senator- Symon&#39;s</inline> amendment - and 1 am, not cavilling at him for moving it; he has acted from the best of motives - are quite ready to accept the original motion if the amendment be not agreed to. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> himself will vote for my motion if his amendment be rejected. Why, then, not be unanimous as to the motion ? I object to the amendment first, because, if adopted, it would show a want of unanimity on the part of the Senate ; and, secondly, because it would seem to indicate that the object we had in view might be evaded. A good deal of history has been gone into in respect of this subject. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not think it is necessary to speak at great length upon the proposition now before the Senate. I echo the sentiments expressed by the Vice-President of the Executive Council in introducing this&#34; &#34;Bill, and share his hopes that it may speedily become law. He directed our attention to the fact that most of the amendments of the law proposed to be made are rather of the character called in the legal profession &#34; amendments of verbiage &#34; than amendments of substance. The intention is to place the Trade Marks Act of the Commonwealth upon the same level as the English Act. Reference has been made to the trade marks legislation of England, and to amendments in the law proposed by Lord Justice Fletcher Moulton. Perhaps, as a lawyer, I may be permitted to express the opinion that we now have the advantage in Australia of benefiting from, the decisions that have been given by different Courts in Great Britain upon corresponding legislation there. There are honorable senators here who have both literary and juristic qualifications. They will be interested in having attention drawn to some of the main features of this Bill. I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> will bear me out when I say that in this measure we have adopted a phraseology which is practically new to the legal profession. Whether it may be adopted, experimentally, with advantage or otherwise, I do not know. Let me take clause11 of the Bill by way of example. It provides that - </para>

                <para class="block">Here the amending Bill, with a tremendous amount of verbiage, provides - &#34; or description of goods,&#34; instead of merely saying &#34; the same goods.&#34; I am not quarrelling with what is proposed, or suggesting that we are doing a wrong thing in amending our law in this way. In fact,  1  think any lawyer would say that we are doing a right and proper thing in amending our law so as to bring it into accord with the English law, in order that we may get the benefit of decisions given by Courts in the Old Country. If honorable senators will go through the Bill they will find that the largest portion of it is concerned with amendments of that character. Taken in the bulk, the Bill simply substitutes different verbiage. I am anxious to congratulate the Government on bringing &#34;our law into line with the English enactment, in order that, not only the legal profession, but persons commercially interested in trade marks, may have the advantage of the decisions of the English Judges. There is one other point to which I should like to draw attention. I am rather sorry that the Vice-President of the Executive Council is not present. </para>

                        <para>- We shall be perfectly safe in adopting the Bill as it stands. I have gone through it very carefully, and other honorable senators who have done so will agree with me that there is nothing in it to which exception can be taken. It does not involve any question of policy. I wish to refer to some remarks made by the Vice-President of the Executive Council in introducing the measure, and I hope I shall be given the opportunity afforded the honorable senator to touch upon a matter which he was probably induced to refer to by interjections from this side, for which I free myself of all responsibility. In introducing this Bill, the honorable senator  referred to the fact that the High Court of Australia had held that certain legislation passed by this Parliament with regard to trade marks was unconstitutional. That is an undoubted fact. This Bill, amongst other things, provides for the deliberate legislative repeal of that legislation. That was not necessary ; but I believe it is properly proposed in this Bill. In discussing the attitude of the High Court towards certain legislation passed by this Parliament, the Vice-President of the Executive Council made the remark that he could scarcely understand why the creation of this Parliament should have the same powers as the Parliament itself. I was moved at the time to interject that both this Parliament and the High Court were alike the creation of the people of Australia. They were established contemporaneously. I am not referring to this matter for the purpose of provoking discussion, but I do think that we ought to realize that this Parliament is neither more nor less the creation and establishment of the people than is the High Court of the Commonwealth. </para>

The Parliament has the power of investing the High Court with jurisdiction in certain matters, but whether it exercises that power or not, and whether it abrogates its power in that respect, under the Constitution the High Court must still exist.

                        <para>- I may be allowed to remind the honorable senator that the men who drafted the Constitution, and especially those who drafted Chapter III., dealing with  the Judicature, looked far ahead, and made provision for more conditions than some honorable senators dream of. Power is given by the Constitution to invest State Courts with Federal jurisdiction. The honorable senator must be aware that, under our Customs Act and other Acts, State Courts exercise Federal jurisdiction, and I may inform him that the next Order of the Day on the business-paper concerns a measure to extend Federal jurisdiction to some of the most insignificant of the State Courts. If the High Court had not been established, what would have been the position? The Government would have been recreant to its responsibilities. We ought to be very careful in our references to the High Court. It is just as much a duty on our part to be jealous of the position which it occupies as it is our duty to be jealous of what the Senate does. When we are presenting our front to the world we should feel, at any rate, that we have the backing of the sentiment and the feeling of the people. </para>

                        <para>- I believe that were the principles on which that decision was based given complete effect to, we should have no more right to interfere with matters of wireless telegraphy than has the ordinary citizen in the street, because the substance and the basis of the decision was that the conception of the term &#34; trade mark,&#34; as understood at the time we federated, was such that the workers&#39; trade mark was never thought of. At the time we established the Commonwealth wireless telegraphy was not thought of. I put before the Senate reasons which seemed to me to be convincing that we had the right, and, further than that, we had the political obligation, to provide for workers&#39; trade marks. The High Court decided against that view ; and the Vice-President and I are bound to respect its decision. At the same time, it is quite possible that an equal number of equally intellectual, able, trained, skilled gentlemen might have the same arguments presented to them, and arrive at the directly opposite conclusion. I do not blame the Vice-President of the Executive Council for what he said&#34;. He strayed into the matter of criticising the High Court, and expressed his sorrow that it had more power than its creator. With the exception of the substitution of &#34; the same &#34; for &#34;the like,&#34; there is practically nothing in the Bill which should not receive the support of every honorable senator. Two or three things I noted merely suggest a difference in verbiage. We shall have the advantage of getting judicial decisions on them. I would like the Minister to give an assurance, before the Bill leaves the Senate, that, in substituting &#34; the same &#34; for &#34; the like,&#34; it is merely adopting the words which are used in the English Act. I have not had an opportunity of making a comparison. The Government have been very considerate in supplying us with a memorandum showing the amendments which are proposed. Clause 5 repeals section 16 of the Act, and substitutes another provision, but the only alteration it makes of our existing law &#39; on that point is that it uses the words, &#34; the name of a company, individual, or firm&#39; represented in a special or particular manner.&#34; There is a little alteration of verbiage.

                        <para>- There is one provision to which I think the honorable senator might ask his officers to give some attention. Clause 10 amends section 25 of the Act by omitting the words &#34; Except by order of the Court,&#34; and substituting the words, &#34; Subject to this Act.&#34; The words &#34; Subject to this Act &#34; are used frequently, I notice, in <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Fletcher</inline> Moulton&#39;s latest edition of the Trade Marks Act.  1  invite the Minister to consider whether or not the use of these words is desirable in Australia? The system of government and administration in Great Britain is a unitary system ; but here we are working under a Federal system, and the use of the words &#34; Subject to this Act &#34; in our legislation, though adopted it may be somewhat lightly by the draftsman, may have in Australia an effect which we can hardly foresee. </para>

                        <para>- Yes ; but will the Minister bear in mind that, whereas in England the provision will probably be interpreted by the Court of King&#39;s Bench, in Australia it will probably be interpreted by the High Court, after six Supreme Courts have separately interpreted it? In our Trade Marks Act of 1905, we included a provision to protect those who had registered trade marks under State laws. Clause 7 of this Bill repeals section 18 of the Act, and substitutes another provision, which begins with the words - </para>

                <para class="block">Section 18 of the Act which this clause repeals excepted any trade mark which was already registered in a State under its law. Suppose, for instance, that under the Trade Marks Act oi Queensland a person had registered a trade mark thirty, or twenty, or fifteen years ago, and that it included one or other of the words contained in proposed new section 18. He could not use that trade mark if this Bill were passed. Under the Act, a trade mark of that kind is excepted from section 18. We ought, I think, to continue pre-existing rights under the system of State registration. </para>

                        <para>- My honorable friend knows that the Trade Marks Act contains a provision which enables a trade mark to be used only under certain conditions. I suggest that whatever rights or powers the original owner of a trade mark may have had by virtue of its registration under the State law should be continued to him. These rights are gradually expiring; there cannot be very many of them in existence. But, as a matter of justice, equity, and duty, we ought not to interfere with anything which has been acquired <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> under State legislation. There is another provision which perhaps will appeal to the Minister much more forcibly. Section 18 defines the things which a trade mark must not embrace. For instance, paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> provides that a registrable trade mark must not contain -  the words &#34; Trade Mark,&#34; &#34; Registered,&#34; &#34; Registered Design,&#34; &#34; Copyright,&#34; &#34; Entered at Stationers&#39; Hall,&#34; &#34; To counterfeit this is Forgery,&#34; or words to the like effect. </para>

It is a matter that might be considered in relation to clause 7 of the Bill. It is desirable that nobody&#39;s &#34;counterfeit presentment&#34; should be utilized by any tradesman without his consent. The omission of the provision from the Bill is, I think, an accidental hiatus. </para>

                    <para>. - Probably I should not have spoken on this Bill except for the very extraordinary doctrines enunciated by the Vice-President of the Executive Council in introducing it. The honorable senator commenced with a declaration that the common-sense of Parliament was quite competent, without a Court of Judges, to interpret the Constitution. When I first read that statement in his speech, I thought it must have been made in a spirit of jocularity. But when I read further on, and found the idea hammered in to the extent of occupying several inches in the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report, I came to the conclusion that the honorable senator had been putting forward a view which, from his position in the public life of the country, he would endeavour later on to give effect to. That would not have been so serious, however, except that the Vice-President of the Executive Council made the distinct affirmation that the Judges were subject, in decisions which they gave, to prejudices, conscious or unconscious; and he followed that up with the declaration that they had given an indication, where they had the misfortune to differ from himself, of interpreting the Constitution in the narrowest possible way. I should not like to misinterpret the honorable senator&#39;s position, and to show that  I  am doing him what he shrinks most from - full justice - I shall quote a few lines from the report of his speech.

He may attempt to tone down his words as much as he likes. I have quoted them, and leave them to the judgment of honorable senators as to whether they are capable of the interpretation that I have given to them. What the Vice-President of the Executive Council wants is not that this Parliament should have the right to interpret the Constitution, but that it should have the right to tear the Constitution up. He wants to free Parliament from any restraint whatever - to leave it, as is the Parliament of Great Britain, absolutely free to pass any law it likes. That is the only construction we. can place upon his remarks. </para>

                <para class="block">If that be so, then I say it means tearing up the Constitution. If we are going to leave to this Parliament the decision as to what laws it shall pass, and what laws it shall permit the States to pass, that means the deathknell of the Federal system under which we are living to-day. The honorable senator surely forgets that the Constitution itself was not the creation of this Parliament. The Federal Constitution guaranteed to the States the Constitutions under which they were living, and specifically left certain powers to them. The very essence of the Constitution lay in.  the division of those powers ; and, the division of powers having taken place, it was imperative, if we were to maintain th&#171; Federal character of our Constitution, that some body placed outside the conflicting Parliaments should be called upon to determine where one dr the other Parliament, Federal or State, broke through the barrier by which they were separated. Let us see whether this Parliament is, or can be, the proper body to deal with matters which are purely judicial. On one occasion this Parliament declared that it was not competent to deal with matters into which political prejudices might enter. I am alluding to our electoral laws. Parliament recognised that it was not the proper tribunal to decide matters as&#39; to which members might be influenced by their political views. It, therefore, called in this very Court which the Vice-President of the Executive Council states is the creature of this Parliament; because it recognised that the High Court was a better-equipped body to deal with matters in dispute than Parliament could ever hope to be. I wish to make another quotation from the honorable senator&#39;s speech, because these passages appear to me to throw a very strong light indeed upon the objects of the party opposite with regard to our Constitution. When they sought to amend the Constitution, and there was controversy with regard to their proposals, they frequently denied that they were seeking to bring about unification. In view of these remarks of the Vice-President of the Executive Council, it seems to me that that denial ought to be withdrawn. </para>

They occupy some 9 or 10 inches in the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report. Further on in his speech, the honorable senator said - i  hope the time will come when Parliament will have as much power as, and a little more than, any institution that is the creation of Parliament. No instrument of legislation in any part of the world, And no institution the creation of a Legislature should have greater power than the Legislature that brought it into existence. That is my opinion, and  i  feel sure that no honorable senator opposite will question a statement of that kind. </para>

                <para class="block">I take the opportunity of questioning it now. I say that every Federalist in Australia must question it. It is just as well that this protest should be made, and it ought to be emphasized, because we ought to recollect that, according to the Governor-General&#39;s Speech, we shall be asked very shortly to pass in review a renewed attempt on the part of this .Government to destroy what is, in the mind of every Federalist, the distinctive feature of a Federal Constitution. I do not desire to do more than emphasize this very plain and frank declaration of the Vice-President of the Executive Council, that he is seeking to destroy the High Court so far as it is the creation of the Constitution, and to remove that guardian of the rights of the States so as to place in the hands of this Parliament, as the honorable senator evidently wishes to do, full power to modify the Constitution if it pleases. To all intents and purposes, the honorable senator would be prepared to remove the Constitution as a written instrument, and to leave this Parliament and its successors absolutely free to pass any law it likes, whether or not power to pass that law is embraced within the ambit of the Constitution itself. There are sections in the Constitution which preserve to the States their distinct rights. Is it reasonable to suppose that this Parliament could adjudicate equitably between the claims of the Federal Parliament and the claims of the State Parliaments? There is only one course which can be taken if that view is once adopted, and that is the course which the honorable senator clearly has in view when he asks that this Parliament should be the sole and final arbiter of the Constitution itself. </para>

                        <para>- It is the people themselves who have, denied to Parliament the right to interpret the Constitution. It was the people themselves who declared,, and recognised more clearly than honorable senators opposite do, that only a judicial tribunal could fairly, honestly, and impartially interpret our Constitution. They, therefore, removed the interpretation of it from the fighting arena, and declared that it should be a judicial matter. That, in my judgment, is the most important of the functions which the High Court has to discharge. It has to see that the rights of the States are not trespassed upon by any Acts of a mere passing Parliament such as this. I suggest to my honorable friends opposite that if they are desirous of changing this system, they should plainly propose to amend the Constitution, and bring about Unification. </para>

I have no desire to say anything further on that point. With regard to the Bill itself, I should like to ask the Vice-President of the Executive Council a question. I am at a loss to understand whether some of its clauses are included for the purpose of bringing our law into conformity with the Imperial legislation, or whether there are not some that are quite foreign to that legislation.

                        <para>- My doubt arose from the use of the word &#34; then &#34; in the last remarks I have quoted from the honorable senator. I understand him now to say that the amendments proposed, which are generally entitled to be approved of by trie Senate, and other amendments of the existing law made by this Bill, are designed with a view to bring our legislation into conformity with that of the Imperial Parliament. I attach a good deal of importance to this, because we must recognise, when science is doing so much to eliminate distance, that, with the increase of trade between Great Britain and Australia, there will be an increase of common interest in shaping our legislation, as far as possible, on similar lines. I am pleased, therefore, to have the assurance of the Minister that the principle amendments of the existing law proposed by this Bill are designed with that end in view. </para>

                    SYMON (South Australia)  &#91;8.15&#93;.  - So far as the Bill itself is concerned,  1  do not think that it requires very much discussion on the second reading, though it may require some analysis, criticism, and improvement when we deal with it in Committee. I hope that there will be no delay in the measure becoming law in its most effective form. The intention is to bring our trade marks law into conformity with the trade marks law as it exists in the &#39; United Kingdom, and1 has been finally established by the Imperial Act of Parliament passed last year. The Bill is not very important in respect of what it proposes to enact, but it. is significant in what it proposes to repeal.  It is the repealing part of it that has given rise to the discussion which, I think, not been irrelevant, but peculiarly relevant to the measure: lt is proposed in this Bill to repeal the whole of Part VII. of the principal Act relating to workers&#39; trade marks, including the sections from section 74 to section 77, dealing with what is known as: the union label. That is significant in this way : When the Bill of 1905 was passing through Parliament, there was a strong body of opinion that the provisions for the union trade mark would be found to be
                    <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires</inline>
                    of the Constitution. Naturally,, at the very earliest possible moment, it. was decided to test the matter by appeal to the tribunal which exists in this Federal community for the purpose of determining questions of that kind. We may, or may not, have founded the Constitution on right lines. But we have adopted certain lines, and the people of this country, and not this Parliament, delegated to a disinterested and elevated tribunal the duty of determining whether we legislate within the ambit and powers of the Constitution, or exceed them. At the earliest possible moment, the question of the constitutionality of the union trade mark was brought under the notice of the High Court of Australia for determination. That was the proper course to take. When the Government sought to enforce the law with regard to combines, they had recourse to exactly the same tribunal. Why should they seek to cast reflections upon it in connexion with one ca&#39;se, when the decision of the Court was not to their liking, and applaud it in another in which they got a decision iii their favour? The remarkable thing is that a decision having been given, and the union trade mark provisions declared to be beyond the constitutional powers of the Parliament, though it was quite unnecessary, the Government now bring down a Bill to de- clare that that was a righteous and just decision by repealing the obnoxious provisions -in the sense that they are opposed to our powers - which .we included in the Act of 1905. That is what we are asked to do by the repealing clauses of this Bill. We are asked to declare that the decision of the High Court which is being criticised  -  I will not say maligned - is a proper decision . and one which this Parliament is bound under the Constitution to recognise r.y wiping the provisions objected to out of the existing Act. That is the situation, and it is because of it that this discussion upon the High Court arose, which otherwise would be hopelessly irrelevant to this Bill. It does arise under the repealing clauses of the Bill, and the Vice-President of the Executive Council was not going beyond what he might fairly submit to the Senate when, in order to save the face of. his party, he said, while advocating the repeal of certain sections of the existing Act, he deprecated the decision which made it inevitable that they should be repealed. I do not know that I should have risen to say anything after the forceful remarks which have already been made on the point, but I think that some of the criticisms of the Vice-President of the Executive Council in the passages quoted from his speech, and some which he made by way of interjection when

                    was speaking, show a most appalling - I will not say ignorance, because that would not be proper or courteous -but a most appalling misconception of the Constitution under which this country is at present governed. We are, of course, entitled to disagree with decisions of the High Court if we please. We may criticise them fairly and honestly, but we are not entitled to say that the High Court of Australia is created by, or is the creature of, the Parliament. It is nothing of the kind. Our Federal Constitution itself creates three coordinate bodies. One is the Parliament, another is the Executive Government, and the third is the Judiciary. These three are absolutely co-ordinate within their respective spheres.

There is a mandate in the Constitution to &#34;create an Inter-State Commission under the commerce sections ; but it is expressed in totally different language,&#39; and from a totally different motive and intent, from those which govern the three constituent elements of the governing body of the country. The High Court is not superior to Parliament, nor is Parliament superior to the High Court. It must he understood that they are co-ordinate - coequal within the limits of their respective powers. It is a gross reflection, not upon the Judiciary, but upon the people of this country, to say that they intended that the High Court which they established by the Constitution should be regarded as a creature, something held in the hollow of the hand of the Parliament which they also created.

                        <para>-The Executive is co-ordinate with the Parliament within its particular sphere, but under our system of responsible government, the <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> of the Executive is not independent of the Parliament. The Executive Government, as a part of the supreme machinery of Government is co-ordinate with Parliament. I think it is desirable that, at the earliest opportunity, these misconceptions should be removed. If we wish to change the Constitution, let us do so in a proper way. If we are going to plunge into the unified system of the United Kingdom, -we shall be dealing with a very large question, which should not be dealt with in this way. So long as we continue under our present Constitution, Ministers, above all others, should pay proper respect to every element of it. The position will be better understood if we consider for a moment the position of the United States of America. I mention this because <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> was good enough to direct special attention to it. The Executive Government in the United States of America is entirely independent of Congress. Our system of Federal union follows, as closely as possible, the Federal system of the United States of America in preference to that of Canada, which was thought not to be so satisfactory a Federal system, with only this difference in regard to the Executive, that we ha.ve tried to fit the British system of responsible government into the American Federal system. That is the whole situation. I, therefore, hope that the Vice-President of the Executive Council will withdraw his remarks about the High Court being the creature or creation of Parliament, that the creator ought to have larger powers than the creature, and all that sort of rubbish. It is rubbish, and no other1 word will properly describe it. </para>

                        <para>- I do not forget that point. This power of removal shows exactly what the position was, and the only power which we, as a Parliament, had under the Constitution was to say how many Judges the High Court should consist of in the first instance, and what the remuneration and the procedure should be. The High Court is just as much and as solidly one of the fundamental elements of the Constitution as is Parliament itself. The three bodies which I have enumerated are under our Federal system co-ordinate each within its own&#39; sphere, namely, the Parliament to legislate,&#39; the Executive Government to carry into effect, and the Judiciary to decide. The concern - if I may use that expression of a great instrument of government - cannot go on if any one of the three disappears. The judicial power of the Commonwealth, which is vested in the High Court, exists irrespective of that tribunal, and it was the judicial power of the Commonwealth, by whomsoever exercised, which arrived at the decision under which these provisions are to be repealed. Honorable senators who were here in 1902 will remember that, pending the passing of the Judiciary Act, which could not be dealt with in the first session, we were obliged to pass a Claims Against the Commonwealth Act, to vest the judicial power of the Commonwealth temporarily - for twelve months, I think - in the Supreme Courts of the States to enable such claims to be determined. If there were such claims brought before the Supreme Courts of the States during that period, and they involved any constitutional question in connexion with the laws we had passed, those Courts would have had to decide the questions just as the High Court has decided the question of the union, label and several other matters. That is all that need be said as regards the basis on which these provisions of the Trade </para>

Whilst I should be the very last to say that in a free country we are not entitled to offer criticisms, or to hold our own opinions with regard to judgments that may be given on constitutional or other matters by the High Court, or other tribunal, still there are limits to the exercise of that right; and if I may say so, with all possible good feeling, and appreciation of the difficulties in which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> found himself in seeking to ask the Senate to pass a Bill giving effect to a judgment of the High Court. I venture to think that he did overstep &#34;the limits, certainly in the quotations which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> read. The conventions of public life hold that criticisms and animadversions upon judgments pronounced by the constituted Courts, such as some of those which I am sure were inadvertently made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> ought not to be made on the floor of the Senate, unless, of course, in moving for the removal of the Judges. </para>

So long as the Federal system exists, that is the only tribunal which can possibly determine a question of that kind. We are doing right, it seems to me, to recognise that position by passing the Bill in this form. </para>

                    <para>. - In moving the second reading of the Bill the Vice-President of the Executive Council made some remarks which were, I thought, irrelevant and uncalled for, and which led me to make one or two interjections. Their nature and purpose were fully revealed at the time, and have now been fully criticised and exposed for the benefit of this Parliament and the people .of Australia. I wish to state my reasons for pointedly drawing the attention of the Senate to the irrelevancy and the dangerous nature of the Minister&#39;s introductory remarks. I remember that, in 1910, when a Bill was brought in here to amend the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, I drew the attention of the Government to the nature of a clause comprising about a line and a-half. They treated my remarks with a certain amount of contempt. I took a course of action, supported, I think, by every honorable member on this side, and, in consequence of that, the debate was sustained until 2 or 3 o&#39;clock in the morning. I took that step in order that the Government of the day should be careful in future about the constitutional nature of any amendments which they submitted. Late last session a Bill of two clauses was brought here to amend the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. One of them would strike those who had carefully followed the decision of the High Court as being brimful of debatable constitutional points, but the other clause, occupying a line and a-half, struck me at once as being palpably unconstitutional. In a very brief speech I drew attention to this apparently innocent clause, and again my criticism was unheeded. The point to which I then drew the attention of the Government has recently been raised in the High Court. Counsel for the appellant drew attention to this very provision of the last amending measure, and it was,- I believe, without argument, and almost unanimously, ruled out as unconstitutional. It therefore becomes necessary for those who are familiar with the Constitution to closely and carefully watch amending  Bills: It was&#39; with a recollection, of these two remarkable instances, and of my criticisms -on .the amending Bills, that I at once drew attention to the apparent irrelevancy and danger of the remarks which the Minister made in introducing this Bill. It seemed to me that in almost a surreptitious way this Bill might contain some provision which would follow and be on all-fours with amendments which have been distinctly ruled by the High Court to be unconstitutional, and which the Government must have known to be absolutely unconstitutional when they submitted them to the Senate. That is why I made the interjections I did. This Bill, so far from attempting to do anything unconstitutional, repeals several of the provisions which were declared by the High Court to be unconstitutional. From that point of view, 1 think we may hail the measure with satisfaction, because it will, not only be constitutional, but will bring our legislation into line with Imperial legislation. I have as much pleasure in saying that as I had reluctance and regret in interjecting when the Vice-President of the Executive Council was making his irrelevant remarks. </para>

                        <para>- If I chose to take advantage of that interjection, I could raise some other questions. I do not say that what I said there was gospel, or was all that I ought to have said or done, but this is neither the time nor the place for me to defend it, nor for the honorable senator to make an interjection of that kind. One other remark which I should like to make is this: The. Vice-President of the Executive Council has assured us that the amendments made in the law by this Bill are intended to bring our legislation into conformity with a new Act passed by the Imperial Parliament. I believe we may take that to be the intention. But when measures of this kind ;are brought before the Senate, I think we ought to be furnished with references to- tile legislation upon which they are modelled. If the amendments in the law made by this Bill follow die course of Imperial legislation, references to that legislation ought to be cited. I will conclude with a few words about a remark that has been made concerning the High Court. It is quite true that Parliament may possibly be able to remove a Judge on a cause proved to the satisfaction* df both Houses. But that does not involve the proposition that this  Parlia-ment  has any direct control over the High Court. The High Court is part of the Constitution. It is as much the creature of the Constitution as this Parliament is. It is equally true that every piece of legislation which we frame .is subject to the Constitution, which must be interpreted by the High Court. </para>

                        <para>- I believe that there was a good deal of make-believe in connexion with the very wordy objections raised on the Opposition benches. I still maintain that I, in common with every other honorable senator here, have a perfect right to express an opinion, not only as to the actions of the High Court, but as to any other Court in this country. As long as we are prepared to abide by the law we are fulfilling our obligations in carrying out the Constitution. It has been said by some of the learned gentlemen here that I have made statements of which I ought to be ashamed. Well, I have never said anything here or elsewhere that I have need to feel ashamed of. As to the High Court&#39;s interpretation of the workers&#39; trade marks provision, I may say this : Even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating,</inline> who is a believer in the Constitution and the High Court, admitted that five men just as independent, just as upright, just as intelligent, and with just as good intentions as the present occupants of the High Court Bench, might come to a different decision. That is all that I said. I argue that it would have been quite possible for other Judges to &#39;come to a different decision. As for opinions being influenced by the political or other conditions under which one is brought up, I have to say that there is no Judge, either of the High Court or of any other Court, who is less human than the rest of the community, and Judges are influenced in just the same way as are other people. </para>

I think that the Executive Council, in making all appointments, does the very best it can in the interests of the community, and that was all that was done in the appointment of those gentlemen who declared the workers&#39; trade mark to be <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires.</inline><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> was very anxious to know why we were confirming the decision .of the High Court hy proposing to repeal the workers&#39; trade mark sections of the principal Act. If the honorable senator had been present when j made my second- reading speech, or if he had read what I said, he would have understood the reason that has actuated the Government, and the reason which I had in my mind. Honorable senators know very well the consequences that have followed from certain decisions which have been given. A notable instance was in connexion with the Seamen&#39;s Compensation Act. A certain section was declared &#39;not separable,&#34; and rendered the whole Act <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires.</inline> &#39; Why should we leave anything in  our trade marks legislation that would give any future Court the right to say that it was <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires &#165;</inline></para>

Some of the most prominent politicians in Australia have assisted in putting things in Commonwealth Acts of Parliament which have afterwards been declared by the High . Court to be <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires.</inline> . Would men like the late C. C. Kingston, or the present <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Isaacs, or <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> have put things into Acts of Parliament which have since been held to be unconstitutional, had they not been of opinion that they were constitutional provisions?

                    <para>. - The original section, 47, provides that when an application for registration has been accepted, and has not been opposed, and the time for opposition has expired, or when an application has been opposed, and has been granted, the Registrar shall register the trade mark. The amendment now sought to be made is that the Registrar, &#34; unless otherwise prescribed&#39; by the regulations,&#34; shall register the trade mark. I take it that the reason for the amendment is that the Registrar has been hampered in giving effect to registration by the Act: as it stood, and that this is intended to give him full facilities under regulations to be framed. If that be so, I have no serious objection to raise, except that many honorable senators are somewhat dubious about the growing evil of legislation by regulation. The clause as I understand it is intended to give the Registrar further powers than he had before. Possibly it may be defended on the ground that patents and trade marks are of a highly technical nature, and that our responsible officers must be trusted to exercise a large amount of discretion. But I should like to have some reason for this further enlargement of the powers of the Registrar under the circumstances mentioned. </para>

I am glad to find him agreeing with what is attempted to be done. Under ordinary circumstances the Registrar is bound to register an application. Circumstances might arise in which it would be inadvisable to register, and it is only right, as has been found in Great Britain, that some discretionary power should be placed in the hands of the Registrar. That can only be provided for by regulation, and I can assure the honorable senator that all this is done in the interests of the public. </para>

                        <para>. - I have known <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Marks</inline> for a long time. I think it is scarcely proper for an honorable senator to use the Senate to attack a man in any way, especially a man who cannot answer for himself, and in respect of a matter with which the Parliament is not concerned. In point of character and ability, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Marks</inline> is above reproach. No person who has come in contact with him as a citizen, apart from his position as&#39; an officer of a political association - neither friend nor enemy - could take exception to his integrity, his ability. and his honour. Though we may differ here in regard to our opinions, I think we should always try to be fair just, and. impartial when we are making: comments on a. private individual. If it be . a fault to be connected with a political organization on the other side, then <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Marks</inline> isguilty of that fault ; but in every other respect I&#39; do not know of any gentleman of my acquaintance of whom, apart from politics, I have a higher opinion. I believe that everybody, friend or foe politically, who has come in contact with hims has the same opinion of him, personally anyway. </para>

                            <para>-  I could have gone very . much farther . than that if I had chosen, because  1  could have pointed out, in reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,-</inline> that this Government, immediately after they came into office, appointed some men belonging to the party on the opposite side, and who had been defeated candidates at the election, to positions in the Public Service of the Commonwealth, and that  we  had never heard a complaint from them about the ap1 pointments. In the course of my remarks, T instanced one man for whom, I believe) <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger has taken up the cudgels to-night, and that was the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Marks,</inline> who was appointed by the Government as area officer in Townsville. Face to face with the Minister who made the apjiointment, I say that a more improper appointment was never made. Everybody knows that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Marks</inline> was, as I accurately described him, a political parasite of the purest kind. </para>

                            <para>- What is the use ot appointing <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Marks</inline> an area officer in &#34;Townsville? The majority of the townspeople are Labour supporters, who will have to send their boys to be drilled and&#39;  ordered about by this man, for whom every one in Townsville has absolute contempt. The men up there rightly complained to me that they should not he subjected to such humiliation &#39; by&#39; a Labour Minister- of Defence, and I quite  agree  with them. I -did not say a word against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Marks</inline> which is not known to everybody in Townsville - in fact, in Queensland - and- that is that he was a mere hanger-on of the political party with which he was associated.I do not believe that he holds any political opinions, but. his servility., made him hang on to the party, which he thought bad most to give him. He was a two-penny-half-penny commission agent and a political parasite, who became secretary of and. organizer for the political so-called National Association. &#39; &#39; I am satisfied that, at any time I -wanted him&#39;, I could purchase, him and his political opinions for a few pounds. </para>
