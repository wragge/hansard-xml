                            GOULD (New South Wales) &#91;10.37.&#93;.- I noticed that in his opening speech, the Vice-President of the Executive Council alluded very strongly to a particular inquiry which is being proceeded with under the Royal Commissions Act, and. that to a very great extent he built up his case in favour of this Bill on the history of that Commission. It is just as well, I think, to consider, first, whether, on a broad and general principle, there is any necessity to amend the law. I am one of those who do not underrate the great value of the power to appoint a Royal Commission to get information, because it is only fair and reasonable that both Ministers and members of the Senate should be acquainted with all the circumstances concerning a matter with which they are called upon to deal. At the same time we should be very careful not to unduly or unfairly intrude upon private concerns and matters which really do not affect policy and the administration of Acts. We ate aware that the power of appointing a Royal Commission to inquire into any public matter is one of the prerogatives of the Crown. In the Old Country this prerogative is never exercised by the Crown except upon the recommendation of responsible advisers, the theory being that the King speaks through his responsible Ministers and acts upon their advice. It is impossible to conceive of it being exercised otherwise. With regard to a recent, inquiry in the Commonwealth, I believe that exception was taken to the validity of the Royal Commission. The matter has been inquired into, and the Court has held that the Commission is valid and effective, and until steps are taken by the people who questioned its validity to have the point tested in the High Court, that must be accepted as an authoritative decision, and not as a warrant to induce us to legislate on this subject. I as a member of the Senate am prepared, not only to recognise the great value of Royal Commissions and the information which they may obtain, but also to assist, so far as I possibly- can, in seeing that such inquiries are made full and complete. At the same time I am not prepared to give a vote which would authorize the appointment of a Commission to deal with any subject unless it is a matter of public importance. At first I felt very much inclined to raise the question as to whether, under the Constitution, the Governor-General had the right to appoint a Royal Commission to inquire into any matters other than those which are comprised within our legislative powers. And even now I feel very grave misgivings as to how far it is right or proper for the Parliament to attempt to go beyond those powers. I recognise, however, that some honorable senators might desire to make certain changes in the Constitution - it Ls a bare possibility that even the present Government might desire to obtain more power for the Parliament than it has - and that, therefore, they might wish to obtain evidence and information in order to be fully primed with the reasons and the necessities for obtaining an amendment of the Constitution. I realize that it would probably be within the competency of this Parliament to request that a Royal Commission be appointed to inquire into matters of that character so long as they are of sufficient importance, and, as I said, so long as they do not trench upon the liberty of the subject except where public interests were involved. One of the strongest sources of safety for the people of the community is to let them understand that while they are engaged in lawful avocations and carry them on within the letter of the law they will be allowed to pursue their own way uninterruptedly and without interference on the part of the Crown or any individual. I am afraid that in the proposed amendments of the Royal Commissions Act that principle has not been recognised to the extent to which it should have been. The moment we get away from that broad principle we enter upon very delicate ground. I take, it, and I think it is clear, that liberty consists in the right of a man to do whatever he may think fit so long as he does not improperly interfere with others in the pursuit of their avocations. I, of course, recognise that when two or three men are employed in one kind of business it is legitimate for each to do the best he can to attract the whole of the trade to his store or warehouse, so long as he does not act unfairly, or unjustly, or go outside the limits of the law.

                        <para>- The honorable . senator is making a very unfair and improper interjection. We have the opportunity if we see fit, and. we have exercised it, to deal with any unfair trade manipulation by which the public may be fleeced by trusts or combines. But we must bear in mind that one of the greatest privileges of the British people is the opportunity to exercise their rights to the fullest extent within the limits of reason and fair play. It would be extraordinary at this stage of the history of the world to say that a man should not be permitted to use his best efforts to promote his own prosperity and the interests of those who belong to him. I could understand objections to these views from honorable senators who profess to be anxious to see a state of affairs in which the Government will conduct every industry in the country, and the people occupy positions merely as managers and workers. But that is not the stale of affairs with which we are called upon to deal to-day. We have no right to place undue powers of punishment in the hands of any persons who may be members of a Royal Commission. Some persons have said that we should give Royal Commissions the same powers as we give to Judges of the High Court. I entirely dissent from such a proposition. A Justice of the High Court devotes the whole of his time to his work, and before he takes his seat on the High Court Bench must pledge himself by oath to do justice to all men and to show no partiality or bias. </para>

                        <para>- And he is a trained man.  His  work on the Bench is his life&#39;s work, and it is his sworn duty to deal with all matters that come before him impartially. He takes no notice of generally expressed opinion, but begins the hearing of a case without any preconceived ideas concerning it, and assumes that both parties are equally actuated by a desire for justice. The case is very different with a Royal Commission. We have to consider first of all what brings about its appointment. We know that the Sugar Commission was brought into existence as the result of an agitation by a great many people who, without knowing anything of the sugar industry, believed that certain abuses were being committed which could only be discovered by an inquiry by a Royal Commission. How was the Commission appointed ? I do not say that the members of it were given* private instructions. They were instructed under the letters patent of their appointment to inquire generally into the sugar industry, and bring up a report. I put on one side for the moment the gentleman who was placed at the head of the Commission, as I may have something to say about him later on&#93; but we know that the other members of the Commission hold certain opinions which, in the minds cf many of the public, make this a partisan Commission. I think that, with one exception, they are men of one mind, and naturally the trend of their investigations will be to substantiate their preconceived ideas, and to justify a report that an improper use has been made of powers secured by industry and the expenditure  of considerable money in a particular business. </para>

                            should not become excited. That will not help him, nor will it make me refrain from saying a single word I intended to say. If the honorable senator were appointed a member of a Royal Commission to inquire into a matter upon&#39; which he held very strong views, it might be said, without imputing any dishonest intention whatever to him, that he would feel that it was his business in conducting the inquiry to prove the truth of the opinions which he so strongly held. That is one pf the dangers which arise in connexion with the appointment of a Select Committee to inquire into the case of an individual. The member of Parliament asking for such a Committee generally secures the appointment to it of other members who sympathize with the view he takes of the matter.

                        <para>- I would not. Any one who takes the trouble to read the evidence taken by the Sugar Commission will admit that the tendency of the examination of witnesses was in one direction. It was in the direction of a particular finding by the Commission. When an inquiry is conducted by men holding certain views, we may expect to find those views represented in their inquiry. That is only human nature, and the members of the Sugar Commission are human, just as are the members of any other Commission. Usually, the members of a Royal Commission are not in the position of a Judge, whose training has enabled him to take a judicial and impartial view of all matters which are brought before him. I may be told that the  President  of the Sugar Commission is the Judge of a Supreme Court. I said that I would probably have something more to say about him ; and it will be admitted that many of the remarks which he has made show that he should not be in a position to exercise the autocratic powers proposed to be given under this Bill to the  President  or  Chairman  of a Royal Commission who is a Judge of a Supreme Court. </para>

                            in introducing the Bill, alluded to the existence of the Sugar Commission, and to the difficulty of obtaining evidence. He said that the witnesses had actually refused to attend and give evidence ; and that those who did attend desired to give evidence in a way that was not satisfactory to the Commission. The honorable senator having referred in this way to the Sugar Commission, I think that I have a right to refer to it also.

In the absence of a measure of this description the position would be very different. Had the Commission completed its inquiry, and had it submitted its report to Parliament, it would then have been competent for honorable senators not merely to criticise its finding, hut to debate the way in which that finding had been arrived at, and incidentally to discuss the conduct of the Commissioners. The  Chairman  of that body, I admit, was subjected to a certain amount of annoyance, and no doubt he felt very indignant at the action of one witness, who. instead of answering  the  questions that were put to him, insisted upon reading a statement which he had prepared, and declined to accept the Chairman&#39;s dictum that he should first give evidence. Next day the  -Chairman  of the Commission accused that witness of having told &#34; a deliberate lie,&#34; but when certain matters were subsequently placed before him he retracted the statement, and said that had he been aware of the circumstances he would not have made it..

                            <para>- Yet we are asked under this Bill to arm a gentleman possessed of such a hot temper with these plenary powers. I presume that the language of the witness whom I have quoted would be regarded by him as insulting to the Commission. The dignity of that body would be hurt because the witness made a simple reply to the Chairman&#39;s question. Are we going to say that in such circumstances the Commission should have power to send that man to gaol for a period of three months? Are we to vest autocratic powers in such a man ? If we do so we shall not be dealing fairly with the people&#39; of this country. Members have to go to the electors now and again for a renewal of their confidence ; and the latter will want to know that they are getting a square deal. </para>

                                GOULD. - In the Bill as originally introduced it was proposed to give Commissions the power to deal with contempt committed outside their hearing. But let me remind my honorable friends that the Judges are not immune from criticism - that under certain circumstances it is competent for the public to criticise their actions. To-day  I am happy to say we believe that men possess certain inherent lights of which no autocratic power should rob them. Honorable senators opposite talk of reactionaries. But who are the reactionaries? They are to be found on the opposite side of the Chamber, among the supporters of this Bill. A reactionary is a man who desires to go back to the old days when little or no freedom was permitted to the individual. When I spoke of the penalties imposed under this Bill, one honorable senator replied. &#34; If a man does not do wrong he will not he liable to those penalties.&#34; Need I point out that less than a century ago a man who stole a sheep, or even 5s., was liable to he hanged ?

                            <para>.- A century ago the reply which I have quoted might have been given with equal justification in the case of a man who stole a shilling. Rut the tendency since then has been towards mitigating the punishment for offences, whilst making that punishment more certain. In the old days the little liberty which was enjoyed was enjoyed only by a section of the community.. When we impose excessive penalties for offences we exhibit vindictiveness, but we do not render punishment more certain. </para>

                            <para>.- I know of no Sugar Trust that is in existence in this country. But if there be one, and if its operations are to the injury of the people, it is the duty of the Government to take action. I hold no brief for the Colonial Sugar Refining Company ; but I recognise that, like other companies, it started operations in a small way, and that, as the result of careful management, it has built up a big industry. All honour to such a company which can do that, so long as it does not do it at the expense of the community. </para>

                            <para>- No. I will not give a vote to nationalize any great industry, because I have less confidence in Government administration in such matters than I have in private enterprise. I do not want to be led off on to a by-track by answering questions about nationalization. The Colonial Sugar Refining Company has not attained&#34; its present position without having had to struggle in the early days of its existence. Have not nearly all those who have made money had their early struggles, and why should they be&#39; pulled down when they have become successful ? If honorable senators advocate the nationalization of this industry, I reply that we have only to look at the unsatisfactory results of nationalization in other parts of the world, and at the unsatisfactory manner in which Government enterprises are carried on in many ways. </para>

                            <para>- I admit that I was going a little bit out of the way ; but I was drawn off by the interjections of honorable senators. In legislating we must abide by broad principles, and avoid unduly interfering with the private affairs of individuals. Why is it that the Government, in giving power to Commissioners to punish witnesses for not answering questions or producing documents, have been oblivious of the necessity for protecting _ witnesses ? It may be that, in the opinion of the Government, in the present instance, the witnesses do not deserve consideration. But this Bill is not designed solely for the present case. It may operate on any individual in the community. Any honorable senator may be summoned by a Royal Commission to appear, be examined, and produce books and documents considered material to the matter under consideration. The broad principle is that, when an inquiry is ordered to be made, a person summoned is bound to answer any material question. But now it is proposed that that power is to be enlarged, and a witness is to be compelled to answer every question put to him, whether material or otherwise. We are abandoning the safe principle by striking out the word &#34; material,&#34; and making a witness subject to a penalty if he refuses to answer any question. Questions most remote from the subject of an inquiry might be put to a witness. When you omit the word &#34; material,&#34; you are entering upon the unknown, and are bound to get into difficulty and danger. The only protection given to a witness is that he has not to answer any questions with regard to any secret process of manufacture. But questions affecting his profits, his manner of conducting his business, the payments he makes to his employes, and the work they perform, have to be answered, although such questions may be absolutely remote from the subject of the inquiry. </para>

Would it be necessary, in connexion with this sugar company, to ascertain such particulars as I have indicated, in order to enable the Commission to find out whether there was an organization working injuriously to the public, or whether the company secured an undue advantage from the bounty paid by the Federal Government for the growth of cane? </para>

                            <para>- An inquiry into such particulars, held in public, would give a man&#39;s trade rivals an opportunity of finding out the particular things which enable one industry to be a success, whilst another, in the same line of business, conducted equally honestly and fairly, is, comparatively speaking, a failure. Then, again, a witness has no option under this Bill but to produce his books when they are demanded. He may say that his books do not relate to the matter of the inquiry. Nevertheless, the Commission can say,&#34; We intend to go through your books, and decide for ourselves what is material and what is not.&#34; Suppose that a trade rival happens to be the  Chairman  of the Commission? Under this Bill, he would have an opportunity of examining the books of his rival. Is it a fair thing that, an individual engaged in business should be prevented from having the particulars of his industry kept secret, unless they happen to be matters of public concern? I admit the value of Royal Commissions. I admit that they should have reasonable powers to enable them to obtain material evidence. But I decline to intrust the  President  or  Chairman  of a Royal Commission with the powers of a Judge of the High Court. Complaint is made of the long time taken to decide the case regarding the Sugar Company in Sydney recently. </para>

                            <para>- What was the cause of the delay in this case? In the first place, it was said that a witness who had been summoned ought to have been allowed to put in a statement before being examined in the ordinary way. The person primarily concerned was not allowed to adopt that course. The Commission said that he must answer the questions put to him forthwith. As to whether the action of the witness was right or not, I offer no opinion just now. </para>

I do not wish to shelter any man from the results of his actions. Whether he be a wealthy or a poor man, an influential or an uninfluential man, when he appears before a tribunal of his country, even-handed justice should be meted out to him.

                            <para>- No, and I will presently tell the honorable senator why. Complaint has been made about the long duration of the proceedings in the case in question. If this Bill had been an Act the proceedings taken before the Court would probably have been of exactly the same duration. It being the first case, many objections were raised which had to be determined. First, objection was taken to the scope of the Commission ; next as to whether there was reasonable excuse for not attending because somebody had been treated as a defendant unfairly. These matters had to be looked into. If honorable senators have read the reports of the fights that went  on  day after day, they will know that the respective counsel, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lamb</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bavin,</inline> were as much responsible for the prolongation of the proceedings as any one. Naturally they were doing their best for their clients. Eventually the proceedings came to an end. The result was that the magistrate considered that there had been no reasonable excuse, and inflicted a penalty of &#163;25 upon the defendant, who has not been called upon to give evidence since then. If he had been, and still assumed the same attitude - if he had said, &#34; I do not mind if I am fined&#163;50 every time; the Court may fine me as often as it likes &#34; - I admit that there would have been some cause for saying, &#34; We cannot stand this flouting of the authority of a body constituted under the law, and we are going to punish the individual who commits that offence drastically, in order that people may learn that they cannot do  as  they like.&#34; </para>

The statement which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knox</inline> desired to place before the Commission reviewed the history of the company, and went into full particulars, in order to enable them to deal fairly and justly with the company. The penalties provided for in this Bill are too heavy. It shows a tendency to go back to old times, and it is unjust. This is a Bill which bristles with pains and penalties. Honorable senators have not any evidence  to  justify them in saying that the law as  it  stands is insufficient to vindicate or protect the powers and rights of a Royal Commission appointed to inquire into any matter. </para>

                    <para>SenatorLt.-Colonel <inline font-weight="bold">Sir ALBERT</inline> GOULD. - It has shown its strength so far ; for, notwithstanding the vigorous and determined fight which was put up, the law has come oat of the contest triumphant. This gentleman has been adjudged by the magistrate to have committed an offence against the law, and he has been punished. If the maximum penalty had been fixed at&#163;500, he might possibly have been fined . &#163;250; but for the value or effectiveness of the fine, it is useless to make it any heavier. If the gentleman who was convicted the other day and fined <inline font-style="italic">&#163;25</inline> would not give evidence then, probably, if he had been fined&#163;250, he would not give evidence now. However much honorable senators may feel incensed against the action of the witnesses, let them  sot  do an injustice to anybody, as they pro pose to do.  1  have here an interesting extract which is taken from a work entitled <inline font-style="italic">Dictionary of Political Economy,</inline> by Palgrave.

                        <para>Everybody is interested in the impartiality of a Court, before which he may appear as defendant. But many, unfortunately, will applaud partiality in a Court where defendants belong exclusively to an unpopular class. As compared with Judges who are also jurists Judges who have had no legal discipline are less likely to deal with causes in a severely judicial spirit, to consider sufficiently the consequences of making a precedent, or to uphold that stringency of procedure which, tedious as it may seem, is the best safeguard against passion or carelessness. Hitherto the predominance of the regular Courts of Justice has protected us from most of the evils which might have been feared from Commissions armed with judicial power. But the multiplication of extraordinary tribunals and of special procedures would break down this predominance, and, with it, the old English principle of submitting to a regular Court for adjudication in the regular way, every question which can be formulated in terms of law, a principle always precious, and always difficult to maintain, but in an age of popular Government especially invaluable, and yet specially liable to be overthrown. </para>

                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">That amendment sums up many of the objections which may be taken here to the Bill. I have made this quotation to show to what extent honorable members in another place were prepared to go in opposing the measure. We should not be less direct in our opposition here. There is one matter to which I have not yet alluded. I have referred to the unfairness of giving these excessive and unprecedented powers to the  President  or  Chairman  of a Royal Commission, and to the absence  of adequate protection to witnesses. The Bill does not shield or cloak a witness with any protection at all. When a witness goes into a Court of justice, it is the duty of a magistrate to afford him a certain amount of protection, more especially if he has no one to look after his interests. But when a man goes before a Royal Commission, he may be, in many respects, ignorant. He may not know that he has any protection, but may think that as soon as the Commission utter a word he must obey them, and they may browbeat him as they please. Some protection should be given to a witness. When a Commission say to a witness, &#34; You must answer the question, whether it is material or not,&#34; they treat him very unfairly. When they say to a witness, &#34; You must produce your books, whether they appertain to the inquiry or not ; we will find out if they do,&#34; they treat him very unfairly. A refusal to answer any questions of this kind may be treated by a Judge, if he thinks fit, as a matter of contempt. If I go before a Royal Commission, a Judge may ask me a question which I recognise is not material &#34; to the matter under consideration, while it may be very material to me that I should not give an answer. If I decline to give an answer he can say, &#34; You are liable to a fine of &#163;100, or three months&#39; imprisonment.&#34; Having taken that course, he can put the same question to me again, and if I take the same attitude, he can impose the penalty. Is that a protection to a witness? Again, if a witness is prosecuted for not having produced a document, the onus of proof is thrown upon him to show that it was not material to the inquiry, and- that, therefore, he did not produce it. Should it turn out in the end that he was right in his view, he will have been very severely punished, because he will have lost his time, and probably a great deal of money, in putting up his defence. He will not be recouped for the loss of his time, or for a great portion of the money which he has spent. Simply because a witness has stood up before the Commission, and taken an honest and fair position, he is to be penalized by being subjected to heavy costs and a waste of his time. Then, if a man or a newspaper says outside that it is a partisan Commission, or makes any statement which would have a tendency to bring the Commission into contempt, the individual, or the newspaper, may be haled before a Court, and if convicted the individual is liable to a pecuniary penalty or to imprisonment, while the newspaper is liable to a pecuniary penalty ; or, if he can be got hold of, the editor may be sent to prison. This is the punishment to be inflicted where a man has made a fair and just comment on a public affair. On the platform we debate public matters and public men, and although the criticism is often very unpleasant to the individual, and frequently very unfair, still it is always regarded as being in the interests of the community that there shall be no &#34;gag&#34; placed on the mouth of any individual when he is commenting on public affairs and confining himself to that. I might comment upon an act of a Minister of the Crown in a most drastic way; but if I said that he was a thief, or ought to have been convicted as  a thief, he would have a right of action against me, and very properly so. But if I said that he had administered the affairs of the country in such an unfair and unjust way that the people were suffering, and being deprived and robbed of sustenance and power, I would be within my right of criticism. It would be for. the public to judge whether my words were worth heeding, or should, be treated as an idle breath. Our nation has been built up on the principle of freedom for the people to follow their pursuits, to express their views on public affairs and public men, with no restriction except that they should not defame a public man in his private life and affairs. If we pass this Bill, it will not do any credit to this Parliament. It will be held up to the public as an attempt to pursue one set of people with a vindictiveness that is almost criminal, and when no good reason has been shown for its enactment. If the Act had broken down, or the magistrate had said that it did not enable him to punish the witness who was charged, honorable senators might say, &#34; We are now taking such steps as we ought to take in order to make sure that the will of the people as expressed by the Commission is carried into effect.&#34; I urge honorable senators even now to try to disabuse their minds of the feeling that there is any party interest to be considered, or that a company not popular with them is being dealt with, and to do what is right between man and man by holding the scales of justice fairly and impartially. lt is necessary to make provision for a full and fair inquiry into every public matter, but the power of punishment should not be abused. Reasonable punishment, and the reprobation of the citizens of the Commonwealth, will always have a better influence than the infliction of vindictive or excessive punishment, or the placing of a particular class in the community under any special disadvantage. Since the commencement of Federation, we have had, I think, eighteen Royal Commissions appointed. I took the trouble to ascertain what we have spent upon them, and 1 find that Royal Commissions have cost us, so far, upwards of ^55,000. The Sugar Commission has cost, up to date, upwards of ,&#163;7,000, and I believe that there is a further &#163;3,000 on the Estimates to cover the probable future expenditure in connexion with that Commission, It would, in my opinion, be very much better if Ministers were to allow this Bill to stand aside, at any rate, until we know the effect of the decision given recently in respect of witnesses who have declined to give evidence. If we find that witnesses are still recalcitrant, and refuse to obey the law, it will be time enough then to provide these drastic powers to compel &#39;their obedience. We might then proceed with a measure such as this, but we should, even then, take care that the questions put to witnesses by members of a Royal Commission, and the documents demanded, shall in every case be material to the issue under consideration. We should thus be protecting the interests of the public at large, whilst recognising the right of every man, to the utmost freedom within the limits of the law, to pursue his own avocation as he pleases. We should be careful also to enact no provision intended to penalize the press or persons who venture to say &#62;a word derogatory to the Royal Commission. We should be able to justify the passing of such a measure as I suggest. Honorable senators opposite would be wise if they declined to give the Opposition the opportunity to contend that the present Government are supported by people who do not like criticism, and are always impatient under it. We should not prevent the press from making public what really takes place. The Government have recently initiated a policy the tendency of which is to gag the press, which has always been regarded as one of the most potent instruments for securing and retaining the liberties of the people. To say that affairs shall be conducted <inline font-style="italic">in camera</inline> or in the presence of only a few people, and shall not be subject to criticism, or be brought under the notice of the public, is to undermine the liberties and rights of our citizens, and to reduce them from the position of free men to that of serfs. It is wrong for the Government to propose a measure to punish people who do not agree with them in opinion, if not by fine or imprisonment, at any rate, by interference with their business and ordinary avocations. </para>

                        <para>.  - We have heard this morning some unfortunate statements with regard to the operations of trusts and combines, and certain accusations, chiefly by way of interjection, against certain members of the Senate that they hold briefs for trusts and combines. Although I do not think that I shall be accused of that, I intend to offer some criticism upon this Bill. The Government are adding some drastic provisions to  our criminal code, and proposing penalties which, so far as I am aware, are not provided for in any measure dealing with Royal Commissions in any other part of the world. I do not wish to lay too much stress upon that, but I do think it is most important to point out that the Government are making it possible for this legislation to be administered by persons who are wholly unfit to administer it. My chief criticism of the Bill is not so much as to what it contains as it is to the wide opportunities it affords to men who are utterly unfit to give effect to its provisions. Clause 3 says that a Royal Commission may be issued to any one, and we know that it may he formed of members of Parliament. It is a matter of common history that members of Parliament who have been appointed as a Select Committee have subsequently been constituted members of a Royal Commission, because the Select Committee has been unable to conclude its work before the end of a session. It will still be possible to follow that practice. I do not hesitate to say that if such a thing should occur again while this measure remains unrepealed, the effect must be disastrous to the administration of justice by this form of court. The tendency which has been exhibited in the Federal Parliament to create various courts and tribunals invested with powers is one which honorable senators on both sides would do well to carefully consider, and which, from my point of view, we should check. By way of illustration, I ask what have we done in connexion with the Conciliation and Arbitration Court? We call it a court, but it is not a court at all. It does not exercise the functions of a court, but it does exercise the functions that we are accustomed to exercise in Parliament, and which only Parliament should exercise. In that case, we have used&#39; the name of a court to designate a body consisting of only one man, that is exercising parliamentary functions. In this Bill, the exactly opposite course is proposed. Under it, one or three members of Parliament may be constituted a Royal Commission, and we practically turn those members of Parliament into a court. That is exactly the reverse of the course we have followed in connexion with the Conciliation and Arbitration Court. I think that it is a serious and vital mistake to take either of these courses. If we intend to give to Royal Commissions the powers provided for in this Bill, it is absolutely incumbent upon us to limit the persons who may be appointed to Commissions to men trained to carry out the duties which will have to be performed. It is quite wrong to expect that we can, from this Parliament, or from any body of ordinary persons, appoint members of a &#39;Commission competent to administer this measure as it ought to be administered. However, the Government are prepared to do that. The penalties provided for are severe, but what I fear most is that the power to impose them will be placed in the hands of men who are not competent to decide the full value of the evidence, or the extent to which offences under this Bill have been committed. Something has been said about impugning the honesty of members of Royal Commissions, but it is not a question of honesty at all. It is a question of fitness, of habit, of thought, perhaps, more than anything else, and that is a matter of training. All these qualities should be demanded of any men who may be appointed to a Royal Commission under this Bill. The Bill leaves it open to Parliament or the Government to appoint any men to carry out duties which should be carried out by men possessing special knowledge. I do not wish to refer to the work of the Sugar Commission, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> this morning read some statements :by the  President  of that Commission, and I say that no one could hear them read without feeling great regret that the gentleman who made them should preside over the deliberations of a Royal &#39;Commission. I do not care to make accusations against any one because I am a member of this Parliament and he may be somewhere else. But, without pursuing the subject much further, I say that the reading of these remarks by the  President  of the Sugar Commission should be sufficient to induce us to hesitate and consider seriously the risks we shall run in granting powers such as are provided for in this Bill to persons who may be appointed members of a Royal Commission. We must remember that it is a very difficult matter to remove any member of a Commission after he has been appointed. But. in view of the provisions of this Bill, we are bound to consider the possibility of removing men from Royal Commissions and the extreme latitude given to the Executive to appoint them. Whilst the Bill is repugnant to me in many ways because of its drastic provisions, I say that it could only he made acceptable hy limiting the persons who may be appointed as members of Royal Commissions. I could welcome the measure, and believe that it would be of infinitely more use to Australia, if such a limitation were provided for. I do not hesitate to say that the only persons to whom Royal Commissions should issue under this Bill are Judges of the Supreme Courts of the States or of the High Court.  I  should not intrust the powers of this Bill to persons below that standard.  I  suppose the Bill will pass, and that Royal Commissions will be appointed in future, possibly, consisting wholly of members of Parliament. I wonder which member of the Senate, whether a trained lawyer or not, would accept the enormous responsibility which would be imposed upon him in conducting an inquiry under the provisions of such a Bill as this.  1  say, unhesitatingly, that nothing would induce me to accept a position on a Royal Commission under this Bill. We may have Judges in embryo in the Senate, but, until a man had proved himself on the Bench, I should feel that he was not fitted to administer this measure, and that no member of the Senate could, with self-respect, accept a position in which he would be compelled to do so.  1  do not wish to debate the Bill further.  I  feel very strongly that it_ will give rise to a great deal of irritation and a rankling sense of injustice. It will produce that sense of injustice, though the Commissioners themselves may be just. I do not suggest that unjust men will be appointed, but Commissioners will be appointed who, notwithstanding their own strict sense of justice, will administer the Act wrongly, because it will demand from them the exercise of qualifications which they do not possess. I make no reflection upon those who have already held appointments on Royal Commissions. I was a member of a Commission which lasted two and a half years, and, with a full knowledge of what happened upon it, I say it would have been most disastrous if we had been working under this Bill. Attention would then have been strongly directed to the unwisdom of placing in the hands of ordinary persons who constitute Royal Commissions such a powerful weapon as this Bill will afford. </para>

                            <para>-Colonel CAMERON (Tasmania) &#91;12.2&#93;. - I desire to say only a word or two upon this measure. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> has put the position as clearly as it can be put, and in as unbiased a way as is possible. The Bill will place a dangerous weapon in the hands of any person who may be appointed to a Royal Commission, unless he is fully qualified to exercise the very wide powers which will be intrusted to him. That is my view of the matter, and even at this late stage I would urge upon the Government the desirableness of withdrawing the Bill. May I remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> that he will not always be in power to administer it. We may be able to trust him, but we may not be able to trust some other people. The Bill will place in the hands ot future Commissions a weapon which is an exceedingly dangerous one, and for that reason I would appeal to the Government and their supporters to think seriously over what they are doing. If once these powers be given to Royal Commissions, is it likely that they will forego their exercise? The Bill will arm those bodies with a weapon which is particularly dangerous to the poorer classes of the community, whom my honorable friends opposite profess to represent. Consequently,0 I would urge them to withdraw it. </para>

                        <para>.- A A layman does not like to follow a member of the legal profession in discussing questions of a legal character. But it seems to me that some of the objections raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> in his long deliverance, and by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> in his more moderate speech, were somewhat overdrawn. We may approach this question by asking whether it is not reasonable to assume that any Commission which may be appointed in the future will be constituted of persons possessed of common sense? I am willing to admit that a member or the  Chairman  of a Commission may, in the past, have said things which will not be upheld by the general public. We may take it for granted, however, that members of Commissions will be possessed of ordinary common sense, and that they will approach their duties with a keen appreciation of the necessity for being thoroughly impartial. </para>

                    <para>The honorable senator stated that even if the Commission wanted to probe unnecessarily into the private business of a witness, the witness possessed that safeguard. But, he added, the onus of proving the irrelevancy of the question will lie on the witness. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> then went on to say that even if the witness proved that the question was not material to the inquiry, and therefore need not be answered, he would, nevertheless, have lost his time and money, and would be without the means of obtaining redress. But I would ask whether the same disabilities do not apply to every member of the community in connexion with our criminal laws? I have in my mind the case of a man in Tasmania who, as the result of an official blunder, was placed upon his trial for murder, only two or three years ago. He was compelled to bring a number of witnesses from one end of that State to the other, and was absolutely ruined as a result of that charge. Yet he was not called &#34;upon to prove his innocence, because at the last moment the prosecution was abandoned. He has been able to secure no redress. As a proof that this is so, I may mention that in two or three successive sessions a member of the State Parliament has moved that a certain sum be granted to him to reimburse him for his out-of-pocket expenses. But the Government of that State have persistently opposed the motion. They affirm that the individual in question was the victim of a police blunder, to which any citizen is liable. Under this Bill no citizen can be placed in a worse position than he is liable to occupy under our common law. </para>

                            <para>- Eve Every honorable senator opposite knows perfectly well that there is no desire to inflict injustice upon any member of the community. The Bill is merely designed to&#39; insure that no citizen shall refuse to give evidence before a Royal Commission. I am thoroughly satisfied that when, by the swing of the pendulum, the present Government retire from office - and I do not expect them to remain in power for ever, although I believe they will remain there for a few years - no citizen will suffer injustice if this Bill is then the law of the land. Too much stress has been laid upon the prosecution of a witness in Sydney, who declined to give evidence before the Sugar Commission. It was inferred by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> that that was the only reason for the introduction of the Bill. Will honorable senators opposite say that when an Act is put into operation and found to be ineffective to do what is intended, it should not be amended? Will it be said that the present Royal Commissions Act is effective to do what is intended ? When it was put into operation, one of the witnesses absolutely flouted the Commission. Very soon after the Act began to operate, its weakness was discovered. The penalties were too small. </para>

Reading between the lines of the speeches which have been made in opposition to the Bill, and reading the articles which have been published in newspapers against it, one can see the true grounds of opposition to it. There is a strong desire on the part of some members of this Parliament, and several writers in the press, to make the powers of a Royal Commission as ineffective as they can be, or, at all events, less effective than they ought to be. </para>

                        with the feeling that he understands his subject ; but I have been much disappointed with his defence of this Bill. He started by mentioning a case in Tasmania where a man was arrested for murder. There is no comparison between that illustration and this Bill. In the first place, under this Bill a person has to prove himself inno-cent ; but a man arrested for murder has to be proved guilty. It a most notorious man happens to be  Chairman  of a Royal Commission, a witness may be threatened and bullied until he hardly knows where he is. In one recent case a man who had been examined as a witness told me that the  Chairman  of a Commission turned to him and threatened him that he must answer certain questions ; and when the man said that he knew nothing about the subject, the  Chairman  retorted, &#34;Unless you answer that question,  1  shall deal with you as far as the law gives me power.&#34; Is that the way in which a witness in the box ought to be treated? That man told me that before he left the box he would have admitted anything to get out of it. He was not an uneducated man, either. He was a clerk in a sugar mill. He said, &#34; I was never bullied and bounced so much in my life. T really did not know how to answer the question, and yet I was threatened with being sent to gaol if I did not.&#34; We do not know who may be  Chairman  of a Royal Commission. We have known a member of this Parliament to make an exhibition of himself all over the world. He would hang a man if an Act gave him power. Fancy an individual like that being  Chairman  of a Royal Commission and exercising the powers given by this Bill. It is inconceivable that in a free country such a measure should be submitted to Parliament. The Star Chamber was abolished long ago in Great Britain, but it is to be reestablished in this new country. I am surprised that honorable senators who believe in a reasonable amount of liberty being enjoyed should support a measure of this kind. Let us look at some of the provisions. Under clause 7, if a witness who has been summoned does not attend day after day until released by the  Chairman,  a warrant may be issued for his apprehension.

If the Bill provided that a reasonable amount should he tendered to a witness to cover his expenses, it would be less objectionable; but many a man is not able to put his hand into his pocket and produce &#163;10 or &#163;15 to pay his expenses. Nevertheless, a person who fails to do so may be treated a.s a criminal, and brought over under a warrant. </para>

                            <para>- Would the honorable senator like to be brought over by a policeman under a warrant? It appears to me that the object of this Bill is to give the Government <inline font-style="italic">carte blanche</inline> to do what they like. There will be such an outcry the first time the measure is put in force that the next Government that comes into power will be compelled to repeal it. In fact, I believe that honorable senators themselves will say that it should be repealed. What reason is there for this procedure? A fair number of Royal Commissions have been appointed under the Commonwealth ; but it seems that we have now reached a situation in which the powers which may be exercised under the existing Act are not sufficient for somebody. Then a Bill is brought down which is, I believe, one of the most drastic measures that have ever been presented to a House of Parliament. In times past in Venice there was a little place into which a letter was put and very soon a man disappeared off the face of the earth. At one time in Great Britain there was a Star Chamber in which persons were tried privately. For certain reasons - we have not had them all put before the Chamber - we are asked to pass this Bill. Like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe,</inline> a great many persons outside Parliament are reading between the lines, but I feel sure that they are doing so altogether differently from my honorable friend. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly. The Bill gives the most arbitrary powers to the  Chairman  of a Royal Commission, though he may be the most incompetent man on the face of God&#39;s earth. We know what men who have been members of Parliament have done in other places. Unfortunately, a man of that type might be the  Chairman  of a Royal Commission. </para>

                            <para>- I do not believe  in  Royal Commissions, especially because of the way in which they have been formed. If a Royal Commission has to be appointed, it should be composed of men outside of Parliament, and beyond parliamentary influence. If a Commission is required to inquire into a mercantile affair, surely, in the length and breadth of Australia, the Government can pick three men who have had a large experience in commerce, and nothing to do with politics. But the position is different when the Government pick men who have shown bias and party feeling, because it is hard for any man to sit in a chamber and not get imbued with bias. </para>

                            <para>- No. In this Bill we give to a layman, who may be proved later to be wrong, the power to commit a man to gaol, or to break into his house. We give these extraordinary powers to a layman who may be appointed by a political party, and who, in my opinion, is not qualified to act on a Commission. When a Royal Commission is composed of members of both Houses, and one reads the names of the Commissioners, he can safely say that the Government have taken every care that they shall have a majority on the Commission. Very often we get a report which has been carried by the majority, the minority reporting in the other way. What sort of evidence can be taken by such a body? These men know, although they are not told so in so many words, that they are expected to take up one. side. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. Every Government acts in this way. Royal Commissions stink in the nostrils of the people of Australia. No more notice is taken of them than is taken of a dog barking. The public see what is going on, and they say, &#34; Look at the Royal Commission ! Who are they ? Why, the Government have a majority there. The Royal Commission can go whatever way the Government like.&#34; </para>

I admit, however, that it may sometimes be necessary to appoint a Royal Commission to find out something with regard to commerce or our daily life. But let it be composed of men who are not known to have preconceived political opinions. </para>

He imputed a certain thing to me, and I remarked that in doing so he was low-minded. He interjected that I would appoint <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Badger</inline> to a Tramway Commission. I would do no such thing, because I do not believe in appointing Royal Commissions. It has been proved here, and in another place, that, prior to their appointment, some members of the Sugar Commission had expressed opinions in the press, and stated in public, that they were opposed to certain things. Yet they are sitting on a Commission to report on the sugar industry. </para>

                            <para>- The public have no confidence in Royal Commissions as they have been constituted. It is well known that Royal Commissions have been given to men who have never had anything to do with the industry on which they were asked to report. They could not tell one how to do the simplest thing in connexion with the industry, though they might have seen the article growing. Naturally ,the public comment, and ask &#34; What does this man know about the industry?&#34; The public want to know, when a man is appointed to a Royal Commission, that he understands the subject-matter of the inquiry. That is one of my objections to the present system of making these appointments. Of what use would it be to ask a man who has been mining, or bullock-driving, or following some other occupation all his life, to report on the sugar, or arrowroot, or other highly technical industry, which a farmer has to learn by experience how to carry on. Of what use, for instance, would it be to put me on a Royal Commission to go out west and to report on cattle-breeding or sheep-breeding, and what is the best system to adopt for that country? </para>

                            <para>- I shall draw my remarks to a close by saying that such a Bill as this is not called for. If the public had a voice in the matter I am sure that they would repudiate it. I know as well as that I am standing here that the Bill will be carried, &#39;but I hope that when the people hear what has been said about it, and see, as they probably will, extracts from the Bill published in the press, they will be wise enough to say that any Government that could introduce a Bill of this nature is not worthy to occupy the Treasury benches. Next year the people will have a chance to say that. All that we can do on this side is to do our best to prevent the measure finding a place on the statute-book. When it does reach the statute-book, I hope that before very long the people will say that it must be removed, because it is a disgrace to the fair name of Australia. </para>

                            <para>- Let us consider what really happened at the meetings of the Commission. Officials of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company were given four months&#39; notice of questions they were to be asked. The Commission held a sitting in May, and the first question put to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knox</inline> was : &#34; Are you  Chairman  of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company?&#34; Instead of answering the question, the wit-, ness proceeded to read a statement. The  Chairman  of the Commission then remarked in the most gentlemanly way that at that stage of the proceedings the witness should not read a statement, but that if he had any facts or any statement to submit after he had given his evidence in the ordinary way, the Judge would take it, as he had done in other cases, and if it were admissible would have it placed before the members of the Commission. The  Chairman  of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company was again asked a question, and instead of answering, persisted in reading his statement. As he continued to do so, and persisted in his unruly and ungentlemanly conduct, the  Chairman  adjourned the meeting of the Commission. When the Commission met on the following day, and the  Chairman  took his seat, be had before him a letter in which there was a misstatement of fact. In reading the letter he characterized this misstatement of facts in plain langauge as a deliberate lie. There was no bullying and bouncing of a witness in connexion with the matter. I can support this statement by a quotation from the report of the proceedings of the Commission which appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald.</inline></para>

                            <para>- The only extent to which the Judge admitted that he was wrong was that, although he held that the statement was still a deliberate lie, he recognised that the  Chairman  of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company was not aware that it was a deliberate lie when he wrote it. In my opinion, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Gordon was justified in describing the statement in plain language as a deliberate lie. When I have read a quotation from the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> I shall expect <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> to recognise that he. is doing an unfair and an unmanly thing in trying to twist the report of what occurred at the meeting of the Commission in the way he is doing. The <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> report, of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Gordon&#39;s remarks is this -  &#34; I desire to explain that at every sitting of the Commission - after I excluded <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mitchell,</inline> a gentleman learned in the law, has been attended by a bevy of gentlemen representing the C. S. R. Co.&#34; -  His  Honor mentioned Messrs. Braund (solicitor), Smith (a- chemical expert), and two shorthand writers--&#34; These were at each place where the Commission sat where there was a company&#39;s mill augmented by the manager of the mill.&#34; </para>

As the reports of the proceedings in the Sydney press clearly show the  Chairman  of that body merely characterized a statement which was contained in a letter forwarded by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knox</inline> as a deliberate lie. I now propose to read what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Gordon said when the Commission resumed its sittings a few days afterwards. </para>

                        <para>Before we proceed to the business of the Commission this morning I desire to make a few observations. At the last meeting of the Commission, held on the 2nd instant, and at the very moment of my taking the chair, I was handed a letter from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knox,</inline> the general manager of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company; which gave a number of reasons for his disobeying a summons to attend before this Commission. Among these was the statement that at the outset - that means at the outset of the Commission&#39;s labours - the  Chairman  refused to carry out an arrangement he had authorized for the reporters to supply us with their transcript. In my not unnatural indignation <inline font-style="italic">at</inline> this unfounded charge being launched against me thus publicly and suddenly in respect of an incident which happened in November last year, and as to which no complaint had ever been made to me, I characterized it in terms which I now withdraw, and for which I express regret. I do so because since the meeting referred to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knox</inline> has published two statutory declarations, made by officers of his company, from which it would appear that he believed that he had grounds for his accusations. Therefore, assuming that belief, it cannot fairly be said that he deliberately intended to make an untrue statement. But I cannot, in justice to myself and to the Commission, leave the matter there, because, whatever <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knox&#39;s</inline> belief may have been, the charge was baseless. </para>

They will use all the opportunities which present themselves to justify their positions as the representatives of the big trusts, the big combines, and the big monopolies of this country. To begin with, we have the most offensive statement of the Leader of the Opposition regarding the  Chairman  of the Commission&#39;. We also have the usual charge of bias levelled against the other members of that body. If we are to accept the statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers,</inline> we have already arrived at the position that when any outsider is appointed to any prominent office by the present Government, he must necessarily be biased. What more vindictive bias could be exhibited by honorable senators opposite than has been evidenced during this debate? The  Chairman  of the Commission, upon reading in a letter an unfounded statement characterized it as a deliberate lie. But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> declared that he called the witness a &#34; deliberate liar.&#34; </para>

                            <para>- Personally I am only familiar with the press reports of the proceedings of this particular case. But I have no hesitation in saying that a man who could prefer a charge of bullying against the  Chairman  of that Commission is not very careful of his own reputation for truthfulness. The whole desire of the  Chairman  of that, body was to be as obliging as he could to the witnesses who came before him. The very questions which this great concern, the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, was called upon to answer were placed in the hands of its representatives months before. They had opportunities of preparing their answers. No question affecting the business of the company was sprung upon them suddenly. The question which the first witness refused to answer was, &#34; Are you the  Chairman  of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company?&#34; </para>

                            <para>- Exactly ; but this illustrates the methods of these rich companies. On a simple question they have held up the work of the Commission for three months. Surely it was a natural question to be put to the witness. It is a question such as must be put to any witness. Then, again, the case before the magistrate lasted three months. Of course, the company were exercising their legal rights, and I do not question them. But the point is that this company was able to prevent an inquiry which the Government of the Commonwealth had ordered to be made. </para>

                            <para>- I cannot answer the question from authoritative information ; but <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Normand</inline> McLaurin was the first witness who refused to answer the summons. I take it that, for that reason, he was the first to be prosecuted. Although <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knox</inline> refused to answer questions, he did appear, and the test prosecution took place in the case of the witness who refused to appear at all. The person prosecuted was one holding a title from  His  Majesty the King, and he set the example of flouting the King&#39;s Commission. I venture to say that when this Bill becomes law it will be a little more difficult for gentlemen in that position to do the same sort of thing. I recognise that a fine to a great and wealthy institution like the Sugar Refining Company is not a serious matter. An increase of Jd. per lb. in the price of sugar would be sufficient to cover whatever fine was imposed. The company can make the residents of this country pay whatever penalties are inflicted. But I believe that there are sufficient powers under this measure to compel corporations of the kind to divulge the means by which they make enormous profits by imposing taxes upon the people. It is because honorable senators opposite are aware of this that they are fighting the measure so vigorously. They know that if legislation of this kind goes through, it will be made more difficult for these persons to evade their responsibilities. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> the Leader of the Opposition, actually referred to the  Chairman  of the Commission as a &#34;chartered bully.&#34; I do not expect much consideration from the other side when they are facing the opponents of the big trusts and combines ; but I do not know that there is anything to show that the learned Judge in question is an opponent of trusts. I do not know that he is not as fair-minded a man as ever sat on the Bench. I do not know that any one is able to say a word against the manner in which he conducted the proceedings of the Commission. The whole trouble was due to the fact that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company find it more profitable to hold up the Commission and refuse to give evidence than to let the public know how these huge profits are made. They want to stave off legislation. Consequently, their endeavour was to delay the work of the Commission. In the meantime additional profits will go into the pockets of the company. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> twisted the language of the  Chairman  of the Commission in order to place him in a false position. It is almost inconceivable that a gentleman in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould&#39;s</inline> position, who may some day be on the High Court Bench himself, should make use of his opportunities in this Chamber to do that in regard to a Judge in <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Gordon&#39;s position. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> aided by his chief lieutenant, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger, has also been trying to create a false impression of what happened. These gentlemen know that newspaper files cannot easily be consulted by the great .bulk of the people, and they hope that their misrepresentations will be believed when they are repeated outside. But I trust that the public will realize that honorable senators opposite have constituted themselves the defenders of the rich combines, and that they, by their efforts, are helping the trusts which are plundering the country. </para>

                        <para>. - I think it is a pity that, in the discussion of this subject, accusations should be made such as have been hurled across the chamber by the  speaker  who has just sat down. He has represented that one party is here simply to promote all kinds of injustice, and that the other party is trying to prevent them. That kind of criticism is neither fair nor creditable to the Senate. </para>

I do not like the measure now proposed to us, because it aims at legislating for a particular occasion. No legislation, in my opinion, ought to be framed in that spirit. Legislation should be on broader lines, and should lay down principles. This savours of panic legislation. </para>

                            <para>- I say again that the law has been vindicated in the case of the witness who refused to attend. He might be fined a hundred times if he refused to attend a hundred times. I feel sure that even the Sugar Company would get tired of paying fines and costs. At any rate, the prosecution that has taken place proves that it was not necessary, for the first reason given, to amend the law. The second reason was, to insure that witnesses shall answer questions. I have no objection to that. Certainly any man who is summoned before a Royal Commission ought to answer questions. In this particular case, I read the Police Court evidence - pages and pages of it - until I grew sick and tired of following the proceedings. I believe that the secretary of the Commission admitted in evidence that some witnesses who were called produced written statements. That was proved in the proceedings before the Police Court. I understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knox</inline> took up exactly, the same position - that if others had been allowed that privilege it should be extended to him. I think that the same treatment should be extended to every witness. Perhaps it would be better to lay down the exact procedure, so as to make it clear and distinct whether a witness has the right to make a statement before he gives his evidence, or whether he must give his evidence first and make a statement afterwards. But I do not see any provision of that kind in the Bill. We might have the same trouble arising over and over again if witnesses think that they are not receiving exactly the same treatment as others have received. I do not excuse in any way a witness who refuses to answer questions or to give evidence, but I hold that we ought to put all witnesses on exactly the same footing. If a privilege is given to one witness, it should be extended to all witnesses. This Bill would have met the position if it had made quite clear what the privileges of a witness are, and what he can do when he is put in the box and called upon to answer questions. There are some peculiar parts of the Bill to which I wish to refer. Clause  2,  for instance, amends section  2  of the Act, which gives power to the  President  or  Chairman  of a Commission to summon a person -  to give evidence and to produce any books, documents, or writings in his custody or control, material to the subject-matter of the inquiry. </para>

A witness may be asked to produce documents which are not at all material to the subject-matter of the inquiry. </para>

                            <para>- I am sorry in almost every case. There may be one or two cases, perhaps, in the Customs Act where the only proof can be produced by the defendant himself. In this Bill we find  a  provision requiring a man to prove that the books and documents asked for were not relevant to the inquiry. Why should not the old British rule be maintained, and proof be required that the witness refused to produce books or documents which were relevant to the inquiry? It is only just that a man should be placed in that position. It is bad in principle to put the onus of proof on a man who is under prosecution. </para>

                            <para>- I said that a member of the Commission, who is  chairman  of a jam company, and, therefore, largely interested in sugar, will have an opportunity under this clause to go through the books of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company and take extracts. It is not fair that he should be allowed to do that. The members of a Royal Commission should be altogether impartial. No member of the Sugar Commission should be connected with sugar or the sugar industry. The  Chairman,  who is a Judge, should be able to get the necessary evidence to enable the Commission to arrive at a conclusion. </para>

                                Gordon is an impartial man, who could extract the evidence and present it to his colleagues, and the Commission could bring up a report founded on the evidence. But when you get men on a Commission who are biased from the start - and, whether it is true or not, that is the complaint which has been made with regard to some members of the Sugar Commission - we are not likely to get justice. It is not fair to put a biased man in a position in which he can examine books and documents in regard to a business which would give him information.

Is it necessary by the introduction of all the proposed new sections included in clause  6  of this Bill to scare people by making provision for these fearful penaltie&#39;s? Under this Bill, a fine of ^500, or imprisonment for a year, two &#39;years, or five years, &#39;may be imposed. I repeat that the Government appear to have got into a panic in connexion with this matter. </para>

                        That settles it, and it must be right. Why is not a penalty of ^1,000 proposed in this Bill.

                        would have us believe that the Government are exceedingly lenient in the penalties they have provided in this Bill for the punishment of offenders against the law. I see no need whatever for frightening people by making provision for these maximum penalties.

I was always under the impression that the law was for the doer of evil, and for the praise of those who do well. I have known the law to be appealed to in connexion with some industrial matters, and have heard some of my honorable friends in such cases say terrible things about the law. Provision is made in this Bill that it shall be retrospective. It is to apply to Royal Commissions appointed .before it will come into force, but it is, at the same time, provided that it shall not apply to offences committed before that time. I doubt whether it is a good thing to make this kind of legislation retrospective in any way whatever. </para>

It is held that a certain trust has flouted* the Sugar Commission. That may be true, but honorable senators should not forget that the provisions of this Bill will apply to the most innocent people in the world, as well as the trust which has been referred to. </para>

                            <para>- If the law is Tor the protection of the just man, and is intended to deter the man who would do wrong, let the principle be applied generally, and I shall be quite content. I believe that our Royal Commissions should be invested with all the powers necessary to enable them to secure the information they are appointed to obtain. I say further that if any one deliberately flouts a Commission he should be punished for doing so. But if there is some other Royal Commission appointed after the Sugar Commission has completed its labours, and some one commits an offence in the face of that Commission, I hope we shall not have another Bill introduced to make provision to meet that offence. That is the course which has been followed in this case. If the Government intend to introduce an amendment of the Act to meet every new offence committed before a Royal Commission, we shall have more panic legislation. I say that the law should be laid down broadly enough to cover all offences that may require to be dealt with, and we should not pass special legislation to meet particular cases. </para>

                        <para>. - I wish briefly to give a general support to this Bill. &#39; From the Opposition we have had a good deal of talk about panic and drastic legislation. I am prepared to admit that this measure is very drastic, but I believe it to be absolutely necessary. I am not quite sure that we have not very nearly reached the panic stage, demanding legislation of this kind, in view of the modern developments of industry. I was looking over some statistics this morning which might justify that opinion. I find that the average wage paid to males employed in the whole of the factories of Victoria is &#163;102 per year. Eliminating youths and young men from fourteen to twenty years of age, the average wage earned in Victorian factories by adult males, most of whom are married men, is from ,&#163;110 to &#163;112 per year. I say that, in such circumstances, and remembering that the cost of living has increased by about 25 per cent., it is not too much to say that we are up against a condition of things which excuses panic and justifies panic legislation. If we are to legislate effectively with respect to modern industries, we must ascertain the facts connected with them chiefly by means of inquiries made by Royal Commissions. I assume that the object of appointing the Sugar Commission was to have an inquiry into the general working of the sugar industry, that we might be in a better position to legislate with respect to the sugar bonus and the conditions which should apply to millers, growers, and workers generally in the industry. This Bill is not intended specially to deal with a particular case. It will be necessary for us in the future to appoint many Royal Commissions to inquire into the conditions of industries. Royal Commissions, in the past, may have been very successful in securing all the information they were appointed to obtain, but the conditions prevailing in trades and industries, ten or twenty years ago in Australia cannot be compared with the complex conditions, of industries which it is necessary to inquire into to-day. In days gone by, most industries were not so organized that it would* have been profitable to those conducting them to pay a considerable amount of money in. fines in order to hold up the proceedings of a Royal Commission. But to-day certain industries have become so concentrated in the hands of a few persons that it pays, them to defy the law for the purpose of securing delay, because, in the meantime, they are levying a heavy toll upon the people. </para>

                            <para>- Whether it has reached the monopoly stage or not, the fact remains that the cost of living has increased to such an extent that it is undoubtedly the biggest question before Australia to-day. Most honorable senators affirm that the increased cost of living is the result of the operation of trusts and combines. In any case, we require to arm Royal Commissions with the most drastic powers to enable them to ascertain the exact cause of the present high cost of livings so that this Parliament may be able adequately to legislate upon that subject. Recently, although the law has been vindicated, it has been conclusively proved that existing legislation is not sufficient to prevent exasperating delays in the conduct of a. Commission&#39;s inquiries - delays which are not in the best interests of the community. I shall support the Bill ; and I trust that when it becomes law it will secure for us that information which is so necessary to enable us to frame legislation which we shall require to enact in the near future. </para>

                        <para>. - At the outset of my remarks, I should like to clear some of the ground which has been covered during this debate. Some matters have been imported into the discussion which, while perhaps illuminating it, are not essential to our deliberations upon this Bill.- Repeated reference has been made to the action of the  Chairman  of the Sugar Commission in relation to one of the witnesses who appeared before him. It would be the grossest exhibition of ostrich sense for honorable senators to pretend that we can entirely divorce our criticism&#39; of the Bill from those actions. I wish that the two things could be dissociated. I believe that the measure has been submitted for our consideration, simply because of certain incidents in connexion with the inquiries of that Commission. </para>

                            <para>- There is certainly no harm in my criticising it. In my judgment, the trouble is entirely due to the foolishness exhibited by the  Chairman  of the Commission. The incidents connected with the relation of the  Chairman  of that body to one of the witnesses who appeared before it on behalf of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company have already been dwelt upon by honorable senators, and the action of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Gordon has been severely criticised. In this connexion, I am irresistibly reminded of some very profound remarks which were made by the Judge who tried a certain case in which I happened to be engaged some time ago. The trial was a protracted one, and counsel upon both sides were extremely anxious to keep back the major portion of their hands. When the proceedings had reached a crucial stage, it became necessary to call a certain individual as a witness, and to produce certain documents. The witness appeared in the box, and the Judge asked him what certain documents meant, and why he had made certain statements. The man replied, &#34; To the best of my ability I have given the information which I thought ought to be given ; and there has been produced on my behalf documents which 1 thought were sufficient for the purpose.&#34; The Judge at once replied. &#34; 1 believe that you are an honest man, and that, within what you deem to be your legal rights, you have behaved as an honest man ; but I say that your opinion of what constitutes honesty and fair play does not accord with the conception of most honest and fair-minded men.&#34; Applying that incident, I have no hesitation in affirming that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Gordon&#39;s conception of impartiality and fair-mindedness does not accord with what ought to be the conception of any man who is &#39;called upon to fill the responsible position of  Chairman  of a Royal Commission. I think it is only fair that I should have said so much with regard to the relations between the  Chairman  of the Commission and the witness, whose conduct caused so much trouble, and has led to the introduction of this measure. I accept <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon&#39;s</inline> statement with regard to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline></para>

                    <para class="block">Gordon. I retorted, while he was speaking, that the very excuse which the  Chairman  of the Commission made was a strong accusation against him, bearing in mind the well-known proverb, &#34;He who excuseth himself accuseth himself.&#34; There was nothing to warrant the  Chairman  telling the witness that he had told &#34; a deliberate lie.&#34; No matter what the circumstances were, no Britisher, however humble he may be, is expected to abide quietly by a charge like that. </para>

                            <para>- The  Chairman  of a Royal Commission should not allow himself to get into such a position. He should not use expressions insulting to a witness. I have had some experience of all classes of Courts, and I have never heard a Judge allow himself to use such an expression to a witness in the box. I have heard Judges, in summing up to juries after evidence was concluded, express strong opinions about persons or matters. But, as a rule, Judges do not allow such expressions as &#34; deliberate lie &#34; to fall from their lips, until they have heard the pros and cons of the case. The whole trouble, in this instance, arose out of the fact that a witness desired to make a statement, and that the  Chairman  of the Commission insisted that he should first answer questions put to him. I believe that a whole series of questions, seventy or eighty in number, had been submitted to the witness, and that he was required to go categorically through them before he made his statement. Every one who has had experience of Law Courts knows that, both in civil and criminal cases - especially criminal cases - when a witness goes into the box and says, &#34; I should prefer not to answer counsel&#39;s questions until I have made a statement,&#34; it is usual not to refuse his request. In my professional experience, it has happened, over and over again, that counsel on both sides could not get what they desired out of a witness, because the witness wanted to take that position. I have heard the Judge say, &#34; Let the man make his statement first.&#34; Sometimes that has happened in civil cases, also. </para>
