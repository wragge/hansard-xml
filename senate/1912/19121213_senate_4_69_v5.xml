                        <para>- I have received from the Home Affairs Department two memoranda by the Chief Electoral Officer dealing with this question, and as I do not think that the statement in the press is quite full, perhaps it will be better if I read them to the Senate.

                    <para>The New South Wales police officers are amongst the most experienced electoral canvassers in the Commonwealth, and no question has been raised as to their integrity or competency. The electoral registrars are Commonwealth officials, with statutory responsibilities, against whom no complaint has been made. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen&#39;s</inline> contention, that because the electoral enrolment figures furnished by the Chief Electoral Officer do not agree with the estimate of electoral population furnished by the Commonwealth Statistician, the rolls have been stuffed or inflated, is one with which I am unable to concur. The statistical estimate of electoral population of a State, which is arrived at by taking the total estimated adult population at a given time and deducting the number of aliens, new arrivals, &#38;c, assumed to be disqualified for enrolment at that time may, for various reasons, be very wide of the mark, and cannot in reason be relied upon as against a personal collection of names. </para>
                    <para>I have conferred with the Commonwealth and the State statistical authorities, and understand that there is grave doubt as to the accuracy of the Commonwealth statistical figures quoted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen.</inline> The New South Wales Statistician claims that the actual population of that State is by many thousands in excess of that given by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs,</inline> and that the electoral figures are substantially correct; while the Victorian Statistician estimates that the actual population of the latter State is very markedly below the estimate given by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs.</inline> Both statisticians are, I understand, of opinion that there has been erroneous counting by the railway authorities on the border, and have made representations to the Commonwealth Statistician to this effect. The statisticians are still conferring with regard to the population figures of the two States, and, in the meantime, I submit that there is no ground for assuming that the New South Wales electoral rolls are in fault. </para>

                    <para>It is now alleged by the Government of New South Wales that the figures supplied by their officers to the Commonwealth Statistician as the migration out of the State, and at first stated to be correct, after the question of their accuracy had been raised, are really incorrect. It is understood that this alleged inaccuracy is accepted by the Victorian Statistician, and the basis on the conclusion of the State Statisticians is expected to be submitted to the Commonwealth Statistician for his consideration. Pending the receipt of this, a definite answer cannot be given ; but it is understood that Victoria is prepared to admit a very considerable reduction in the estimate of its population, and New South Wales will receive a correspondingly large increase. Inasmuch as a large proportion of the border migration is adult, this will materially affect the voting numbers. 12th December, 1912. </para>

The report of the Chief Electoral Officer deals with my remarks so far as they had reference to the figures presented by the Federal Statistician.I also indicated here a discrepancy between the rolls and the figures supplied by the State Statistician, but, to. that portion of my remarks, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Oldham</inline> has made no reference.

Yesterday I received from him a telegram stating that the delay had been occasioned by his regarding the reports of the officers concerned as unsatisfactory, and referring them back to them-; but that a report would be completed and forwarded on that day. Probably it will be delivered at the Barracks here between 3 and 4 o&#39;clock, and may not reach me before the Senate adjourns. Of course, until it comes forward, I cannot know what it contains. </para>

                        <para>. - At the last sitting, I was engaged in pointing out the change which has come over the nature of commerce the world  over, and especially in Australia. I have said that commerce in Australia to-day is&#39; not confined to particular States, but ranges over the whole area of the Commonwealth. Goods manufactured in the east and south find their market in the west and north. We send timber from Western Australia to the eastern States, and products of the eastern States - such as butter, bacon, and other foodstuffs - are sent to the west, and as far north as the State of Western Australia extends. In view of the fact that commerce to-day differs so very much from what it was a hundred years ago, it is quite illogical to contend that the laws which were sufficient to regulate it then suffice for to-day. People outside naturally look for guidance to members of this Parliament, because of their special opportunities to become acquainted with matters which the people generally have no means of knowing; but, when they find the opponents of these proposals insisting that a law made over one hundred years ago is sufficient for the requirements of to-day, the only conclusion to which they can come is that we must shut our eyes to the change which has &#39; come over events, and which especially has taken place in the nature of commerce in Australia. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>An instance came under my notice recently of an attempt to compel commerce to run within certain definite channels without respect to the interests of the people. As honorable senators are aware, the Government of Western Australia recently started a line of steam-ships, and, during the short time since the establishment of that line, the residents of comparatively isolated and remote districts of the State have derived very great benefit from the service. It has led to a reduction of fares and freights, and the people have been placed in the position to contend better with the disadvantages of their isolated situation than they were able to do when served by private shipping companies. I am in a position to inform honorable senators that, in connexion with goods shipped from Melbourne to a port in Western Australia, there was written across the bill of lading the words, &#34; Not to be shipped in the State steam-ships of Western Australia.&#34; It is very evident that the consignors of these goods were brought in some way or another under the influence of those engaged in the shipping business here. That is an instance of the kind of thing that is going on in Australia to-day. An endeavour has been clearly made to confine commerce within channels controlled by private enterprise, and to prevent it from being conducted by a State steam service established for the benefit of the people. This is a restraint of trade which places a burden upon the people of Western Australia. </para>
                    <para>It would appear, from this debate, that nothing done by the Ministerial party in this Parliament meets with the approval of the Opposition. They are carrying out the <inline font-style="italic">role</inline> assigned to them by Disraeli when he said that it is the duty of the Opposition to oppose. But it is not in the true interests of the community that they should carry out that <inline font-style="italic">role</inline> to the fullest extent. The result has been to place honorable members opposite in very contradictory positions at times. When the Maternity Allowance Bill was under consideration a few months ago, the Leader of the Opposition condemned it as a vote-catching measure. It was stated that the measure was introduced before an election merely as an electioneering placard and in order to catch votes. </para>

                            <para>- I find that that statement is cheered by a member of the Opposition who opposes the measures now under consideration on exactly opposite grounds. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Shannon</inline> has urged the rejection of these measures, because they are unpopular. He has told the Senate that, on a previous occasion, similar proposals were rejected by about  250,000  electors, and has contended that that was a reason why they should not be submitted to the people again. On the one hand, honorable senators opposite condemn measures because they are calculated to catch votes, and, on the other hand, they condemn measures which they assert are calculated to repel popular opinion. Whether we place before them allegedly popular or unpopular measures we cannot please the taste of the Opposition. </para>

We go upon our own course in obedience to the dictates of our consciences, and we do not trouble ourselves as to whether what we propose meets with the approval of the Opposition or does not. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline> may laugh, but the history of the Labour party in politics in Australia supplies the best answer to the honorable senator It is the history of a militant party. We have stood up for measures which were unpopular. After years of struggling and endeavour measures which were unpopular years ago are accepted to-day by the people, as a result of the efforts of the Labour party and of the Labour party alone. We are in the proud position of having been able to convert a considerable minority into an overwhelming majority. The fact that measures which were regarded as unpopular have since been accepted by the people is due to the efforts of the Labour .party, assisted by one or two staunch friends of the movement who do not belong to the party. I make this statement in justice to those outside the Labour ranks who have helped us, but they have been very few in number. We are pursuing our own course, indifferent as to whether we meet with popular favour or arouse popular clamour. That is evident from the way In which the measures to which I have referred have been treated by the Opposition. </para>

                        has said that the Ministerial party in this Parliament are, in connexion -with these measures, flying in the face of the history of our own race. That is a high-sounding statement, but I wish to direct attention to its inaccuracy. First of all, the history of our race is not confined to the British Empire, or members of the Empire. If we consider Canada alone we shall find that the National Parliament of that Dominion possesses powers far in excess of those for which we are asking to-day. So far as the experience of Canada, therefore, is concerned we cannot be said to be flying in the face of the history of our own race.
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser,</inline>
                        who comes from Canada, must acknowledge that the Dominion is one of the most prosperous portions of the British Empire. If there be any lack of &#39;prosperity in Canada the honorable senator will admit that it is not due to the character of the Canadian Constitution.

It would appear that the honorable senator is being guided by the alleged jesuitical maxim that the end justifies the means. Is it because he desires to get in a blow at the Labour party that he refuses to endow the Australian people with the powers which he claims have been productive of so much benefit in Canada ? I ask the venerable old political jesuit whether that is his object? </para>

                            <para>- I am pursuing a line of argument based upon an admission by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser,</inline> which I contend justifies the statement. We have been told that it is an alleged jesuitical maxim that the end justifies the means. I have based an argument upon that. I asked <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser,</inline> as a native of Canada, to say whether the prosperity of the Dominion has not been largely due to the Canadian Constitution, and the legislation framed under it. The honorable senator admitted that it has, and I now ask him whether he is opposing the endowment of this Parliament with the powers which have been productive of such good results in Canada in order that he may bring about the downfall of the Labour party through a refusal to confer upon the people of Australia powers the exercise of which has done so much foi the people of Canada. Dealing with the statement of the Leader of the Opposition, that we are flying in the face of the traditions of the British race, I have looked closely into the Canadian case, and claim that we in this country are seeking even less power than is enjoyed by the Dominion Government in Canada. </para>

                    <para>Let us turn to South Africa. There the central authority has greater power than is given here. I say flatly that, so far from flying in the face of the traditions of our race, we are not asking for more powers than are enjoyed to-day by any other self-governing entity of the British Empire. In South Africa, the States, which for a long time enjoyed complete autonomy, have been stripped of their powers, and these have been intrusted to a single central authority. Look at the United States of America. We must acknowledge that the Republic of the West, numbering 90,000,000 of people to-day, affords an example which is just as much part and parcel of the experience of the British race as is that of any part of the British Empire. The British Parliament cannot fairly be compared with the </para>
                    <para class="block">Commonwealth Parliament, however powerful it may become. The British Parliament has to legislate for  300,000,000  people, and not  5,000.000.  It has to deal with territories spread over the five continents of the globe. It has to deal legislatively with peoples alien in race, religion, and economic and social standards - the very opposite of the Australian people. Therefore, the cry of Home Rule, as applied to the question of the referendum, is grotesquely absurd. We turned to the United States of America when framing our own Constitution. But what has been the trend of events there? We can take the opinions, not only of impartial students on the spot, but of jurists elsewhere, who, after an examination of the facts, have come to the conclusion that the State Governments of America are waning in popular favour, and stand in danger of losing the sovereignty which they have hitherto enjoyed. I direct the attention of the Leader of the Opposition to what has been written by Professor Harrison Moore, of the Melbourne University, on the trend of events in America. </para>

In the United States of America the development has been by way of judicial construction rather than by formal amendment, a construction given under a deep responsibility which came from the knowledge that the decisions of the Court were, in face of the difficulty of amending the Constitution, for all practical, purposes final, and yet mav not be &#34;Commerce among the several States.&#34; In America, too, as elsewhere, the citadel of natural rights has been stormed, and the securities demanded by the citizen of the eighteenth century against the improvement of his liberties are likely to be more and more regarded in the twentieth century as hindrances to his social welfare. </para>

                        <para>Among the many political changes which have occurred during the history . of the American people there are few that can compare in importance with the growth of the national feeling by which the State and local Government have lost their former independent position and are now valued largely for the places they furnish for partisans of national politics. . . . The average voter of to-day would have been a puzzle to our ancestors. The motives upon which he acts would have been incomprehensible to them. They looked upon the State as a sovereign, and kept State issues independent of those of the nation. They limited the power of the nation as&#39; much as possible with the hope that the States would retain their vitality and be the real centre of power and influence. Each part of our really complex system of government had a meaning to them, and they exerted the utmost vigilance to ensure that no part lost its vitality. Nothing could have grieved the fathers of our country more than to know that before the end of the first century of our national existence, State and local Governments would have sunk to their present condition with a mere nominal existence. </para>

An amendment requires  a  two-thirds majority in each House of Congress, or a demand by two-thirds of the States, and has to be ratified by three-fourths of the Legislatures of the States.

                    <para>In regard to the main features of these referenda proposals, I have referred to what has taken place in other countries with respect to monopolies. During the time of my participancy in public  affairs  in this country, I admit that I have advocated concerted action by those in charge of industries and their employes. I ; have urged them to come together and to recognise that it was not wise and well to permit unrestricted competition in carrying on business. I have suffered from the cut-throat competitive methods adopted by those engaged in industry, and have been forced to accept lower wages than were reasonable and have been compelled to live under unsatisfactory conditions. This state of affairs was entirely due to the reduction of prices to such an absurd level that they did not pay the employers, or those who were engaged by them. I urged on that occasion and  Afterwards  that it was necessary for the employers to combine to fix rates that would operate fairly to themselves and enable them to deal fairly with their employes. I was urged to do this by the necessities of the situation and because I was not going to be made a slave so that the public might enjoy cheap prices. Whilst on that occasion I agreed to those engaged in industry combining for their reasonable protection, I did not agree to their going to the further, length of making themselves our masters. I refer particularly to the shipping industry.. When&#39; the shipping companies were not combined, people could travel from place to place around the  Australian coast for less than they could obtain board on shore, and hundreds of persons did travel merely for the novelty of the thing and in order to save their board. The employes were made to pay for these holiday jaunts, and that was not a healthy state of affairs. I urged that it was necessary to raise rates to such a level that employers would obtain a fair return for their capital and would be able to pay us fairly for our labour. We are charged to-day with, having encouraged monopolies, but . there is . a great distinction between combinations for the purpose I have indicated ah j combinations which will enable employers to become masters of the situation. I may invite a man into my house to enjoy my hospitality, but at the same time I am not content that he shall become my master. My invitation affords him no warrant for usurping my place in my own home. Those employers who took our advice to combine in order to fix fair prices were not content with accomplishing that object, but have gone much further afield and have constituted themselves masters of the situation.- These proposals are intended to enable the Commonwealth Government to curb this abuse of power, and to deal effectively with those who have gone far beyond the boundary line between a fair reward for their enterprise and exorbitant demands upon the public. </para>
                    <para>In regard to what has happened in other countries, I shall have to discard a good deal of the matter I have prepared with a view to showing the trend of events in the United States, Great Britain, and New Zealand. But I would refer especially to New Zealand, because it is nearer home, and because in that Dominion we shall find ample evidence in support of the present proposals. A Royal Commission appointed by the New Zealand Government to inquire into the cost of living last year presented its report during the current year. The report contains a list of articles which are the subjects of monopolies. The Commission found that the cost of living had been increased by 21 per cent, during the last seventeen years. They found that the following articles were the subjects of monopolies : - </para>

The increase seems to be most marked in Auckland - a city which has also exhibited the most rapid increase in population over that period - and it is not improbable that there rents have increased by 45 per cent. </para>

This is a most important point.

The ordinary organs of government which ought to control them in some cases are becoming their instruments?

There is no power to deal with these trusts in the United States, and the point has been made by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Haynes</inline> in the passage to which I have referred, that with a Constitution which is practically incapable of being so amended as to do away with this ligature there may be found no other remedy than some form of revolutionary change. </para>

                    <para>I think it is worth while, even at the expense of delaying the Senate, to point out what has happened in regard to the supply of steel rails, and to show that Governments and those who are engaged in developmental work in Australia are seriously handicapped&#39; by the action of the&#39; Steel Trust to-day, which reserves to itself certain spaces over the surface of the globe, beyond which they do not attempt to trade. No competition reigns- within these allotted areas. In his work on International Trusts <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hermann</inline> Levy, professor in -the Heidelberg University - and so important was  his work that it was translated into English - sets forth the fact that in  1895  an international arrangement was . entered into between the  steel  companies of &#39; the world, that the price of rails in Great Britain was something like <inline font-style="italic">-&#163;2</inline> a ton more than the price of rails in the United States of America, and that in spite of the fact that England was Free Trade and that America could land rails at a cheaper price in England, according to the relative price in both countries, after the compact had been entered into, only  477  tons were landed in England. In the meantime, America  exported  no less than  200,000  tons to foreign countries, but England, although the price was higher in that country, never received more than a paltry  477  tons during the &#39; time. It is quite plain to those who are conversant with public affairs in the Old Country, that their vaunted policy of Free Trade at least  is  not .giving the consumers  in  England any . benefit&#39;, but rather that the mighty trusts that sit in conclave in different cities  in  the world can come to an arrangement which will throw into the waste-paper basket any Tariff which the Parliament of Australia, or the British House of Commons, may take&#39;, labour and pains to formulate for the benefit and protection of the people. The Tariff in the Old Country, so far as steel rails were concerned, was powerless. People  in  that country wanted the rails at a cheap price, but the Americans would not supply them. Therefore,  it  is clear that these enormous octopi, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Irvine</inline> has described trusts, can play &#34; ducks and drakes &#34; with the Tariffs of the world. It was done  in  the case of steel rails in Australia when the Germans refused to tender and left the field clear to the American and English competitors. </para>
                    <para>I&#39; desire to refer briefly to the proposal to enable railway servants to come under the Conciliation and Arbitration Court, should they ever find themselves in trouble, or want a dispute settled. I regard it as a very vital proposal indeed. When we examine closely the objections to the proposal, we find that, unless the railway servants of Australia are given power to approach the Arbitration.. Court, very serious &#39;consequences, if not evil, will ensue. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline> may laugh. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator who laughs at this proposal comes from the State where the railway servants went into revolt not very long ago. Why? To obtain fair conditions. I am not personally aware of the conditions under which they worked, but am able to state, on the best authority, the conditions under which they worked up to the time they struck-, as compared with .the railway servants of New South Wales. Prior to the strike, the average wage of the engine-drivers -in Victoria was  12s.  n}d. a day, and in New South Wales,  13s. 4d.,  being a difference of  4jd.  a day in favour of the. New South Wales men. The average wage of firemen in Victoria was  8s. 7$d.  a day,, and in New South Wales,  8s. 8Jd.  - not a. great difference, it is true, but still a difference, to which I shall refer later. The average wage of guards in Victoria &#39; was  8s.  10¾d. a day, and in New South Wales it was  9s. 7fd.,  showing a difference of 9d. in favour of the New South Wales men. In addition - and this is all-important - in the New South Wales service, the men worked only eight hours a day, and ninety-six hours a fortnight ; whereas in Victoria, up to the time of the strike, the men worked 108 hours a fortnight. In other words, they worked a day longer for a lower wage than was paid in New South Wales. When they sought a redress of their grievances, what was the result? <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Irvine,</inline> who is now in this Parliament, and has shown himself so skilful an acrobat, refused to consider what they proposed for consideration, and insisted upon the Government being the only arbiter of the situation. </para>

                            <para>- A fair means of adjustment would be to have an arbitrator to decide between those seeking something and those refusing it. The Government of Victoria of that day refused to consider the demands of the railway employes unless they conceded that the Government should be the sole arbitrators in all such matters. We know the history of that strike, and the attempts made to force those men into submission. Nothing serves as a better guide for the future than experience of the past. It is the lamp which may guide our feet. What has happened in the past is a reliable guide to what may happen in the future. The railway men went on strike in Victoria, as they were perfectly entitled to do, because a man should have the right to sell his labour in the highest market, just as a merchant sells his goods in the highest market. </para>

It was only after they had exhausted in vain every means open to them for the redress of their grievances, and because they were treated with contempt by the Victorian Government, that they resorted to those extreme measures. Here are some of the clauses of the Irvine Coercion Act, which should, I think, be put on record, as indicating what may happen in the future if we are to accept the experience of the past as a guide.

                    <para>The Victorian Government of the immediate past proposed as a penalty for going on strike a fine of &#163;100, or twelve months&#39; imprisonment, or the payment of the penalty, and also the imprisonment.

                            <para>- The only light that can guide our feet is the experience of the past. In Victoria, the &#34;Englishman&#39;s home&#34; was dishonoured, the informer was encouraged, the practices of the Courts of Law were set at naught, trade and commerce were completely disorganized and brought to a standstill, and the most repressive means of coercion were resorted to by the Government. I want to prevent the happening of such things again by making these amendments of the Constitution. I make these references to warn the people as to what may happen in the future. The railway system of Australia to-day links up one part of the country with another and the trade and commerce conducted by its means is all part and parcel of one whole. The railways are an indispensable factor in dealing with trade and commerce and if one State Government chose to do what the Victorian Government did a few years ago, the trade of the country would be paralyzed. We should surely be blind to our true interests if we did not institute means of preventing the recurrence of such  a state of things. But that can only be done by granting the Federal Government the powers asked for. </para>

                    <para>I wish to say a word about the work of the Federal Arbitration Court. It has granted fifteen awards, and 214 industrial agreements have been registered under it. By means of awards and agreements combined, the affairs of no fewer than 105,000 employes have been regulated, and the whole of them are working peacefully to-day. There have been no strikes in connexion with the awards and industrial agreements of the Federal Arbitration Court. It has smoothed the path of the industrial chariot, and brought employer and employ6 more closely together, notwithstanding the serious curtailments of its power which have been brought about by the action of the High Court. Let me mention some of the directions in which the High Court has restricted the usefulness of the Arbitration Court. There is, first, the common rule. The Arbitration Court cannot fix a common rule, whilst the State Courts can do so. . Secondly, there is the power to fix the wages of apprentices. The Federal Arbitration Court cannot fix them. The State Courts can do so, having unlimited power in that respect. Again, the Federal Arbitration Court reduced the length of the working week of the employes at the Port Pirie smelters from seven days to six. State Courts could have done so, but the High Court ruled that the Federal Arbitration Court could not. The Port Pirie smelters have to work seven days, instead of six, owing to the limitations of the Constitution. These are samples of the hobbles in which the Federal Arbitration Court has been struggling, owing to the extraordinary action of the High Court. I will not refer to what has been said by the  President  of the Court, except to indicate that its records speak for themselves. I believe that we shall enter upon an extended area of industrial peace if we can only secure the increased industrial powers asked for by these referenda proposals. </para>
                    <para>I wish to say a word or two as to the warnings afforded by other countries in regard to the actions of monopolists. In Free- Trade England there are no fewer than fifteen combinations in existence, including the tobacco combine. As to what is happening in connexion with the social life of the Britisher of to-day, the fol- lowing is a passage which I have taken from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd&#39;s</inline><inline font-style="italic">Lords of Industry -</inline></para>

                    <para class="block">So that 77 millions of the people have to scramble for one-half of the wealth of the nation, whilst the other half is enjoyed by the remainder. Surely that is not a healthy state of affairs. It has been brought about by the evils that have taken such deep root in America, and which we are trying to prevent by these proposals. What has happened in Germany? The following is the opinion of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dawson,</inline> in his work <inline font-style="italic">The Evolution of Modern Germany -</inline> &#34; Never before,&#34; wrote the Austrian Consul in Berlin to his Government in 1906, &#34; was economic Germany so entirely under the absolute rule of a group of men, barely fifty in number; in no former period of industrial expansion was the old formula of * the free-play of forces &#39; abandoned to such a degree as in 1906, when the momentous decisions as to the extent of production, sales abroad, prices, the granting of credit, the raising of new capital, and the fixing of wages and rates of interest lay in the hands of a few persons found at the head of the large banks, mammoth industrial undertakings and great cartels. The lion&#39;s share of the industrial boom has fallen to these great combinations of interests, whose gains have been the larger the more their industries were ruled by syndicates.&#34; </para>
                    <para class="block">It would take too long to refer to the incipient evils existing in this country, which we hope to cure by means of this policy. It will suffice to say that the same tendencies of the time are making themselves evident in Australia, as is the case in other countries of the world. Take the report of the Wheat Commission, appointed by the South Australian Government only four years ago, That Commission found, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Shannon</inline> is aware, that, owing to the cornering of prices, and the bringing about of &#34;honorable understandings,&#34; the price per bushel was reduced by &#39;2d. all round. Taking the products of South Australia for the year with which the report deals, we can say that those manipulators of the wheat market robbed the producers of the State of no less than ,&#163;166,000. Honorable senators opposite can laugh, but what do the people think who were  robbed of this money ? What about the men out in the wilds with broken boots and broken hearts? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline> can afford to laugh because he is in the lap of luxury. But I speak as one who knows these troubles intimately. I know that it is no laughing matter for men who have to earn a bare living on scanty food, and who work with blighted eyes and blighted hopes in the distant parts of this country. They have been robbed systematically by that gang of thieves, the wheat-buyers of South Australia. I say that they are hypocritical who will not give us the power to deal with evils which result in the wholesale robbery of our farmers. The manufacturers of harvesters- abroad have entered into a combination with the local manufacturers to charge certain prices, with the result that the farmer now has to pay <inline font-style="italic">j&#163;i8</inline> more than previously for a machine. The farmers are being robbed wholesale by the manufacturers&#39; combine. Being the son of a farmer. I know that the farmers are robbed consistently by these highway raiders, who are everywhere in the field of commerce. When the farmer sends his wheat to market he finds that the price is ruled by world-wide competition, or else by some combine that is operating to his disadvantage. On the other hand, in respect to everything he requires, he has to pay prices which are regulated by half-a-dozen men sitting in an office in one of the big metropolitan centres. He sells at prices which are fixed by competition, but has to buy at prices fixed by combines which claim to be his friends, but which are piling up the burdens on him all the time. We are endeavouring to save this young Commonwealth from treading in the false steps of other communities. We are endeavouring to protect the people against the monopolies that have already driven their roots into the soil of Australia - as the Victorian Premier, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt,</inline> has admitted. We want to cut off these roots, and the only means by which we can do so is by strengthening the central Government in the direction indicated by these proposals. </para>
                    <para>What have these monopolists done ? Even now they are turning round and biting the hand which fed them. In- every civilized country monopolists have flourished under the protection of the Government, and have invariably turned round and rended those who have supported them. We can see in our forests something which will serve to illustrate the methods of the combines. Take the case of the banyan tree. That tree is raised from a seed which is borne aloft by birds and deposited in some hollow recess of a forest monarch. By-and-by the seed germinates and the young plant obtains a foothold and gradually spreads its root downwards along the stem of its supporter which is providing sustenance and fostering it. Eventually it reaches the earth, and its roots soon become embedded in the soil. The plant continues to grow, and eventually surrounds its once lordly supporter, and gradually twists and squeezes the life blood out of it. Monopolies are growing under the shelter and protection of our Government institutions, and by virtue of the security they enjoy, and once they become entrenched they will inevitably squeeze and crush the life blood out of the community. It is in order to prevent the development of this evil, and the dire consequences that will inevitably follow unless it is curbed, that we are asking for these additional powers. We should be wise in our generation, and do everything we can to escape the evils which have overwhelmed other countries. We have here a glorious heritage to preserve.  Our lands extend over an immense area, and our resources cannot be questioned. Settlement has merely touched the fringe of our heritage, and not a drop of blood has been spilt to secure the inestimable liberty we enjoy. Those who know Australia, and have wandered through its vast expanses, have learnt to love even its dry and barren wastes. We have also learnt to appreciate the immense resources of our fertile plains and dense forest areas. We have learnt to appreciate the priceless heritage that has been given to us, and the liberty we enjoy, and we should be foolish in the extreme if we did not take steps to prevent this overshadowing evil from destroying us. We have a land that is worth being lived for, as it is worth .dying for, and we should do everything possible to maintain our standard of living and improved social conditions. One of the means to this end is enlarged powers for the central authority, so that it may effectively cope with the evils which threaten us. If we do this, we shall act wisely ; if we fail, we shall pay the penalty of our folly. </para>

                        <para>. - We have been listening for some time here and in another place to debates on the series of Bills over which, as we know, this Parliament does not exercise complete control, but with respect to which we shall all agree that this Parliament is called upon to act in something like an advisory capacity. These Bills, after they have received the approval of this Parliament, will have to be submitted both to the people and the States, and, for this reason, I would remind honorable members that we are practically acting now in our advisory capacity. On this account, I shall be very brief in my remarks with regard to any or all of the Bills that are being submitted to us. There are other reasons, I might mention, probably without offence, one of these being the fact that there is not the slightest chance of affecting the decisions of this House, or of the other Chamber. In this connexion, I would recall something I have heard this morning, and at other stages of this debate, with regard to the change of mind on the part of some honorable senators on this side. I am bound to admit that there are, on. this side, honorable senators who have occasionally shown themselves so lacking in political acumen as to be unable to realize that the majority of their own party represent absolute infallibility. I cannot make that&#34; accusation against honorable senators opposite. The infallibility of the majority of the Labour party was at first a thing to be wondered at, but now we have become accustomed to it. </para>

                            <para>- It is easy to make divisions about trivial and unimportant subjects, but in regard to all matters which we regard as important the unanimity of honorable senators opposite has been remarkable. There are other reasons why I do not intend to speak at length. In common with other honorable senators, 1 had an opportunity of listening to the speech delivered by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> which, for close logical reasoning and the strength of its destructive criticism, was superior to any speech I have heard in this Parliament. This is another reason why I should not venture to address myself to the subject at any great length. But the main reason I have is that these matters will have to be decided elsewhere. If I have any regret in connexion with this debate, it is in regard to the fact that neither the Vice-President of the Executive Council nor the Minister of Defence, has explained in a lucid way, and seriatim, the meaning of these proposals. If these debates are to be worth anything as a record, or as a means of conveying information to the public outside, it would have been of advantage if some one on the Government side had indicated the exact nature of the proposals. The average elector will not be able to grasp the meaning of these proposals, or to locate the specific sphere of action intended to be covered by the respective Bills. I have found some difficulty in arriving at an understanding of their scope. Taking them briefly, the first Bill is that which, for the sake of better distinction, is termed &#34; the Trade and Commerce Bill.&#34; To me, this seems to involve the policy of the new Protection, as we know it, including, incidentally, the question of fixing prices. Then there is the Railway Disputes Bill. We all know what that means. It represents the desire of the Government to bring within the purview of our Federal Arbitration Court the railway servants who are in the employment of the various States. It means other things too, but that is the predominant object. The third is called the Trusts Bill. I do not wish to invite criticism or rejoinder when I say that the measure is regarded as a substitute for the Anti-Trust Bill which this Parliament passed in  1910.  My opinion regarding this measure is that it is quite unnecessary. I believe, as I said here two or three years ago, that the last Anti-Trust Bill we passed is adequate for the purpose. In spite of the decision recently given by the High Court, I adhere to that opinion. </para>

                            <para>- No. Very unfortunately, as I think, the High Court was not invited to decide the case on the basis of our most recent Anti-Trust legislation, and as we all know, there was a very strong and justifiable reason why we should amend the Act. No one was more interested in the amendment than I was, personally. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think that the honorable senator is quite justified in making that statement, because I can assure him that many of us who approved of the intentions of the measure openly expressed ourselves doubtful as to whether it went far enough. Even with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner&#39;s</inline> opportunities to criticise measures in Committee, he will find that many a measure passed while he is here will be found in the light of subsequent development to require amendment. That happened in this case. The grievance I feel is that we have been deprived of an opportunity of testing the. amending Act. I now come to the Industrial Matters Bill. So far as I can offer an epitome of the measure, it seems to me to represent the desire of this Government to have arbitration without causing a dispute to spread beyond a State. I can see nothing else in the proposal. I know that the Government resent the idea that a dispute has to extend from one State to another before it can be brought under the purview of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. I also know that one of the effects of that Court has undoubtedly been to promote and encourage the spread of industrial disputes. </para>

It is a strange measure. I admit that there might be some good material discovered in the Bill if it were altered in scope. I do not think that any honorable senator who knows even a little bit about company laws and company matters in Australia would be prepared readily to deny that the Federal Parliament might perhaps improve, even when it made uniform in this particular matter, our company legislation. </para>

                            <para>--Yes ; but since a vast number do carry on most of their operations within the confines of a State, I believe that the State ought to regulate those operations. No explanation is needed as to the last referenda Bill. It is an open and clear declaration for an ordinary elector to understand; and it is a declaration in favour of nationalization. I should say that the Bill represents the efforts of the party in office to provide the machinery and to supply the means for giving effect to some of the most prominent planks in their platform. With that statement I do not suppose that any one could quarrel. I have heard the remark that there are honorable senators on this side who are opposing these referenda proposals, first, because they originated with the Labour party, and secondly, because they contemplate that the Labour party will have the administration of them. </para>

                            <para>- I have no particular man in my mind, but I have heard the argument used in the Senate. I was not referring to anything which happened  elsewhere. May I ask the members of the Government party to consider whether there is anything strange in that opposition? Speaking entirely for myself, if all these Bills were accepted by the people not one of them would be of any use to me. So far as my political views go I do not think there is any necessity for a single one of them - excepting, perhaps, the trivial and unimportant reference I made just now to a common company law, though I think that that end might be attained by other means. If I and other members of this party think that, from our point of view, these referenda proposals are of no value, it surely cannot be considered strange that we should oppose them. On the other hand we know that they represent the machinery and the means by which the Labour party hope to go on with legislation.  I venture to say that the opportunities for showing to the people of Australia the beneficial results of their power are being rapidly curtailed - have practically, I think, from their own point of view, come to an end. </para>

                            <para>- I think that the Labour party have unanimously decided that this is the chief way. One regret I have is that Ministers, neither here nor in the other House, have not ventured to say that at the next elections they are going to stand or fall 6*y these referenda proposals, nor do I think for one moment that they will. They will, however, be placed in this position : If they fail to carry these referenda proposals, they will be forced to admit in- this Parliament, and to the pub-, lie, that the desirability of. their continuing any longer in office, and in control of the affairs of the Commonwealth, will have been seriously questioned. They will be forced to admit that there is not much good that they can do by remaining longer in office. I am certain, however, that they will not say, &#34; As the Constitution imposes such limits upon us, we decline to carry on any longer.&#34; They will not say to honorable senators on this side, &#34; If you believe that under this limited and circumscribed Constitution you can manage the affairs of Australia for the good of the people, you can come and do it.&#34; </para>

In answer, I have only to say that I should be very glad if the Vice-President pf the Executive Council, or any one holding a responsible position in another place, would say the same thing. I am perfectly sure they will not. The debate on these referenda proposals has supplied a statement of the desires, motives, and main objects of the Labour party should they continue to control the affairs of the Commonwealth; but I regret to say that during the course of it we have had, in the Senate, several expressions of opinion which I think had much better have been left unsaid. T say this without any party feeling whatever. I should not for a moment think of making partly political capital of some of the words used by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> but, speaking purely as a member of the Senate, I say that it is extremely regrettable that any one holding the position of Leader of the Senate should have given expression to such views. Those of us who are mere .privates of the army do occasionally use words which in cooler moments we should like to recall, but I say that upon the Leader of the Senate, to whichever party he belongs, devolves a much greater responsibility. It is very regrettable indeed that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> should have used the terms he did about the High Court. </para>

We have a means open to us of attacking the Judges of the High Court. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> knows the procedure, and I say that unless a member of the Senate is prepared to adopt that procedure in dealing with any person who holds a position on the High Court Bench he should refrain from intermediary criticism. It is regrettable that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> speaking as Leader of the Senate, should give expression to such opinions concerning Judges of the High Court. </para>

                        <para>. - I desire to approach this matter as calmly and dispassionately as I possibly can. We all recognise the importance of the subjects brought before us in these various Bills, which are to be referred to the people for confirmation or otherwise next year. A good deal depends upon the view-point from which they are regarded. We have established in Australia a Government national in its. character, and supreme with respect to all matters referred to in section 51 of the Constitution. We have also in Australia States which are supreme within their own ambit, and endowed with sovereign power to pass any legislation they please that does not interfere with the legislation of the Commonwealth. In all Governments, in Australia or abroad, the spirit of devolution is manifested. For instance, the States of Australia endow with considerable powers of self -government such bodies as municipal corporations, shire councils, district councils, and boards of health. That policy is pursued because it induces a spirit of responsibility on the part of the citizens themselves, creates a deeper interest in public affairs, and leads to the advancement of the best interests of the whole community. The idea of decentralization is favoured nowadays because it makes for good citizenship. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> observed that if this idea be followed to its logical end, it leads to the self-government of the individual. I admit that. It is well that it should be so. because, if an individual can govern and control himself, he is better able to assist in the government of his country. In Great Britain, affairs are moving in the direction of decentralization all the time. There are demands for Home Rule for Ireland, for Wales, and for Scotland. It is felt, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> showed, that the national Parliament is overburdened, and that it is necessary that subsidiary bodies should have referred to them various matters for legislation and decision. Here, however, the tendency is manifested to commit to the central Government all sorts of subjects for legislation which can be better managed by the States themselves. I do not for a moment say that the Constitution of Australia is a sacred thing. It is not a fetish. It may be altered to suit the will of the people. But when appeals are made to the people to alter the Constitution, those who make them should advance good and sound reasons. </para>

                            <para>- That is a matter of opinion. At any rate, I have not heard sufficient reasons for the adoption of the most important of these proposals. They were submitted to the people last year, and emphatically declined. I do not say that the Government have not the right to put the questions to the test again, although I do think that to put them again within two years after the previous decision is rather to discount the intelligence of the people by supposing that they will so soon have changed their minds. </para>

                            <para>- That may be a very good reason for submitting the proposals to the people again. I am not complaining because the Government see fit to adopt that course. The sooner a decision is arrived at, and the question settled, the better. But these alterations do not seem to me to be necessary from a national point of view. The demand is altogether sectional. One party, and one only, asks for them. The people generally have not expressed in any way whatever a wish that these proposals should be resubmitted. </para>

                            <para>- Some, yes; and we said so at the last referenda. We said that if it were necessary to give the Federal Parliament further powers in dealing with trusts and combines we were prepared to do so. But my point is that there has been no general demand for these wholesale alterations of the Constitution. The policy is put forward by the Labour party, and the consideration which weighs with them is not &#34; Will these alterations be in the best interests of the whole people,&#34; but &#34; Will they be in the interests of our party.&#34; That such is the attitude of the party I gather from the proceedings of the Labour Conference. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Minahan</inline> said at one of these gatherings - </para>

                        <para>The Conference was the parliament of the Labour movement, because the policy they decided there must ultimately become the law under which the whole of the people would live if they were to retain their majorities in Parliament. Their powers and responsibilities were greater than those of the pledged representatives, for the Conference could make and unmake politics, while their elected pledged representatives of the people had to confine their duties to putting the policy of the Conference before the people, elaborating it, and voting for it in the Parliament of the country. </para>

                            <para>- The Labour party never had a broad and liberal platform. They are the most conservative and reactionary party in Australia. They fight for their own hand all the time, and they want these proposals to be carried, because they think they will advance the interests of the Labour party. We have a Federation, and I intend to stand by it until I am satisfied that the Occasion has arisen for making a change. </para>

                    <para>The first of the proposals before us has reference to trade and commerce. The Constitution now gives the Commonwealth power over &#34; trade and commerce with foreign countries, or among the States,&#34; and it is proposed to strike out certain words with a view of very much enlarging the powers of the Commonwealth. As a matter of fact, it is desired to obtain control over the whole of the trade and commerce of the Commonwealth. Trade is the medium or pathway of commerce, and commerce, as I understand it, embraces every particle of business that can be carried on - the buying and selling of every article, wholesale or retail, from a button to a battleship. It governs all forms of transportation by land, river, lake, or sea, and embraces every means of transportation from the handbarrow of the costermonger to the big ocean liner. Nothing is omitted from the scope of the present proposals, which are intended to cover the whole field of trade and commerce. At present the control of trade within the States is left to the States themselves, and that is a very wise arrangement, which has worked well. Why should these larger powers be granted? When the Constitution was adopted the powers of the Commonwealth with regard to trade and commerce were limited, and certain control was left in the hands of the States, because within out vast area of over  3,250,000  square miles mainly undeveloped, and with varying conditions of climate and population local interests can be more efficiently controlled by the States than by the Commonwealth Parliament. It would be impossible to centre the whole government of the Commonwealth in one place. Are the conditions the same at Adelaide and Port Darwin? Are the conditions in the East the same as in the West? </para>

                            <para>- That is a very good answer. It is because the answer is &#34; no &#34; in regard to a great many things that certain powers have been left in the hands of the States, which are best able to develop their own resources and control their own trade and commerce. It must be admitted that centralization leads to loss of interest and indifference, and that it is much better to leave the local Parliaments to look after the affairs in their respective States, and to carry on their work directly under the eyes of their own people. The present arrangement is ideal, and works well. </para>

Nearly everything has been looked at from the industrial point of view. </para>

He settled the matte 1. That was better than twenty branch unions dealing with twenty separate companies.

They were face to face with combinations in industry, manufacture, and production. They knew very well that prices of commodities had been raised sympathetically with the increase in wages. It was, therefore, perfectly clear that unless Parliament could regulate prices and profits the mere ability to regulate wages was of very little value. As long as the people who had the control of commodities raised the prices the workers were very little better off. Therefore, the Commonwealth Parliament would have to regulate prices and profits. They were the beginning and end of the whole thing. There was nothing else in :&#39;. Bring down prices, profits, and rents, and everything else would come down&#39; with them. </para>

No one is satisfied with the present Tariff. Free Traders affirm that there is too much revenue raised on articles which cannot be manufactured in Australia ; while the Protectionists declare that the duties are not sufficient to maintain the present industries and establish new ones. The Government have been approached over and over again to revise the Tariff - to do away with its anomalies, to make it more just in its working, and, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers</inline> says, more comprehensive. But what has been the reply? It has been simply a petulant refusal . because the new Protection has not yet been adopted. The Minister of Trade and Customs has said, &#34; We will not touch the Tariff until you carry the referenda proposals. Until you give us additional powers, we are not going to do anything in regard to a revision of the Tariff.&#34; </para>

Even Free Traders of the Labour party say &#34;that they are going to have the referenda carried, and high Protection established, before they will do anything with the desired power.

                            <para>- It immediately led to legislation for the purpose of securing to the worker something like fair wages. Now we are to have the new Protection, a Protection which is going to enable the Parliament of the Commonwealth to control wages, profits, prices, and rents. It is, I think, a quixotic proposal. I do not think it is capable of being carried out, at all events, to any great extent. I hold that it is not possible to fix the price of any of our primary products. We cannot fix the price of a pound of wool, or a bushel of grain, or dairy produce ; nor can we fix the price of silver, lead, copper, zinc, or other minerals. The prices of these articles are fixed outside the Commonwealth - in the markets of the world. </para>

                            <para>- Any one who is familiar with commercial operations is aware that the prices of these articles are fixed in the competition of the world&#39;s markets, and cannot be fixed in any other way. If it is possible to fix prices at all, it is when the articles have been manufactured, and are being retailed. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has already referred to the difficulty of fixing the price of a loaf of bread because of the variations of the wheat market. The price of wheat may rise or fall, and therefore it is not possible to fix the price of bread. </para>

                            <para>- What I mean is that if wheat goes up id. a bushel, the baker cannot put id. or Jd.&#39; on the price of the loaf. The rise in the price of wheat is often too infinitesimal to allow of a rise in the price of bread. It is only when the price of wheat has gone up to a considerable extent that the baker is able to make a difference in the price of his bread. Before the price of a pair of boots can be fixed, it will be necessary to fix the price of the hides and other materials used in the manufacture, and also the price of the leather itself. The same course would have to be taken in fixing the price of a suit of clothes. There has been a proposal made to put export duties on both food and clothing produced in Australia, but I want to know how it is intended to fix the profits? On what basis can that be done? </para>

                            <para>- I warrant that in any business in which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> is engaged, he is glad to make all the profit he can. I never knew of a man being in business simply for the fun of the thing. He is there to get as much out of it as he can do fairly and justly. There is a further difficulty in carrying out this proposal. One man who has an up-to-date plant is able to produce more cheaply than can a man whose factory is not so well equipped. How is it proposed to deal with a case of this kind ? Is the higher man to come down, or is the lower , man to go up, or how is it intended to bring about an average? It is possible, I take it, to raise the cost of production, but it cannot be done without increasing the price to the consumer. However the Labour party may imagine that they are going to carry out this idea, they will find in the end, I think, that they have made a very great mistake. It is said that the Labour party do not propose to use all these powers if conferred on Parliament, and when they are asked to say what powers they are going to use, what legislation they intend to introduce, we cannot get a definite statement. </para>

These proposals represent an endeavour to disturb the Constitution, in order to secure for this Parliament greater powers in the regulation of industrial affairs. Exactly the same difficulty has arisen in the United States of America. To-day there is an agitation in that country to tear up the Constitution, merely in order to advance the designs of certain persons interested in industrial matters. They are worse off in the United States of America in this respect than we are. </para>

                            <para>- I have never previously heard that they dealt with the High Court in any way whatever. I wish to put in. a plea for the maintenance of our High Court, and that proper respect should be paid to the Judges of it. If they are to be the subjects of continual criticism and condemnation, because they do not interpret the Constitution as a certain political party desire, the status and dignity of the Court will be lowered, and much will be done to injure the influence of one of the safeguards of our civilization. I propose here to read an extract from an address delivered before an important body in New York, on 21st May of this year, by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thomas</inline> A. Emery, General Counsel for the National Council of Industrial Defence. He had been referring to just the kind of thing I have mentioned, namely, the earnest, insistent, and persistent endeavour of the Federation ,pf Labour in the United States of America to break down the Supreme Court. This is what he said - </para>

                        <para>The judicial department of our government, by its very nature, finds its last sanction in the respect and confidence of the community. Deprive it of that essential asset, you weaken  its authority more insidiously, but as successfully as though it were emasculated by statute. Possessing neither the purse nor the sword, without power to appoint, appropriate or reward, the judicial department represents in the highest degree the conscience and sane judgment of the people. By virtue of its functions, it represents the last refuge of civilization from barbarism, the final arbiter that alone saves each from the individual defence of his own by the sword. It is our last resort and hope. The legislator, elected for short terms, may yield under human temptation to the dominant passions of the hour. The Executive, but less remotely effected, may yield to a like weakness in the making of law and its administration. The minority or the individual, helpless, outnumbered, unpopular, alone, finds refuge against overwhelming force only in the sanctuary of justice. Protected against fear of the loss of popular favour by their tenure of office, the nature of their function, the established respect of long usage, and the personal qualifications which rarely in our history have failed to sustain the individual, our judiciary, in the most trying periods of national life, have faithfully met the highest requirements of their great office. Amid the formations of the two great schools of political thought originating in the lifetime of Hamilton and Jefferson, and all of bitterness and passion that tore families and political groups asunder amid the storm and passion of the great civil struggle; and during all that critical period of reconstruction that followed in its wake, our judiciary has stood serene, immutable in change, unshaken and magnificent in temptation. Let the rising tides of political fashion leave that institution, like the last mountain in the deluge, the last resting place of Heaven&#39;s light, the last security of human hope. The very storms that beat about our courts will but make them more secure by the support and sympathy they shall secure and retain from an aroused people. The very assaults of their enemies, the very bitterness of their critics, the very temptations of their task have won for them the respect of our people and the wondering admiration of human-kind. Let us hold that great system secure against the inroads of passion and prejudice. Meeting with firmness every effort to lessen the efficiency, impair the powers, or slander the reputation, of the human instruments of justice, losing nothing of our faith in the institution, because in rare instances it has been administered by unworthy hands. If we shall support it during the storms that now beat upon it, that great department of our government shall rise supreme over the discontent of this trying period, enduring as do the pyramids of Egypt. The sun of centuries has burned their sides, the countless storms of time have broken upon their worn but enduring pinnacles; the sands of the desert shifting about their base have but filled their crevices and made more secure their foundations. </para>

I do not blame the honorable gentleman, because they are so very wide. There is nothing with regard to labour, employment, manufacture, and the relations between employer and employe that is not covered by these words. I have always favored legislation to secure fair wages and conditions for workmen by the establishment of conferences for conciliation on the lines of Wages Boards rather than of Arbitration Courts. </para>

I say that if the powers proposed in this Bill are conferred upon this Parliament, instead of making for industrial peace, they will throw the whole industrial world of the Commonwealth into a state of turmoil, and will engender a spirit of unrest. I venture to say that the atmosphere of the Arbitration Court is redolent of a spirit of antagonism and unrest. </para>

To give the Federal Parliament power to make laws affecting industrial disputes gives them authority to regulate by penalties every detail of the industrial life of every trade in the Colonies. Surely that cannot be desired or intended. There is no matter in which varied local development is more necessary or desirable to a State than the development of its industrial conditions, and the industrial conditions in every part of this continent in years to come may, and probably will, very largely develop. </para>

Between December, 1904, and December, 1911, out of 19 plaints submitted only 9 awards have been given. The other cases were settled or withdrawn. The hearings occupied 313 days. The shearers&#39; dispute occupied no less than 68 days of the President&#39;s time. The agreements entered into numbered 136. The tramway dispute is now being heard. How long will that take? </para>

                    <para class="block">I hold that instead of handing over these many disputes to one body, it would be far better to allow the States to make their own arrangements for settling them. If there are differences between one State and another which operate unfairly, we might provide an appeal board to sift the evidence and bring about harmony. That would be a more efficient and less costly way of dealing with the matter. I do not believe that if an Appeal Board were established many appeals would be made to it, for the simple reason that it would be composed of employers and employes, who would know the conditions prevailing in their industries, and what wages were fair as between one State and another. A good deal has been said with regard to New Zealand and its experience of arbitration. A writer in <inline font-style="italic">The Round Table</inline> has referred to the New Zealand experience in the following terms :  - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>The past two years have shown that the system has entirely broken down, in the sense that a powerful section of employes has indicated that no legislative provisions will deter it from using the weapon of the strike. Plainly, therefore, the system must be destroyed or very materially altered, for, if the prohibitions are mere <inline font-style="italic">brutafulmina,</inline> the sooner they are removed from the statute-book the better. For many years the arbitration system effectually prevented strikes, but only while the victory rested substantially with the workers. Now, however, it is realized by the more aggressive and militant bodies that little more is to be gained by compulsory arbitration, and the old weapon of the strike is once again brought out of the armory. Quite naturally, legislation is powerless to restrain its use. For some time past numerous applications have been made for cancellation of the registration of the workers unions, the object of this being to enable them to join in or assist a strike without danger to their funds under the penal provisions, and trouble has been brewing for well over a year. </para>

                        <para>. - I desire to make a statement with regard to the caning of a cadet attending the Sydney Grammar School. Yesterday, I received a letter from the father of the boy who, writing from &#34;Cromarty,&#34; Wolseley-road, Mosman, on 10th instant, says - </para>

                        <para>I herewith enclose statement made by my son, which I believe to be a correct record of what took place. It is needless to add that such conduct on the part of military officers will tend to bring compulsory training into disrepute. </para>

                        <para class="block">After I attended the whole-day parade on 12th November, which lasted four hours, from 1 o&#39;clock till 5 p.m., I was commanded to stay back by Sergeant Cloustan for slowness, but I did not think it justifiable. A few others were commanded to stay back by different officers also. I waited until the other cadets (except those who had to stay back) had gone. Then Sergeant Sherwood came up and said to another cadet who had to stay back, &#34; It is hardly worth while drilling these few.&#34; During this time I was sitting down, being tired. Then I went home. </para>
                        <para>Next day I was told by Corporal O&#39;Brien to see Lieutenant Boyse, but be was in class at the time, so I waited till the luncheon hour, when he told me to go with him to the Area Office. I went with him, hut he took me to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. MacNaughton&#39;s</inline> office. I was then told to wait outside while Lieutenant Boyse interviewed the Adjutant, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. MacNaughten.</inline> Then I was told to come in, and the Adjutant told me the punishment - A Breach of Military Discipline ; then he read out the punishment - three months&#39; imprisonment, with or without hard labour, or the reduction of pay, or a fine of Thirty (30) pounds. Then he asked me which I preferred, imprisonment or the fine, and I said the fine. Then he asked me which I preferred, the fine or be caned by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lucas</inline> (headmaster);&#39; I said I would rather be caned. </para>
                        <para>The next day, Thursday, 14th, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lucas</inline> came to me in class, and asked me what I did on parade on Tuesday, and I told him that after parade on Tuesday I was told to stay back, but I went home. </para>
                        <para>The next day, Friday, 15th, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lucas</inline> came and spoke to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Giles,</inline> and told him the affair, and (asked) said, &#34; If we take proceedings they will not prosecute. What do you suggest?&#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Giles</inline> suggested that I should be caned before the assembled school. Then <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lucas</inline> left the room, but returned in a few minutes and said there would be assembly when the bell rang. Then he asked me would I rather be fined or punished by him. I answered that I would rather be punished by him. At assembly I was called up, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lucas</inline> addressed the school that I was being caned to avoid being fined Thirty&#39; pounds. Then to me, &#34; This is at your own wish?&#34; and I said, &#34;Yes.&#34; Then I was caned, and the school was dismissed. </para>

                    <para class="block">All I wish to say is that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lucas</inline> is the Acting Headmaster of the Sydney Grammar School, the headmaster of which recently died. It is almost inconceivable that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lucas</inline> would have told the youth that a caning was the alternative for a fine of &#163;30 unless he had been so informed by the Adjutant. If that intimation was conveyed by the adjutant, it was a clear case of bluff and bullying on the part of an officer, who ought have known better. </para>
