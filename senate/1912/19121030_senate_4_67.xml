            <para>- It will be recognised that there was no opportunity to do anything at the time. There was an uproar, and I do not think that the honorable senators who were interested were in the Chamber for some time afterwards. What the  President  could have done was to ask the honorable senator who was responsible for the occurrence to withdraw the remark and apologize to the Senate. That was the only action which I could have taken. I may, perhaps, have been remiss in overlooking the matter at the time, but I have no doubt that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> will withdraw the remark and apologize to the Senate for what took place on that occasion. </para>

            <para>- For the information of the Senate, sir, I may say that, before this question was asked, you took an opportunity to-day to speak tome on the matter, and suggested to me that I should take a certain course. You told me then - what I must recognise myself as being right - that the action I took and the expression I used were entirely out of order. It is quite true that they were entirely out of order. The action was taken, and the words were used by me, under what was, to me, exceedingly great provocation. </para>

            <para>. - I suppose that the Government are satisfied that no fraud can be committed under the administration of this measure.  I  have, however, been informed that it will be the easiest thing in the world to cheat the revenue if the machines provided for in the Bill are brought into use. I am not prepared now to go into details, but I was shown an article 011 Saturday last by means of which an imitation of a Government stamp might be impressed upon letters, documents, newspapers, and other postal matter.  I  was informed that  this  contrivance could be, and is being, manufactured for 2s. 6d., and also that it  is  being used in New Zealand. I wish to know whether the attention of the Government has been directed to the facility with which the marks made by these recording machines can be imitated, and whether they are satisfied in the circumstances that no fraud upon the postal revenue is likely to be committed? I have not sufficient information on the subject to be more definite, but the person who showed me the article to which I have referred told me that it would be the simplest matter in the world to perpetrate a fraud upon the revenue under this Bill. </para>

            <para>. - In view of the statement that frauds have actually taken place in New Zealand in connexion with the use of these stamping machines, I say that even at the eleventh hour the Government would do well to consider the arguments against their use advanced by honorable senators on this side. It would appear that, although the use of these machines has continued for some time in New Zealand, the authorities have recently become aware that it has led to the perpetration of fraud. It has been discovered that the die and mark impressed by these machines can be closely imitated, and there are grave reasons for believing that many frauds are being perpetrated in New Zealand in this way which have not yet been brought home to the offenders. </para>

Since then I have had occasion to consult authorities as to the possibility of the perpetration of such frauds. I find that in New Zealand, while it has not been positively admitted by the Postal Department of the Dominion, there is sufficient evidence to show that the authorities are not quite satisfied with the operations of the recording machines at present in use there. </para>

            <para>- I have-not, except that statements have been made, whether inspired by the New Zealand Postal De partment or not I am unable to say, to the effect that the Department is losing revenue by reason of the employment of these machines. When speaking on the second reading of the Bill, I had in mind a report which I read some time ago in the press concerning frauds perpetrated upon the Postal Department through the use of these machines. Since then I have had a conversation with a person who has placed in my possession one of the stamps impressed by a machine at present in use in New Zealand. I have also here a copy of that stamp which is almost a <inline font-style="italic">facsimile,</inline> and which certainly is as close a reproduction of it as one could wish to see. I produce the stamp for which the New Zealand Government received one penny, and the imitation of it. This imitation can be made by a machine or contrivance which can be purchased for the small price of a few shillings. I produce the contrivance also for the inspection of honorable senators, and they will see that it is not an elaborate one. It is part of an ordinary reel upon which cotton was wound, with a metal stamp attached. By its use a stamp almost identical with that impressed by the authorized machine can be produced. </para>

              <para>- Whether the penalty provided for will be sufficient to deter persons from resorting to the use of unauthorized machines when they may be so easily procured is another matter. The consequence of their use may be very important, in view of the fact that the bulk of the revenue derived last year by the Post and Telegraph Department was from the sale of stamps. It amounted to no less than  , &#163;2,600,000,  andthis means that about  1,000,000  packets are passed through the post-offices of the. Commonwealth every -day. The adoption of these recording machines may without full consideration be considered a step in advance, but there is every reason why we should be very, wary about sanctioning their use. I have satisfied myself that it is so easy to imitate the marks to be impressed upon postal matter by these machines that I do not feel inclined to support the third reading of the Bill. I believe it would be a mistake to pass it. In my opinion it is necessary in the interests of the public and of the Post and Telegraph Department to exercise the greatest caution, and that before the Bill is brought into operation the Postal Department of NewZealand should be communicated with to find out exactly how they regard the use of these machines in the Dominion. I submit the contrivance to which I have referred for the inspection of honorable senators who may themselves reproduce the imitation of the mark impressed by the authorized machine, and having done so vote accordingly. </para>

I believe &#39;that any person charged with an offence should be given a fair chance to prove his innocence, and I agree that in this respect clause3, proposed new section  102a,  of the Bill is not entirely satisfactory.

            <para>. - I join with other honorable senators in saying that the Government should be extremely cautious in asking the Senate to pass this Bill, or in bringing it into operation if it should be passed. The whole object of the introduction of the measure is to convenience large business firmswho desire to be in a position to use machines of this kind for the convenience of their postal work, and in order that they may be protected against petty swindling by junior clerks and office boys. But if the big merchants, who have large dealings with the Post Office, are to be protected from the little pettifogging swindling which they allege goes&#39; on in their offices, and which amounts at the very most to a few pounds per annum, how much more necessary is it to proceed cautiously in order to prevent the Commonwealth being swindled, not out of a few pounds, but out of hundreds of thousands, or perhaps even a million pounds before we shall be able to detect the swindle. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> to whom we ought to be very much obliged, has furnished us with incontrovertible proof that a stamp can be made very cheaply to counterfeit the stamp used in the authorized stamping machines. With such a simple little instrument as be has produced, which can be fitted on tothe head of an old cotton spool, and can be manufactured very cheaply, and purchased for half-a-crown, it is evident that the opportunities for fraud are very great. It seems to me that we shall by this means place in the hands of unscrupulous people a new method of trying to defraud the Commonwealth. </para>

              <para>- -We-have it in&#34; evidence that in New Zealand some serious frauds have been discovered. Why put temptation in the way of people to swindle the Commonwealth? Unfortunately, some people are not so strictly moral in their ideas relating to the revenue of the country as they are in their ideas concerning their relations with&#39; private individuals. Many people look upon it as not being immoral to try and swindle the Government. That is the reason why smuggling is regarded with such a lenient eye by so many. </para>

              <para>- Will not the same moral instinct prompt some people to try to defraud the Post Office; although, certainly, the Commonwealth does not make a- profit out of the Post Office, but works the business at a loss? It is essential that the revenue of this great business should be protected, as far as possible, against being defrauded by people who would have no great objection to &#34; getting at &#34; the Commonwealth for a few pounds at a time, amounting perhaps to a considerable sum per annum. But, apart altogether from the ease with which the stamp itself can be counterfeited, as we have been shown by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> it must be remembered that, no matter how ingenious may be the machine which is adopted, the inventive genius which could make -it would also be capable of making another to defraud the revenue.- The Department might adopt a machine which it would puzzle  99  per cent, of the people to &#34;fake,&#34; but another ingenious person might be capable of inventing one with which he would be able to &#34;fake&#34; the departmental stamp. If we have these machines scattered about broadcast, although the proprietors of the estabments in which they were used might be honest, and might not desire improper things to be done, nevertheless some ingenious person might tamper with the machine in order to see how he could &#34; fake &#34; it; and the Commonwealth might in consequence be involved in loss to a very serious amount.  AS  these machines are to be introduced only for the convenience of a small section of the community, and to prevent the littlepettifogging swindling which may occur in large business establishments, we should&#39; hesitate before laying ourselves open to the possibility of being defrauded bypeople who, perhaps; would not be tooscrupulous in this matter. There are  4,500,000  people in this country. Why should those  4,500,000  be rendered&#39; liable to be swindled to prevent the little swindling that may be suffered by a- few? Why should we do this to protect those who&#39; have very good means and methods of protecting themselves, and wellorganized staffs. at their disposal? Seeing that this machine is asked&#39; for by a limited&#34; section, and will be useful only to them, I am afraid that I shall be. compelled to vote against the third reading of the Bill, unless we have a more satisfactory assurance that the interests of the Commonwealth will not be sacrificed. </para>

He certainly read one or two reports that were up to date from business people, and I was also under the impression that he stated that up-to-date reports had been obtained from the authorities iri New Zealand. If that is not so, I venture to suggest to the Minister, particularly in view of the statements made to-day, that the correct course for him to follow is to adjourn the debate, and not to proceed&#39; further with the Bill until he obtains information. from New ZealandHe ought not to force men like myself, who believe in the principle of the- measure, to vote against it.

              <para>- No; and nobody suggested that ; but if fraud were suspected it would be a serious reflection upon the business capacity of those who control the Post and Telegraph Department if they did not resort to a systematic and continuous examination of the stamps used. That is one check. Another would be, not an examination of every letter, but an examination of a certain percentage, to see whether fraud was perpetrated ; just as an ordinary man of business, who is in the habit of receiving goods, examines them from time to time. We are asked now to -sanction a Bill which is to authorize the introduction of these stamping machines,  and,  at the last moment, things are disclosed which should cause us to desire to obtain the very latest reports obtainable from the New Zealand Government. </para>

          <para>SenatorMILLEN. - Before we proceed further, a cablegram-should be sent to the New Zealand authorities to ask them what has been their experience up to date, and whether they still indorse the recommendation of this stamping machine as supplied to us two and a half years ago. Surely it is not asking too much to request that the Government should stay their hand in relation to this Bill until a communication can be received from New Zealand. The Minister must see that good reason for delay is disclosed by the evidence produced this afternoon. I may make another suggestion. The Minister informed the Senate   on  Friday that it was the intention of the Government to appoint aCommittee to inquire into the rival claims ofdifferent stamping machines. I am not so much concerned with that, but I do think that that Committee might be set to work before Parliament is asked to pass this Bill. The Committee should press its inquiries to a conclusion with regard to the New Zealand experience before the Senate is asked to go any further in the matter. I suggest, therefore, the advisableness of postponing this Bill until the Minister is in a position to give us up-to-date information from New. Zealand as to what has been the experience there. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir JOSIAH</inline>SYMON (South Australia) &#91;3.40&#93;.- I was not present on Friday when the  Becond  reading of this Bill was debated. My objection to it is so very radical that I should like to go a step further than <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has done, and appeal to the Minister to withdraw it altogether. I doubt whether he would be able to&#39; obtain a report which would be sufficiently satisfactory to justify the Senate in passing a Billof this description. The only object of a change in relation to the stamping of postal matter is to substitute an impressed stamp for an adhesive stamp. The intention really is to bring in a sort of fad, or fanciful method of dealing with what we are accustomed to deal with in a very ordinary and satisfactory way; in a way, moreover, which prevents any possibility of defrauding the revenue of the Post and Telegraph Department. We are all aware that the objection to adhesive stamps is to the licking process, of which so much fun has recently been made in England . in connexion with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. LloydGeorge&#39;s</inline> insurance scheme. . The objection that most people have to adhesive stamps is that they have to be wetted. </para>

              <para>- That is  a  very different thing from this. This machine is like a rubber stamp which is handed about, and any person requiring it is enabled to put the stamp on the face of a postal article. The impressed stamp <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barker</inline> was talking about is a different thing altogether. It is like an ordinary stamp, although it may be part of the envelope. This machine is simply something in the nature of a rubber stamp, a more finished article, and more scientifically got up and made, and having, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has said, a private mark uponit. But as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> has put it very sensibly, it might be impossible to check fraud even by a microscopical examination of each impression, and if you did detect it, what is the penalty?

              <para>- But this Bill has been introduced with a view to bringing these machines into general use. I think what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has said is quite true, that at the telegraph offices it would be an advantage to have some machine by which stamps could be impressed at the moment, but it would be  a  machine held in the custody of the Department, and the stamps would be ofa particular design. What I would suggest to my honorable friends is - to go a little further than <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen&#39;s</inline> suggestion - that as we are getting on towards the end of the session, and if we received a report from New Zealand it would have to be further investigated, and, further, as there is no crying need or immediate necessity for the machine at present, the third reading of the Bill should not be pressed. If the Bill were removed from the paper, and the Government made this a matter of further investigation, they might render  a  valuable service to the country. </para>

            <para>. - I am going to support the third reading of the Bill, and for this reason : I believe that  a  stamping machine will be of considerable value to alarge number of people. We had the assurance of the Minister, in . introducing the Bill, that before any machine was adopted by the Department the whole matter would be referred to  a  committee of experts for investigation. The committee would examine each machine, and find out if it was possible for fraud to be committed. It will be absolutely necessary for the committee to obtain proof that the machine could not easily be tampered with. </para>

              <para>- I do. The honorable senator knows that; - some few. years Ago, there was a stamping machine used at the Customs House at Port Adelaide.&#39; A certain gentleman came over from Mel- &#39; bourne and got a copy of it, and by having that stamp in his possession he was able to defraud the Government of &#163;60,000 The position I took up last week was that if there was a suitable machine on the market - and I believe there is - the people using it should go to the Post Office, buy their. stamps, put them in the machine, and pay for them. There would then be no chance whatever of fraud. </para>

              <para>- If a machine *as left open, so that any one could get at the die or the stamp, fraud might be perpetrated. Some years ago the Commissioner of Railways in New South Wales put in1 a system of a time-bell in the tramways. Some one who understood its mechanism made a big trade by supplying to conductors dummy-bells that rang, but did not record, with the result that the Railway Department in New South Wales suffered severely. What I am afraid of in regard to this machine is that there may be some one clever enough to get at the dies, and to make imitations of them The only safe thing is to have a machine &#39; such as I have described, when the users would have to go to the Post Office, and buy their stamps, or they could use special stamps. </para>

              <para>- We are allowing that practice now. Any firm in Australia can perforate their stamps with the name of the firm. We do it in our Parliament in regard to our &#34;on service&#34; stamps. In Victoria, South Australia, and New South Wales stamps are similarly perforated. Any firm could do the same thing, and thus guard themselves against peculation. I think we should allow the third reading of the Bill to pass on the understanding that if an expend report is made to the Government, before the Government accept it, it will be laid before Parliament for consideration. If, then,&#39; it is found that the machine offers opportunities for fraud its  uBe  need not be sanctioned. </para>

            <para>. - The statement that almost any machine could be imitated reminded me of a remark I heard made that Krupps would undertake to manufacture to order a gun that would pierce any armour plate, and would as readily undertake to manufacture armour plate that no gun would pierce. No matter how perfect a machine was some ingeniousperson would be found who could imitate that. I object altogether to the argument which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> based on this fact, that we should not oppose this proposal. He argued that the facility with which machines could be made was a reason why the onus of proof of innocence should be cast on any accused person. There is a safe axiom that the efforts of a Government should be to make it easy to do right and difficult to do wrong. This seems to be a method of offering facilities to people to do wrong. We know on high authority that &#39; &#39; the sight of means to do ill deeds makes ill deeds done.&#34; I think that this Bill bears an air of progressiveness about it in a superficial kind of way, and, as stated by other honorable senators, it does not appear that the dangers which surround it are counter-balanced by the advantages which it offers. I quite see that it would be an advantage to have a machine which could be operated by officials in the large telegraph offices where there is often a congestion of business, as delay and waste of time is caused by having to attach stamps to telegrams. But this is quite another . proposition. While I know that Ministers here can generally put up a pretty good case for any position they take up, yet I do not think thatthe skill of even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> or <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> can induce the members of the Senate to believe that it is possible to guard against all cases of fraud in the use of these machines. We have then to consider to what extent it would pay any one to indulge in fraudulent practices. Taking the risk as against the possible gain, I think it is not probable that any person engaged in a large business would find so much profit in a thing of this kind as to obtain a counterfeit machine. </para>

              <para>- I do not think that there would be enough profit to induce a person in a large way of business to obtain a. machine, but I do think that it mightbe the means of enabling persons who  are  dishonest, and who now pilfer stamps from their employers, to make the Government a victim, in which case the employer would not be defrauded as he may now be. On the other hand, it would be a very difficult task to sheet home a case of this sort, and&#39; even if the Department did now and againfind some person clumsily operating a machine so as to be discovered, that would not prevent the same thing going on in a hundred different quarters. In this way a very big leakage might occur, and continue to occur. So fast as one case was sheeted home it might still be considered quite easy for other persons who fancied their ingenuity to be a little greater,to manage to do the same kind of thing. If there is such a thing as a perfect machine, and also a perfect check against fraud, that should be proved to us before we areasked to pass a measure of this kind, which, after all, in its larger aspects willonly benefit a few members of the commercial class, saving them a little troublein safeguarding their own interests. I think it is wasting our time, anyhow, to deal with what I must call pettyfogging legislation. I trust that we shall devote the rest of the session to measures of a great deal more practical value to the community&#39; than such a measure as this can be. Unless a very much stronger case can be made&#39; out than I believe is possible, I shall join with those who oppose the third reading: of the Bill. </para>

We have heard a great deal about the methods which it pursues. Why should not the Department takeevery possible means to convenience the public, whether the convenience will be enjoyed by a few persons or not? If large commercial firms can be convenienced by any method, contrivance, or machine, why should they not have the advantage of that convenience? </para>

When it was proposed to introduce bank notes, the whole cry was that the notes would be counterfeited, and lead to the commission of crime.

There are large firms in the Commonwealth which have an enormous amount of correspondence, and their convenience should be considered. If means can be devised for providing facilities to the general public or ilarge firms, the Department has a right to provide those facilities, and, therefore, I intend to support the third reading of the Bill. </para>

          <para class="block">Departments of the Commonwealth, to introduce any kind of machine for making stamp impressions, and, therefore, he desires the Bill to be withdrawn, and the old method of using adhesive stamps to be continued. I can understand that line of opposition; but I cannot understand the opposition of those who say that, because there is the possibility of fraud being committed through the use of these machines by private firms, therefore the Bill should not be passed. I want honorable senators to remember what the Bill contains. This discussion has been solely upon a machine which has been in use in New Zealand for some years, but it does not necessarily follow that that will be the machine approved of by the Postmaster-General. When this Bill becomes law, it is his intention to appoint a committee of experts to closely examine the different machines which are on the market to-day, for the convenience of the commercial community and Government Departments in the way of stamping&#39; letters. </para>

I have a fair knowledge of business, and I do not know the head of a big firm who wastes his time in stamping letters. What advantage, therefore, would a junior have in using such an instrument as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> has brought into the Chamber to-day ? The junior would get no monetary benefit, and the firm, indirectly, would not get any benefit. Apart from the firm, what advantage would anybody in the community get ? </para>

Apart from the fact that there must be collusion between a junior and the head of &#39;a firm before fraud can be perpetrated, it must be remembered that the dies have to be made under the supervision of the Government, and for all time they will be the property of the Government.

          <para class="block">That is the penalty; and if this Bill were law <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> would be liable to a penalty of two years&#39; imprisonment, with or without hard labour, for having in hispossession the instrument which he has produced here to-day ; and let it be remembered the onus of proving his innocence would be on the honorable senator under this Bill, and it would not be for the Department to prove his guilt. There isnothing in the imitation which the honorable senator has submitted to the Sennte. It is as easy as falling off a log to photograph almost anything. The probability is that a. photograph has been taken from an envelope of the stamp impression made by one of the machines in use in New Zealand by a rival inventor. I cannot imagine for a moment that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> out of the goodness of his heart, went to some photographer or die maker in this city, and, at his own expense, had made, the instrument which he exhibited in the Senate to-day for the purpose of proving that the administration of this measure was open to the perpetration of fraud. I see nothing in the imitation which he has produced. As I have said, a rival inventor has probably had a photograph taken of the stamp impression of one of these machines. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon,</inline> as a printer, knows that it would then be quite a simple matter to have a die made which would produce a mark very similar to the mark originally produced by the recording machine. Honorable senators will have noticed in the stamp impression submitted for their inspection the number &#34; 7 &#34; ; and the name of the business firm using the No. 7 die would be known to the Postal Department. </para>

              <para>- We do not propose to legislate for a particular machine, but the discussion has taken place mainly upon a machine in use in New Zealand, which is, to a certain extent, automatic in its operation. A. telegram or envelope is placed opposite a certain denomination of stamp. Then the handle of the machine is turned, and the impression of that stamp is made on the telegram or envelope, and, at the same time, the machine automatically registers the amount by which the firm has become indebted to the Postal Department. Let me remind honorable senators that it is not a difficult matter to photograph a bank note, and afterwards to produce plates from which copies might be printed. </para>

              <para>- I stated the reasons for the introduction of the Bill in moving the second reading. I said that a stamping machine had been in use in New Zealand six or eight years to my knowledge ; that a number of business firms there had purchased the machines and were operating them, and that some of the firms were so pleased with them that they said that if they cost four times as much as they had to pay for them they would not, if they could avoid it, go back to the old method of using adhesive stamps. I said also that different Government Departments in New Zealand have found the use of these machines of very great convenience, especially in connexion with the sending of telegrams. Any member of the community who is in the habit of sending telegrams, whether frequently or occasionally, knows the trouble to which he is put under the existing system. He has to fill in a telegraph form, wait until the attendant counts the number of words, and informs him as  to how much the message will cost. Stamps to the amount are then handed to the sender, who has to attach them to <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> telegraph form. If we had a stamping machine in operation, all that the sender ofa telegram would need to do would be to fill in the form, and pay what he was told the telegram would cost, and the machine would do the rest. It would be a great convenience not merely to the commercial community, but to thousands of our citizens. </para>

            <para>- Yes ; and in the different Departments of the Commonwealth. These machines will be installed if the Bill becomes law. Honorable senators should not take the narrow view that the Bill should not be passed, because it is intended mainly to convenience the commercial world. Commercial men form an important section of the community, and by the use of these machines they will be able to carry on their business more expeditiously, and also economically because we all know that leakages take place in the use of adhesive stamps. The proposal also has some advantages from a hygienic point of view. I hope that the objection to the measure will not be persisted in. Honorable senators must recognise that before these machines are brought into operation, the authorities of the Post and Telegraph Department will thoroughly satisfy themselves that their use will be in the best interests of the Department, and of the citizens generally. If it be still contended that opportunities will be afforded for the perpetration of fraud, I repeat that a punishment of two years&#39; imprisonment, in view of the fact that the imitation stamp impression can be of no value to any one but the firm using a particular machine, should be a sufficient guarantee that the fears expressed by some honorable senators in this connexion are not well founded. </para>

            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> who moved the adjournment of the debate on this motion, being unavoidably called away, has asked me to take his place. This is a Bill for the purpose of granting to the State of Tasmania a sum of &#163;500,000. I do not wish to speak upon it at great length, nor to deal with matters with which the Senate is perfectly well aware. It is within the knowledge of every one that a Royal Commission was appointed to inquire into and report upon the subject, and that they recommended that a sum of &#163;900,000 should be granted to Tasmania. The Commission started off upon its inquiries rather unfavorably. It commenced to investigate what was called &#34; a Customs leakage,&#34; and I may admit at once that if Tasmania&#39;s claim to assistance had been based solely upon leakages in that direction, no such sum as the Government propose to grant would have been justified. It is true, and I think is generally admitted, that Tasmania did suffer from &#34;Customs leakages&#34;; but she only suffered to a comparatively small extent, and probably did not suffer more than did other States. For instance, it is within our common knowledge that there must have been a considerable amount of leakage affecting the State of Queensland. In fact, under our system, that was inevitable. But as the Royal Commission pursued its inquiries, I am glad to say that it discovered that there was another and very satisfactory reason why Tasmania should receive financial assistance. I may remind the Senate that both <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe</inline> and myself have on many occasions, in the Senate, and outside also, drawn attention to the way in which Tasmania suffered under the bookkeeping section of the Constitution. The Senate must recollect that the claim which Tasmania has to make is not based on the facts as they exist today. She is entitled to a grant from the Commonwealth, not because of the existing arrangement between the Commonwealth and the States, but because of circumstances that existed in the early days of Federation. Those circumstances are well known. We had first of all in our Con- stitution what was known as the bookkeeping section. The operation of that section, until it was amended by Parliament, continued for five years. We had also what was known as the Braddon section. I was a member of the Senate - as were many others - when the bookkeeping section expired, as far as concerned the actual time limit fixed by the Constitution itself; but, of course, as we all know, it was provided that the section should continue in operation until the Parliament otherwise provided. During the time mentioned in the Constitution - five years - I, on more than one occasion, drew attention to the consideration that on the expiration of the bookkeeping section a different arrangement, fairer to Tasmania and the other States situated as Tasmania might be, ought to be made. </para>

              <para>- Both <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe</inline> and myself frequently referred to it. I might also refer to a statement made by you yourself, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> when we were discussing the financial agreement in 1909. The bookkeeping section of the Constitution operated very unfairly as far as Tasmania was concerned. When the Braddon section was on the eve of expiring it was urged that some arrangement ought to be made which would embrace in its financial aspect not only the operation of the bookkeeping section, but also the operation of the Braddon section. In other words, the financial arrangement has to be dealt with on a fresh basis. I venture to say that, while the present Ministry came into power just as the Braddon section was about to expire, and appointed the Commission to inquire into Tasmania&#39;s claims, and have since taken steps to remedy the grievance, nevertheless, any Ministry which had been in office at the time when the financial arrangement between the Commonwealth and the States came up for review would have given attention to Tasmania&#39;s heeds, and consideration to that to which she was justly entitled. I will come now to the main point on which this claim is based. It is not based upon any Customs leakage, but upon the bookkeeping section. It will be remembered that under the bookkeeping section of the Constitution the revenues which each State of the Commonwealth derived from Customs and Excise were determined by the amount of duty that was paid by the citizens of that State on goods that were imported into it from outside the Commonwealth. The corollary to that was that just to the extent that the State of Tasmania - or any other State for that matter - imported and used goods that were manufactured in some other part of theCommonwealth did her finances suffer. Perhaps I am using the word &#34;imported&#34; rather loosely. </para>

              <para>- Perhaps I should have used the word &#34; transferred.&#34; In the Constitution the technical expression is &#34;transfers.&#34; The position was this: If Tasmania imported goods largely from overseas, under the bookkeeping section of the Constitution she would derive a considerable benefit ; in other words, would be entitled to a considerable amount of revenue from Customs, because she would be the consumer of the goods that came from abroad. But if the goods which she consumed were transferred from some other part of the Commonwealth into the State of Tasmania, to that extent under the bookkeeping section she suffered. I remember discussing this matter in the Senate, and particularly referring to it- as a matter of special interest to Protectionists. I was not appealing to those holding similar views to my own, but to members of the Senate who were Protectionists. I made the appeal on this ground : I said that Protectionists ought to recognise that their best friends, and the greatest helpers of the policy which they favoured, were the people of that State which chiefly consumed goods that were produced and manufactured in Australia. I do not think that any Protectionist would object to that argument. No Protectionist would deny that the State or the person who consumed the greatest quantity of Australian-made products was the best friend to Protection. Upon that argument, the best friends to Protection in the whole Commonwealth were the citizens of Tasmania. That is why they lost so severely in the early days&#39; of the Federation. The reason is very simple. Instead of importing goods from abroad to a large amount <inline font-style="italic">per capita,</inline> they transferred goods from other States of the Commonwealth, and consequently were large consumers of goods produced in Australia. </para>

              <para>- Unfortunately, Tasmania produces very little in the way of manufacture &#39; goods. The value of our manufactures may almost be considered as nothing. It was  si-&#62;  small as not to be worthy of consideration. Every one will admit that the policy F Protection, whatever results it had in regard to the Com monwealth of Australia, has not resulted in any large manufacture of goods in Tasmania. That is a fact now, and always has been. Tasmania is too small to become a manufacturing State. The geographical conditions are against that. Every one must recognise that the manufacturing interests of Australia must always be in the chief centres of population. It was because of these circumstances that Tasmania suffered by Federation. If, for instance, we had got all the people of Tasmania together, we might have put to them this argument : &#34; The amount of revenue that the State of Tasmania will get depends very largely on the total value of the goods imported into the State from oversea; the amount of revenue she will get from the Federation will have a considerable bearing upon the taxation she will have to impose on her citizens. If, therefore, you will all com-&#39; bine to save yourselves from the heavy burden of taxation - if you will combine and buy only those things which are manufactured outside the Commonwealth, then you will be able, without any additional expense to yourselves, to add very largely to Tasmania&#39;s revenue derived from the Commonwealth, and consequently to save yourselves from taxation which the State may have to impose in order to adjust the finances.&#34; Such an argument would have been bad for any man with Federal views to advance, but he would have been absolutely justified if the one desire had been to increase Tasmania&#39;s revenue, and save the State from imposing heavy taxation. I do not want to quote figures at length, but sufficiently to show how they bear out my argument. I will take the year  1899  as a more normal year than that immediately preceding Federation. In that year, Tasmania&#39;s Customs and Excise revenue was  &#163;449,000.  In  1890,  it was a little more,  &#163;492,000.  Federation was established in  1901,  and I would like honorable senators to look at the effect  01  the Union on the Tasmanian revenue from Customs and Excise that is under the three-fourths distribution. In  T901-3.  it was  &#163;316,000;  in  1902-3, &#163;300,000;  in  1903-4, &#163;264,000;  in  1904-5, &#163;259,000;  in  1905-6, &#163;255,000;  while in  1906-7,  it was  &#163;223,000.  The other figures I will not bother about. They are practically similar. </para>

              <para>- Until the financial arrangement was made, the revenue kept down to about &#163;220,000, and since then new conditions have prevailed. The point is that in 1899, prior to Federation, Tasmania derived from its Customs Tariff, and that was not so high as the present Tariff, ,&#163;440,000. During the years I have mentioned, although Tasmania&#39;s population had not &#39;increased at as rapid a rate as could be desired, it still had increased. I would remind honorable senators that, had Tasmania, not gone into Federation, one. might assume that the Customs revenue would slowly but surely have increased beyond the &#163;440,000, owing to the growth, of population- and the general improvement that has taken place. On the figures I have quoted, I am safe in saying that Tasmania lost by entering the Federation at least from &#163;220,000 to &#163;240,000 a year. </para>

              <para>- In the early days of Federation that gain was practically nothing. But it is so hard to compute the exact value to Tasmania of that transfer of services that I have left it out of my argument. I will put it in another way. Many of us have strong views on taxation. For instance, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> has. I have heard him talking here about direct taxation as compared with indirect taxation. Let me tell the Senate how Tasmania has been affected in that way. Taking the figures in regard to the directtaxation paid in all the States, except Tasmania, the average per head is 18s. 9d. In Tasmania, the average paid in direct taxation is 32s. 6d. per head. Those figures are most instructive, almost alarming, I should say. From <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart&#39;s</inline> point of view, Tasmania, may be ideally taxed. </para>

              <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> will agree that the contrast between Tasmania and the other States is tremendous. I would point to one other fact to show what Tasmania is doing to adjust her finances. Direct taxation in that State has increased since the advent of Federation from  T2S.  rod., which was the rate ner head in 1899, *&#176; 32S- 6d. Per bead, which is the rate to-day. </para>

              <para>- The citizens of Tasmania have a direct taxation of 32s. 6d. per head, while the average for the whole of the other States is only 1.8s. 9d. The figures I have given are sufficient to show that Tasmania&#39;s financial position is a very singular one compared with that of the other States. Those figures ought to convince honorable senators that Tasmania does deserve some pecuniary compensation for the loss she suffered during the earlier years of &#39;Federation. The question we are discussing has nothing to do with our position to-day. The Bill deals with nine years of Federation, and it was never intended by the Government or any of their supporters to have any reference whatever to the state of things to-day. Tasmania has now no complaint to make. She is in the same position as every other State. It was anticipated in framing the Constitution that certain inequalities would arise as between the States. We could have no greater proof of that than the bookkeeping provision and Braddon section. I would like to point out that it was hardly contemplated at that time that the financial arrangement entered into would be other than tentative, a time limit being introduced of five and ten years respectively. I regret very much, of course, and every honorable senn tor for Tasmania regrets, that the Government have not deemed it advisable to give Tasmania the whole of the amount the Commission decided in its unanimous recommendation that that State was entitled to. It is not for me to go into the reasons . for their action. I regret it. It is for me rather to justify the action of the Commission. I do not hesitate to say for one moment that it would have paid Tasmania as a commercial transaction, to have given to the Commonwealth Government &#163;100,000 every year of the first nine years of Federation to be allowed the same source of Customs and Excise revenue as she had before Federation. I say that without the slightest hesitation. </para>

              <para>- I have been particularly careful not to deal with any controversial questions. I have confined my remarks simply and solely to the subject-matter of the Bill. Will <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Long</inline> say that if Tasmania had been left alone to make its own Customs and Excise Tariff, it would always have had a duty on this article, or a duty on that article? I cannot say what the State would have done, nor can the honorable senator do so. I shall deal with things just as they are without going into the question of policy. I believe that it would have paid Tasmania financially to have given the Commonwealth &#163;100,000 a year for the right to determine her&#39; own Tariff. In these circumstances, surely it is almost an easy task for any senator from Tasmania to say that, on the facts which are presented in regard to the financial arrangements of the State, and especially in regard to its revenue since Federation, the present Government of the Commonwealth would Have been abundantly justified in giving full effect to the recommendation of the Royal Commission. I do not think that it is quite sufficient to tell us, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> did, that we ought to be satisfied with getting &#163;500,000. I believe that the Government have recognised that the position is such that Tasmania is entitled to some assis tance. I know that many a senator hasrecognised that, too, before this question ever came up. I also know that many a member of another place has recognised inpast years Tasmania&#39;s real claim to compensation. If the Government recogniseTasmania&#39;s claim, and the facts and the figures do show that the sum recommended by the Commission, namely, &#163;900,000, isnot in excess of the actual loss which the State sustained, it is exceedingly regrettable, at any rate to me,&#39; that they havepractically halved the amount. I know that it is difficult for me, standing on theOpposition side, to offer any remarks which would affect the decision of the Government. I am not speaking in a party sense. </para>

              <para>- I can only hopethat they will have more practical effect than, unfortunately, any remarks will havecoming from me. I dismiss the question of Customs leakage altogether, because leakage happened, wherever goods had to be transferred from State to State. Queensland, no doubt suffered from Customs leakage, and even South Australia suffered to a. certain extent, but that, consideration I dismiss altogether. I submit that, on thefigures, it is abundantly proved that, because of Tasmania&#39;s loyalty to Federation, and the Tariff which this Parliament imposed, the State suffered. I say, further,, that the facts abundantly justify my statement that the State suffered to the extent: of more than the amount which the Royal Commission recommended Parliament should pay to the State. Because of thesefacts, if I am given an opportunity bySenator O&#39;Keefe, or any one else, I shall&#39; be only too glad to support a request, because I believe absolutely in the meritsof this claim. I hope that the Government will give Tasmania the &#163;900,000. I trust that an opportunity will be given tome to vote for that amount, because, on the facts and figures submitted, it ishonestly and fairly due. once the Government admitted the principle by offering; &#163;500,000. </para>

            <para>. - I thoroughly indorse &#39;everything which hasbeen said by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons.</inline> The position is not at all satisfactory to senatorsfrom Tasmania. While we fully recognise that the present Government have donemore than did any previous Government&#34; in bringing down a proposal for compensation we feel that the amount proposed to be- paid is too small. After this question had been discussed in Both Houses of this Parliament for a number of years, a Royal Commission was appointed to investigate the whole of the circumstances. I know that the chief ground which led to its appointment was that there had been a big Customs leakage, lt was discovered in the course of the very voluminous evidence taken that there was a leakage; but those who read the evidence, as I have done, will find that there was a great variety of opinion respecting the actual amount. Owing to the system of Inter-State transfers, it was impossible to discover what the leakage was, but it was put down unanimously by the Commissioners at about &#163;10,000 a year for seven years, making a total leakage of &#163;70,000. During the course of the inquiry it was shown clearly that Tasmania&#39;s chief disadvantages under Federation were due to the fact that she was taking goods from the mainland, where they were produced or manufactured. On these goods there was no duty collected by Tasmania, because they had been made within the Commonwealth. I do not propose to refer at any length to the evidence, but I wish to  call  the attention of honorable senators to paragraph 15 of the report, which is unanimously signed by the Commissioners. It reads as follows - </para>

Taking the evidence of all the witnesses whose names are furnished, it will be found that the consensus of opinion was to the effect that there was a loss of about &#163;100,000 a year. The Commission came to the conclusion that the annual loss was at least &#163;100,000 for nine years; but the facts elicited in the evidence show that the average loss for the period was considerably greater. </para>

              <para>- No; that argument has been used in the Senate, but it is absolutely fallacious. If the honorable senator had been living in Tasmania for the last eight or nine years, he would know that, in spite of the fact that the InterState duties were swept away, very gradually, but steadily, prices came back to the old level. Before Federation, Tasmania collected, say, 20 per cent. on articles produced or manufactured in Australia; but as soon as Free Trade within the Commonwealth was established, the producers and manufacturers on the mainland got the benefit of the sweeping away of those duties, because the prices were gradually and steadily put up to what they were before Federation. The statement has often been made that the 14s. per head remained in the pockets, of the people of Tasmania, but it is proved to be entirely fallacious. The greater portion of it has gone to benefit the producers and manufacturers of the mainland. I only say &#34;Good luck&#34; to them. That is one of the benefits they derive from Federation. </para>

              <para>- That is so. On the question whether the grant should bc &#163;500,000 or &#163;900,000, as recommended by the Royal Commission, it is clear that the difference of 14s. per head in the Tasmanian revenue from Customs during Federation would account, with a population of 180,000 people, for &#163;126,000 per annum. Taking the average Customs revenue <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> in all the other States, the amount received by Tasmania each year has been considerably less. In 1903 Tasmania received in Customs revenue 8s. 3d. per head less than the average received by the other States from the same source. In 1904, Tasmania received 7s. 6d. per head less; in 1905, 8s. 4d. ; in 1906, 8s. 8d. ; in 1907,  its.  ; in 1908, 10s. 6d. ; and in the financial year ending 30th June, 1909, Tasmania received us. 3d. per head less from Customs revenue than the average of the other States. This is another set of figures which completely establishes the statement that Tasmania has suffered financially as a result of Federation. -I do not hold a brief from the Government of Tasmania, but I say that the Governments in power in that State during the last few years could scarcely have made a more heroic effort than they did to meet the situation by an increase of direct taxation. As I have already stated, the direct taxation in Tasmania prior to Federation amounted to 12s. 6d. per head, and up to the time the report of the Royal Commission was presented it had been increased to 32s. 6d. per head, or an increase, of &#163;1 per head since Federation, whilst the average increase of direct taxation in the other States during the same period has amounted to only 2s. 4d. per head. Answering the question by another set of figures, let me inform honorable senators that in 1901 the value of the dutiable imports into Tasmania amounted to &#163;1,586,000, whilst in 1909, although there was in the meantime an increase of population, the value of the dutiable imports had fallen to &#163;1,486,000, or a decrease of &#163;100.000. In order to show that the population had increased, I may say that the total value of goods transferred from other States to Tasmania, and imported from beyond the Commonwealth, increased* during the period mentioned by &#163;1,156,000, or an average of about &#163;100,000 a year. In spite of this fact, E have shown that the total value of the dutiable imports in the same period decreased:* by &#163;100,000. These figures again showthat our claim is a sound one, and that Tasmania&#39;s position under the uniformTariff has become a very difficult one todeal with. This question is now a matter of practically ancient history. Some attempts were made to deal with it as farback as 1903. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> will re- ( member that at that time <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lynewent into the matter, and, speaking from memory, I believe that he recommended&#39; that Victoria and New South Wales should make some kind of compensation to Tasmania. At the close of the first five yearsof Federation, when it became competent for this Parliament to distribute the Customs revenue under a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> system, instead of under the bookkeeping system; I&#39; submitted a motion in the Senate to providefor that being done. If that course had?then been followed Tasmania would not&#39; have the claim to compensation which isnow urged on her behalf. The numberswere against me, however, and I was unable, with the assistance of other representatives of Tasmania, to carry my motion. Then we know that the Royal Commission,, to which reference has been made, was appointed, and its report was in due coursesubmitted to Parliament. My quarrel withthe Government is that they have notadopted the recommendation of the Royal* Commission in its entirety, because theCommission, after taking voluminous evidence, unanimously reported that Tasmaniais entitled to a grant of &#163;900,000. It is, of course, a question of finance, and the Prime Minister, who is also Treasurer of&#39; the Commonwealth, being possessed of afull amount of Scotch caution, says that agrant of &#163;500.000 is a fair grant at the present time. No words used by the righthonorable gentleman or by any other member of the Government in the Senate or inanother place have led me to believe that the proposed grant of &#163;500,000 should&#34; end the matter. I understand that the. idea in the minds of Ministers is that &#163;500.000&#39; is a fair grant to make at present, and that if the circumstances of Tasmania show at some later period that she is entitled to thebalance of &#163;400,000 of the amount recommended by the Royal Commission, the- </para>

              <para>- Certainly not. I was going to say that I think it would have been far better if the Government had adopted the recommendation of the Royal Commission. There is ample evidence attached to their report to justify a grant of ?900,000 to the people of the Commonwealth. One does not need to compare the circumstances of one State with another, but we are all aware that the State of Western Australia, under the present financial agreement with the States, is to receive on a sliding scale an amount of ?2,250,000, in addition to the amount of 25s. per head of her population, the amount of the payment made to the other States. We know also that Western Australia had her own Customs Tariff, in addition to the Commonwealth Tariff, during the first years of Federation. I propose, when the Bill gets into Committee, to move that another place be requested to increase the proposed grant of ?500,000 to ?900,000, and in support of that amendment 1 ask what better evidence could we have than that given by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs,</inline> the Commonwealth Statistician, who, it will be admitted, was an absolutely disinterested and impartial witness before the Royal Commission?

            <para>At page 806 of the issue No. 3, covering the period 1901-g, you give a table showing the surplus Commonwealth revenue per head of population paid to the States for &#39;1904-5 to 1908-9. Docs anything in that table strike you with regard to the position of each Slate? -  Tasmania, of course, appears in a very disadvantageous position indeed, while New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, and Victoria are in a very relatively favorable position. Western Australia, on account of her special circumstances, appears in a very favorable position. </para>
            <para>Tasmania comes out a very bad last in that regard? - Yes. I state in my memorandum previously referred to that in the nature of the case, a small State, other things being equal, is at some disadvantage, and T urge that as a ground for favorable consideration, apart from the evidence of the Tasmanian claim. From the figures it appears that Tasmania does come &#91; out very badly. In my memorandum of 9th </para>
            <para class="block">May, 1907, I endeavoured to compare, item by item, the previous Tariff of Tasmania and the Commonwealth Tariff. This was a big undertaking, and it was necessary to interpret as best, we could when there was a difference in the items, because there was a difficulty in that regard. It gave this result : - &#34; It appears thathad the Tasmanian Customs and Excise Tariff of 1899, namely, that in vogue in 1900, been in operation in that State in 1906, the revenuederived from this source would have been ?708,735, instead of ?326,395 actually collected. This indicates that the substitution of the Commonwealth for the State Tariff, and the accompanying provision of Inter-State free-trade, has had the effect of depriving the State Treasury of a certain amount of the funds, namely,. ?382&#62;34?, which it would otherwise have received. </para>

            <para>As regards its finances, Tasmania would have  been to-day in a very flourishing condition indeed if there had been no Federation.  1  donot want it to be understood that Tasmaniahas not gained advantages by Federation, but it certainly had to make sacrifices in the matterof its finances. I have pointed our what would have received some years after the advent of Federation by increased imports under our old Tariff between &#163;600,000 and &#163;700,000. I have noticed that already the figures have been quoted at this inquiry. In the year prior to Federation we collected under our Customs Tariff about &#39; &#163;497,000. So strongly was I of opinion that Federation was going to be a good thing for Tasmania that I spared no effort in that direction; in fact, I not only spoke from the platform, but also from lorries and carts, and all sorts of things, in fighting for Federation. We were always led to believe that at no time in the history of the Commonwealth would this little State be in a worse position than it was at that time prior to Federation - that is, that we should always get from the Commonwealth a return sufficient to pay the interest on our pre-Federal debts, which was something like &#163;319,000. In 1900 we obtained from Customs &#163;497,000, but only in one instance have we received back from the Commonwealth the amount of &#163;300,000. It has been a diminishing amount each year. In 1902-3 we received &#163;301,978; in 1903-4, &#163;263,191; in 1904-5, &#163;259,099; in 1905-6, &#163;256,391; and in 1906-7, &#163;223,727. I cannot give the figures for later years, but they can be obtained without difficulty from the Statistician. You will see that only in one year have we received over &#163;300,000; it has been a diminishing amount each year. Therefore, I am quite satisfied that Tasmania has made a sacrifice of something like &#163;200,000 a year in the interests of Federation. </para>

            <para>I know it has been said that while it came out of one pocket it went into the other, that under our Federal Tariff we get free a large number of goods which were not on the free list of the State Tariff, that we have also got a reduced Tariff in other directions, and that the prices of goods, clothing, &#38;c, have been cheaper, and, therefore, the people have gained a benefit. But my personal experience, and the information I have .gained from various householders, is not in that direction at all. They state that the prices of their goods are higher than they were prior to Federation. T am convinced that if we had simply gone in for Inter-State free-trade, Tasmania would be in a far better position financially, and we would not have1 such heavy burdens of taxation on the people of the State as we have been forced to impose on them owing to our reduced revenue from Customs year by year. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">To sum up, it seems to me that during the nine years which have been referred to we received in Tasmania, roughly speaking, about one-half the amount we  would  have received from Customs revenue if there had been no Inter-State Free Trade. Though only about half the amount of Customs revenue has been collected from the people of Tasmania, they have been no better off, because they have had to pay the same prices for the goods  they  have consumed, and the benefit&#34; has been derived by the manufacturers and producers of the mainland. On these grounds I think that representatives of Tasmania are fully entitled to. ask the Senate to give effect to the recommendation of the Royal Commission in its entirety. One need not go into history to show that such grants as are asked for here are not new to Federation. It is sufficient to say that in the Dominion of Canada similar contributions have been made in aid of some of the Canadian Provinces, whose financial arrangements were disturbed by the establishment of the Dominion. </para>

              <para>- Well, I wonder that the Royal Commission did not make it a million pounds. They would have &#34;been justified in doing so. All the figures go to prove that the loss for nine years was considerably more than-&#163;roo,000 per annum. Still I am. willing to follow the Royal Commission&#39;s report in its entirety, and to ask for  &#163;900,000.  To secure this end, I have given notice of ,a series of requests to alter the word &#34; five &#34; to &#34; nine.&#34; I also propose to move an amendment to do away with the sliding scale. My idea is that the Bill should be altered to give Tasmania  &#163;100,000  a year for nine years. I would have it remembered that such a grant would, to some extent, compensate for the period of nine years during which Tasmania lost a tremendous amount of money. We should not forget that the Tasmanian people were splendid Federalists. They were absolutely and intensely loyal to the Commonwealth. Although they knew that if they purchased, for instance, boots manufactured in Great Britain or America, their State would receive so much per pair, their regard for Australia was so strong that the greater number of the young Tasmanians preferred to buy boots made in Australia. </para>

              <para>- For example, I use&#34; such boots, but it can be applied to nearly every other article. I may remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> that it applies to sugar. Tasmania was loyal to Queensland sugar. She lost in that way a great amount of revenue which she would have obtained from Customs, had . her people chosen to consume sugar produced outside the Commonwealth. I think I have quoted sufficient figures to demonstrate that the Royal Commission&#39;s report left practically no option to the Government but to bring down a proposal of this description. The evidence and recommendations would have justified the granting of the full amount mentioned by the Royal Commission, but I am grateful to the Government for what they have done, because as one of their supporters, I am glad to feel that they have done the right thing. But at the same time, -I cannot&#39; avoid mentioning that the Royal Commission&#39;s report was unanimous, although it was a nonparty Commission, representing every State in the Union, and all shades of thought in politics. Whilst, therefore, I am glad to admit that the present Government is the first that has recognised the obligations of the Commonwealth to Tasmania, I am, at the same time, very sorry that they have not &#34; gone the whole hog,&#34; and given effect to the Royal Commission&#39;s recommendation in its entirety. </para>

Out of the surplus, the Commonwealth Government might have paid compensation to Tasmania just as Western Australia received special treatment. </para>

            <para>. - I welcome the arrival of .this Bill in the Senate. Like those who Have already spoken, I should have preferred to see provision made for carrying out the full recommendation of the Royal Commission. In that we have been&#39; disappointed. As I hope to see the measure passed, if not. in an amended and better form, at least in its present form, as early as possible, I shall be brief in addressing myself to the motion for the second reading. It has been observed by preceding speakers that the present is the first Government that has proposed anything of the kind. But as has been rightly urged elsewhere, and&#39; as I took the opportunity of saying most courteously when a similar observation was made by the Prime Minister in Hobart, no other Government prior to this one had such an opportunity of dealing with the subject as the present Ministry have. The opportunity is, of course, afforded by the termination of the Braddon section. </para>

              <para>- Previous Governments were bound under the Constitution to return at least three-fourths of the Customs revenue to the States. It was thought in some quarters, indeed, that they were bound to return not only the full threefourths, but also the unexpended portion or the surplus of the Commonwealth&#39;s own one-fourth. Even those who thought that it was not necessary for the Commonwealth to return any portion of the onefourth to the States, were, nevertheless, of the opinion that at the very least it would be necessary to have a definite allocation of the surplus revenue remaining out of our own one-fourth, and that opinion needed indorsement by the High Court. That is why we passed the Surplus Revenue Bill in 1908. </para>

              <para>- Exactly ; long before doing so I endeavoured to assist <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne, then Treasurer of the Commonwealth, to bring about a similar result. The work which I did for him at his request and upon this subject is to be found on record in one of our parliamentarypapers. <inline font-style="italic">Apropos</inline> of the question whether the grant should be &#163;500.000 or &#163;900,000. I may point out that the particular proposition which I submitted to the Senate on the occasion to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> has just referred was for a distribution during a period of twenty-five years- which the then Government were contemplating as the period for a new allocation of revenue as between States and Commonwealth - of a special amount of &#163;75,000 a year to Tasmania, diminishing by &#163;3,000 each year until the amount disappeared. If that had been carried the amount paid to Tasmania would in the aggregate have been &#163;975,000. The Royal Commission have since recommended that the amount which should be paid to Tasmania is , &#163;900,000, spread over ten years. I do not propose to quote a large number of figures on the present occasion, because the subject has been before the Senate frequently in different forms - twice on my own motion - and I am inclined to think that some honorable senators are coming to the opinion that we Tasmanians are treating them to figures <inline font-style="italic">ad nauseam.</inline> Possibly, if we continue to do so, we shall find ourselves in the position of entertaining each other within this Chamber instead of having &#39; honorable senators from other States as part of our attentive audience. I do wish, however, to quote a. few figures as illustrative of the decline of the revenue of Tasmania after the establishment of Federation. The figures are the net receipts for Tasmania from Customs and Excise under the Commonwealth <inline font-style="italic">regime.</inline> Reference has been made to the fact that in the year preceding Federation the Tasmanian Customs and Excise revenue ran up to about &#163;450,000. I am inclined to think that it nearly reached &#163;500,000. Nor were there any special circumstances to swell t he revenue derived through the Tariff. It was steadily increasing year by year. </para>

              <para>- In the year 1900- 1, under the Commonwealth <inline font-style="italic">regime,</inline> the net Tasmanian Customs and Excise revenue was &#163;475.568. There was no Commonwealth Tariff in operation until October of 1901. Consequently the revenue for 1900-1 was collected under the old Tasmanian Tariff. In the year 1 901-2, nine or ten months of which saw revenue collected under the first Commonwealth Tariff, the net yield of Customs and Excise revenue for Tasmania was &#163;373,140 - a drop of 25 per cent, as compared with the previous year. In 1902-3 the net revenue was &#163;360,607; in 1903-4. it was &#163;342,189; in1904-5, &#163;333,651;in1905-6, &#163;326,395. It will be observed that there was no recovery during that period. In 1906- 7 the revenue went up a little- to &#163;343,000; and in 1907-8- obviously in contemplation of the alteration of the Tariff, as in other States- it jumped up to &#163;409,000 odd. It receded in the first year of the operation of the new Tariff of 1907- 8 to &#163;374,000, and in 1909-10 it was &#163;391,000. It will be noted that throughout that whole period there was a steady decrease in the return of Customs and Excise revenue to Tasmania up to 1906. It has been said that part of this decrease was due to leakage, and part to the displacement of imported goods in Tasmanian use by goods of Australian production and manufacture. I wish to draw the attention of honorable senators to the effect of the Commonwealth Tariff in the two States which were, and are, the greatest States for the production and manufacture of Australian goods. Neglecting the odd hundreds, in 1900-1, Victoria collected &#163;2,570,000. In 1901-2, it collected &#163;2,376,000. Where Tasmania dropped 25 per cent., Victoria dropped but 8 per cent., and it could certainly then claim to be the greatest State for the output of goods of Australian production and manufacture. In 1902-3 the Customs and Excise revenue of Victoria rose to &#163;2,499,000, exclusive of the sugar Excise revenue which was put to a trust account. In 1903-4 it rose to &#163;2,443,000; in 1904-5 to &#163;2,488,000; in 1905-6 to &#163;2,537,000; in 1906-7, to &#163;2,719,000; in 1907-8, in anticipation of a new Tariff, to &#163;3,212,000 ; in 1908-9, it was &#163;2,861,000 ; and in 1909-10, &#163;3,048,000. Victoria&#39;s fall in the first year of the Federal Tariff was 8 per cent., as against Tasmania&#39;s 25 per cent. Victoria&#39;s fall only lasted for a year or two, whereas Tasmania&#39;s fall was 25 per cent, in the first year, and progressively steady in succeeding years. Take New South Wales, which has a great output of goods of Australian production and manufacture. In 1900-1, before the operation of the Federal Tariff, its Customs and Excise revenue was &#163;1,958,547. In 1901-2 it bounded to &#163;2,812,000, being an increase of 45 per cent. as against </para>

          <para class="block">Tasmania&#39;s decrease of 25 per cent., and Victoria&#39;s decrease of 8 per cent. The Customs and Excise revenue of New South Wales wept on bounding, attributable no doubt to the fact that it had not developed its capabilities in production and manufacture as much , as it might have done, the effect of a protective Tariff was a swelling of revenue from goods imported from abroad. In 1902-3 the Customs and Excise revenue of this State rose to &#163;3,478,000; in 1903-4, to &#163;3,229,000; in 1904-5, to &#163;3,033,000; in 1905-61 to &#163;3,233,000, until in 1906-7 it had increased to &#163;3,573,000, which was an increase of 85 per cent. on its revenue for the year in which the State entered Federation. The revenue of New South Wales has continued to increase, for in 1907-8 it was &#163;4,514,000; in 1908-9, &#163;4,263,000; while in 1909-10 it was estimated at &#163;4, 180,000, and actually reached &#163;4,449,000, or an increase of far over 100 per cent. on 1900-1. I think that these figures go to show that Tasmania can rightly claim that as regards the use of Australian goods per head, and loss of duty revenue, she has stood pre-eminently prominent among the different States. It was the use of goods coming most largely from New South Wales and Victoria, to the exclusion of goods from abroad, which caused this continuous drop in the Customs revenue of Tasmania. All the time that he was Minister of Trade and Customs and also when Treasurer, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne recognised that there was in Tasmania a displacement of what are called imported goods by goods transferred from New South Wales and Victoria. He put his case to the Premiers of New South Wales and Victoria, and at last he convinced the Premier of the latter State that he should pay a certain sum per annumthrough the Commonwealth to Tasmania, but the Premier of the former State was not so amenable to reason. </para>

              <para>- The Premier of New South Wales thought that the claim should be made against the Commonwealth. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne recognised that the bulk of the loss was due to the fact that New South Wales and Victoria were the two large manufacturing States from which Tasmania drew, and I think that he suggested that &#163;40,000 a year should be retained by the Commonwealth to be handed&#39; to Tasmania, of which Victoria should pay &#163;25,000 and New South Wales &#163;15,000.Senator Millen has interjected that it was not made manifest to the Premier of New South Wales that there was a claim by Tasmania against that State. I think that that is largely due to the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne had not the same opportunity for putting the case as clearly before him as he had to put it before the Premier of Victoria.. I know that he had several interviews as well as correspondence with the Premier of Victoria, but interviews which had been arranged from time to time between him and the Premier of New South Wales had to be abandoned. I believe that if the same opportunities for interviews had been afforded or the three Ministers had been brought together, the matter would have been settled. With regard to the title of the Bill - the Tasmanian Grant Bill- -I think that &#34; grant &#34; is hardly a correct term to use. It is really compensation. </para>

              <para>- It is better to have the fact properly recognised in the title. As regards Western Australia, a constitutional provision was made at the outset in favour&#39; of that State, and avowedly it was based upon its peculiar position in the group, and the fact that it had not then developed its manufacturing or producing resources. It was recognised that there would be an immense drop in the revenue of the State by reason of importations from the eastern . States, which would displace dutiable goods from elsewhere. But. I do not know that that has ever been called a grant. I think that the right of Western Australia to that special consideration was freely conceded throughout the Commonwealth. We ought to realize that the actual position and experience of Tasmania is very much like that which was foreseen regarding Western Australia. </para>

              <para>- No, but there was a special provision put in the Constitution that Western Australia should have its own Tariff for five years, but diminishing on a sliding scale, and subsequently, in connexion with the distribution of revenue, a special provision was made over and above the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> distribution for a certain period. The report of the Royal Commission has been received in Tasmania, I need hardly say, with marked demonstrations of satisfaction. There has been no hostile criticism levelled at it so far as I can remember. But I think that the bulk of the citizens of the State found, and still find, the action of the Prime Minister, in deciding to make provision for &#163;500,000, really unintelligible. I do not know that any reason has as yet been advanced for adopting the Commission&#39;s unanimous report to a certain extent, and practically ignoring the balance of its recommendation. I do not know that any Minister has attempted for a moment to give any reasons further than that he thinks that &#163;500,000 would be a very satisfactory sum for the State just at&#39; present. In these circumstances, we might expect to get some justification for this departure from the Commission&#39;s recommendation to the extent of 40 or 50 per cent. </para>

              <para>- We ask for what has been recommended unanimously by the Commission. I hope that in Committee we shall find honorable senators who supported my proposals for the payment of &#163;975,000, voting for a request for an amendment to increase the amount to &#163;900,000. Otherwise, I trust that we shall get some satisfactory reason, which we can take back to the people of Tasmania, why the Government and the Parliament have departed from the general principle which was recommended with such unanimity by the Commission. I have very much pleasure in supporting the second reading of the Bill. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lt.-Colonel</inline>CAMERON (Tasmania) &#91;6.10&#93;. - I rise to support the Bill, and I am very pleased that one of Tasmania&#39;s senators has intimated his intention to move in Committee for the payment to that State of the amount which the Commission recommended as being fair. There has been a displacement of revenue. Revenue which, prior to Federation, Tasmania received was diverted to the two largest States, and, seeing that a Royal Commission has gone fully into the merits of the case, I think it is only right for the Commonwealth to carry out its recommendation, because it has been clearly shown that the State lost to the extent of &#163;100,000 a year between the introduction of the Federal Tariff and the new system of distributing the revenue. I do not believe that if I were to talk for a month . I could put the position more pointedly to the Senate. The benefits of Federation have been mutual, except in respect to the distribution of revenue year after year. A large sum which Tasmania used to receive through the Customs went to increase the revenue of the two largest States, and it is time, I think, that it was returned to the State, not in the spirit of a grant, but in a spirit of justice. I have much pleasure in supporting the measure. </para>

            <para>. - I find myself in a somewhat awkward position in dealing with this proposal. I do not very well see how I can oppose it, but, on looking into it, I really cannot find any good reasons why I should support it. Undoubtedly Tasmania is in a difficult position. She is in the situation of a person who has got into bad health by indulgence in habits prejudicial to her well-being, and, owing to a somewhat drastic system of treatment of her disease, she is now in a <inline font-style="italic">very</inline> weak position. Several honorable senators have lamented the fact that, owing to Federation, the people of Tasmania have been compelled to resort to what they are pleased to term very drastic direct taxation. I for one welcome that fact. I believe that it will ultimately be found to be very much to the advantage of the State. I trust that, before many years are over our heads, the proportion of direct taxation now paid by the people of Tasmania will be equal, if not surpassed, in every other State of the Union. On looking into the Tasmanian Tariff prior to Federation, I found that it was one of the most extraordinary revenue Tariffs I have ever had the misfortune to peruse. It did not attempt in the slightest degree to create industries. It was reaching out for revenue all the time, and, like the horse-leech, was never satisfied. It was a Tariff under which it would have been impossible to establish manufacturing industries on any large scale. It was a revenue Tariff pure and simple. </para>

              <para>- I do not know whether I shall be in order in referring to the slow progress made by Tasmania during recent years; but during the period 1906 to 1911 the population of that State increased at a much lower rate than did the population of any other portion of the Commonwealth. The increase was, in fact, so low that it was almost on a level with the ratio of increase in the denselypopulated countries of Europe. That is a state of affairs which should not exist in a young country like Tasmania. It is evidence of the adoption of a very conservative or retrogressive policy. We are quite entitled, when discussing a grant of &#163;500,000 to a particular State of the Commonwealth, to point out how it is that that State happens to be in need of assistance. I find, on investigating the financial affairs of Tasmania, that 42 per cent, of her whole income is required to meet interest and sinking fund for her debt. </para>

              <para>- It requires something over &#163;400,000 a year, or about 42 per cent, of the total annual revenue, a much higher proportion than in any other State, and about 15 per cent, higher than the average for the Commonwealth. Going further into the matter, I find that Tasmania has spent between &#163;4,000,000 and &#163;5,000,000 on railways, and pays about &#163;172,000 a year in interest on those railways; whilst the annual loss on their working is over &#163;100,000. Another very important fact is that she has spent nearly  &#163;3,000,000  on roads, which expenditure, so far as I can discover, returns no direct revenue at all. </para>

              <para>- Yes. There may be an indirect return from the last expenditure to which I have referred, but I have no evidence of that. The broad fact remains that nearly  &#163;8,000,000  have been spent in Tasmania on making roads and railways, bridges, harbors and public works of that kind, which usually lead to large public developments. It seems to me that that money has to a very great extent been wasted in Tasmania. It may be that there are huge areas of good land lying idle along the railways and roads. I do not know which of the two assumptions is the true one - that&#39; the money has been wasted because the roads and railways have been constructed in wrong places, or that the lands along them are locked up. Whichever is the case, it is evident that there has been something radically wrong in the conduct of public affairs in that State. Honorable senators have been deploring the fact that there has been a very large increase of direct taxation and a reduction of indirect taxation. I point out that indirect taxation is largely drawn from the pockets of the poor, and that direct taxation usually comes from the plethoric banking accounts of the rich. Honorable senators, therefore, are wasting their sympathy, not on the poor, with whom one would expect them to have sympathy, but on the rich. I am not a bit sorry for the rich because they have had to pay a little more. </para>

I am upheld in that position by the evidence given by James Robert Collins, Accountant of the Commonwealth Treasury. On page 4 of the evidence taken by the Royal Commission, </para>

            <para>In your position of accountant of the Commonwealth Treasury, have you observed that since the advent df Federation the Customs revenue of Tasmania has suffered a considerable decline? - I have, and I believe that it is principally due to the imposition of a uniform Tariff, under which very much lower rates of duty are levied than were in force in Tasmania prior to Federation. It is also due to the abolition of Inter-State duties. </para>

          <para class="block">
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Collins</inline>evidently thought, as I think, that while certain taxpayers in Tasmania have to pay more to the Government than previously, and while the Government gets less from the great body of people than it did before, Federation has not been a substantial gain to the average citizen from the taxation point of view. As far as I can make out, a man getting &#163;2&#39; a week in Tasmania pays very much less taxation now than he did previous to Federation ; whereas land-owners and people earning more than that income have to pay considerably more than they did before. That is a position upon which I congratulate the people of Tasmania. I do not think that they are to be pitied, for Federation has evidently benefited, from the revenue point of view, the great mass of the working people of that State. That being the case, I, at least, cannot be expected to have any sympathy for the richer classes. Undoubtedly the new state of affairs has brought the Government of Tasmania face to face with a rather difficult position. Instead of still further taxing the rich, that Government comes to the Commonwealth, and asks for assistance. I say that when a person comes craving for help from another, he ought first to demonstrate that he is utterly unable to help himself ; because, if assistance is given to him while he is in a position to do something for himself, his moral stamina is lowered. I am afraid that this &#163;500,000 is going to do the people of Tasmania considerable injury. Instead of setting their own house in order, heroically tackling the rich man, and compelling him to pay very much more taxation than he is doing at present, the taxpayers of other portions of the Commonwealth will have to come to their assistance. It is a most important fact that, by giving this grant to Tasmania, we are not helping the working people of that State at all. They will have to pay as much in the future as they are doing now. We are subsidizing the rich man. </para>

              <para>- I hope this will not go into <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> In any case, I wish, in all seriousness, to point out to honorable senators what they are doing. They are subsidizing the rich people of Tasmania, who are well able to bear a much heavier burden of taxation than they now carry. We are not going to help the Tasmanian working man at all by this legislation. Those people will have to pay in the future just as much as they pay now. In fact, I am not sure that we are not going to do  something  which will even damage the prospects of the Tasmanian working man. If the Government of the State were com,pelled to resort to legitimate direct taxation, the probability is that the railway position, which is now most unsatisfactory, would, within a very short period, be materially improved. I wish to quote some figures, upon the authority of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs,</inline> with regard to public works and services throughout the Commonwealth. The average annual receipts from railways and tramways throughout Australia amount to &#163;4 19s. 2d. per head of the population. In Tasmania the receipts are &#163;1 13s. 9d. per head per annum. </para>

              <para>- I know all about that, but I am not referring now to income tax or probate duties. I am not alluding to any other form of taxation than land values taxation. I do not suppose that you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> would permit me to go into this matter at length, but if I were allowed I think I could show honorable senators that there is ample room for much greater land values taxation in Tasmania than the paltry instalment which is now levied. It is accepted everywhere that the building .of railways and the making of roads, &#39;bridges, and other conveniences largely increases the value of land. </para>

              <para>- I quite understand that, but the building of railways in Tasmania increases the value of land just as much as it does anywhere else on this continent. When you build a railway in any district you at least double the value of the &#39;land there. A man having a piece of land worth &#163;2,499 pays &#163;10 8s. 3d. in Tasmania. In all probability half - I might say a very much greater proportion - of that value is community-created value. A nian who has an estate worth &#163;1,250, in all probability, has the value of his land increased by the building of a railway to &#163;2,500. That is to say, the community has presented him with &#163;.1,250 sterling. Capitalized at 5 per cent., you have a sum which the community presents to him equivalent to &#163;62 10s. per annum. Of that amount the State asks him to pay &#163;10 8s. 3d., leaving him still to the good to the amount of over &#163;50 a year. Yet he has the audacity to come forward and talk about &#34; this drastic land values taxation.&#34; </para>

Therefore, I am doing my little best to try to remedy it. I may now tell <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> that I intend to vote for f-his grant of &#163;500.000 to Tasmania. I do so with very great reluctance, for the reasons I have given. But there is one thing that consoles me, and it is that I hope that within a very short period the people of Tasmania will be restored to sanity, and that instead of having a reactionary Government in power, as happens to be the case at present- </para>

I have not occupied a seat in the Senate as long as some of my colleagues have done, and I cannot speak with personal knowledge of all the happenings in connexion with her claims for assistance as they can do. I want to point out, in reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating,</inline> that the history of the claim clearly proves that overtures for assistance were made to the various Governments preceding the present one, but made entirely in vain. According to the comprehensive report presented by the Royal Commission, which I am happy to say was a unanimous one, the claim originated in 1903. We find that time after time representatives of the State did make certain statements to the previous Administrations, but up to the advent of the present Government the request for help was made in vain. In the report of the Commission we find this paragraph - </para>

            <para>The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Deakin),</inline> on his return from England in 1907, and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest held, according to Captain Evans, that any Customs leakage loss was not a Commonwealth financial responsibility, but one which ought to be accepted by the two States which were chiefly gaining by the Tasmanian trade, viz. - New South Wales and Victoria. </para>

          <para class="block">Captain Evans, at one time Premier of Tasmania, gave very interesting data in this regard. Examined by the  Chairman,  in reference to his remarks in Tasmania, he gave the following evidence - 446. Do I understand from your remarks that Tasmania was then paying a subsidy for the mail service by the <inline font-style="italic">Loongana?</inline> - It  was then paying the whole of the mail subsidy. 447. Although it was a Commonwealth affair? - Yes; but that was rectified. I must admit that, on his return, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest took the subject in hand, and put the service on a proper basis. Although it was only a matter of a few thousand pounds, still that was of great assistance to us. That was all that he did at that time. As regards the leakage question, he pointed out the great difficulty which the Commonwealth Government had to contend with. He said that it was not a matter in which the Federal authorities could interfere very much, that our InterState credits &#39;were principally with New South Wales and Victoria, but with Victoria more than New South Wales. These were the two States we were dealing with, as far as Interstate credits were concerned, and they -were gaining the benefit of any argument I put forth at that time as to the leakage question. Therefore, he argued, and so did the Prime Minister on his return from England, that it was not a financial responsibility of the Commonwealth, but one which ought to be accepted by the two States which were gaining the advantage by our large business with them. &#39;He was quite prepared to recognise the responsibility as to a fair amount, but it must be a return from those two States&#39; share of the Customs and Excise revenue. We failed to attain our object at that time, after holding several conferences. I even went to Melbourne on three occasions to deal with the matter. </para>
          <para class="block">That evidence shows clearly that the present was the first Government to seriously take up the question with the idea of helping the little State. I do not think that this aspect of the question has been touched upon during the debate. Although I intend to vote against the Government on the amount of the proposed grant, still I give them credit for having attempted seriously to do something for the State I represent. </para>

Although I am very pleased that my colleagues have refrained from introducing any party feeling into the discussion - and I congratulate them in that respect - yet I find that already in Tasmania, before the Bill is even passed, the party organs are endeavouring to make political capital in order to damage the Labour party at the coming election.

          <para>The Tasmanian Grant Bill. </para>
          <para>The Tasmanian Grant Bill got through the Representatives, and yesterday the second reading was moved in tlie Senate. The debate inthe Representatives developed some peculiar features. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Laird</inline> Smith and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jensen</inline> being controlled by the caucus, had to accept the &#163;500,000 that the Government offered. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Atkinson</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mcwilliams</inline> wanted to go further, but could not, because they were blocked by the rule which prevents a private member from increasing such a vote such as this. The real power lay with the Labour members, who could have exercised pressure through the caucus. They might also have made themselves heard in the House against the Government, but they were stopped by party considerations. This is one or the disadvantages of being a Labour member. You have to submit yourself to an iron discipline, whether it is against the interests of your constituents or not. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mcwilliamsendeavoured</inline> to corner both <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Laird</inline> Smithand <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jensen</inline> by proposing a technical amendment in Committee, with a view of increasing the grant. It was called a trick, but they hadto vote for it. Next week the Bill will pass the Senate. </para>
          <para class="block">These remarks are an absolute distortion of the plain facts of the situation. The question of a Tasmanian grant has not been mentioned at any Caucus held by the Labour party. This is not a Caucus question at all. It is one of those questions on which we are free to vote as we wish, or in accordance with our promises to our own constituents. This trash sent to a leading newspaper in northern Tasmania is a deliberate misrepresentation which is calculated to place the Labour party in a false position. I acquit honorable senators on the other side of any blame in the matter. So far they have not attempted to make political capital in this debate, but if they do - and I give them credit for being too honorable and conscientious to do so - I wish it to be clearly understood that we on this side are not bound in any way, and that it is not a question of which the Caucus has any control. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe</inline> has given proof of that by giving notice of a request to increase the amount. When a division is taken, we shall see how honorable senators on each side feel towards Tasmania. </para>
          <para>I have no quarrel with anything said against the Government in reference to the amount. They have the right to propose whatever amount they think fit; we, in this Chamber, are quite free to vote as we think fit, and I shall have a good deal of pleasure, in spite of the terrible Caucus, in voting for a grant of &#163;900,000. The fact that Tasmania has been badly governed in the past, and that past administration has stunk in the nostrils of the other States, does nol&#39; interfere with the justice of this special claim. It is altogether outside the question of the good or bad administration of Tasmania&#39;s internal affairs. </para>
          <para>Our honorable friends on the other side have spoken with two voices on this subject. Immediately preceding the agitation for a Royal Commission during its visit to Tasmania, every one of our Liberal leaders in Tasmania cried stinking fish. They said that the people of the State were poverty-stricken, and wanted help. That was largely true; but the same people, now that the State elections are finished, are to-day stating from every platform, and in the State Legislature, that the prospects in Tasmania were never brighter, that we were never better off, or in such a flourishing condition. </para>

            <para>Tasmania&#39;s purchases from other States during the bookkeeping period were comparatively heavy, the Customs revenue thereby suffering. Whereas all other States from 1900 to 190S increased their purchases from the Commonwealth from the value of &#163;27,424,000 to &#163;38,444,000, or 43 per cent., Tasmanian purchases increased from &#163;1,060,000 to &#163;2,534,000, or 139 per cent. Whilst this increase of &#163;1,474,000 took place, the other States increased their purchases from Tasmania by &#163;677,000. If the difference be credited to Tasmania on a 20 per cent, basis for Customs purposes, the State&#39;s revenue would be increased by &#163;159,400 per annum. Tasmania&#39;s total imports in 1900 were &#163;9 14s. 6d. per head. In 1908 they were &#163;18 ns. per head, an increase of 16s. 6d. Of that sum &#163;7 10s. rod. <inline font-style="italic">fer capita</inline> represents the increase in Inter-State imports. </para>

              <para>- Yes; because they were paying higher wages, and getting a very much higher standard of efficiency, once more exploding the old economic axiom, that low wages mean cheap goods. Tasmania had a wage-list which was  10, 20,  and even  30  per cent, lower than that of Victoria, yet Victorian manufacturers sent goods to Tasmania, paid the freight, and undersold us. Why ? Because they had efficient and well-organized factories. They had machinery and men capable of turning out goods superior to anything in the Commonwealth at a lower price. </para>

              <para>- That is the point. The increase in employes in the other States was about  25.  per cent., while in Tasmania it was  17  per cent. We found even worse than that. Victorian manufacturers dumped goods into Tasmania, and undersold our factories. They sent in their goods, and sold them at cost price until they had ruined our factories, and obtained the trade, when at once they reverted to the old standard and Tasmania still had to pay. That is one very vital matter which was dealt with at length by the Royal Commission. They proved beyond a doubt &#91;hat dumping did take place, and was very detrimental to Tasmania&#39;s trade relations. On that ground alone, leaving out the  &#163;70,000  for leakage, we are entitled to all that the Commission recommended, </para>

The Tariff Commission made many recommendations, and how many were adopted? The Oversea Shipping Commission, the Navigation Commission, and the Postal Commission all made numerous recommendations, but in no case were they adopted, <inline font-style="italic">in toto.</inline> It is quite the rule that the recommendations of Royal Commissions are not fully given effect to. </para>

I am glad to have the assurance of the Vice-President of the Executive Council that the amount proposed by the Government may be regarded as an instalment, and that, if a future Administration is disposed to grant Tasmania the balance of the  &#163;900,000  recommended by the Royal Commission, it will be admitted that we can put up a good claim for it.

              <para>- I am glad to hear the honorable senator say so. I can give figures to show that, if we taxed ourselves in Tasmania to carry out a public works policy on the lines adopted in the other States, our State would at once become bankrupt. In 1908-9 the Tasmanian people paid in direct taxation &#163;1 7s.per <inline font-style="italic">capita.</inline> There was 25 per cent. added for surtax, income, land, and ability tax, equal to 5s. 6d. <inline font-style="italic">per capita.</inline> If Tasmania is to remain solvent, she cannot continue the policy at present adopted for the construction of roads, bridges, and unproductive works from borrowed money. The facts show that the public men controlling the affairs of Tasmania in the past did not possess the statesmanship of a bullfrog. It is not right that we should continue to finance Tasmania on such lines. I find that even ex-Senator Dobson, who will scarcely be regarded by any one as a Democrat, in giv- ing evidence before the Commission, said - </para>

              <para>- I admit that it is; but some of our friends on the other side, during the recent State election, went through Tasmania justifying the expendi ture of borrowed money upon the construction of non-productive works. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart&#39;s</inline> criticism was searching, and we must admit that that policy will have to be altered, and a more honest system of finance introduced. If in Tasmania we are to pay for roads and bridges out of revenue, it will require an amount equal to 14s. 9d. per head of the population, and that money would have to be raised by taxation. That would bring the direct taxation of Tasmania up to &#163;2 13s.8d <inline font-style="italic">per capita.</inline> If Tasmania spent thesame average amount as the other States on the important and vital matter of education, it would involve additional direct taxation to the extent of3s. 8d. <inline font-style="italic">per capita.</inline> If she subsidized hospitals and benevolent institutions as liberally as do the other States further taxation to the amount of1s. 4&#189;d. <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> would be required for the purpose. If she spent as much proportionately as is spent in the other States on technical education, another 4d. <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> would be required. If Tasmania protected the people and property of the State to the same extent as is done in the other States, additional taxation to the extent of1s. 7d. <inline font-style="italic">per capia</inline> would be involved ; and, when all these things were done, direct taxation in Tasmania would then amount to &#163;3 os. 8d. <inline font-style="italic">per capita,</inline> as against 16s.5d. for the rest of Australia. </para>

          <para>I maintain that the finances of Tasmania must be established on a different basis, and she must, at the same time, be compensated for her losses through Federation. These losses are due to causes altogether apart from those which have made Tasmania the most backward amongst the States in the matter of internal administration. I was very pleased to hear my colleague from Tasmania - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> - say that in the past honorable senators representing Tasmaniahave expressed a desire that something should be done for that State, and that many an honorable senator had recognised in past years Tasmania&#39;s claim to compensation. But, with all due respect to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons,</inline> I point out that they did no more than express a desire ; and I repeat that the present Government is the first Government of the Commonwealth that has evinced a desire to do something tangible to assist Tasmania. </para>

              <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Long</inline> has put the matter very nicely. The present Government are the only Government of the Commonwealth who have had the courage to make such a proposal. I believe that, if they did not hold possession of the Treasury benches, and Tasmania were not represented by so many Labour men as sit in the National Parliament to-day, we should not be discussing this Bill to-night. I believe that it is wholly due to the increased Labour representation sent to this Parliament by Tasmania that we are now discussing a proposal for special assistance to the State I represent. In justice to the Government I am supporting, I want that statement to be made public. </para>

I frankly recognise the fact that the Government have grappled with the question with an earnest desire that long-delayed justice should at last be done to the Cinderella State of the Commonwealth. Our claim is a just one, and, although we are asking for assistance under section 96 of the Constitution, we make our claim without any loss of self-respect, because Tasmania is entitled to the grant recommended by the Royal Commission.  Her  people have been good Federalists, and good members of the Commonwealth. It is for that reason that they have been penalized, and, when the Government are attempting to help us out of our difficulties, I should be lacking in my duty as a representative of Tasmania if I did not frankly express appreciation of their action. </para>

            <para>.- Owing to the fact that for weeks past I have suffered from a severe dental trouble, it is impossible for me to discuss, at any great length, the matter now before the Senate, though it is, of course, of great moment to the State from which I come. I cannot allow the second reading of the Bill to pass without expressing the gratitude I feel to the present Government for the very prompt manner in which they proceeded to deal with the question of assistance to Tasmania as soon as they sssumed possession of the Treasury benches. It is a matter of history that the Government were not in office for more than a few weeks when a motion was submitted by a representative of Tasmania for the appointment of a Select Committee to investigate the claims of that State to a special grant. The Select Committee was subsequently converted into a Royal Commission, the members of which visited various States and inquired very exhaustively into the whole question. No member of the Government or of the Senate can claim to express anything like as sound an opinion upon the justice of Tasmania&#39;s claims as can the members of that Commission. The fact that they unanimously recommended that Tasmania is entitled to a grant of &#163;900,000 should of itself have been sufficient to induce the Government to treat that State more generously than they propose to do in this Bill. I feel sure that it will not alarm the members of the Government in the Senate when I say that the combined forces from the State of Tasmania will fight to the last ditch to secure for that State the full amountrecommended by the Royal Commission. We can look to our friends on the Opposition benches to come to the assistance of our little State in this matter. I should like to say to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> without entering into any question of party, and without being too critical of the mismanagement of past Governments in Tasmania which the honorable <inline font-weight="bold">Senator says</inline> in a measure was responsible for the present position of the State, that the patriotism of Tasmania, and her loyalty to the Federation, has, in some measure, contributed to her present position. It is because Tasmanians, setting an example which, I am sorry to say, has not been followed by other States of the Commonwealth, have used and consumed Australian-made goods, that the State is in her present position. If the people of the other States had followed that example, our imports would not have increased so hugely as they have done. </para>

              <para>- Western Australia is, perhaps, second to Tasmania in that respect. 1 am hopeful that the Government, even before a vote is taken on the request given notice of by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe,</inline> will come to the conclusion that the honorable senator&#39;s proposal is a reasonable one; that it will meet with their approval, and that the Bill will be returned to the House of Representatives withthe request that the grant should be increased to &#163;900,000. I regret that, for the reason I have mentioned, I am not able to go into the question as fully as I should like, but if I were in the best condition, I, perhaps, could not add anything to the arguments which have been so clearly, logically, and collectively put before the Senate by other representatives of Tasmania. I content myself by expressing the hope that to-morrow we shall be able to send across to Tasmania the good news that the Senate, which, after all, is the States&#39; House, has taken a more just view of Tasmania&#39;s claim than was taken of it in another place, and has agreed to confirm the recommendation of the Royal Commission and give her &#163;900,000. </para>

I have here the report of the Royal Commission, and I see that it commenced its duties on the 10th August, 1910, and the report is dated 23rd September, 1 01 1. In the circumstances, I do not know that there is any great reason to complain of delay in the matter. The Tasmanian claim is either just or unjust. It is right that we should recognise it in full or that we should refuse to recognise it altogether. But the Government have recognised the claim to a certain extent. The Royal Commission, after investigating the matter thoroughly, and taking evidence which covered between 300 and 400 pages, came to a unanimous conclusion that the sum of &#163;900,000 should be paid to Tasmania to recoup her for the loss she had sustained because of her entry into the Federation. </para>

The members brought up a unanimous report, recommending that &#163;900,000 should be paid to Tasmania; and, that being so, I am at a loss to understand why the Government should have proposed a compromise in the matter. It certainly cannot be owing to shortness of funds, because we know that their expenditure in many directions has been exceedingly lavish. </para>

            <para>. - I am rather glad that this opportunity is presented of doing somewhat belated justice to the State of Tasmania. I differ from some of my colleagues who have alleged that the proposed, grant is something in the nature of charity. I regard it as simply an act of justice. Coming, as I do, from another State of the Commonwealth that has been .similarly situated, I can sympathize fully with the Tasmanian people in their present position. If we only look to one indication of progress we can see that the island State, in comparison with other States, has not occupied a favorable situation. I take the number of employes engaged in factories. If we turn to the statistics for New South Wales, Victoria, and Queensland, we see that the number of persons employed in factories has increased enormously during the last seven years. In the powerful State of New South Wales, where a new policy has been enforced, which has made for prosperity, the number of employes in factories has increased 50 per cent., whereas in Tasmania the increase has been very far below that proportion. </para>

              <para>- The reason is that through the throwing down of the Tariff walls under Federation the manufacturers of neighbouring States, where industries are more highly organized, were able to flood the Tasmanian markets with their products. The industries in that State were not so highly developed. As a result, a large number of men, who formerly worked in Tasmanian factories, sought employment on the mainland, and shifted their domiciles. This is one of the direct results of Federation, and it is such a result as will always follow a Federation having the conditions which exist in Australia. The States in which there were large centres of population, and where there were highly organized industries, were favorably situated in the matter of competition in comparison with smaller communities. To some extent, the same thing happened in Western Australia. There were industries there which were in the early stages of development. Some of them have .since gone altogether, and others are maintaining a meagre existence. The result is plainly shown in the dwindling number of factories. I intend to vote for this proposal in the belief that it is nothing but a simple act of natural justice to Tasmania. I should like to vote for the full amount recommended by the Royal Commission, but I think that in supporting the Government proposition we shall be going a great way towards securing justice to Tasmania to compensate her for the position in which she finds herself. It is not her fault that she is in a weak financial position. It is simply the result of federating with the other States of the Commonwealth. It is but reasonable, therefore, for the other States, which have benefited to the extent that Tasmania has suffered, to come to her assistance, and recoup her fairly for the loss which she has sustained. 1 shall vote for the proposal of the Government, believing that it is a fair one ; but if, in the future, the facts reveal that Tasmania is still in a condition demanding assistance, I shall be prepared to review the case, and vote for further compensation or recompense, if that be necessary. </para>

          <para class="block">L9-S&#93;-  - I do not think that any criticism of a very vital character has been advanced against the Government proposal. Although the members of the Opposition have been very generous, and Government supporters have been fair in their criticism, still I think that some reply is necessary to assertions that have been made on both sides. I am pleased to hear from&#39; those senators who support the Government that they recognise that we are the first Government to take this matter up seriously. Members of the Opposition, by interjec tion, have sought to make it appear that it was not within the power of the Commonwealth Parliament, prior to  1910,  to doanything of the kind. Even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons,</inline> backed up by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating,</inline> referred to the financial sections of the Constitution, and especially to the Braddonsection. I reply that there is not a section in the Constitution which offered the slightest bar to any previous Government doing, what this Government is now proposing. Let honorable senators read section-  96  of the Constitution. It lays it down that for a period of ten years after the establishment of the Commonwealth, and until the Parliament otherwise provides, such financial assistance may be granted to any State as Parliament thinks &#34;fit. Is there any condition or embargo there? A Government could have taken action tenyears ago; and it certainly is not because the attention of the Government of the day was not called to the position of Tasmania that action was not taken. </para>

              <para>- She complained that she had not sufficient revenue to meet her requirements. It seems a very peculiar thing that any excuse should be made on behalf of any past Government on this account, because; during the first ten yearsthe Commonwealth paid back to the States  &#163;6,059,000,  out of which it could have taken action in this direction; and that is twelve times the amount that is being set apart by the present Government to assist. Tasmania. As I said in my secondreading speech, it is hardly fair when we are going to assist a friend, a brother, or a relation to say anything about the reasonswhy such assistance is necessary. But statements have been made during the course of the debate by those who have been advocating the cause of Tasmania to the effect that the amount derived from Customs and Excise revenue fell from-  &#163;475,000  in  1900  to a little over  &#163;220,000  a few years later. If honorable senators look closely into the question, they will find that the  &#163;475,000  was taken out of the pockets of the people of Tasmania. Does anybody imagine that they did not feel it? A few years later, only &#163;220,000 was taken out of their pockets. </para>

              <para>- I am not saying anything of the kind, but I am pointing out in my own way the sophistry and fallacy of an argument of that description. In combating these statements, I am no less a friend of Tasmania than I ever was, and I am prepared to do all I possibly can for her. It is not the fault of the majority of the people of that State that they have not been able to put their affairs on a better foundation. We know that they have not been able to work out their own salvation, but we hope that in future they will do so. I have shown that that money still remained in the pockets of the people, and, consequently, as it was not taken out by Federation, there was no loss to the people of Tasmania generally. Another statement that has been made is that the people of Tasmania were loyal to Federation, because, instead of consuming imported goods, they purchased Australian made articles. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> has repeatedly used that argument in the Senate. He has pointed out that if the people of Tasmania had imported goods from abroad, and paid Customs duties on them during the operation of the Braddon section, they would have been acting in their own interest. </para>

              <para>- I know the business people of Hobart and Launceston just as well as any one does, and I know that it was because they could get their goods cheaper, more expeditiously, and of better quality, than they obtained them from Australia. I am not speaking of the people generally, but of the business people; and every honorable senator from Tasmania knows as well as I do that they are no better and no worse than the business people of any other part of Australia. There is not a business man here who, if he could get goods from outside Australia2&#189; per cent. cheaper than he could obtain them in Australia, would not jump at the chance. </para>

              <para>- Perhaps I would make an exception of the honorable senator, because I have always regarded him as a patriotic Australian, and especially as a patriotic Tasmanian. Still, it would be a strong temptation if such an offer as I have indicated were placed before him; and strong arguments and powerful evidence would have to be brought before me to convince me that he would not take advantage of any bargain that presented, itself. It is a business instinct to do so, and to rest a case on such an argument is not to found it upon common sense.. I might refer to other points that have been raised in the course of the debate, but I have no desire to delay the Senate. I am anxious that this Bill should be passed as rapidly as possible in order that it may receive the Governor-General&#39;s sanction, and that the people of Tasmania may obtain the benefits derivable from it immediately. I do not blame the Tasmanian senators for doing their very best for their State. We ought all to be Australians, however, before we think of the interests of any particular State. If we look at this matter from an. Australian point of view, we shall realize that the money to be granted has to come out of the pockets of the whole of the people of the Commonwealth. Furthermore, if the request, which has been foreshadowed, were carried, the Bill would be delayed. It would have to go back to another place, and then there would be no possibility of carrying it. </para>

              <para>- Surely the Government may be supposed, to have canvassed this question honestly and sincerely in both Houses of the Parliament, and they ought to know something about the general opinion. They have brought forward a proposal which they thought they could carry without great difficulty in both branches of the Legislature. If the Bill be sent back to another place, it will cause difficulty between the two Houses, and will delay the assistance which we desire to give to Tasmania. We may well leave the future to look after itself, and determine at some time hereafter what, if anything, is necessary to be done. It will be a fair thing to give the Government proposal a chance,and see whether it does not help Tasmania to get out of the longstanding and almost hopeless position in which she has been for the last forty or fifty years, and to become one of the most prosperous States in the Australian Union. I therefore hope that the suggestion will not be pressed. </para>

            <para>. - I have given notice of my intention to move a series of requests. I desire &#34;nine&#34; to be substituted for &#34;five&#34; in clauses  2  and  3,  and &#34; according to the scale in the schedule &#34; to be omitted from clause  3.  These requests, if carried, will necessitate some alterations in the schedule. The effect of the requests, taken together, will be to increase the  &#163;500,000  to  &#163;900,000,  and to make the payment extend over nine years, at the rate of  &#163;100,000  a year, instead of extending over ten years at a varying rate. I do not think it necessary to repeat any arguments I have used as to why these alterations ought to be made. I am quite willing to take a test vote on the first request. In spite of the speech made by the Vice-President of the Executive Council, I see no reason why the Senate should not request a grant of  &#163;900,000.  The Minister has really not advanced any argument against my proposal, because the contention that there is very little chance of the other House acceding to a request of the kind is not one which ought to be used here. I have no doubt that both he and his colleagues are satisfied in their mind that they cannot get more than  &#163;500,000  from theother House, but I would remind him that on several occasions, although the other House did not agree in full to our request, a compromise was arrived at. </para>

              <para>-  The Committee has, by a vote, determined that a certain thing shall not be done, and now, under cover of the procedure suggested by the Leader of the Opposition, it is invited to stultify its vote. This request, if carried, would attain exactly the same object as would have been attained if the previous request bad been carried. I am not supporting the point of order of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> against Tasmania. I voted in favour of a grant of&#163;500,000 The Committee has decided that Parliament should assist Tasmania to that extent, and if the request now moved is accepted the Committee will stultify itself. </para>

        <para>This is a very short Bill, and I move the second reading this evening for the convenience of honorable senators in ordertha they may have an opportunity to consider it, and come here at a subsequent sitting prepared to carry it into law. The objectis to amend the present Designs Act and bring it into harmony with our amendment of the Trade Marks and Patents Acts. The principle of the existing proposal is to makethe Designs Act applicable to the Territory of Papua. We have already made the Patents Act and the Trade Marks Act applicable to the Territory. It is advisable that our legislation regarding such industrial affairs as trade marks, patents, and designsshould he uniform. A short amendment of t he existing law is desired in the direction of extending the time during which a design, shall be the property of any individual registering it. We propose to provide for three periods of five years each. At the close of each period of five years of course a fresh application for registration will be necessary, and the applicant will have to pay the necessary fees. These are the principle objects of this amending legislation. I think it will convenience honorable senators if I move the second reading now If it is considered necessary, any member of the Senate may move the adjournment off the debate. </para>
