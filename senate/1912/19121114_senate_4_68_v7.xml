                        <para>- Of course,, the honorable senator will , recognise that to meet every emergency of that description the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> staff would require to be doubled, and we should have to maintain that expenditure fur the whole year. I think that honorable senators will admit, if they scan the notice-paper of the Senate, that we have worked very well up to the present time, and that it would not be economical to double an efficient staff such as we have at present. The only serious objection that can be raised to the proposed adjournment is with respect to private business. I have already stated - and I think that it may be safely left to the future - that we may have a day or two to spare. I shall give a sufficient intimation to honorable senators when that time arrives to enable them to so arrange their business on the notice-paper that it may be taken in the daytime as well as in the evening. With that assurance I feel sure that those who have private business on the notice-paper will agree with me that it is only a humane act to submit this motion. I anticipate very little opposition, because it would be far better not to make such a proposal if time is to be taken up in discussing it. That would put a further burden upon those who have no chance of evading it. Honorable senators know that both in another place and here a member can go out when he chooses and have a spell, but a member of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff must stick to his duty till- he drops. I am sure that no honorable senator or anybody else desires to make that burden so heavy that it would be an undue physical strain upon the men who are in the Service. </para>

                    <para>. - I feel sure that the Senate has listened with both sympathy and interest to the reason advanced by the Vice-President of the Executive Council for the motion he has submitted. No one, . irrespective of the side on which he happens to sit, will at any time disregard an appeal which is made in the interests of, or as a matter of mere justice to, the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff. We also recognise, at any rate, those of us who have been in Parliament for any length of time, how extremely undesirable it would be to call in temporary hands for this work. It is work which I am sure it will be generally admitted requires special training and some experience to be discharged satisfactorily. We are then confronted with the difficulty which arises from the Government's conduct of public business: I do not wish to say any more, except that they must take the responsibility for that. </para>

                    Knowing the temptations which sometimes present themselves to even orderly and well-mannered Government supporters, I would not ask the Minister to tie his hands to that extent, but I do think that we are entitled to ask for, and to expect .from him, in view of the .time which the Senate is now about to give up for the reason advanced, a definite assurance that it will not be penalized, that its opportunities for considering public matters will not be curtailed, and that we shall not be expected to hurriedly pass a number of important measures. If that assurance is forthcoming I shall feel disposed, as I believe the . majority of the Senate will, in view of the special circumstances which have arisen, to accede to the proposition before the Chair.

                    <para>- - The Vice-President of the Executive Council made one remark which has a special interest to a few honorable senators who happen to have private business on the notice-paper. I hope that before the end of the session he will give these honorable senators an opportunity to get a vote on the questions - the opportunity which he has hinted at - by allowing on some occasions private business to be taken in the daytime, even if it be necessary to give to it more than one day. It is necessary to remind the Minister, and also honorable senators generally,- that in practically every session those who had notices of motion on the business-paper found themselves at the end of the session unable to get a vote thereon, and altogether in an unsatisfactory position. The Minister knows that no private senator puts a motion on the notice-paper  unless he desires, in most cases at least, to  have  a vote taken. A number of honorable senators are hoping that he will keep his promise, and that we shall have ample time to discuss all the matters on the notice-paper, even if it be necessary to ask the Senate to sit on Tuesdays in addition to the present sitting days. I thought it was just as well to bring the matter before the Senate at this juncture, because we are nearing the end of the session. </para>

With both of these sentiments I agree ; but I think that, in view of the ill-health which has overtaken more than one member of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff during this and previous sessions, there should be, at any rate, an accession to their strength, so that when the normal work of the session is on they should not be unduly harassed and broken down in health. </para>

                    <para>. - I crave a few moments to bring under the notice of the Minister of Defence, a matter of the greatest importance. It is in connexion with our system of compulsory military training. Quite recently in Hobart there were eighty-eight prosecutions for non-attendance at compulsory drill, and a great many of these persons were employed in a Commonwealth Department. Evidence was tendered; in fact, the presiding magistrate had a letter sent to him to the effect that one of the cadets so charged was not given the necessary permission by the Postal authorities in Hobart to enable him to attend drill. </para>

He was also told that he could not attend the Court to answer the  summnos.  He was allowed t) come at n o'clock provided he had his dinner, and went straight back to work. He had had nothing to eat since 6 o'clock, and, as the case was late in coming on, he would have to go back immediately.

I trust that by the next sitting the Minister will be able to inquire into the truth of these allegations, and make a statement to the Senate. </para>

                <para class="block">J2.40]. - I should like to ask a question of you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> as to who is responsible for communicating a piece of business transacted by the Senate to the Department concerned, in the following circumstances. On the 8th of the present month the Senate arrived at a certain determination with regard to the redistribution of New South Wales into electorates. The Minister in charge of that business gave the Senate an assurance that no time would be lost, and that the determination would be submitted through the proper channels to the New South Wales Commissioners. The answer given to a question to-day shows that the determination of the Senate remained in somebody's hands until the I 2 th instant. That is to say, four days elapsed before anything was done to place the Department of Home Affairs officially in touch with what we did. I desire to know who was responsible for the delay. I presume that the Minister in charge of the business was responsible, and that he should have informed the Minister of Home Affairs for whom he acted j because the Minister in the Senate is, as I may put it, a <inline font-style="italic">locum tenens</inline> for the Minister of Home Affairs.. Deliberately, however, and, as it would appear, of set purpose, the Minister delayed the submission of this matter to the Minister of Home Affairs. A delay of four days occurred before the Department was placed in a position to refer the matter again to the New South Wales Commissioners. If Ministers were determined that there should be no proper opportunity of submitting the question to the Commissioners, and of their report being returned to us for consideration - if they were determined that the resolution of the Senate should remain in somebody's pigeon-holes - we had better know it, in order that the public may understand the fraud that has been perpetrated upon the electors of New South Wales. </para>

                        lad brought before Police Court. In case before magistrate, on 15th October, inquiry showed that officer had opportunities for attending number of drills required. Impossible to give definite information regarding recent cases at Police Court until time worked has been compared with parade hours for twelve months. This is now being done, and report  will be forwarded as soon as possible.

                        <para>- I will cause a copy of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Long's</inline> remarks to be forwarded to the Secretary of the Post and Telegraph Department, and the whole question as raised by him will be inquired into. With regard to the New South Wales redistribution scheme, which has been mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> the honorable senator asserted that " deliberately, apparently, and of set purpose, the Minister had delayed the sending forward of the resolution of the Senate." That was a nice charge to make before the honorable senator had taken any trouble to inquire into the facts ! I took no action whatever with a view of delaying the matter. I am sure that honorable senators will give me credit for not taking any such action, because I gave a promise that the redistribution scheme would be sent back to the New South Wales Commissioners, and would be dealt with in the ordinary course, as all other schemes have been dealt with, immediately. The facts are these : The motion for the adoption of the scheme of redistribution was rejected by the Senate on Friday, the 8th of the present month. It was the duty of the officers of the Senate to notify the Secretary to the Minister of that rejection. That was done. The letter announcing the result of the division was written on Saturday, the 9th. On the evening of Friday, 8th, however, the Secretary to Ministers left Melbourne, in company with the Vice-President of the Executive Council, for Adelaide. The 9th, on which the letter to the  Clerk  of the Senate was written, was a half-day at Parliament House. Sunday intervened. The secretary to Ministers returned from Adelaide on Tuesday, the 12th. He found the letter ' awaiting him, and immediately sent it on to the Minister of Home Affairs, who, as stated in the' answer to-day, immediately took action thereon. Those are the facts of the case, and if upon them <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> can . form a charge that I, of set purpose and deliberately, delayed the forwarding of the determination of the Senate to the Department of Home Affairs, he is welcome to all the satisfaction he can get. </para>

                    GOULD (New South Wales) [2.59].- We have all read about the Circumlocution Office as it was conducted in the old days. Communications had to go through channel after channel, until, after long delay, they reached their ultimate destination. Here we have a set of facts which show that the methods of the Circumlocution Office are being adopted by our own Ministers.

                        <para>- I certainly want to depart from circumlocution. The Minister of Defence . represented the Minister of Home Affairs in the Senate in regard to the redistribution business. The position was exactly tha same, as far as we are concerned, as if the Minister of Home Affairs had been personally in the chamber. If all this circumlocution was required in order to communicate the determination of the Senate to the Minister of Home Affairs, very grave reasons are afforded for crediting the complaints, about the way in which the matter has been dealt with.. </para>

                        <para>.- It would have been a good thing if the honorable member who interjects had done that, instead of objecting to the scheme of distribution as submitted. Both <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> and myself, when we realized that the scheme would be rejected, were ' careful to impress upon the Minister the necessity of dealing with the matter promptly and expeditiously. Surely the Minister should have made an effort to deal with the subject at once. He said that it would be dealt with in the ordinary way. </para>

                        <para>- I say that the Minister, knowing full well the necessity of using urgency, might very well have moved out of the ordinary groove in which the members of this Government are so fond of remaining when it suits their purposes. We are  all  perfectly well aware that the session will end shortly. There is a great deal of business to be transacted before the prorogation. There ought to be a fair and honest determination that the new scheme of the Commissioners should be submitted to the Parliament and dealt with by  Doth.  Houses. It may be the intention of Ministers to do that, but, judging from certain remarks which I saw in a newspaper with regard to the attitude of the Minister of Home Affairs, I am afraid that he regards the business as a huge joke, and as a thing: to be put on one side, and treated as of very little importance. If so, the scheme may not come before us again during the present session. I hope we shall not allow such a condition of affairs  to  remain in New South Wales  as  we find  at  present, where there are 49,000 electors in one constituency, and only  22,000  electors in another- I earnestly protest against this circumlocution, and against the red-tape system which is being followed by Ministers. They ought to realize that we want to close the session as early as possible. There is important business to be dealt with, and, if we are to have a satisfactory election next year, and one that will give an honest representation to the people of New South Wales, it is absolutely necessary that the new scheme of distribution should he brought before us in good time. I trust that the Minister responsible will move himself out of the rut in which he is, and will show more expedition than has been displayed up to the present. </para>
