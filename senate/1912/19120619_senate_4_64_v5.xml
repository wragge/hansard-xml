Will the Minister,&#34; when giving the information, also inform the Senate as to when a start will be made with the construction of the line after the negotiations referred to are completed? </para>

                        <para>- The necessary Act passed by the South Australian Parliament to enable a commencement to be made with the railway was thought by the Government to be, in some of its provisions, inadequate for the safeguarding of the interests of the Commonwealth. Certain communications have passed in regard to proposed amendments or alterations, and these negotiations, we hope, will be shortly brought to a successful issue. The intention of the Government in respect to the construction of the railway is disclosed in the Governor-General&#39;s Speech, in which it is stated that, after the negotiations referred to are completed, the construction of the line will be immediately proceeded with. </para>

                <para>In moving the adoption of the Address-in-Reply to the Governor-General&#39;s Speech, I may take the opportunity of saying that the motion which I now submit will, I am confident, meet with the most hearty accord from every honorable senator opposite, as well as from the members of the party to which I belong. To my mind <inline font-style="italic">it</inline> marks one of the characteristics of our parliamentary methods that, upon a motion of this character, as to which there is common agreement, we are likely to have a most vigorous debate, full of keen criticism, at all events from honorable senators opposite. That criticism will be directed, not only to the principles which have actuated the present Government, but also to their administration during the two years that they have been in office. </para>

                        <para>- I say frankly, as one of the supporters of this Government, that we shrink from no criticism. 1 recognise that Parliament is a place in which vigorous criticism of the action of any Government is appropriate; but I venture to say that in respect of their policy and administration the. present Government can challenge criticism with greater confidence than could any Government that has ever held office in Australia. Not only have they attempted, and in many instances carried to a successful issue, many projects which have met with the most- I was going to say bitter, but I . prefer to say strenuous opposition - but they have carried them into effect in a manner-&#39; which would not have been possible had any other than this Government been in office. That has been rendered possible by reason of the fact that the Government have had such a strong following in both Houses of the Legislature, and also by reason of the splendid support which has been accorded to them from one end of Australia to the other. As far as projected new legislation is concerned, there is much in the Governor-General&#39;s Speech to occupy our attention for many months to come. I am of opinion that the first essential of successful government is the maintenance in office of a set of men who will be able to manage affairs and carry out a policy in the interest of the people of the country ; and during the time that I have had the privilege of occupying a seat in the Commonwealth Legislature - and this is the first time during a reasonably long parliamentary career that I have ever been so satisfactorily situated - I have had the pleasure of knowing that I was supporting a Government in office that was not only prepared to administer the affairs of this country in the interests of the people, but also to carry out quickly and effectively the practical legislation that the party to which I belong has been striving for a great many years to accomplish. Turning to some of the points mentioned in the Speech, we may join with  His Excellency  in congratulating the whole Commonwealth upon the splendid rains that have given us an assurance of prosperity for some time ahead. I must, however, deprecate the attempts that have been made in the press, and by many members of the public, to exaggerate the fact that there has been a short period without rain by describing it as a drought. People at a distance who are not acquainted with the power of recuperation possessed by the soil of this country read these descriptions of drought and form the opinion that Australia is in a serious condition. I say that it is a mistake to allow the idea to go abroad that each little period of dryness ought to be described in the press, by some of the public, and also, I am sorry to say, by some platform speakers, as a drought. </para>

                        <para>- I am not so sure of that. I recognise that between January and May of the present year the outlook, so far as the country was concerned, was not of the brightest. But still there was no warrant for making a great outcry in regard to it. Certainly there was a shortage of that rainfall which is so essential to success in our primary industries. But we must recollect that in Australia the autumn seasons are always marked by long periods of dry weather- </para>

                        <para>- It may  be  so in certain places. We all join with  His Excellency  in expressing our pleasure that the prospect of a protracted drought has passed away, and that we can look forward to a continuation of our former prosperity. In this connexion, I would point out how prosperous the Australian Commonwealth has been since it fell under the guidance of the present Government. </para>

                        <para>- I do not object to the statement of the honorable senator, because the Labour Caucus is merely a meeting of our party, and I hope that our party will always formulate our programme. I hope that it will always exercise a wise supervision over proposed legislation. If honorable senators opposite work under a different system - a system under which there is no meeting of their party to consider what legislation shall be pressed forward, and what measures shall be withheld, I am sorry for them. But I would like to know what they have to substitute for the system which is adopted by the Labour party. The Caucus is nothing more nor less than a meeting of our party ; and if there be anything wrong in its members meeting together, I should like to know what it is. </para>

                        <para>- That is one of those misstatements which may be used with effect on a public platform when there are people present who do not know better ; but when the honorable senator deliberately affirms that the Caucus is used to drill the minority into obedience, if he does not know that the statement is incorrect he ought to. I want to say, further, that, not only do I claim, as an individual member of the Caucus, as much liberty as my honorable friends opposite, but I claim that I enjoy more. I have greater liberty than they have in criticising the actions of my party. </para>

                        <para>- My record of last session alone is more than a complete answer to the question as to whether I have ever criticised the members of the Labour Government. But I do not want to get away from the point at issue. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> is under the impression that the Labour Caucus adopts a system under which the minority of the party must bow to the will of the majority ; but that is not correct. So far as the Caucus is concerned, we are pledged to vote for certain planks in our platform; but outside of those planks we are not bound by any word or pledge. I hope that we have heard the last of this attempt at misrepresentation - this attempt to misrepresent the facts to the people outside, and to make it appear that members of the Labour party have not the same freedom as have the members of other political parties. I make the assertion that as our platform is in black and white, and we have to sign it before we can become candidates for Parliament, we enjoy more freedom than do honorable senators opposite. </para>

                        <para>- I do not want any general statement of that kind, but I invite these old, astute parliamentarians to level definite charges against the Government - charges of failure either in administration or legislation. As this is the last session before we shall be called upon to face our constituents, let honorable senators opposite point to the statute-book, and tell us what legislation we have enacted which they will repeal. Will they repeal the Land Tax Act ? I do not think so. That tax, if it did nothing else, called into existence a number of additional taxpayers to assist the people to prepare for the defence of Australia. I recollect that when the Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher,</inline> was in London, he was waited upon by a deputation of absentee landowners, who pointed out the hardship which the tax inflicted upon their interests. I remember that a gentleman representing the Midland Land Company complained that that company had to pay &#163;7,000 annually to the Commonwealth Government as the result of its operation. Another member of the deputation, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Henry</inline> Joselyn, representing the old South Australian Land Company, affirmed that that company had to contribute no less a sum than&#163;18,000 a year. I would ask my honorable friends opposite whether they will tell the people that they are prepared to repeal that legislation, and thus save the absentees from paying land tax. They appear to be quite silent now when we ask whether they are going to do this thing or not. I have not the slightest doubt in my mind that if, at the next general election, they could get sufficient power, they would revert to a system under which wealthy companies would escape taxation as they did prior to our legislation. Apart from raising revenue to assist in carrying out the great defence proposals of the Labour Government, what has been the effect of the land tax ? </para>

                        <para>- It was described by the Leader of the Opposition as &#34; the Labour party&#39;s tin-pot Navy.&#34; Our opponents almost branded us as disloyalists because we refused to contribute to a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> fund. If there is one thing more than another for which the Prime Minister deserves credit, it is that, in a time of clamour, when it did look as if the Empire was in danger, he was not to be stampeded into any proposal to vote huge sums of public money to assist in providing a fleet at the other side of the world. He contended then that the best defence of the Empire, so far as Australia was concerned, was the defence of Australia by Australia. </para>

                        <para>- After the Government winning the elections in the teeth of their opponents&#39; criticism and the Labour party&#39;s scheme receiving the approval of the best men who have been giving their attention to the defence of the Empire, I can quite understand the anxiety of honorable senators opposite to try to claim it as part of their policy. Ever since there has been a Labour party they have clamoured and cavilled at every new proposal put forward ; but when, by the use of the platform only, we popularized the measures, and, perhaps, had enough strength in Parliament to compel the Government to place them on the statute-book, they have had. the effrontery to claim them as their measures. The land tax has had the effect of compelling absentee landlords to pay their fair share towards the government and defence of Australia. It has had a further effect. It has caused the breaking up of innumerable large estates from one end of this continent to the other. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Henry</inline> Joselyn, when pointing out to the Prime Minister in London what his land company were prepared to do, said that their tenants only held reasonably small holdings - that is, farms of  240  acres each - were prosperous, and satisfied to remain as tenants ; but he added that if the company were called upon to pay this enormous taxation, they must say to their tenants, &#34; We will sell our farms to you at cheaper prices than to anybody else, but we must sell them, because we cannot pay the tax.&#34; Here is the case of an outsider pointing out that the very first effect of our land tax is that his company are compelled to sell their big landed estates. I do not think that there is any one here who has a doubt as to which is the better class of farmers - those who own -the lands or those who have to pay interest. </para>

                        <para>- No doubt I did when the honorable senator belonged to our party, and we sat together in conference in 1893. I wish to point to another effect of the land tax which has come under my own observation. I am not going to say that the effect of this taxation has been so marked in all the towns of Australia as it has been at the town of Orange. Within a five-mile radius of the Orange post-office, five or six very large estates have been subdivided and sold since the land tax came into operation. I refer to Dalton&#39;s Blechington estate, the Rosedale estate, Moulder&#39;s Bloomfield estate, Moulder&#39;s Warrindine estate, and Frost&#39;s Campdale estate. Of these five estates, four border upon the boundaries of the municipality. If there was nothing else to justify our party and to make us satisfied with the result of this experimental legislation, these subdivisions should.. We can never forget the objections which were taken to our policy by honorable senators opposite. They used all the constitutional means in their power to prevent us from giving effect to our proposals before they would submit to the will of the majority at the polls, and also to the will of the majority in each House of Parliament. We are intensely gratified that our legislation is doing exactly what we claimed it would do. Our honorable friends on the other side not only said that it would be a serious mistake to introduce a land tax, but they tried to make the Parliament and the country believe that we had not the constitutional power to enact such an impost. I believe that their statements led the land companies which appealed to the Courts to waste a considerable amount of their money in testing our constitutional power. Honorable senators on the other side said so positively that there was no power in the Constitution to give effect to our land tax proposals that I have no doubt a number of the big landholders who had not looked into the matter as keenly, believed that their statement was true, but they found to their sorrow that it was not true. </para>

                        <para>- We can understand now why our opponents claim our de fence system as theirs. I suppose that the land tax system is theirs, and that they have always intended to carry it out. I have no doubt that everything which turns out well will be represented by them to be exactly what they intended. I heard the debates in the Senate, and read the debates in the other House, and I thought that one of the chief objections of the Opposition to our land tax proposal was that Parliament had not the constitutional power to enact such taxation. At all events, that was the impression which was conveyed to my mind. I do not always, know whether my honorable friends are talking to deceive their own supporters, or criticising the Government with a view to improving their legislation. It is pleasing to know that the system of Australian bank notes is working satisfactorily. </para>

                        <para>- We know how many tons of gold there are waiting to be paid over the counter, but there need be no fear in this matter. I think that honorable senators opposite will agree with me that during the time the Australian notes have been in circulation the utmost care has been exercised by our Treasurer and Prime Minister. There is nothing in his administration which need cause the least anxiety in the mind of the most nervous that anything is being, or will be, done in a way calculated to injure the reputation and credit of the Commonwealth. I am also glad to find that the Bank Bill of last session is being given effect to, and that the appointment of the Governor will be quickly followed by the appointment of his subordinate officers, so that we may soon have a most successful banking system in operation. I should like here to congratulate the Leader of the Opposition upon the tact that in a recent speech he pointed out, and agreed with, the soundness of our banking proposals. </para>

If the honorable senator did not make that statement, he ought, I think, to read the press reports of his speeches a little more carefully, and correct them. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. Just as we say that they shall not issue any sovereigns, shillings, or coppers of their  own, and must take the coin provided for them by the Government. The point I wish to make is that it is not right that men holding high positions in the public life of this country should, in order to gain the passing advantage of the  applause of the crowd, make statements so wide of the mark as that the legislation passed by this Parliament compels the banks to take the Australian notes. </para>

                        <para>- As a matter of fact, it does not. The banks have no more need to take these notes than I have. When I go to a bank, they give me notes because it is convenient for them to do so ; but if they choose to conduct a cash business, there is no compulsion upon them to take Australian notes under the legislation which has been passed by this Parliament. What has been stated may be one of the effects of our legislation ; but if we are to have honest criticism of the Government, the people should be told that. They should not be asked to listen to wild statements that such a thing is compulsory under our legislation. I think I may say that, so far as the Australian notes are concerned, the best and soundest banking authorities - and I do not here refer to that section of the banking community composed of people who are half bankers and half politicians, but to the common sense banking community - do not at the present time view the Australian note issue with any alarm. The people are satisfied with the note issue, the best banking authorities are not alarmed, and we are deriving at the present time from this legislation a profit of &#163;200,000 a year in the way of interest on loans. Our notes have been loaned to the various States, and the loans granted to Queensland, Victoria, New South Wales, and the other States have enabled those States to carry out reproductive WOrkS that have l:&#62;een of immense benefit to them. It should further be remembered that the State Governments have not been asked to take &#163;92, &#163;95, or &#163;98 for each &#163;100, but have been given the full &#163;100 for every &#163;100 they borrow. The people of the Commonwealth and of the States represent the same body of taxpayers. This legislation has been of mutual benefit to the Commonwealth and the States, and it is very hard, at the present time, to estimate what is the real profit which the people of Australia derive from this particular piece df Commonwealth legislation. </para>

                        <para>- One reason for that is the abounding prosperity of the Australian community, and the development of investments which has been proceeding during the last two years, and which has been unprecedented in Australia. In times past our friends opposite used to talk to us of the iron law of supply and demand. When money is not being used you can get it cheaply, but when money is required for investment in trade and commerce, and for business purposes, then, just as the demand for it increases, so the price for its use increases. </para>

                        <para>- I have learned much from the honorable senator. I used to listen to the words of wisdom which fell from his lips many years ago. In considering the banking proposals of the Government, it is well to consider their full effects, and not to try to put them in a false light in order to blame them for results which are not due to them. The increased price of money is due to the increased demand for it. No one can fail to have observed the enormous development of business which has taken place in Sydney, and also, I am glad to say in Melbourne, during the last two years. One of the most pleasing features of the time is the growth and development of business, not only in these two cities, but throughout Australia. I do not intend to speak at any great length, but I wish to refer to something new which is mentioned in paragraph 9 of the Governor-General&#39;s Speech. </para>

                <para>On account of its novelty this may be regarded as one of the most remarkable features of  His  Excellency&#39;s address. It is remarkable for many reasons. If it is found that the proposal receives the approval of the people of the Commonwealth our friends opposite may not claim that it is their proposal, and something we have taken from them, but I have no doubt that four or five years hence, should there be an appeal to the people, and this proposal is found to be approved by them, we shall find the same anxiety displayed by our honorable friends opposite to show that they always believed in it, and that if the Labour Government had not remained in power, they would have given effect to it. </para>

                        <para>- This enormous death rate may be materially reduced if provision be made for better professional attendance and better nourishment for mother and infant. In the case of the ordinary working man, who has to maintain himself and his family on just what his hands can earn, the receipt of a small amount of money, even as small as the maternity grant may be, will at that interesting period remove a great deal of anxiety from the minds of himself and family by placing them in a position to secure little comforts, and will, in my opinion, lead to a considerable improvement in the figures showing the death rate amongst infants at the present time. It is reasonable to suppose that the expenditure of a few pounds at that period will enable many infants, who under existing conditions pass away, to thrive arid develop. It is because I believe this to be a sound and common-sense proposal that I give it my approval. I know that, at first sight, it is repugnant to the conservative mind. </para>

                        <para>- I recognise that I am apt to get out of touch with the party because of the conservative view I take of things. It may give us a sort of shock to read of a proposal of this kind for the first time, but when we make ourselves acquainted with the advantages that are likely to accrue from it, and the assistance it may afford for the preservation of a number of valuable lives, in spite of our natural conservatism we can give it approval. Viewing it in a calmer light, we can all agree that it will provide a means of saving life. My honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon,</inline> is inclined to make the proposal retrospective in order to cover lost ground, but there must be a beginning to all new forms of legislation. This is a beginning upon which the Government can be congratulated, and I join most heartily in that congratulation. There are several other matters mentioned in the Speech, which might be referred to j but I think it is sufficient now to comment upon the fact that a selection has been made from the designs for the Federal Capital. I hope that the Government will proceed expeditiously with the building of the Capital, and I look forward to the possibility that, perhaps the next Parliament may meet in the Australian Federal Capital at Yass-Canberra. </para>

                    <para>. - I desire to second the motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply. Looking through the Speech, I can congratulate the Government upon the progressive steps they propose, and which I believe are in keeping with the desires of the people of Australia. If the legislation foreshadowed be passed, as I trust it will be, during this session, I have no doubt that the Government will have the highest of all compliments paid to them, such as they have received in respect of their past legislation, namely, that the Opposition will claim their measures wholesale, and assert that they were initiated by them. </para>

                        <para>- I believe they, are, and I wish them good luck. I do not think that I have ever been condemned for being so narrow-minded as to reject support from whatever quarter it may come. There is another difficulty about criticising a document of this kind with which one is in general agreement, namely, that the Opposition, from whom we have a right to expect criticism, seem to be unable to advance anything that is original and new. When we look to them for criticism of the Labour platform, one of the first things we hear from them is the old cry of &#34;caucus secrecy.&#34; That is an objection to our party&#39;s organization that was dealt with and effectively disposed of years ago. But to-day, it may be remarked, it is not only the Labour party that has a secret caucus. The political party in Australia now that not only refuses information to the public and to the press, but even to members of their own party, is that which is presided over by no less a person than <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon.</inline> He presided over a caucus held not long ago as to the proceedings of which no information was accorded, and consequently <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> H. Irvine, in criticising what he supposed to be the result of its deliberations, appears to have fallen under the displeasure of his colleagues, who took occasion to bring him to book. The result was that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Irvine</inline> apologized, and pleaded in excuse his ignorance of the platform of his own party. </para>

Recently there was a meeting of the three Opposition leagues - the Women&#39;s National League, the People&#39;s party, and the People&#39;s Liberal party. I believe it was a very harmonious caucus meeting. They sat for about three hours, and I understand that the final result was - no agreement.

                        <para>- Yes ; but it is not fully developed yet. It is going to grow. Now, what is the security behind Australian notes? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> says that it is not gold. It is just as well to put on record what the securities against our note issue are. I do not think that there is any intelligent man or woman in this community who would think it a wise thing to allow the money paid into the Treasury for notes obtained to lie there and not be put to good use. I feel sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> would not approve of that. He would not regard it as sane banking. Indeed, I venture to express the opinion that 40 per cent, of gold is too much for the Treasury to hold against the note issue, and that it would be sound policy to devote a larger percentage of the gold to reproductive purposes. Now, what has happened with some of the gold that has been deposited ? Let us see. There is a gentleman at present presiding over the destinies of this State of Victoria who may be given credit for being one of the most active leaders of the Anti-Labour party. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt</inline> has continually denounced the Australian note issue as being an unsound project. Yet, as Treasurer of Victoria, he was one of the first to be found waiting on the doorstep of the Treasury when it was announced that the States could obtain loans from the Commonwealth, and he secured ^980,000 of this note issue at 3^ per cent., maturing 10th August, 1919. </para>

                        <para>- No; I mean that the Act under which the note issue was established allows the money to be lent only on securities that can be held against the notes and which are as good as gold. The Treasury must hold either golden sovereigns or security of the greatest possible soundness. In the case of these loans the Treasury holds the security of the whole of the people of the borrowing States. For the note issue to fail it would be necessary either for one or two States to go insolvent or for the Commonwealth itself to go insolvent; and I do not think that there is any danger of that. Does the honorable senator think there is? </para>

If it did, surely the security of the Mates would be satisfactory. If not, what would it mean? That the whole of the States would be insolvent; and as their destinies are not, as a rule, being controlled by the Labour party, any such conjecture is a poor tribute to pay to the parties which control the State Governments to-day. </para>

                    <para>Apart from the Commonwealth, no country, British or foreign, has escaped the effects of the general anxiety about the position in Europe. Gilt-edged stock, which has been considered immune from anything but the outbreak of actual war of a menacing character, has been indiscriminately hammered with a multitude of less respected holdings&#39;. In fact, Australia has done somewhat better than hold her own. In a number of instances shares have been actually improved during the recent troubled season. There was, for example, a fine rise in Broken Hill. It might have been expected that the ill-informed outcry in the press here about the Federal land tax and the widely advertised protest which the deputation to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> made upon the subject would have had a bad effect upon our pastoral security held in this country. We were repeatedly told that the Federal land tax would cause the withdrawal of large sums of British capital from Australia. Indeed, this seemed inevitable. As a matter of fact, however, all Commonwealth securities have stood firm, while those of the rest of the world were being sorely knocked about. </para>

                        <para>- It does_ not say, but as the article was published in a newspaper that has continually opposed the Labour party, and which many honorable senators in the Opposition take as their principal authority on most public questions, I think it will be accepted as reliable. Recently <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> H. Irvine - and he ought to be a fair judge - said that it would probably be just as well for Australia if the Labour party remained in power for another three years. He stated that we were now engaged in a perfect financial carnival. I do not know why that should be so. Outside of the land tax, I am not aware that the Labour Government have imposed any new taxation. During the first year, the total amount collected as the result of the operation of that tax was &#163;1,400,000, and, during the second year, ^,&#39;1,300,000. And we have not yet borrowed a single penny. There are certain moneys in trust funds to-day, and it is anticipated that the year will close with a surplus of ,&#163;1,000,000 or &#163;1,500,000. While it may be true that loans will require to be raised for the purpose of constructing the transcontinental railway, it is not true that the Commonwealth is indebted to the private moneylender to the extent of a single penny. </para>

                        <para>- We all know that the States have been attempting to deal with the land problem for a number of years. In Victoria we have had four or five amendments of the Closer Settlement Act. Yet what is the position today ? Victoria is loaded up with about &#163;400,000 worth of land. This land has been advertised broadcast, it has been brought under the notice of local residents and immigrants, and yet the State cannot induce anybody to take it off its hands. Why? Because it paid too much for it in the first place. The Commonwealth brought about more real settlement within twelve months by reason of the operation of the land tax- </para>

                        <para>- Then Providence appears to have been very kind to the Labour party. This seems strange, seeing that another political party is never tired of implying that God is upon its side. At its meeting places it has mottoes on the walls such as &#34; For God and country,&#34; the implication being that we are for the devils down below. Why has Providence been so kind ? </para>

                        <para>- Tome Protection is not a matter of figures. I feel sure that if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> saw a young man who was doing very well, he would not say to him, &#34; <inline font-style="italic">You</inline> are doing very well, and therefore you must not go in for more enterprise.&#34;On the contrary, he would be the first to encourage him by saying, &#34; Go on, you are doing very well.&#34; While it is true that our industries are prosperous, I say that many of them could be made more prosperous by the aid of a little more Protection. To me the test is not whether a manufacturer is doing well, but whether, by producing certain commodities here, we could not provide more employment for our people. I am prepared to fight the manufacturer for fair conditions for his employe&#39;s. The greatest enemy to a Protective Tariff in Australia to-day is the manufacturer himself. He is not prepared to extend to his employes the new Protection. </para>

                        <para>- Less than a week ago, the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> published an article which stated that two-thirds of the members of this Parliament are Protectionists. It pointed out that, unless Protection was extended to the workman and consumer alike, some members were not prepared to grant to manufacturers any increased measure of Protection. I do not agree with that view, but I respect it, because I recognise that there is some reason underlying it. But it is useless to talk about protecting the consumer and worker so long as commodities are. manufactured in a foreign country. We never shall be able to pass a law which will affect the industrial conditions of any country other than Australia. For these reasons, I hope that, before the session closes, Parliament will see that the Commonwealth is given effective Protection. During the past three years, the value of our imports has increased from&#163;51,000,000 to&#163;66,000,000, and the value of them for the current year will probably approach &#163;80,000,000. I say that, for a young country like Australia to import &#163;80,000,000 worth of goods is a suicidal policy. These figures show convincingly that our Tariff wall is too low. If Australia is to develop her trade and industries, she must not import so largely and I know of nothing that will attract men and women to a country so quickly as the knowledge that there arc good times ahead of it. I hope that something will be done to stop an importation which. I consider to be excessive.. </para>

                        <para>- I used to think that we quarrelled a good deal, and regretted it ; but my present opinion is that our caucuses, or meetings, compared with those of the Opposition, are as heaven. Honorable senators may draw their own conclusions regarding, our opponents. In conclusion, I hope that all the legislation outlined in the Speech will be placed on the statute-book during the present session, and that something definite will be done in regard to Protection. I hope, too, that at the end of the session the Government, in every Department, will have the same clean record for administration that it has now. I congratulate Ministers on the work that they have done, and trust that they will do equally good and effective work in the future. </para>
