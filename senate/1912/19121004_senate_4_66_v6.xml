                        <para>.- The speeches we have had from the other side, with the exception of that of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson,</inline> to which I think no exception can be taken, have mostly dealt with three points. First, an attack has been made upon certain members of the Opposition and a somewhat virulent attack too; second, we have had from honorable senators opposite a laudation of themselves as being the only humanitarian section in this Parliament ; and, third, we have had frequent references to the unfortunate women, and it seems to me somewhat regrettable that such " 'references should be made. They are really not cognate to the Bill, and I do not know why they should be dragged in so much. They surely cannot be appreciated by these individuals. I do not know that the frequent references to them which will appear in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> will make the measure any more acceptable to the other women in the community. I deplore the fact that the unfortunate women have been brought into the discussion so much. </para>

                            <para>- I think that the Minister is showing a toad example by starting to interject so early. I do not know why honorable senators should take these individuals and try to make heroines of them. It is quite enough that we are prepared to give them all the help that we can. I do not propose to make more than a slight reference to them as I am not catering for their votes. From the expressions of self-laudation from the other side one would imagine that there was no humanity displayed in this or any other Parliament in Australia except by the Labour party, and as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger very truly said last night, there seems to be a good deal of the political Pharisee about this business. Honorable senators on the other side say, in effect, "  We are the only Simon Pures; we are the only people who are ready to -help any one else; we are the only people who ever brought in any benevolent legislation." Can there be any stronger proof that this is purely in its inception a political measure, and designed, as I said before, to catch votes? How anxious honorable senators on the other side were to parade themselves as supporters of the proposal ! Why? It was done to catch the votes of a certain section. They were simply fishing for credit for themselves and endeavouring to put discredit upon their opponents, because the latter take exception to the measure in very many respects. No  stronger  proof that it is a political move could be furnished than the attitude of honorable senators on the other side yesterday. That is not, I think, the spirit in which such a measure should be discussed. If it were brought in in a fair way it should get the consent of all parties here, arid it should be framed in such a manner as to commend itself to all parties. </para>

                            <para>- Is the little impertinent member of the Senate starting already to interject? I have travelled, a good deal about this State since the measure was introduced. I have heard expressions of opinion from all classes, both men and women, and the measure is viewed with very mixed feelings. By many persons it is looked upon as a boon, as something that will do much good ; by others it is looked upon as a superfluity ; and by a great many women of the working classes it is regarded as something in the light of a positive insult. But on one point I have found no divergence of opinion. Whether they are in favour of or against the Bill, they all agree that it is a political move. Those who are in favour of its enactment say, " We know, of course, that that is what is behind the proposal, but, all the same, we support it because we believe that it will do a lot of good." I have been told that I dare not repeat here what I said outside. I am going to say it again, because I do not 'say here what I am not prepared to say outside, nor <inline font-style="italic">vice versa.</inline> When the caucus of the Labour party met previous to the beginning of this session they were under a very great shadow. They were under the shadow of that Sedan which one of their number had predicted for them, and it was largely caused because they had diverted from1 themselves an enormous amount of sympathy on the part of the women of this country by reason of blocking them in the exercise of their franchise, of taking away a political privilege, of taking away their birthright by striking postal voting out of the Electoral Act. It is not correct to say that the Liberal party have been opposed to womanhood suffrage. It was first proposed in Victoria by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Maloney,</inline> who was then not a Labour man, but a Liberal. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, John Hancock was one, and Tom Smith was another. When this maternity proposal was submitted to the caucus we were told in the press that it was received with exulting cheering. No doubt it was, because the members of the caucus said, " Here is something which is going to get us out of our trouble, which, will conciliate the women of Australia, and bring us their votes at the next election." They were afraid of the women's anger, and this proposal was born of fear and not simply of  humanitarianism, as we are told. The members of the caucus took this proposal, which deals with the most delicate and sacred time in a woman's life, and used it as a means for vote-catching in order to save their political skins. We are getting used to the distribution of Government money as largess. Of late years a lot of money has come into the hands of the Federal Government, and it has been used in every possible way to make safe their position on the Treasury bench. They are using the public money in order to get political support. While this money is, I admit, to be applied to humanitarianism, yet it is being used in this way largely with the object I have stated. I do not think that this proposal will affect the birth rate one way or other. I do not think that it will increase the birth rate either in or out of marriage. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator is interjecting again ! We all sympathize, especially those of us who have a number of children, with women in this particular condition. We know that it is the lot of women to bear children and to endure suffering for the continuation of the race, and they are entitled to our best help. No matter whether they are married or single ; no matter whether they are the most respectable and virtuous or the most lost and degraded, they are entitled to our help .at that particular time in every possible way. I would give more help to the unfortunate ones than I would give to those who are placed in better circumstances. But we have to ask ourselves, " Is this measure likely to give the help iu the best way?" This proposal should only be made for those who are in need. The great majority of the women in this country are not in need. There is no effort made to . find out those who are in need. </para>

                            <para>- No. It is very obvious why the Labour caucus, do not want to find out those who are in need. If the grant were only intended for such persons it would be absolutely valueless as a vote-catching proposition. That is where the economic aspect of this question comes in. It is proposed to tax the wage earners at, perhaps, the rate of 10s. a head - to do what? - not only to help those who are in need but to put money in the pockets of those who are well-to-do. In order to meet the needs of those who are in want at this delicate time,  £100,000  a year would be quite ample, whereas it is proposed to spend  £500,000.  Why should we squander the difference upon those who do not require help ? We are told, and I think that the Attorney-General said in another place, that those who do not want the grant will not take it. I doubt that. We know that when- the public purse is opened wide many persons who should not do so, even many in high authority, are prepared to take from it money to which I do not think they are entitled. It is somewhat dangerous to teach the people to rely upon the Government, and we should be careful not to bring about such a condition of affairs as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> sketched. The people should be kept in constant employment, so that the proposed bonus or allowance, or whatever it may be called, would not be necessary. It has been urged against the Liberals in this Parliament that they have never done anything like this on behalf of the people. I venture to say that all the reforms which have uplifted humanity, and which have given it better conditions, have emanated from Liberalism, and from Liberals who have been actuated' by that spirit of altruism which comes from the Gospel. Yet we are told that they have never done anything. Who initiated the work that is going on in all the States to-day - work which is helping those whom this Bill is intended to help - but the Liberals ? Yet it is -repeatedly stated that since the advent of Federation Liberals have never brought forward a proposal of this character. Those who make that charge know perfectly well the reason why such proposals were not forthcoming. They know that in the earlier years of its history the Commonwealth was crippled by* the operation of the Braddon section of the Constitution. In  1905-6  the balance derived by the Commonwealth from Customs and Excise amounted to  £1,600,000,  the following year it was  ,£1,800,000,  the next year it was  £2,700,000,  the following year it was  £2,900,000,  and the next year it was  ,£3,100,000.  But immediately after the present Government came into office the Braddon section expired, and money fairly streamed into the Treasury. As a result, the balance derived by the Commonwealth. during their first year of office amounted to  £7.700,000,  the next year it was  £8,885,000,  and this year it will be still more. So that they have been flush of revenue. </para>

                            <para>- Probably it was unwise to return that money to the States, because that action resulted in starving the Post Office, and in preventing a number of public works from being carried out. How-, ever, the step was prompted by the best-of motives, and was taken in the interests of the people themselves. But the Government of which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> is the head has not been pinched for money. They have money to burn, and they are burning it at a very fierce rate. They are warming their own friends with the flame. But by-and-by the money will have been burnt, and somebody will be cooling when they ought to have a fire. The sneer that Liberals have done nothing in the direction proposed by this Bill is unworthy of honorable senators opposite, and is not correct. During the course of the debate some references have been made to certain ladies, which, to my mind, were not in good taste. For instance, there was a reference to Lady Way, who is a woman of very high repute, who is always engaged in charitable work, and who has done a vast amount of good. To hold her up to public scorn was unworthy of any honorable senator. The members of the Women's National League have been treated in the same way. I am glad to say that from this side of the Chamber I have never heard a single word uttered against any woman, no matter to what class she may belong. Imbecile references to the Women's " Fashionable " League come with very bad grace from any honorable senator. We know that women have the franchise to-day, and honorable senators opposite grumble because the women have organized for the purpose of giving effect to their own political views. My honorable friends grumble because the women are a menace to the party which is now in office. </para>

                            <para>- Honorable senators opposite do not hesitate to slander these women because they fear them. If we choose to inquire who are rescuing unfortunates, helping the sick and suffering, and protecting children from disaster and death, we shall find it is the women who have been slandered in this Chamber. One point which has to be considered in connexion with this Bill is the disorganization which may result in the work which is at present being done. The number of institutions engaged in charitable work is very large. In Victoria alone  16,000  children are being maintained at a cost of  £90,000  per annum, and I suppose that other States are doing equally good work. It is difficult to say what will be the effect of the Bill on these institutions. I come now to the constitutional aspect of this question. I do not pose as an expert in constitutional matters, but to me, as a layman, there seems to be grave doubts whether the Bill is constitutional. Possibly, nobody may test it, but should it be contested in the High Court, I believe that it will be held to be <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires.</inline> Of course that might suit the purpose of the Government, because it would provide them with a splendid cry upon which to go to the country. In connexion with this measure the plea of urgency has been raised. We have been told that  300  children- are being born every day, and that the help which it is proposed to extend to mothers cannot be extended to them until the Bill has become law. Consequently the Government wish to rush it through at any cost. I suppose the real truth of the matter is that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> wishes to be able to flaunt it before his hearers in Sydney on Monday next as an evidence of what the Government have done. But why has the matter been neglected so long? </para>

                            <para>- The Ministry have allowed the matter to stand over for two and a half years, notwithstanding that during that time they have received in revenue  £18,000,000  more than did other Governments. They have chosen, however, to delay taking action in this matter until we are on the eve of a general election. In other words, the Bill has been reserved for a crisis. Reference was made  last night to the Council of Churches. Now, the principal members of that council are ministers of my own church, and, therefore, I propose to say a word or two on their behalf. The Council of Churches waited upon the Prime Minister in respect of this Bill. They placed before him certain views which were discussed for one and a half hours. They expressly informed him that they did not desire to say anything against the general principles of the measure. But they deemed it to be their duty, as the moral leaders of their people, to protest against no differentiation being made in respect of the manner in which the allowance is to be distributed. It has been stated that they endeavoured to deprive unfortunate women of the proposed allowance. They did nothing of the kind. They merely asked that a distinction should be made in the method of distribution between cases in which births were nuptial and those in which they were not. I do not say that I indorse the whole of their views. </para>

                            <para>I will take as one practical example the Rev. John S. Buntine. He is not a member of the Council of the Churches; but he is one of the few brave men who, in this State and in&gt; another Australian State, have for years given of time and strength and means in the effort to rouse interest in the succour, defence and rescue of tempted and wronged girlhood, and in the saving from destruction of unfathered  and helpless little children. Two out of the three growing organizations of our Presbyterian Church, which are striving to grapple practically with these social problems, owe much of the intensifying interest taken in these redemptive modes of effort to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Buntine.</inline> The same spirit of Christ's practical sympathy and succour has been the characteristic of every member of the deputation representing the Council of Churches, which laid their views and their experience before <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher.</inline> And they certainly deserved' a very different tone of language and attitude of manner from that which they were met with. My colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Adam,</inline> who has proven his large hearted interest in the most modern modes, of practical sympathy with the poor and wronged amidst the special difficulties of a Scottish seaport town, was made " an offender for a word "' torn out of its true reference ; and yet, a few minutes later, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> himself used a far harsher word about the same people, and did not call himself to task.

At every point at which our deputation urged upon <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> some practical measures proven by experience, his answer was,. " Oh, that is the duty of the States." Exactly. And that is tantamount to saying that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher's</inline> entire scheme of " collectivist " compulsory succour is a falsetto scheme, and* will never reach into the real need, viz., refuge and succour for the mother and safety to the life of the child. A number of letter writers ornament their contributions with laudation to the <inline font-style="italic">Age's</inline> leader, as " admirable," and so forth. That ought to go without saying, and is " too thin..*" </para>

                    <para class="block">These very writers pay no attention to the weightiest  part of that " admirable " leader, viz., that part which points out that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher's</inline> maternity bonus, if it is anything at all, is meant to relieve distress, to succour the impoverished, to cure sick mothers and to feed their infants." But " <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> declines to search these women out. Rather than do that he prefers to give a bonus to every woman who becomes a mother, whether she needs help or not. Such a project is in violent conflict with the laws of economy and common sense." That is most admirably said. </para>

                            <para>Now turn to the statistics. " The Victorian Year Book," 1910-11, in its clearly arranged compilation, shows that " the proportion of illegitimate births in Victoria " was " much lower than in New South Wales and Queensland" in 1910. " The children born out of wedlock numbered 1,759." In that same year "the mortality rate for legitimate infants was only a little over 6 per 100 births." But " the deaths of illegitimate children were 374, which corresponded to a rate of21.26 (over 21) per 100 births." And when you seek the explanation of this terrible mortality of the illegitimate bairns, the answer is that of the deaths under 1 year per 1,000 in 1910 so high a proportion as 62 were due to " congenital defects " and kindred causes, and So from " diarrhoeal diseases," indicating a " considerable neglect in the rearing of . illegitimate infants." This dreadful toll paid by the infants as the result of man's lawless lust and woman's ruin is emphatic enough answer to the startling Socialistic taunt ascribed to a member of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher's</inline> Cabinet about " prying into the marriage lines" and "happiness" not confined to marriage ! Yet when I urged on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> that the money should, if given at all by national compulsion, be directed towards safeguarding the child's life and . the mother's care for it, his answer was that he had nothing to do with that. It was the State's function ! I think I may safely ask on which side, that of the deputation or that of the Socialist scheme, the mercy and practical sagacity lie? </para>
                        </item>
                        <item label="4.">
                            <para>Take another aspect of the statistics. In " ten refuges " in the State of Victoria we find 372 of those " women and girls admitted " during the year, and in the " six rescue homes of the Salvation Army 722 adults were admitted." Let me take these two sentences as indicative of the kind of rescue and life-saving- work that are grappling in practical power with the problem. (I choose them regarding a Roman Catholic institution to indicate that I am stating these facts free from all bias) :  - " Young women are received at the institution without charge for three months before the birth of the infant, and can remain for six months after they return from the Women's Hospital. Those children who are naturally fed have thus every chance of surviving "(p. 323). That is the sort of beneficent and effective work that is going on also in the various Protestant refuges and organizations of rescue, backed and animated by these "hardhearted Pharisees " ! And it compares nobly with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher's</inline> fantastic theoretic scheme. </para>
                        </item>
                        <item label="5.">
                            <para>But these modes of rescue mentioned in that year-book (covering as they do 1,094 of the cases) are but indicative of various other modes of rescue and succor.. Take, for example, one of the " sisterhoods  " referred to above, and which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Buntine</inline> was zealous in furthering. Here I find "there has not been a death among the women or the infants while in the institution." </para>

                    </list>
                    <para class="block">The women there "engage to nurse their infants." And, more, "Every inmate has been told on leaving that the committee will help her, if necessary, till her child is two years old." Compared with this practical uplifting mercy and its loving word "sisterhood," <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher's</inline> "maternity bonus" of£5 does look a "miserable comforter." Had I time to refer to Anglican and Methodist, &amp;c, modes of rescue the same tale would run on well. </para>

                            <para>Take one other aspect. I urged it on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher,</inline> but found no response. And the same (shall I call it callousness or impracticality ?) marks all the letters of attack against " the Pharisees." He and they have nothing to say about or against the seducer . ' No means to make him responsible ! I must say it is a poor and miserable sort of pity or charity that throws <inline font-style="italic">£5</inline> to a ruined girl and takes no indignant vigorous steps to lay hold of her wronger, and make him pay for the support of his child. And I will close by quoting this wise and practical suggestion from the annual report of that Presbyterian "sisterhood" I have already spoken of - words written by its effective  chairman,  the Rev. D. A. Cameron :  - " The sooner cases at law for prematernity  expenses and for maintenance of children born out of wedlock are held in private, the sooner will the great wrong often done to unfortunate women be set right. As it is, in nine cases out of ten the father of the child goes free, while the mother either has to foist the child on to the State, or under a great handicap work for both its and her own support." </para>

Expressions of opinion have come from another quarter which are certainly deserving of consideration. Yesterday there was a conference of benevolent societies carrying on their operations around Melbourne, and of those engaged in rescue work and the helping of women and children. I believe that thirty women's organizations were represented, and the meeting was a large one. A resolution was submitted and carried, and I shall take the opportunity of quoting it. Every one of these ladies knows more about the subject in hand than any of us do. The resolution was carried with only two dissentients. Only one lady - <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Sangster</inline> - spoke against it. </para>

Nothing was said to run down any woman, no matter how unfortunate. Everything that emanated from this conference was done with the desire to help. It would have been well, before this measure was brought in, had people like these from the various States been taken into counsel, and some scheme prepared which could have been by common consent recognised as suitable to the whole community. I feel quite sure that, whilst this proposal will do some good, whilst some benefits will arise from it, it will not be long before Parliament will be called upon to make a radical alteration on the lines which these ladies propose. I am against the Bill, and intend to vote against it for the following reasons : I object to it, first of all, because it is a vote-catching proposition, and I am not going to play into the hands of my opponents by helping them to carry it through. Secondly, I object to it because the money could be better expended by working in with State and local agencies. </para>

                            <para>- I object to the measure also because the amount that will be spent, except in cases of absolute need, will be unnecessarily spent. Lastly, I object to it because I consider that the whole subject should be dealt with on sounder line's than those proposed at the present time. An expenditure of £400,000 a year, if wisely administered, would suffice to erect maternity homes, hospitals,, and similar institutions over the whole of Australia, and the balance to be expended would provide a foundation fund to keep these institutions going, aided, perhaps, by a little State or Commonwealth support. One year's expenditure under this Bill would be sufficient to do this great work, which would be of enormously greater advantage than simply paying out a dole and forgetting all about the people who received it after the money was paid. For these reasons I intend to vote against the measure. </para>

                        <para>. - In approaching this question, I say at once that I do not think that it is one that ought to be considered in a light vein. I heartily wish that it had been possible to keep out of the controversy such expressions as have been referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> this morning. I wish we could have approached the subject without introducing abuse and animosity. But who is responsible for the introduction of the personalities? Is it the Leader of the Labour party or those who are opposed to this policy? I am sorry that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> is leaving the chamber, because I wish to say one or two things about his criticism. I trust that it will not be considered ill-mannered on my part if I refer to what he has said in his absence. From the very first day that this proposal was made - when, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> says, it was received with loud cheers in the Caucus - it has been unfairly criticised. He alleges that it was received with cheers because the Labour party felt that they were going to their Sedan, as announced by one of our members, who has evidently successfully pulled the leg of such individuals as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl,</inline> who are inclined to take such things seriously. It is quite true that the moment the policy was announced1 it was accepted by the Labour party, because we have always believed in the principle of this measure, although it had not been previously defined within the four corners of a Bill. Who started the abuse in connexion with the question ? Within two days after the policy was declared. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> denounced it as " a low down political trick." The arguments that he has been using for months past he has repeated this morning, though I must admit that they were couched to-day in clearer and more gentlemanly language. What is the truth in regard to this being a political trick? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> states that in travelling- round the country he has met people belonging to all sections of society, some of whom recognise that the Bill is a political trick, though they intend to support it because they believe if will do a great deal of good. Now, I do not know of any claim that any party can have to occupy the Treasury bench and bring forward proposals in  a  democratic Parliament unless they manifest a desire and willingness to pass that legislation which the people wish to see carried. I do not know of any higher compliment that can be paid to us by our political opponents than to say that we are introducing popular measures. What could be said more favorable to the Labour party than that our legislation is good and that people intend to support it? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> might have gone further. That view of the matter is not confined merely to the man in the street. The bulk of the members of the Opposition in the Senate, and in another place, have adopted the same attitude. They denounced the measure, and abused those who introduced it, but, when they found that the people desired such legislation, and that it was popular, they lacked the courage of their convictions, and refused, in another place, to call for a division and register their votes against the Bill. I trust that a division will be called for in the Senate. Where has. the abuse come from? A few days after the proposal was announced in caucus, there was a political dinner given, at which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt,</inline> the leader of the State Government of Victoria, described it as a political dodge brought forward merely with the idea of catching votes. He said that in Victoria the State has control over a number of institutions in which all that is necessary is provided for in the interests of mother and child. I have not the report of the speech by me, but I think I am quoting <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt</inline> fairly. He said that if the proposal were given effect, the allowance would not go to the mother of the child, or to the child ; that every one knew the medical profession, and they knew that the doctors would simply increase the maternity fees, with the result that the allowance would merely be a sop to the medical profession. </para>

                            <para>- Does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger indorse that statement ? If there is one class in the community which more than another has displayed a noble spirit of willingness to help those who are unable to help themselves, it is the medical profession. No public man, and no member of a State or the Federal Parliament, is entitled to abuse members of that profession, which has rendered such magnificent service to women. Such statements are unworthy of any public man, and they indicate the depths to which members of a political party can descend. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl,</inline> when speaking of the Labour Government and the proposal to pay a maternity allowance, made the statement that if a certain class of legislation submitted by the Labour Government is carried into effect, the day is not far distant when in this State a man will have  to  have two wives. If that is not abuse, I do not know what is. I regard it as one of the strongest statements ever made on  a  public platform. I do not believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> seriously advocated that  a  man should have two wives. I would not attribute that to him for a moment, but I do say that, in making that statement, he desired to suggest to the people that if the legislation of the Labour party be continued, it will be necessary for  a  man to have two wives if the ordinary work of his household is to be got through every day. -I regret the honorable senator's absence from the chamber. I believe that he made the statement referred to with the object only of throwing so much mud at the Labour party. </para>

In this matter, I  cannot congratulate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger as I am able to congratulate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl.</inline> The latter honorable senator has repeated here the statements to which he has been giving utterance for months past, and has announced his intention to vote against the Bill. On the other hand, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger has gone round the country enunciating definite principles, and when he comes here he repeats only portions of the remarks he has made outside, and qualifies, or absolutely contradicts, some of the statements he has made at public meetings. I can refer to one case in support of what I say. In the course of his address yesterday, the honorable senator said that he did not believe that the monetary advantage of the proposed allowance would lead to any increase in illegitimacy. </para>

                            <para>- It is a reasonable inference from the honorable senator's remarks at Hamilton. Yet he told us yesterday that no amount of such assistance would have that effect. I wish to refer now to another statement which has been made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl.</inline> At a meeting "of ladies yesterday he said that he was pleased to know that the ladies had not said an abusive word  of any single individual. I admit that their language has not been vulgar, but: one lady, a <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Kerr</inline> - I do not know whether she weighed her words deliberately - made the statement that as the result of her experience she had no sympathy with the expression " grievously sinned  against,"' used in the Federal Parliament, as those who had experience knew 'that those cases; were very few. Is it not correct to interpret that statement as meaning that, apart from cases where persons have yielded to the passion of the moment, and which are very few, all those who have been unfortunate must have deliberately mapped out for themselves a particular course of living? No greater insult could be hurled, at our women folk than that statement, made at a meeting of women: as reported in last evening's <inline font-style="italic">Herald.</inline> The Government propose the grant of a maternity allowance, which some people are fond of describing as a " baby bonus." The first question that we have to ask is, whether it is necessary. There is not a single church representative who has expressed himself strongly in opposition to the Bill who has not also admitted' the necessity of providing help for mothers at this critical period of their lives. There is not a single member of this Parliament, or an individual member of" the public, who will deny the necessity for it. The question then arises: How can it be best provided for? It is said that we propose by this Bill to hand over grants of £5 to assist women at this period of their lives without-  asking very many questions. Why are we not going to ask any questions? It is because to do so would bring the proposed allowance down to the level of a charitable dole, which the people of Australia, and particularly our women folk, would regard as a personal insult, and so the proposed law would be ineffective. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> dealing with another objection to the Bill, said he preferred some scheme of insurance to which the people should contribute, and that under such a system people would be relieved of the feeling that the allowance was a charity. On the other hand, we have honorable senators saying that the moment the purse strings of the Treasury are opened for the payment of such grants people, even in good positions, who should be ashamed of themselves for doing so, would probably rush the Treasury to obtain the </para>

                            <para>- If that be so, it cannot be correct to say that the people will regard it as a charitable dole. I am merely pointing out that the statements made do not agree. But do the people not contribute to the fund from which this allowance will be paid? Something was said to the effect that those who pay land tax do contribute, but I wish to point out that people of the working classes make substantial contributions to the fund from which such allowances will be paid. The average working man with a family living in the suburbs of Melbourne is contributing by way of Commonwealth, State, municipal, and other taxation nearly <inline font-style="italic">£18</inline> per annum. That is too much, considering the enormous revenue duties on everything his family eats, drinks, or wears. Surely such a man is contributing to the fund? I feel sure that one of the reasons why people are not clamouring to-day for the removal of our revenue duties is that they recognise that they are contributing to the funds of the Commonwealth, and are in return getting such benefits as old-age and invalid pensions and the proposed maternity allowance. I believe that if we abolished this kind of legislation there would within twenty-four hours be a unanimous clamour for the removal of the revenue duties which bear so heavily upon the people. The necessity for this legislation is admitted by all sections of the community. It is said that the grant is too low in some cases. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> used another unfortunate expression to-day. He said he thought he would be willing to give more money in the case of " the unfortunates." If I were to adopt the practice which has been indulged in for the last few months, it would be quite possible for me, not only in Parliament, but in the country districts where there is a press circulating, to say that the honorable senator, from his place in Parliament, advocated increasing the allowance to " the unfortunates." We have no desire to do that sort of thing. I trust that I, at all events, will not descend to that level. The honorable senator's statement is certainly ' open to that interpretation, but it would be mean and contemptible to attribute to him a meaning which I do not think for a moment he intended to convey. Still, when you go to the country districts, pick up the local press, and meet people who have been at meetings, you find that instead of an indefinite charge being levelled against the Labour party, there simply has been an insinuation that if the people were not careful something would happen. In my opinion, this is one of the finest pieces of legislation ever submitted to this Parliament. I believe that it is in full agreement with the desires of 80 per cent, of the community. I believe that there will be no abuse of this grant by the medical profession, and whilst the doctors may ask for a reasonable fee, as they are entitled to, I expect, despite the slander of the State Premier against a noble profession, that they will continue to render that splendid service which they have rendered to the community hitherto. On the question of whether the grant is likely to increase the illegitimacy of Australia, I desire to say a few words. If I thought for a moment - and I am expressing the opinions of a good many persons - that this legislation would have any tendency of that sort, I would not be found supporting it. When women - young women as a rule - have the misfortune to fall in this way, I believe that the allowance will enable them to get that attention and comfort which may be the cause of preventing them from falling still lower. If it will have that effect, we shall have well earned the good opinion of, not only the clergymen and the moralists of this State, but every clean-thinking man and woman in the community. Nearly all the members of the Opposition have been converted to this proposal ; the clergymen have withdrawn most of the statements they made against it; and the politicians and the organizers of the different political parties are getting round to the position of saying, " The principle is a splendid one ; the idea is a great one ; the people want this legislation, and we are anxious, not only to give all that it contains, but to go further in regard to the benefits for which provision should be made." Seeing that we have now arrived at that happy position, I trust that those who took the opportunity of misrepresenting the maternity allowance, of saying that the Prime Minister and his colleagues gloried in the fact that they were going to grant the allowance in cases where the children were illegitimate, will now be manly enough either to withdraw such statements or to demand a division in the Senate, and vote against the measure which they have condemned practically from A to Z. I trust that this legislation will be carried. I have every confidence that it will have that beneficial effect among the womenfolk of Australia which its framers intend, and if it does, this Parliament will have justified itself from the humanitarian point of view, and earned the good wishes of all lovers of civilization and clean morality. </para>

                        <para>. - I cannot allow this measure to pass its second reading without saying exactly what I think about it, and also explaining why I offer it a straight-out and uncompromising opposition. I ask myself the question whether there is any demand for this Bill. The question of social amelioration is being considered in many countries, and quite rightly, too, but the schemes are all more or less on a contributory basis, which I believe to be better in character than this proposal. Take the Insurance Act which was passed in Great Britain only last year. In its comprehensiveness it is a heroic measure. The whole intention of that legislation is humane from beginning to end, but it is not a charitable scheme ; it is contributory from start to finish. It calls upon the employer, the workman, and the Government to make contributions towards the system. </para>

                            <para>- That may be the honorable senator's opinion, but it is not mine. I believe in the principle. I believe in a contributory system under which the workman pays something, the employer pays something, and the Government give a subvention. Under the English Act the contribution comes to something like is. per week. The Government pay 5d. and the balance is distributed between the employer and the employ^, though not always equally. Sometimes the workman pays 2d. and at other times 3d. or 4d. The amount he pays is not always the same, but there is a contribution from each party. </para>

                            <para>- There is a reason for this measure. The Labour party took away the postal vote from the women in maternity cases. They find that they made a very grave mistake, and have become unpopular in consequence. They want to recover that ground, and so this Bill is brought in with the idea of bringing the women into line again. </para>

That is, I believe, the full and true reason for the introduction of this measure. Of course, I know that our honorable friends on the other side are declaring that it is humanitarian legislation - that it is brought in with a desire to help the poor women, and so on - and those who oppose the Bill are accused of being Pharisees and hypocrites, having no soul or humanity about them. I believe that the Pharisaical spirit is altogether on the other side. I can imagine one of my honorable friends opposite piously crossing his hands over his breast, and saying - </para>

We are told that this has always been the idea of the Labour party. Although a Labour Conference was held so recently as last January in Hobart, this was not put on the platform. It was not put out as something which the Labour Ministry were to have brought into operation immediately. They were not even commissioned to adopt this bit of patchwork legislation in any way. </para>

                            <para>- The Church of England has a Home of Mercy at Walkerville in which every attention is given to the inmates. The Roman Catholic Church has a similar refuge in the Fullarton district, where it does all that it can to relieve necessitous cases. The Salvation Army undertakes the same sort of work. The Maternity Home at Rose Park is an institution in which women who can afford to pay something for the attention which is bestowed upon them receive very considerable help. In addition, there is the District Trained Nurses' Society, which is doing a really fine work. Its members are the ministering angels of the State, They recognise no creed, no political party, and no religious shibboleth. The only question which they ask is, " Is there any need of pur assistance?" If so, it is granted immediately. Nearly every centre in South Australia is supplied with nurses in this way. Adelaide, Port Adelaide, Unley, the municipalities of Norwood, St. Peters, Gawler, Port Pirie, Yorke's Peninsula, and a great many others are all supplied with them. The society is supported largely by private contributions. To my mind it represents the organization of the "ministering angels." It was Scott who wrote - </para>

                            <para>- That is all right. I pay my taxes, but I send my children to a private school and pay for their education. At the same time I would like to see education free and open to all, from the primary school to the University. That, however, is not a parallel case to the one which we are discussing. In regard to the proposed maternity allowance, we simply say, " Come along. Dip your hand into this Government bag. Here is a horn of Cornucopia. . Come along and take£5 when you want it." We do not apply that principle to old-age pensions. </para>

A contributory system of insurance is the right system, and would encourage in our people all those manly qualities that we desire to inculcate in them, such as grit, independence, thrift, and self-reliance.

                            <para>- I have contributed to a fund upon which I can draw in case of need. These societies insure their members against sickness and death. They provide medical attendance for their members and the families of those members at a very small cost. They also make provision that reduced fees shall be paid in cases of confinement. The Government of New South Wales grant a subvention to these friendly societies. They do it on the principle of helping those who are endeavouring to help themselves ; and that is a thoroughly sound principle, which ought to be adopted by every Government at all times. Another aspect of the case is this : It has been shown that what we ought to do is not so much to look after the mother in her time of confinement, as to look after the child during the first twelve months of its existence. What did the Governor-General's Speech say at the opening of this Parliament? It regretted the fact that every year nearly 9,000 children died in this Commonwealth under one year of age. Ought it not to be our task to try to remedy that state of things ? An honorable senator said last night that the child! is the greatest asset the State can have. So it is ; and for that reason we ought to devote every care to the preservation of the child when it comes into the world. </para>

                        <para>As far as the Commonwealth is concerned, only a very small amount of infantile deaths are due to circumstances connected with the time of birth. Most of these' children are doomed to die either by prenatal causes or from their subsequent environment. In the former case a subsidy at birth is ineffectual, because it is too late: in the latter case, because it is too little - unless the environment is alcoholic, when it is too much. What would be said to a proposal to bestow on shipping companies a bonus of j£j a head for all immigrants leaving England if it were known that one in every ten of those immigrants would die within twelve months of their arrival here, and there were no stipulations with the companies as to selection in England, or conditions of life on the voyage? Yet, this is on all fours with the present proposal. </para>

In the past there has been no need for us to worry much .about this. &lt; Through the foresight of Colonel Light we have had given us for all time abundant air spaces in and about our city, in our public squares and park lands; and we do not yet adequately recognise the debt which we and our successors owe to the founder of the city for this wise provision. But in the suburbs the case is different. There is practically no provision for any such air spaces. </para>

                        <para>Turning to an analysis of the chief causes of infantile mortality we find that by far the greatest proportion of deaths are comprised under two heads - and that these two alone give 55 per cent, of the deaths, 30 per cent, being constantly due to prematurity, congenital debility, and malformation, and 25 per cent, to diarrhoea and enteritis. Bronchitis and pneumonia, so fruitful a source of deaths in colder climates, only account for 5 to 7 per cent., and here, again, we are reminded of the favorable natural conditions we enjoy. It is characteristic of all countries that the largest proportion of infantile deaths come under the first head. Up to a very few years ago,- any thought of reducing this proportion was looked upon as outside the range of practical politics. However, the marvellous rise into prominence during the last few years of the science of eugenics, the latest born of the sciences - still only an infant itself, but with no appearance of congenital debility - is compelling us  to  revise this long accepted doctrine. It may  be  early yet  to  talk dogmatically  on  the subject, but the report during the twelve months  of  the Sub-Committee  of  the </para>

                            <para>- She does not, know what is going to happen with regard to herself. She does not know whether she will get the money or not. I do not believe that the women of the Common-  wealth want this allowance. The States are already doing a great deal in needy cases. I shall not discuss the constitutional aspect of the question. Frankly, I do not care whether the Bill is constitutional or not. If I thought that what was proposed was right in itself, I would vote for it, and chance its constitutionality. I am not opposing the measure on constitutional grounds, nor am I going to say whether it will encourage illegitimacy or not. Certainly it will not discourage illegitimacy. I thoroughly agree with what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St..</inline> Ledger said last night, that if you are going to start this sort of business you will have to adopt a different attitude towards women. Instead of making the woman bear all the burden, ostracising her, and condemning her, whilst allowing the man who has wronged her to go scot free, you will have to put the man on the same level, ostracise him, and punish him. We do something of that kind in South Australia, because there, the putative father, if he can be found, is brought up and made to provide for the mother. We want equality before the law for men and women in these affairs, and should not leave the woman to bear the whole burden whilst the man is very often looked upon as a hero. </para>

                            <para>- I think we have some power, although I admit that there is a difference of opinion about it. I d© not say that the mother of an illegitimate  child, who is in distressed circumstances, ought not to be looked after just as much as any other mother. But if we want to do that we should alter the law in another manner. In this Bill you are saying to the woman who is living in open adultery : "We will give you a maternity allowance;" you are saying to the harlot : " We will give you a maternity allowance;" whilst you say to the Asiatic woman : " We will give you nothing." This raises a somewhat curious position. Take the case of an Asiatic woman married to a European. On the birth of a half-caste child no allowance can be paid under this measure. </para>

At the same time, while the Bill wastes money without advantage, it does nothing to prevent waste of life. Holding these views, I shall have to vote against the measure. </para>

                            <para>- If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger will contain himself in patience, perhaps I may be able to satisfy even him before I am finished. Every one knows that when this proposal was first mooted, the party in opposition denounced it. Those in Parliament, as well as people outside, were loud and uncompromising in their opposition to the whole proposal. Yet we find now that both in another place and here most of those who originally opposed the policy, instead of being manly enough to maintain an attitude in accordance with their previous declarations, -as soon as they found that the tide of public opinion was not with them, commenced to shape their course accordingly. There are two honorable exceptions in the honorable senators whom I have mentioned. They have adhered to their wholesale condemnation, and intend to vote against the Bill. I have very much pleasure in congratulating both <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> upon the honest attitude which they have assumed. It is refreshing to see men who are manly enough to stand up for what they believe to be right apart altogether from any ulterior considerations. I have nothing but admiration for those who do that, although I may entirely disagree with them. What has been the main contention in regard to this Bill ? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger went to all the bun-worries he could attend in Victoria to condemn this measure. </para>

                            <para>- I have just said that the honorable senator went to as many as he could go to. He is so much in demand for these bun-worries and tea-fights that the Women's National League would like him to be able to make half-a-dozen of himself in order that he might attend them all. What has been his contribution to the discussion of this proposal? He has said that it is "a sop to profligacy." </para>

Will he go to any woman who, on giving birth to a child, a future citizen of the Commonwealth, accepts the allowance of ^5 and say that she has accepted a sop to profligacy, and is one of the profligates £0 whom the Government intend to give this sop? </para>

                            <para>- I have not the slightest doubt that the honorable senator made the statement when he thought there would be a popular outcry against the proposal on the ground that the allowance is to be given to a mother in any circumstances. The Bill proposes to give every mother the allowance, irrespective of whether the maternity occurs 'in or out of wedlock. The Council of Churches, our friends on the opposite side, and their compatriots outside, thought they would get the Labour party in a cleft stick over this proposal. That is why <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger described the allowance as a sop to profligacy. That is why he sought to raise an outcry against the proposal by an appeal to the Pharisaical feelings of certain people outside. I have a greater sympathy for the woman who is engaged in maternity out of wedlock than for the woman who becomes a mother in wedlock, and for the reason that she needs that sympathy more. What is the position of a young girl who, betrayed and deserted, becomes a mother out of wedlock ? Not only is she deserted by her betrayer who has caused her fall, but she is very often deserted by her own people. I have known young girls whose parents were well to do, and even wealthy, to be turned from their doors because they were about to become mothers in such circumstances. Fathers, mothers, sisters and brothers have refused to look at them, or recognise them. What is to become of a poor girl in such circumstances? Is she to be left entirely outside the pale? Is she, because, in a weak moment, she has fallen, owing to the. temptation of one of those very nice men who have been referred to in the Senate sometimes, to be left absolutely to her own resources?  Her  friends and relatives turn from her, and the rest of the community  ostracise her in the same way. It is for this reason that I say the girl who becomes a mother under such circumstances has more of my sympathy than the woman whose child is born in wedlock. It is simply because she needs sympathy and help more. A child born out of wedlock may be superior to any child born in wedlock. 1 go so far as to say that, from the natural point of view, no child is illegitimate. Nature has never given birth to an illegitimate child during the whole history of this earth. Every child is born in accordance with natural law, and, therefore, cannot be illegitimate. But because we have imposed certain conventions we say that any one who disobeys those conventional laws are to be condemned, and their children are illegitimate. </para>

                            <para>- We have to cover it up. I have no doubt that a multitude of sins are committed in the dark. I do not wish to treat this very serious subject lightly. I have pointed out that girls who become mothers under the circumstances I have referred to are in far greater need of help and sympathy than are women engaged in maternity in wedlock. In Australia we badly need a large population. No one will deny that the most desirable population we can have will be those born and reared here. Leaving the question of so-called illegitimacy for the time, let me refer to this aspect of the question. I am able to say, from my own knowledge, experience, and observation, that the birth rate of Australia is very considerably reduced because mothers are unable to get proper medical and nursing attention at the time of their first birth. These are aspects of the question which one cannot discuss fully in an assembly of this kind, but any honorable senator who doubts my statement has only to consult a medical man to have it borne out completely. It often happens that, owing to a lack of proper medical attention and nursing, a. woman at her first birth, or even at later births, is rendered incapable of bearing further children. Every married man of experience knows that. I say, therefore, that in giving assistance to women at such a time to secure proper medical attention and nursing, we shall be taking the most proper, necessary, and, I hope, effective step to increase the birth rate, and, consequently, the population of the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- I am willing to accept that statement. If the grant of the proposed allowance will secure to a mother proper care and attention at this critical period of her life, it will insure that instead of her natural functions becoming disordered, as frequently happens, through lack of proper attention at such a time, she will have a successful birth, not only on that one occasion, but, it may be, on several subsequent occasions. Every one who has given any attention to the subject knows that, in many cases, women who lack the necessary care at such a time are never able to have a successful birth again. The honorable senator is, therefore, entirely wrong when he says that this Bill will not lead to an increase in the birth rate. If, as the result of the care which may be given through the proposed allowance, a woman is successful in giving birth to a child, we may reasonably hope that she will have several successful births later. In that way, I contend, the birth rate will be increased under the operation of this Bill. Unfortunately for myself, I have had to pay a heavy price for the experience I have gained. I know that what I am saying is absolutely true. If it had not been that I was in a position to spend hundreds of pounds for the necessary care of my wife at the birth of her first child, the probability is that I should never have had another. Now I have five, and I shall not regret if there are five to follow. I am giving my experience as a contribution to this debate, because I know it is an absolute fact that many women are unable to have subsequent successful births because of the lack of attention at such a critical time. If this Bill will enable tens of thousands of women to have that needful attention which otherwise they could not have, we can reasonably hope that it will very largely increase the effective birth rate of Australia, as well as ameliorate the suffering of thousands of women who could not otherwise get the necessary attention. The bulk of the people of Australia have to be content with an income of about £2 per week, or even less. Most workmen who are engaged in manual, or even clerical toil, cannot be sure of getting regularly much more than that income. I think it can be fairly, stated that if you allow for loss of time through the state of the weather, and other causes, the general average of the incomes of these people, on which they have to get married, maintain a house, and' bring up a family, does not exceed £100 or £120 a year. I know, of course, that there are plenty of artisans who get ,£400 or £500 a year, and I am aware that there are plenty of men in responsible positions who get £1,000, or even £2,000 a year, but I am speaking of the general average of the incomes. That being so, how is a man to make adequate provision so that his wife can be assured of receiving the necessary medical attention and nursing comforts at a critical time in her life ? Whether it is on economical or humanitarian grounds, or on the ground of broad Christian charity, this Bill can .be justified on any platform in Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> at any rate, had the grace to say he thought that it could be justified on' economical grounds, but he went a little further than that. He practically insinuated, that it was altogether disgraceful on the part of the Labour party that they should try to justify the measure on humanitarian grounds. I disagree with that view altogether. Even if the Bill could not be justified on economic grounds, there is ample justification for it on the grounds of humanitarianism. On the economic ground, I think we can all agree that if the Bill tends to very largely increase the effective population, that it will be ample justification for the expenditure  of the money, whatever it may be. There are several other economic grounds on which it could be justified, but I know that the Government are anxious to get on with business, and I do not propose to go into them at all. Apart from that altogether, the relief of human suffering, the giving to a woman of a sufficient amount to insure to her the necessary care and attention when she is performing the highest function of womanhood, furnishes a ground on which alone the Bill could be more than justified. But we do not need any justification for the measure beyond the knowledge that it will be a blessing to tens of thousands of mothers who otherwise could not get the comforts and the attention which they need. We have been twitted with the fact that we propose to give the allowance to every mother whether she needs it or not. If my wife should ever present me with another baby, I shall not have the slightest hesitation in advising her to apply for, and accept, the money. We have been told by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon,</inline> and others, that what is needed is a contributory scheme. In fact, they have harped so much on the word " contributory " that it seems to be like the blessed, word Mesapotamia,  which had such a comforting sound to the old lady's soul. One would think that the word " contributory " covers the whole ground. Our honorable friends opposite say that the Bill, because it does not provide for a contributory scheme, will destroy that manly or womanly self-reliance, that, habit of providence, which ought to be inculcated in the people, arid which they ought to be taught to pursue. What grander example of forethought, or of the principle of contribution, can you have than the whole people combining and contributing together in order to provide for a national  need?  Why, the very essence of schemes of this kind is that instead of relying upon the isolated, helpful efforts which may be put out by a few charitably disposed persons, instead of relying on this altogether unsatisfactory means, we get the whole people to join <inline font-style="italic">en masse</inline> to contribute to help the mothers of the nation. There is no grander principle of combining to provide for the future, no grander principle of self-help, no grander principle of self-reliance, than the whole of the people combining together and contributing every day of their lives to a scheme which will enable such a great object as this to be accomplished. Therefore, when honorable senators opposite talk about the special virtues of their so-called contributory schemes, when they talk of teaching the people to be self-reliant, and to adopt provident habits, and the rest of the flapdoodle we hear so often from that side, I reply that they are barking up the wrong tree, because they are forgetting that the grandest example you could have of that sort of thing is the whole of the people combining together to provide for every case which occurs, and not relying upon the indiscriminate charity of a few well-meaning persons, who help a few cases, and leave the bulk to go unaided. We have been told also, as one of the faults of this proposal, that it is  altogether  unnecessary, that it is  worthy  of condemnation, and that we should propose to offer this maternity allowance, which has been described by our friends opposite as a <inline font-style="italic">£5</inline> dole, only to those who are in need of it. The beauty of this proposal is that it is not a dole at all. We do not propose to give a dole to anybody, but to give back to every mother what is her absolute right, and what is provided for by the whole nation. It will be her right to apply for it after she has fulfilled the necessary conditions, which are that she should give birth to a baby, and register the fact in the ordinary way. The Bill does not take any cognisance of whether she is rich' or poor. If our friends opposite had their way, they would compel1 her to declare that she was in a condition of poverty. </para>

                            <para>- -They want women to be compelled to go cap in hand, and say,  " We are miserable paupers, and we beg you to give us a dole." The Council of Churches said, " We would be content to give this relief to the mothers who give birth to children out of wedlock, provided that you give the money to us to distribute." It was quite a laudable proposal then ; but when the State proposes to give the money without question or qualification - simply because a woman has become a mother, and registered the fact - the proposal is altogether wrong. The deputation to the Prime Minister were quite content that the so-called illegitimate mother should get this £$, provided that the representatives of the Council of the Churches had the handling of the money, but when it is to be handled by the State, it is altogether wrong. I do not propose to further labour the question. The Bill can be amply justified whether it is on the economic, . the humanitarian, or the Christian ground. Christ, when he was asked to condemn the sinner, absolutely refused. I suppose that every honorable senator has read the book of the Rev. Charles Kingsley, in which one of the characters is made to read a poem, which falls, after he is captured by the gamekeeper, into the hands of the squire, who reads it. In this poem, the Rev. Charles Kingsley - I forget whether it occurs in <inline font-style="italic">Alton Locke,</inline> or another book - states that a poor girl is condemned because she, to use a colloquial phrase, has fallen, and that perhaps the squire's daughter would have done the same thing if she had been placed in the same position. It is quite likely that she would. We do not know the temptations to which these people are subjected. We do not know the lengths to which they are driven by their squalid surroundings, or their environment, and therefore we should not be too ready to condemn them. At . any rate, there is no single one of us who has obeyed all his lifetime the whole of the moral law. There is not one of us who has not, at some time or other, fallen away from the paths of strict rectitude. There is not one of us who can say that he is the righteous person who is entitled to cast the first stone. There is not one of us who has not sinned in company with all these people whom our friends opposite are so ready to condemn. </para>

                            <para>- Why should any one adopt a self-righteous attitude, and say that this is a blot on the Bill, that the mother who needs help most should be denied it altogether, or that it should only be given to her vicariously, provided she is willing to proclaim her shame by entering a home of refuge. The very fact that this <inline font-style="italic">£s</inline> will be available to any unfortunate girl at the critical hour of her life, and perhaps enable her to pay her board, will assist to save thousands who would otherwise perish because pf the conventional punishment which has  hitherto been meted out to them. I regret to say that women have been the most ready to condemn each other. Up to the present 'time, these unfortunate girls have been ostracised. But this Bill will place no such bar upon any mother ; and I hope that every mother in Australia will avail herself of its provisions to the utmost extent. If they do so, nothing but good' will result; and I am sure that the very persons who are opposed to it to-da}' will be absolutely in accord with it ten years hence. Indeed, I do not know that, before the lapse of that time, my honorable friends opposite will not be getting up on the public platform' and declaring that they were responsible for the introduction of the Bill, and that they would have accomplished a great deal more but for the opposition of the Labour party. </para>

                        <para>. - I must oppose this Bill upon many grounds. Knowing the world as I do fairly well, I have no hesitation in saying that there is no country upon earth which is so independent of a Bill of this character as is Australia. I know of no country where the people generally are as well off as they are in the Commonwealth. I know of n» country where there are so many charitable institutions to meet the needs of the deserving, and even of the "undeserving, poor, as there are in Australia. If there be any person in need in any way, there are charitable institutions which will meet his or her case. </para>

To begin with, I imagine that the need for a provision of this kind exists only in about 1 per cent, of the births registered in Australia. At any rate, it would not exist in more than 2 per cent, or  3  per cent, of those births. </para>

                            <para>- Only a very small percentage of the people who are in really necessitous circumstances, will benefit under this Bill. I make that statement knowing, as I do, not merely Victoria, but Queensland and the other States. To pass legislation of this character, which will apply only to a small number of persons, is not wise. Is there any sense in imposing a tax upon the poor in order to give to the rich? We know that taxation has been increased in the Commonwealth so that to-day it falls very heavily upon the people. I am not speaking for myself, because I have enough to live upon, and those who succeed me will, I hope, be able to look after themselves. To tax people who cannot afford to pay, in order to give money to thousands who do not require assistance, is absurd in the extreme. There is no justification for such a course of action. If my honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens,</inline> who is a big-brained man, can see any question of sentiment in that, I am sorry that  1  differ from him. Humanitarian sentiments are prompted by a desire to help the needy, the suffering, and the criminal.. My desire is to uplift persons who are in the gutter, and to encourage them to remain up. But while I say that, I am glad to know that the position in Australia is not nearly so bad as it is in other parts of the world. When on a visit to Glasgow recently, during the continuance of a strike there, it took me an hour to get  3  miles in my motor car. To my amazement and horror, I saw women with babies in their arms and at their feet who were not able to walk straight, and I experienced a dreadful sensation. It is in that direction that we need to uplift the people. We require to teach them not to imbibe stuff that will addle their brains and drive them into the gutter. </para>

                            <para>- A gift of ^5 will probably make matters worse. The people of Australia have a reputation for sobriety. If one visits the Melbourne Cup, he may not see a drunken man all day, notwithstanding that there may be 100,000 people present. But if one goes to the Derby in England, he will see hundred's of persons drunk. In returning from the course, he will need to be extremely careful that he does not drive over these persons in the middle of the streets. In my opinion, nine-tenths of the crime committed in Australia, and a great deal of the destitution to be found here, is due to bad habits - to drink, &amp;c. </para>

It is one of those measures which ought to be regarded as above all party considerations. I sympathize with the Government in the position which they occupy by reason of their having brought forward the Bill at the present juncture. If they desired, it to be regarded "from other than a political stand-point, they indeed occupy an unfortunate position, seeing that the women who will be benefited by it have recently been exhibiting their resentment because they have been deprived of one of their undoubted rights and privileges. lt is this circumstance which lends colour to the suggestion that there is a certain amount of political jobbery connected with the introduction of the Bill.

                            <para>- I have already said that the position of the Government in regard to this measure lends colour to the accusation which has been made that the policy was initiated as a political dodge. But I shall not labour that point, because, strictly speaking, it has nothing to do with the Bill. I wish to give my own ideas' concerning it. I deprecate very much the tactics which have been resorted to by Ministerial supporters in casting reflections upon those who have shown antagonism to their policy. I especially deprecate the allusions made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Blakey</inline> to Lady Way, with whom I am not personally acquainted, although I know of her on account of her public-spirited, philanthropic work. </para>

                            <para>- I do not wish to say any more on that point. I have looked into the newspapers and elsewhere for information on this subject, and have failed to find any statistical  or other reasons for the introduction of this measure. The Vice-President of the Executive Council, in moving the second reading, recommended it, practically under the cloak of Christianity. If it were permissible, I would call his attitude hypocritical cant. For any honorable senator to use the name of our Saviour Jesus Christ in advocacy of this measure is next to blasphemy. I expected that some honorable senators would give statistics or reasons to show that such a Bill is required. But evidently that did not suit their book. I venture to say that not 10 per cent, of the women of this country require such aid. A'n older man than myself, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser,</inline> this morning said that he did not believe that more than 2 per cent, of the mothers of Australia would require the grant. Let us suppose that there are 10 per cent, of Australian mothers who are - in need. Let us suppose that another 15 per cent., who do not really require such aid, would nevertheless be pleased to receive it. We may allow that, for the sake of argument, another 10 per cent., who have no real claim upon the resources of the Commonwealth, will take the money. That leaves 65 per cent, of the mothers of Australia who do not wish for any measure of Government assistance. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> could not see the difference between moral profligacy and monetary profligacy. But they are quite different. In view of the fact that this Bill provides for taking public funds from the Treasury for people who do not require such aid, I venture to say that the term " monetary profligacy," used by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger, is not too strong a one to use. It appears to me to be absolutely repulsive that th© resources of the public Treasury should be used for this purpose. Honorable senators opposite cannot point to any other part of the world where such a Bill has been placed on the statute-book. God forbid that I should think that the majority of the mothers of Australia are practically paupers. Indeed, I believe they are, as a rule, in a better condition than mothers in other parts of the world. I do not wish it to be inferred that I have not the strongest sympathy with women in their hour of trial. I realize that it is the most severe of all nature's trials. As some one has put the idea in very fine language, " When a women goes down to the gates of death, she has either to pass through quickly, or return bearing in her hand the flaming torch of a new life." I yield to no one in my sympathy for such women. I would extend relief wherever relief was required. If the Government had brought down a measure providing for rendering assistance where it was necessary, it would have had my hearty support. But the strong objection I have to the Bill is that it gives money indiscriminately from the Treasury to those who are absolutely in no need of it. I do not say that many who do not require the aid will not take it.- We cannot blame any one for taking it as soon as this measure becomes the law of the land. I am quite sure that there are few people in Australia to-day to whom a <inline font-style="italic">£5</inline> note would not be more or less acceptable. Much has been said from a humanitarian point of view in advocacy of the Bill. I say, however, that the measure goes quite beyond the limits of humanitarianism. Humanitarianism means philanthropy; but is there any philanthropy in a Bill which goes as far as this does? Absolutely none. I would support it if it could be justified on those grounds. </para>

It was all very well for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> to say yesterday that honorable senators who said it would have the effect of increasing illegitimacy should prove it. It is impossible to, prove it until it has had-a trial. There are, I believe, only two places in the world in which an allowance of this kind is indiscriminately given. </para>

                            <para>- Then I apologize to the honorable senator ; I must have misunderstood him. The question raised is one which can only be proved by statistics when the results of the operation of the allowance are before us. Still, I must say that I do not, for a moment, believe that the women of Australia would be prepared to sacrifice themselves for ^5, <inline font-style="italic">£10,</inline> or £20. It is useless to argue upon this phase of the question, as time only can prove which view of it is right, and which is wrong. The Bill goes too far from a humanitarian point of view, and, as I believe the principle of it to be absolutely wrong, it is my duty, not only to speak against it, but to vote against the second reading. </para>

                        <para>. - I welcome this measure, first, for itself, and, secondly, because I believe it to be only the forerunner of much more comprehensive legislation of the same kind. The members of the Opposition are, in this matter, in the position of the man who was " Willing to wound, and yet afraid to strike." Most of them have been damning the measure with very faint praise. Some of them have execrated it as something almost beneath contempt. The word " humanitarian " has been very much in evidence during the debate, but I discard that word altogether. I say that this is a good business measure. This is good business for the people of Australia. We have heard a great deal of late years about the birth rate, the empty cradle, and the huge vacant spaces of Australia. Honorable senators of the Opposition are loud in their call for immigration from "anywhere - from Europe, and even from Asia, if it were permissible. Here we have the first attempt made by an Australian Government to encourage the production of population within the boundaries of Australia. Whatever be the ostensible  reason  for the introduction of this measure, I believe that is the real reason for it. </para>

This Bill is only the forerunner of much more comprehensive, legislation of the kind, which, I hope, will be passed in the very near future. I trust that before many years have gone over our heads the medical profession will be nationalized in Australia ; that every doctor will be a public functionary, and every hospital as open as the day, with medical advice, medicine, and all that sort of thing absolutely free. I trust that the expense entailed) in securing these things, which to-day brings many working-class families to the door of ruin, will be provided for by the community as a whole. </para>

                            <para>- If it comes to free dinners, the people of the working class pay for their own. At present they are paying as well for the dinners of members of the privileged class whom <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger represents in this Chamber, the class who are getting £30,000,000 a year, as I pointed out the other day, of community-created values in Australia. That is the class for whom <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger isa special pleader. I am a special pleader for the other class." I say, that we require to abolish the privileged class. We should use the money now being squandered in fostering those people to improve the condition of the great mass of the people of this country. I have said that this Bill is good business for Australia. We want more population, and the best kind of people we can get is the local product. We ought to encourage it, and this Bill, I take it, is a step in that direction. I have had no actual experience in this matter, but the onlooker often sees most of the game. I have observed that the. coming of a child into a working-class home is a very serious tax upon the monetary resources of the home. I have known working-class parents to be driven into a condition of comparative poverty for months owing to the advent of a child. In such circumstances, I should not be one to greatly blame parents if they were exceedingly careful in such matters. </para>

                            <para>- They will not. Honorable senators opposite need not try to frighten the poor with that gag. They  are paying just as much as they are able to pay now, and in no conceivable circumstances can they pay any more. Every Act passed by a Labour Government, whether Federal or State, has a tendency to lighten the burden of the tax on the backs of the poor. As I said here the other evening, my complaint against the Federal Government is that they are not moving quickly enough in that direction. But every added item of expenditure, such as this, will stimulate the movement for the readjustment of the incidence of taxation. That is what the Opposition are weeping about. It is not a sop to profligacy, or anything of that kind that is troubling them. They do not care two straws about that sort of thing. What they are frightened of is that capital will be called upon, as I hope and believe it will, to pay a greater and still greater share of the cost of the government of this country. I do not wish to delay the passage of this measure. I had no intention whatever of opening my mouth upon it. It has my approval. I trust that within a very short time its principles will be extended so as to embrace the whole medical profession in Australia. What we require, so  far  as I can see, is to nationalize the medical profession. The health of the community is surely one of its greatest assets. </para>

                            <para>- I do not care what it would cost. What does it matter what it would cost? It would not cost £30,000,000 per annum, as it does to keep up the useless crowd of land monopolists. Even if it cost a very large sum of money, surely it would be worth it? If we could raise the standard of health in Australia, and, consequently, increase the virility and courage of the people, surely that would he worth a great deal. What is money compared with such a result as that? I shall not further delay the passing of the Bill. I hope it is only the prelude to a still greater and more comprehensive reform. I believe that it is. I shall vote for this instalment with very great pleasure. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator is now in a bit of a difficulty. He ought to apologize and go down on his knees for some things which he has said, but he will not do it. There are in the Commonwealth a few, and only a few, women who are in such condition that after the first ex-nuptial birth they are living in such circumstances as conduce to, and will certainly produce, a second and a third ex-nuptial birth. I was brought to task for a remark, which was twisted and distorted with what it would be charitable  to  call stupid perversity, because I referred in my public speeches twice to something about moral profligacy in this Bill. I shall now use a term which no honorable senator who has the slightest pretence to intelligence, or even the least shread  of political intelligence, will be able to misunderstand. </para>

                        <para>- I say that the amendment seeks to provide safeguards in cases in which women continue to live in sin and in adultery. I object to giving a grant out of the public funds - even to the extent of <inline font-style="italic">£5</inline> or£10 - to make the path of sin and adultery easy. If the Committee do not accept my amendment, I say that I was amply justified in affirming that the Bill offers a sop to profligacy. I make that statement, notwithstanding that the expression which I used on the public platform was so grossly twisted from its plain intention by honorable senators opposite. I used the term " economic profligacy " in connexion with the poor law administration of Great Britain, so that its application must have been patent to all. But its meaning was deliberately perverted by honorable senators opposite, and I can recall only one worse parallel, if I may be permitted to reverently mention it. It was the occasion on which our Redeemer was accused of preaching treason and disloyalty to Caesar, because he mentioned his kingdom. Of course, his accusers knew in their hearts that they were perverting his words. In regard to the moral sin of adultery, which, fortunately, prevails in Australia to a lesser extent than it does in any other country of the world, it is our bounden duty to make some reservation regarding the distribution of this maternity allowance. What is the object of the amendment? </para>

                        <para>- I am fighting, not dying. The amendment recognises that there are women who have been betrayed, and seeks to provide that if such women, subsequent to their first child, bear ex-nuptial children, the Commissioner shall be entitled to inquire whether they or the fathers, have means to provide for those children. Why should not the community make that inquiry ? I said last night that respect for motherhood was binding both on the individual and on the nation. But certain circumstances require to be taken into consideration. The assertion of the two principles is not inconsistent. Indeed, one is a complement of the other. Why should a grant from the public funds be made for" the second and subsequent ex-nuptial births? Because such a grant was made under the poor laws of England, every child born ex-nuptially was a source of income to the lusty vagabonds who lived on the unfortunate earnings of such mothers. The same thing may happen in a few cases here. I object to offering a sop from the public, funds to sin and adultery in circumstances of that character. Why should we blind our eyes to such a condition of affairs? The amendment provides a further alternative, namely, that every mother who is living in a maternity home or under conditions which conduce to her moral amendment may receive the grant. During the course of the debate upon the motion for the second reading of this Bill it was stated that the Council of Churches had suggested that charitable institutions ought to be charged with the duty of distributing the grant. That statement was made with a sneer and a jeer, and was more or less supported by honorable senators opposite, until I pointed out that I knew of maternity homes in more than one State to which it would be better, to give <inline font-style="italic">£5</inline> on behalf of the mother, than it would be to make an indiscriminate grant df ,£50 either to the father or mother. There are institutions in the various States under the care of which it would be a blessing for these unfortunate women to come. Does any one suggest that, after the second or third ex-nuptial birth it would not be an advantage for the mother to be brought under the influence of such institutions as are conducted by the Roman Catholic Church or by the Salvation Army? If the Government refuse to accept the amendment I shall be justified in saying that when  1  attempted to uplift these women, by providing that they should be rescued from their unfortunate surroundings, the Government positively declined to accord me their support. </para>

                    <para>. - I am very sorry that delay should have been caused by the moving of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger's amendment. Had he not been so anxious to rush into the breach at an earlier stage, it would not have been necessary for him to take up so much time in apologizing for his previous utterances, and justifying his great display of courage. No one desires to injure the honorable senator. With respect to the arguments that may be used in favour of the amendment, I will turn back to an older precept than any that has been advanced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger. I direct attention to words to be found in the New Testament, containing the injunction that if our brother offends he shall be forgiven, not seven times, but seventy times seven. What applies to our brother must apply to our weaker and often less fortunate sister. That is the only argument that need be advanced at this stage against those urged in favour of the amendment, which I hope will be defeated. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator was reported in the press fo have alleged that if this maternity, allowance were granted it would be " a sop to profligacy." Up to now he has not denied the accuracy of the report. But he has now made an <inline font-style="italic">ad misericordiam</inline> appeal. He tells us that the phrase he really used was "economic profligacy." I venture to say that in characterizing this grant as a sop to profligacy the honorable senator was hurling an insult at every woman in Australia. The amendment now before us simply means that if an unfortunate woman has been betrayed once she is to have no sympathy in the event of being betrayed a second time; and if she is to receive any assistance at all the money is to be handed over to some charitable institution which can be trusted. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger cannot trust the National Government of Australia ; that is exactly what it means. </para>

In such a home a woman of that kind could get away from objectionable surroundings. I intend to support the amendment.

                    <para>- - The charge has been repeated again and again against me that I have insulted the womanhood of Australia. But with my amendment before the Committee my meaning must be open and clear to every one. Towards the close of the debate last night, in order thai there might be no mistake, I read certain principles, which will appear in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> One of them was that respect for motherhood was binding both on the nation and the individual. But, notwithstanding that I made that thoroughly clear, my meaning is still distorted - maliciously and deliberately, I am afraid - by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham.</inline> I have indicated the evil which I wish to prevent. Every one now understands it. If some such amendment is not to be inserted in the Bill, I do not see how that evil is to be guarded against. We have all heard of throwing sops to Cerberus. There is a certain moral condition, happily not too prevalent in society, but still existent, to" which I object to throwing sops. My amendment would permit an unfortunate woman to be assisted in the best and safest way. To secure that object is my only desire. The Bill at present is defective, and it is in order to guard against moral profligacy that I have moved the amendment. Every one now understands it, and any honorable senator who does not withdraw the imputations he has made against' me is, I will say again, lying to himself and to his own heart. </para>

                        <para>- I shall not occupy much time in dealing with the matter, as the Government, I understand, wish to get the Bill out of Committee to-day. To begin with, I think there ought to be a definition of the word " Asiatics." We all profess, more or less, to belong to the Christian faith, and we cannot forget that our Lord was an Asiatic. Nowadays, the word "Asiatic" has a very wide signification, and I consider it very unwise to use the word in this clause. I may mention that. in many of the Pacific islands there have been Protestant missionaries for the last fifty or sixty years, and many of them have children. I know one missionary whose son is. a native of the New Hebrides, and would call himself a New Hebridian. I know another missionary who was in Samoa, and who has daughters as well as sons. I propose that we should not exempt from the benefits. of this Bill those who are of European descent. The word "Asiatic " is altogether too wide. For argument's sake, many Europeans have had children born to them in India, and those children are Asiatics, although their parents were born in Europe. The Vice-President of the Executive Council knows my views on this matter very well. If the Government are not prepared to accept even a verbal amendment, it will be useless to debate the question at any length. lt will make clear what I propose to do if I say that, as I wish to amend it, the clause would read - </para>

                    <para>-551-- It is a somewhat difficult matter to decide what is the right thing to do in this case. It would have been much better, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> has said, if we had some definition of the word " Asiatic." Surely it does not cover any one born in Asia of European parents? It should mean people of the Asiatic races. The clause seems harsh, because there are in Australia many persons of Asiatic birth who have been respectable citizens of the Commonwealth for the last twenty or thirty years, and their, children would be debarred from obtaining the allowance under this clause. It would be too sweeping to negative the clause, but it carries racial antagonism rather too far. It seems to me that it would do an injustice to a great many very worthy people whom we have accepted as fellow subjects of the British Empire. I should like to hear the effect of the clause fully explained. </para>

I wish to know from the Vice-President of the Executive Council whether what I said on the second reading of the Bill in regard to the birth of half-caste children is correct? No Asiatic woman is to receive a maternity allowance. If she be married to a white man, and gives birth to a half-caste child, she will not be given the allowance. But a white woman, the wife of a black man, giving birth to a child would receive it. Is that the intention of the Bill? </para>

                        <para>- I do not propose to move an amendment. I oppose the Bill straight out, and am not going to do anything to improve it, but I do want the public to know that an Asiatic woman married to a European will not get an allowance in respect of her child, while a white woman married to an Asiatic man will get an allowance in respect of her child. I ask whether that is fair dealing? If the Minister chooses to say that it is not, and that they cannot help it, well and good. </para>

                    <para>. - When I was in Bundaberg some years ago, at the time of a Show, I noticed three very pleasant-looking young girls. Somebody said to me, " Do you know what those girls are?" I said, "I suppose that they come from the south of Europe." " No," he said, " they are Australian quadroons. Their mother was a half-caste, and their father a German." They were just as nice-looking young persons as one would wish to see anywhere. </para>

                        <para>- No, I shall say what I choose, subject to the Standing Orders. Honorable senators on the other side have misused their power by misrepresentations of the grossest character, and that is a reason why we should analyze every line of the Bill. There is a difference between " Asia " used as a geographical term and "Asiatic used as a personal term, either directly or indirectly, in connexion with the word " Asia." Not everybody who is bom in Asia is an Asiatic, and <inline font-style="italic">vice versa.</inline> What, then, is the meaning of the word " Asiatic " ? From the explanation I have just given, everybody can understand the force of my remark, and I hope that the Committee will not allow the Bill to go through until we know exactly what this term means. If it means a person horn in Asia for the' purposes of this Bill, why will not the Minister say so, and, if it does not mean that, what on earth does it mean ? </para>

                        <para>- We do not want to know what it does not mean, because that does not help us. We want to know what it does mean. We ought not to allow the Bill to go through on the assumption that it does not mean this or that or anything else. We should only allow a Bill to pass from the Chamber when we thoroughly understand what the terms used in it do mean. " Asiatic " is a term which is capable of many interpretations. When we ask the Minister what does " Asiatic " mean, what do we get from him? </para>
