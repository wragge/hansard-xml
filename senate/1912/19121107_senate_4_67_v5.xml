                    <para>- When a matter was being debated yesterday, on a motion  by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens,</inline> he stated that&#39; he was quoting from an uncorrected <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> proof, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> challenged the correctness of the statement that he was reading,  Baying  that it did not correspond with the statement in his own proof. I may mention that I was not supplied with my <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> proofs until very late, and that I corrected them. Subsequently, on sending for the proofs to verify a statement which had been made, the one I had corrected was returned to me with my correction written on a slip, and I handed the proof, while the debate was in progress, to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens.</inline> He naturally thought that it was the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> reporter&#39;s proof, and quoted it as uncorrected. The correction I had made  was the insertion of the words &#34; distrust of the magistracy.&#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> said that the words should be, &#34; I said it had been amply justified,&#34; while the words which had been inserted made the remark read, &#34; I said distrust of the magistracy had been amply justified.&#34;I wish to say that in -making the correction I put in words which obviously were left out of the report. I did not in any way attempt to cook or fake the report, but simply put in words to convey the meaning which I intended to convey in the statement originally made. </para>

                    <para>The regulations- dealing, with the granting of sick lea.ve. to the permanent forces are practically the. same as those, which obtain in the Commonwealth Public Service - that is, a man with! less, than, five years&#39; service may, under ordinary circumstances, be granted, sick leave for one month on full pay, three months, on half pay, and six months on third pay. </para>
                    <para>Staff Sergeant-Major. Leech reported sick on 4th October, 191 1. He- was granted&#39; leave for one month on full&#39; pay from that date. As he was. not fit to resume duty on the expiration of that leave, he was granted an extension of leave until the 30th&#39; November on half pay. </para>
                    <para>Nothing further was heard of the case at Head -quarters until the following, February, when proceedings, of a. Medical- Board were received. This Medical Board- reported that Staff Sergeant-Major Leech was suffering from malaria. and was medical-lv. unfit, for further service. in the permanent forces.. </para>
                    <para>The proceedings were not in. order,, and the Director-General, of Medical Services returned the papers to the Medical Board for further particulars. </para>
                    <para>The papers, were not again received, at Headquarters until the 26th&#39; April-; but, as there was a divergence of opinion between the medical officer attending the man, and the Medical Bonird&#34;, it was again necessary to return, the proceedings to Western Australia. </para>
                    <para>Consequent1 on this the Medical Board again examined Staff Sergeant-Major Leech, and now found his condition had&#39; greatly improved, and that he was then fit for further service; but, as the ma&#39;arial condition was liable to recur; recommended that he be transferred to another district. </para>
                    <para>The retention of Staff Sergeant-Major Leech in- the service was approved, and he resumed duty on the- 27th June, and was transferred&#39; at the expense of the Department to Tasmania. </para>

A considerable number of well-qualified applicants, have submitted their names, and a selection will shortly be made. The duties connected with the position will not be limited to the comparatively small task of inspecting the existing schools, but will consist mainly in conducting classes in higher branches of study than those usually taught in State schools, the object being to give opportunities fur a good secondary education to the children in that remote part of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>. - I called &#34; Not formal &#34; to this motion, because I have always been under the impression that there is no standing order which necessitates an honorable senator to apply for leave of absence for a less period than two months. I should like to have it settled, whether it is necessary for an honorable senator, if he should find private business detaining him, to request leave of absence for a week. If that is not necessary, it is just as well for us to know. It looks to me as if it is a kind of cheap political advertisement for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Shannon</inline> to make an application of this kind when other honorable senators, on both sides of the chamber, have stayed away without making such a request. I protest against the Senate being made a kind of political advertising arena. </para>

I do not know the reason for the course which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Shannon</inline> is taking. All. that I can say is that it is quite unusual. Yesterday we found that we had been pursuing a course which was quite contrary to the Standing Orders, and, if, in the matter of leave of absence, we have been doing wrong, it is only right and proper that the Senate should know, so that the proper course may be taken in the future. </para>

                        <para>. - I wish only to state that the moving, of- the motion is- merely an. act of courtesy on my part. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Shannon,</inline> came to me, and. said that, prior to his election to the Senate, he had. an engagement on the west coast of South Australia, which, he felt bound to carry out, and he asked me if I would move for a. week&#39;sleave of absence for him. I told him that that was not necessary, and that he could remain absent for that period from the Senate- without obtaining- leave. He said&#39; that he preferred to make application for leave, and I said that if he desired it I would&#39; make the application for him. That is the whole history of the motion-. It is submitted merely as an act- of courtesy, and&#39; I am surprised that when an honorable senator desires to secure leave of absence in this- way any one should object, especially when it- does not injure any one else, or prevent any other hon&#62;orable senator from- asking- for a week&#39;s leave of absence or declining to- do so. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Shannon-</inline> felt that he- would prefer to&#39; have his&#62; absence accounted: for in this- way, I&#39; did not see that it was- my place-, or the place- of any. one else, to stand in his way. The request was courteously made to- nae, and,, as. a matter of courtesy,  1  have- complied with it, and have nothing further to say about it. </para>

                            <para>- I refer to the ordinary Workmen&#39;s Compensation Act. Later on I may explain the difference between this Bill and the Act passed- by the Imperial Parliament. From the inauguration of the Commonwealth up to. the present time nothing has been done to&#62;make provision for employés of the Common wealth- who may have met with accidents in the course of their employment. From time to time appeals have been made when accidents such as those contemplated in- this Bill have occurred, and Bills have been introduced and. passed to&#62; provide for those extraordinary cases.. No uniform, or definite legislation dealing with, the matter has, however, been considered up to the present time. I am sure, that every honorable senator and every citizen of the Common- , wealth desires that when those who are employed in the Commonwealth service meet with accidents they, and their dependents* should be provided for in some manner.. We are all agreed that that is right and1 proper. The Government have introduced this Bill in order to make that provision. There is- a difference of opinion amongst citizens of the Commonwealth and members of Parliament as to what has been done in the different States in providing for workmen&#39;s compensation. The representatives of different States have claimed that the particular State they represent must have the credit of having been the first to make provision for workmen&#39;s compensation.I say that South Australia was the first State in the Commonwealth to introduce and carry a Workmen&#39;s Compensation Bill. </para>

                            <para>- I &#39;say it because I come from South Australia, and I was in the South Australian Parliament when the Bill was carried. I should, therefore, know something about it. The next measure of the kind was carried in 1902 by Western Australia. Then, in 1905 and 1910, Queensland, New South Wales, and Tasmania passed legislation of this description. So far as Victoria is concerned, no Bill dealing with workmen&#39;s compensation has yet been carried in that State. Such a Bill has been introduced on various occasions in the Victorian Parliament, but there has never been a Labour Government in Victoria, and, consequently, it has not been possible to carry beneficent legislation of this kind in that State. In the other States, through the action of Labour Governments or the influence of the Labour party, or at the instance of a truly Liberal Administration, and not such a Liberal party as we have in the Commonwealth under Fusion conditions, measures of this kind have been passed. In the circumstances, we may hail with some gratification the action of this Labour Government in introducing this legislation. The Bill is submitted in the usual form. There are a number of clauses covering the short title, the date of commencement by proclamation, and definitions of the different phrases used in the Bill. Honorable senators will see that the definition clauses go so far as to include even a mother-in-law. It is proposed to include an adopted child and a mother-in-law as amongst the persons who may be considered to be dependants, and entitled to be recipients of the proposed compensation. </para>

That is a matter that can be seriously discussed in Committee. Every provision is made, not only for the protection of an individual who meets with an accident, but also for the security of the Commonwealth, that is to be responsible for the proposed payments. Examinations by duly qualified medical men are provided for. To the eleven clauses of the Bill there are added two schedules providing for rates of payment and the manner of application. I am satisfied that no honorable senator who seriously studies the measure will be able <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> discover any very great objection to it. If suggestions of a beneficial character are offered, the Government, as on all other occasions, will be prepared to listen to them, and to adopt the course most in the interests of the worker and of the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>. - When this Bill, was before the Senate we carried an amendment to provide that the number of copies of a copyrighted work that had previously been supplied to State Parliaments should still be supplied to them by the owners of the copyright. The House of Representatives has further amended the clause by inserting a provision that State Parliaments shall continue to have the unlimited power to legislate with respect to the delivery of these copies. I think there will be no danger in accepting the amendment. We believe that we should, to as small an extent as possible, interfere with State rights, and if the State Parliaments desire to legislate in this matter as they have done in the past, we think there is no objection to their doing so.

Does it come within the scope of this Bill, or does it relate to the particular powers possessed by State Parliaments enabling them to require certain books or publications printed within their jurisdiction to be supplied? I should like to know whether the amendment comes within the dominion of copyright at all, or whether it is an attempt to give to the State Parliaments a power which they undoubtedly enjoy, irrespective of our legislation on the subject of copyright. </para>

                    <para>. -I endeavoured to explain the matter as clearly as possible in my first statement. I indicated that we made an amendment upon the Bill as introduced into the Senate, providing that no alteration should be made in the number of copies required to be supplied to a State Legislature. This amendment of the House of Representatives simply means that, so far as a copyright connected with a particular State is concerned, the Legislature of that State will not be prevented from legislating with respect to the supply of copies of copyrighted matter to the State Parliament or a State institution. If we have the power, under  a  Copyright Bill, to provide that copies shall be supplied to the Commonwealth Parliament, or to any other public body, then,  I  say, we have the right to make provision that a State Legislature may retain the power with respect to copyrighted matter published in the State to require copies to be supplied to the State Parliament or public bodies within the State. That is a limitation of the Bill which  1  think every honorable senator ought to understand. </para>

The evidence taken by the Royal Commission at Newcastle showed that both men and captains of ships are parties to abuses which amount to frauds on shipowners. There are persons who enter into agreements with dishonest captains under which men, having a considerable sum of money due to them in wages, are induced to desert, whereupon the crimp and the captain divide the wages between them. Unless we have something to prevent that sort of thing, we shall have men continually refusing to proceed to sea. </para>

                    <para>- &#91;3- <inline font-style="italic">2 5 j-</inline> - Some honorable senators do not seem to realize what is meant by the amendment. We have already dealt effectually with crimping by stopping advance notes. A person giving an advance note is, under this measure, liable to a penalty of ^50. The crimp is not going to use his influence over men unless there is money in it ; and the only possible way in which he can get money is by obtaining the advance note of a seaman before he goes to sea. </para>

                        <para>- No, in forfeited wages. A ship came into Newcastle with a crew on board. A crimp went on board that ship, and gave the seamen all sorts of inducements to desert. They forfeited their wages on leaving. But the crimp did not get them. The forfeited wages should have gone into the Treasury. </para>

                        <para>- Probably the master retained them. Under the law they ought to have been deposited with the superintendent of the mercantile marine. The crimp simply wanted to get the men out of the ship for the purpose of shipping them on another vessel, where he would get advance &#39; notes for them. By this Bill we have made it absolutely illegal for any owner or master to issue an advance note, or to pay the men money before it is earned. Consequently the crimp&#39;s occupation is entirely gone. He no longer has a leg to stand on. </para>

                        <para>- We have no control over such men. We have already dealt with desertion, making the penalty for that offence the forfeiture of all accrued wages, not exceeding <inline font-style="italic">&#163;20,</inline> or a fine not exceeding the same amount. It is now proposed by the House of Representatives to make it an offence to fail or refuse without reasonable cause to join a ship or to proceed to sea iri her. I have no objection to the insertion of the words, because I think that they ought to go in. </para>

I do. not think that the. arguments, relating to, camping apply to. this clause, in view of other provisions, in, the&#39; Bill., I have stated all along that my principal objection to these heavy penalties* is that they amount, to the infliction of a. practical injustice- of a very severe, character, because of the unsympathetic disposition of the magistracy. The sailor does not get a square deal., O.ur. newspapers fairly teem with instances, of the most, unjust decisions against seamen.. They are unjust in the eyes of the whole public, and are frequently denounced by. the press as unjust, but with, the consoling remark that it cannot be helped,, as it is the law. A seaman,, who is not. a registered: voter in. Australia, has not. a political pull. He cannot get a. direct hearing in a Parlia.ment, and consequently no one takes very much, notice of the injustice he suffers, i&#39; have been looked upon, by honorable senators opposite as. a singular character be cause I. have criticised adversely the raagisrtrates. who inflict these fines., I speak advisedly, because I have experienced their harshness and unsympathetic character, not only in dealings I have had with them,, but also in. taking up the cases of other- persons. I have found that the grossest injustice has often been inflicted. That is owing to the environment from which the average magistrate cannot get away. . </para>

                        <para>- No. I think it is in order to discuss, on this clause, the difficulty of keeping agreements in all cases when they are not entered into by both parties from an equal stand-point. We continually hear from our honorable friends opposite and their press as to the sacredness of contract, and the blessings of freedom of contract, but they ignore the fact that there is no free contract unless both parties stand on an equal footing ; unless they are equally free from economic circumstances to complete the contract, or not to make it. I have a very lenient feeling towards a man who enters into a contract only under the force of circumstances. While believing that all contracts or promises, whether verbal or written, should be kept, as far as practicable, we should not apply hard and fast penalties to those who, from force of circumstances break a contract by refusing to join their ship. This penal legislation is a relic of the Dark Ages, and is altogether out of place in the Commonwealth. I feel that I have a good case. We know that the abolition of imprisonment for debt was practically a farce, because the magistrates imprisoned a person for contempt of Court when he did not obey an order to pay a. debt. No imprisonment is provided in this clause for a man refusing to join his ship, but he will be imprisoned for not being able to pay the fine inflicted, and imprisonment bears some relation to the pecuniary penalty. I have seen savage sentences inflicted by the magistrates time after time; and, therefore, I intend to raise my voice against them on every opportunity, and, if necessary, so far as my voice will go, to hold up the Bill. My voice will never go for a penalty of more than a couple of pounds. </para>

                    <para>. - I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> has forgotten that the penalty is to be imposed only when a man does not join his ship without reasonable cause. If a man were ill, or a death had taken place in his family, that would undoubtedly be considered a reasonable cause. Suppose that at the last minute, and without reasonable cause, not one man, but the whole lot, declined to complete the agreement. That would entail great loss upon the shipowner. Surely <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> may assume that every magistrate will give every consideration to a reasonable cause. </para>

                    <para>.- I wish to point out to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> that it is somewhat late in the day to start on this poor, unfortunate amendment, a general tilt against the magistracy. It seems to me that he is several months too late. He ought to have started on the first measure imposing a penalty that came before the Senate. Why should he pick out this particular amendment, when we have been passing measures day after day providing for penalties which may be imposed, which he has accepted without a murmur? 1 think 1 can satisfy him that this amendment is necessary in the interests of the seamen. We want to discourage seamen from, after signing an agreement, refusing to proceed to sea without reasonable cause. That is the point. </para>

                        <para>- These matters will rest not only with magistrates. The honorable senator has entirely disregarded all that I said last week on this subject. If&#34; there is a complaint of bad food, the seaman has his remedy, and the magistrate will not decide that question. If there is  a  complaint that a ship is unseaworthy, a remedy is provided for the seaman, and the matter is not referred to a magistrate. It is decided, just as the other matter is decided, by the Minister and his experts. If a seaman has a reasonable cause for refusing to go to sea it is not left to the magistrate, that the honorable senator talks about, to decide the matter. If he can prove either of the complaints to which I have referred, he will have a reasonable cause for his refusal to go to sea, and no magistrate will be able to impose a penalty upon him. </para>

                        <para>- Nothing of the kind. The honorable senator has evidently made up his mind that no matter what may be said he will not change his opinion. It is therefore useless to appeal to his reason any further, and the remainder of my remarks will be made without any special reference to him. Any one who reads the report of the Royal Commission, which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> signed, will come to the conclusion that one of the chief factors in making the practice of crimping payable, was desertion by seamen. By desertion, seamen played into the hands of the crimp. In this Bill, following the recommendations of the Royal Commission, we have recognised that seamen have suffered from a number of disabilities that, as has been said, life on board a ship was made such a hell to the men that they were induced to desert and abandon their wages. We have, in accordance with the recommendations of the Commission, inserted provisions in this Bill to protect seamen in this regard, and to give them facilities for bringing such disabilities before the proper authorities, in order that they may be remedied. </para>

                <para>As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> pointed out on Friday last, what we want the seamen to do is not to protest by deserting, but to take advantage of the provisions of this Bill, and to have their disabilities remedied in a legal way. We want to discourage seamen from deserting.  It is the last thing we want them to do, if we are to have good conditions prevailing in our ships, because, if they desert, the authorities will never hear of their desertion, and therefore will never be given an opportunity to rectify abuses. </para>

If he has a reasonable cause for refusing to join his ship, a proper course of action is provided for him&#39; in this Bill. If that he not so, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> must share the responsibility of the omission, because we have adopted the recommendations of the Royal Commission which he signed. We are giving those recommendations the force of law in this Bill. We desire that seamen shall have recourse to the usual means to secure their rights, and not, by deserting, continue to make others subject to the conditions which were the grounds for their desertion. </para>

                    tells : as that the oooupaiio&#187; of the crimp will be gone under this Bill, and, so far as regular engagements &#39;entered into &#39;with crimps for the supply -of seamen are concerned, it will be gone. But if we do not provide a penalty for the breaking of an agreement, ; as proposed in this clause, one loop-no&#39;le wfll&#39;l be left for the operations of the crimp. Where engagements have been entered into, . and the crew have been supplied, -and just on the point of sailing men refuse to go &#39;to sea, the crimp will be . at hand and will say to the master-, &#34; I -have men . ready, and I can supply* you with half-a-dozen.&#34; There will then be no engagement before a superintendent ; the ship will leave, probably never to return to Australia ; men will be put on by the crimp, who will get&#39; his fee ; and the men will go away. The opportunity for the crimp will be created by the refusal of men to go to sea, and, be it remembered,  by the refusal of men who have been properly sig.ned-on before a superintendent, of men who, but for the protection of this measure, would have suffered from the crimp. By doing away with any penalty for the breaking of their engagements by seamen, an opportunity will be afforded the crimp : to re-introduce the practice of crimping ; and, therefore, I say that this provision is most necessary in the interests of the seamen themselves.

If I were administering the measure, it would be of no use for me to inspect a ship to decide whether she was unseaworthy, though I mighty be able to pass an opinion as to the quality of the food supplied. Let me remind&#39; honorable senators that we do not propose to impose penalties only on one side. In clause 87 we provide that if a master engages 2 seaman, and then, refuses to take him to sea, which is the converse of the position we are now discussing, the seaman is entitled to not less than one month&#39;s wages as compensation. </para>

                        <para>- In the case of ships engaged in the coasting trade it is practically an equality of penalty. The honorable senator loses sight of the fact that the penalty of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;10</inline> proposed is the maximum, and the penalty imposed may be half-a-crown. I do not propose to take up further time in dealing with the matter. Statements have been made which indicate that some honorable senators think that this proposal is made in the interests of ship-owners, but, as far as I am concerned, it is submitted, not in the interests of ship-owners, but in the interests of the seamen themselves. </para>

                        <para>- I quite expected that, interjection. The honorable senator has been flogging his own joss so long that I cannot complain if I get. a little, flogging also. It is evident from the Bill, and from the explanation of the Minister, that very large powers are necessarily intrusted to the Minister who will have the administration of this measure.T <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae&#39;s</inline> objection, if I understand3 it, is, first of all, to the penalty; and in that matter, probably for good reasons, the Minister of Defence has met the honorable senator half-way. However, he is not yet satisfied, because in some cases a Bench of magistrates may have to deal with the matter, and may impose the maximum penalty ; and as the majority of magistrates are, in his opinion, possessed of the evil spirit of class bias, such a power should not be placed in their hands. The argument is a weapon of instantaneous self-destruction, which the honorable senator has manufactured for himself. I have no doubt that, from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae&#39;s</inline> point of view, the member of the present Government who will have the. administration of this measure worthily represents a certain class in the community. He may be assumed to have a certain, bias in a direction strongly favored by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae.</inline> It is, however, quite an imaginable proposition; and some of us hope that <inline font-style="italic">it</inline> will be early realized  that there will be a Minister administering the measure who, from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae&#39;s</inline> point of view, will represent what he would call the entirely opposite class. What will happen then? According to the honorable senator&#39;s argument, it would appear that he desires that the Bill should be left open to the very abuse - adopting his point of view - to which he so strongly objects. I have said that the honorable senator&#39;s argument is self -destructive ; and, in his dealing with the matter, I have been reminded of the pig crossing the stream - that if it gets over, only does so with its throat cut. </para>

                    <para>. - I can sympathize to some extent with what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae.</inline> has said, because I believe he has had a rather exceptional experience of magisterial justice. For the sake of the profession, I may say that I can cite instances of magistrates who have been possessed of sufficient backbone to refuse to administer an Act in the way desired by the responsible Minister. i can recall instances in Western Australia where magistrates absolutely refused to take the direction, or accept the dictation, of Ministers who thought it advisable to strain the law in a way which would involve the severe oppression of certain people. There is, after all, nothing to choose between a magistrate who fails to justly administer a law and a Minister who desires to strain it beyond its reasonable limits for political and party purposes. I do hot see how the position could be improved unless we could always have a Labour Minister administering the Bill, and one in whom <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> would have the utmost confidence. We might, under such conditions, secure a near approach to ideal justice. But, seeing that there are imperfections on both sides - through administration and through magisterial law - there does not seem to be much choice between the two. If the magistracy as a whole fail to interpret the law fairly and justly, that is not a reflection on the law, but on the system of administration. The only remedy is either to remove the offending magistrate, or to improve the magistracy, and that can be done by the Government of the day. The Minister proposes to reduce the penalty to &#163;10. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> has referred to the proposal as being made chiefly in the interests of the ship-owners. But it is quite conceivable that a case will arise where seamen . may find it to their advantage to refuse to join a ship, and where it might suit them to pay a purely nominal fine. Suppose that a ship is just ready to go to sea, having her full number of passengers on board, and her complement of crew, with the exception of one or two; suppose that a few of the men, after signing on, take it into their heads to refuse to join. In the case of a steam-ship, that would mean that those who were left would have thrown upon their shoulders an extra strain. </para>

                        <para>- I am speaking as one who has had practical experience of life at sea, not merely for a- few, but for a number, of years. I know that men who work on steam-ships are called upon to work up to their full bodily strength. If some of the men fall sick, it simply means that extra strain is put upon the others who do the work. I have seen, not once, but hundreds of times, men come up from the stokehold, with all appetite gone, and not voice enough to ask for a drink- of water. Men who leave a ship, therefore, do an injustice to their fellow men. I remember occasions when we were obliged to work six-hour shifts, because some of our men fell sick. I heard a bit of growling about it at times. A man who refuses to join a ship without reasonable cause acts a selfish part. </para>

                        <para>- No one would do that ; but I am pointing out that, as work is carried out on board a ship, each watch is working against another, and each man has to do his share of the work. If there are sick men on board, extra strain is thrown on those who do the work. If we leave the field clear for any person to leave a ship at the last moment, so as to compel her to go to sea short-handed, we inflict hardship on those who have to work the ship under such conditions. I have known men to leave ships simply because they thought they could not work with the men. who were on board. </para>

                        <para>- It will be seen, from, what I have stated, that a man who leaves a ship at a critical moment acts a selfish part, and imposes a penalty upon his fellow workmen. Before a seaman joins a ship in any capacity, an agreement is entered into between him and the ship-owner. That agreement is in the nature of a security for the men themselves. If, after an agreement is signed, half-a-dozen men take it into their heads to desert, for the simple reason that they believe the ship to be unsea worthy, there are ample provisions in this measure for ascertaining whether or not their belief is well founded. Expert evidence will be taken, and if it is found that the ship is unseaworthy, not only will the men not be fined, but the ship will be detained. That is a fair adjustment, and works on lines which, as I have already pointed out, have been approved by the Seamen&#39;s Union in the past. </para>

                    <para>.- One point of view has been missed throughout the argument on this clause. A steamer, which is ready to go to sea, may have fifty or a hundred passengers on board. Are not their interests to be taken into consideration ? Are they to be put to expense and inconvenience because a few firemen or seamen may refuse to join the ship? The Minister has distinctly explained that a seaman may refuse to go to sea, if he has a reasonable and just cause.  But if he has not, he ought to be punished. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> has referred to the action of magistrates. I do not know why he has had such an experience of them. My experience, which extends over a good many years, is different from his. I remember that at one time I was in the town of Bathurst, where I knew no one, and was in rather a difficulty about money. I went to the police magistrate, and explained my circumstances; he assisted me with the greatest courtesy, and saw that I got fair play. Surely, because some bench of magistrates has had to deal with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae,</inline> and dealt with him in a manner that he believes to be unjust, we ought not to condemn them all. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator spoke of what had personally affected him, but I do not think that all magistrates are as bad as he tried to make out. I am satisfied that if a seaman offered a reasonable excuse for refusing to go to sea, a magistrate would not fine him. I knew of a case where men refused to go to sea, and the captain* was compelled to take twelve or fourteen scratch men on board as firemen. The result was that when the ship got into the English Channel, the men were found to be unfit for their work. There was nearly a mutiny amongst the firemen because all the work had to be done by the good men. </para>

                    <para>. - I did intend to vote with the Government on this matter, but, after listening to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> and the honorable senator who has just resumed his seat, I have decided to vote on the other side. It appears to me that the only reason for  imposing this penalty on men is the inconvenience which would be caused by seamen refusing to join a ship. If we are going to impose penalties on men who are not able to go to work simply because of the inconvenience to others, where is the practice going to end ? Would the penalty be imposed on men who strike without what is considered to be a legitimate excuse ? </para>

                        <para>- When I was in Great Britain, a large number of vessels were unable to proceed to sea because of a strike in the shipping trade. Could each of the men who struck have been fined &#163;10 under this measure if it had been in force in Great Britain? If so, a grave injustice will be inflicted on workers. In &#39;my opinion it is far more important to the workers of this country that they should stand together in a matter of that kind than that the interests of shipping companies should be considered. I know that that remark exhibits a standard of morality which some of my colleagues would not admit, but, at all events, it is my standard ; and when it comes to be a question of doing something for the benefit of the workers for all future time, I hold that the principle that should apply is that of the greatest benefit to the greatest number. I fear that there is some danger that a provision of this kind will be brought into operation to penalize men who go on strike. It appears to me that honorable senators have been dealing with seamen as though they were beings distinct from ourselves. Let us consider their case as though their interests were ours. Is there one of us who would like to work under a provision of this kind? If I agreed to sail in a ship to-morrow, and if, after I went down to the wharf and saw her, I preferred to remain in Australia, why should I be penalized for doing so? Why should a man be compelled to leave the country against his will? Suppose a seaman has a presentiment that the ship for which he has signed on will go down, or that an accident will happen, why should we. compel him to go to his grave? </para>

The penalty is altogether unreasonable, but I should be quite prepared to vote for a moderate amount with a view of conforming to the old custom under which the employer has always been put in a different class from his employe. The penalty inflicted on the employer is always different from that inflicted on the employe. It is always inflicted on one. side. </para>

If we concede, as we do, that twenty-four hours is sufficient notice for a seaman to give, I think that the forfeiture of twenty-four hours&#39; wages should be a sufficient penalty to impose upon a seaman who refused to join his ship. </para>

                    <para>. - I have heard the Minister and Senators de Largie and Lynch quote evidence given before the Navigation Commission. With this evidence in their possession, why did they not think of providing for this penalty when the Bill, was before the Senate previously? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> has explained why the matter was forgotten. He has told us that the shipowners have represented to the Government that there must be a penalty provided for men who hold up their ships. The Government were practically induced by the ship-owners, for their own safeguard, to make this amendment in another place. I do not intend to vote for the infliction of a penalty upon seamen, because I am too familiar with the disabilities under which they work. I have seen them too often sent to sea in coffins, when they never expected to return. I have seen instances where men have refused to go to sea. Under this amendment, they will be penalized to the extent of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;10.</inline> Why did not the Government, I repeat, think of this matter when the Bill was last before the Senate? They thought it right then that there should be no pecuniary penalty provided, and I want to know why it is not right now. </para>

                        <para>- It seems that I have unintentionally&#34; &#34; black-legged &#34; on my own crowd by voting for a penalty for desertion ; but an offence committed in ignorance frees an offender from moral guilt. At any rate, we should not repeat the offence. I certainly think that, in this age of industrial unrest, if there is a justifiable cause for men refusing to go to work, it is when they know that by doing so they will lose the respect of every member of their class. I am really surprised that a Labour Government have not had the courage to put in a provision exempting seamen from the operation of these penalties, at any rate, in the case of a strike, even though they might  stick,  in their own stubborn way, to the penalties in other respects. <inline font-weight="bold">-Senator Lynch</inline> has made -a long speech, in which he tried to give -weight to his arguments by quoting his personal experience, and wished to pit that against mine., as it were. I was not putting forward my personal experience of seafaring life, but I was pitting my opinion of magistrates against those who are prepared to trust them to an unlimited extent, as is done in this measure. I am not complaining of my personal experience of magistrates, because, in the long run, I have beaten them out of sight. I have no personal grievance. I have not been before a magistrate for twenty years, -and I am now a member of that privileged class. I contend that if such a state of affairs as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> depicted arose, that a body of men would render themselves liable to very severe work if they went to sea shorthanded, they would have a reasonable cause, which could not be disputed, &#163;6 refuse to go on board. Certainly no case could be made out against men who refused to proceed with their duty in the event of the ship being so short-handed that it would throw upon them duties beyond their physical strength to carry through. We know that this provision applies to the case of a man who, at the initiation of a voyage, refuses to join a ship. </para>

                        <para>- Not necessarily without giving his employer any reason, but for doing it without reasonable cause, in the opinion of the magistrate. The argument has been put forward that there are good magistrates. I haw never denied that. I admit that some magistrates may be the most admirable nien in the world. I was only talking of the average magistrate; and my experience of him goes a long way further than .any cases in which I have been personally involved. I have been thinking more particularly of paid magistrates. Innumerable instances have been reported in the daily press where the penalties meted out to seamen have been far and away &#39;beyond all reason as compared with the penalties inflicted for similar offences committed by ordinary landsmen. The sailor has proverbially been badly treated in the Courts, and I put it down to the fact that he has no political friends. Now, if this Bill makes <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> position an ideal one, is it likely that there will be a very large number of seamen availing themselves of the opportunity to leave their ship without a reasonable cause? If such cases are very frequent, it will be an impeachment of the measure, and it will show that the conditions surrounding seafaring life are still so bad that the temptation not to fulfil an agreement is paramount in many instances. If the Bill succeeds in bringing about ideal conditions, there will be no great difficulty arising from men coming under the conditions of this clause. The object of the measure is to make the conditions of the seaman so good that he will be just as ready to go to sea as men are ready to take employment on land. </para>

                        <para>- In that case, there would be a poor chance of sheeting home an offence. The maximum penalty imposed on the ship-owner for refusing to complete his agreement is, by the admission of the Minister, not so much in any case as is the reduced maximum which he proposes in this amendment to inflict on the seaman. Where is the fairness of a proposal introduced by a Labour Government, and amended very largely at the dictation of the ship-owners&#39; interest in another House, and made the worse by those amendments ? </para>

Undue consideration has been given to their representations, and, as a result, the Bill has come back a lot worse than it was before it left here. If I have defaulted in my duty in some particulars through not paying close attention to the clauses, I shall make up for my default in those cases where I do pay attention. I shall fight against this penalty to the extent of dividing the Committee, because I believe that a maximum fine of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2</inline> would be more practicable and more effective. </para>

Each one of us knows that the whole difficulty between shipowners and their men has been due to the inhuman treatment by shipping companies of their employes. In making this statement, I have splendid testimony, not only from the records of the mercantile marine of Great Britain, but in the report of the Navigation Commission. What do they say about it? - </para>

                <para class="block">I say advisedly that, in that one sentence, we have the whole gist of the trouble between ship-owners and their men. We know perfectly well that, in ordinary times - and unfortunately times are nearly always ordinary, and sometimes very ordinary - when a man wants a job, he finds he has to compete with perhaps dozens of others. At the present moment labour is probably more fully employed in Australia than it has ever before been in the history of the country. That may be owing to the presence of several Labour Governments in the Commonwealth. That may be a mere coincidence, but the fact remains that at present seamen, like other workers, have little difficulty in finding employment. But in the ordinary course of events a seaman has just as much trouble in getting a job as has an ordinary landsman, and the shipping companies have not been slow to take advantage of his position. The result has been that sailors throughout the world have become a sort of industrial outlaws. They have been subjected to treatment which landsmen would not tolerate for a single moment, and which no Legislature would permit to be dealt out to landsmen. I do not know why that has been the case. Some one has said that it has been because the seaman has had no political friends. There may be something in that, but I trust that the seaman has some political friends in this Parliament. I know that he has many friends in the Commonwealth, and that the great mass of the people of Australia are as anxious that the seaman should get fair play as that a landsman should be treated fairly. To get to the root of desertion, failure to join a ship, . and all the other difficulties, we have to examine the treatment dealt out by shipping companies to seamen. The Navigation Commission&#39;s report refers to cases which, if they appeared in a novel, would not be credited, because they are so much outside the run of ordinary human experience. The unfortunate seaman seems to be fair game for the shipping companies, crimps, boardinghouse-keepers, and every individual who thinks that he or she can with impunity plunder him. So far as I am concerned, I shall attempt to do something which will compel ship-owners to treat their men as they ought to be treated. I say, with the authors of the Navigation Commission&#39;s report, that men do not leave their employment without cause if they are reasonably treated, well paid, and properly fed. Here is another sentence from the report which I commend to honorable senators on both sides - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>If the owner knew that unless he treated his crew properly they could leave at the first opportunity he would see that they had no just cause for complaint. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">That being the case, I do not see why we should impose any penalty upon men for refusing to join their ship. If their treatment is all that it ought to be, the wages good, and the conditions satisfactory, instead of having this great trouble with their men the shipping companies would be able to get any number of employes. I do not think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> meant to be an apologist for the shipping companies, but that was practically the attitude he took up. He told us of the hard work in the stoke-hold, and I have not the slightest doubt that it is extremely hard work. </para>

                        <para>- It was not; but we must go back to the origin of the difficulty. Where is it to be found ? It is to be found in the fact, in the first instance, that the shipping companies do not provide a sufficient number of men to man the  :stoke-hold. The number supplied is strictly limited to ;a number barely sufficient to do the work. I say the obligation ought to be thrust upon shipping companies to provide a sufficient .number of -men to  sarry  out the work of their ships. It  should  not be sufficient to say at the port of sailing that they complied with the Act. There should always be a margin provided for, because, in the case .of such work as we are now considering, there is always the liability, and, indeed, a likelihood, that some -men will fall out through sheer physical- inability to continue their work. But it appears that no provision is made by shipping companies for that contingency, and they are under no liability even to be satisfied that the men they employ are competent. All that they require to do is to provide a certain number of men to do certain work. If half of those men fail through lack of experience or physical weakness, the other half are expected to do the work. I say that the moment a man drops out the remaining men should be at liberty to at once cease work&#34;, and the responsibility for having a reserve of men to replace those who fall out should rest upon the shipping companies. I shall be told -that all this means a great deal of difficulty. Of course it does, because life on board a ship is like no other kind of life. There is all the more reason on that account why we should do everything in our power to safeguard the interests of the men who have to do the actual work on board ship. In the past it has been pointed out here time and again that the life of a seaman has &#39;been the life of a dog, a life which no man, who could find anything better to do, would think of adopting. If we are so interested in the sailing of ships and constant intercourse between nations, we should see that in the future the conditions on board ship shall be good. And then men, instead of deserting, or failing to join their ships after signing agreements, will be only too anxious to join them and do their work. We never hear of men deserting from Government employment. </para>

                        <para>- Very seldom. Men seldom desert from our railway service. Very few of our Post Office employes desert and leave their wages &#39; behind them, risking fines, imprisonment, and other difficulties and dangers. And why? It is because they are well off, fairly treated, and the conditions of their employment are good. This Parliament should compel ship-owners to provide good conditions and fair wages for their employes. </para>

                        <para>- Then the penalty in their case amounts to more than a month&#39;s wages if they fail to join their ship without reasonable cause. The words &#34;reasonable cause&#34; are all very well in an Act of Parliament, but when it comes to discovering what is the meaning of the words, we know perfectly well that the average seaman might have a dozen reasons for failing to join his ship and carry out his agreement, and he will think each one of them reasonable. The difficulty is that he will have to prove that they are reasonable before a Court. That may involve the employment of a solicitor, and the taking up of a great deal of valuable time. It will mean putting the seaman to all sorts of inconvenience, and that being the case, rather than give any reason, he will probably let things slide. He will forfeit his wages, or even incur the obligation to pay a fine rather than go to sea. If we wish to get rid of the whole of this business, we should take the broad hint given us by the Navigation Commission. The members of that Commission actually invite men to desert. They excuse therm  for deserting, and say that they are perfectly justified in deserting if they are not fairly treated. Let me read again what they say; - </para>

                    <para>To find himself, after months of incessant toil and hardship, the victim of a conspiracy between the master of the ship and the crimps to rob him of his wages is not calculated to raise his standard of morality, or to make him regard the sea as*1 a desirable calling. None but the most improvident, the most careless, the least ambitious, and the most worthless, or- the most unfortunate, tolerate these conditions for any length of time. If in all ships the treatment was as in those we have spoken of, the British seaman of a desirable class would -soon become extinct. As. it is, there is every reason to believe that the conditions described are sufficiently prevalent to constitute a menace to the most important industry of the Empire. It is most significant&#39; that desertions from this and other causes seem more prevalent from British than from foreign vessels. </para>

                        <para>- Desertions would appear to be more numerous in the case of British ships than in foreign ships. My opinion of workmen, whether on land or at sea, is that where the conditions of their employment&#39; are good, they stick. The great object of every Legislature should be to make the conditions of employment so favorable that working men, instead of taking the first opportunity to run away from their employment, will be glad to stay and do the work they are engaged to do. I would again impress upon the Committee the desirability of doing everything in our power to compel ship-owners to treat their men fairly and squarely, as human beings ought to be treated. If they did that, there would be very little cause for legislation such as we are now engaged upon. </para>

                        <para>- I did not. I have explained that it is the first subsection of section 65 of the Merchant Shipping Act of 1906. that deals with advance notes, and the punishment where they are abused. We have to consider what punishment will act as a deterrent in the case of this offence. The Government propose that a fine of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;10</inline> should be imposed. This means that if a man fails to join his ship, either with or without a reasonable cause, he may be arrested and thrown into gaol. Unless he can find bail, he has to remain there until such time as he can be brought before a magistrate. Under this Bill we are relieving the owner or master from the trouble of prosecuting the men. We say that: if there is no reasonable excuse for a man leaving a ship, the superintendent shall, bring him before the Court., </para>

                        <para>- I say that the superintendent is the proper person to deal with a matter of this kind. As a rule, superintendents of mercantile marine, who are in the habit of dealing with seamen every day, are well fitted to discharge such duties. An ordinary magistrate has not the same acquaintance with maritime law as has a marine superintendent. I appeal to those honorable senators who are continually praising British law to consider whether what is good enough for Great Britain in this respect is not good enough for the Commonwealth ? The matter with which we are now dealing was a new offence in the British Act of  1854.  It was not included in the Act of  1894.  It was again provided for in the Act of  1906,  which was based on the report of three special Committees, which dealt entirely with merchant shipping. I ask the Committee not to agree to a proposal that involves fine and imprisonment, because imprisonment must necessarily follow unless a man can find bail, which in the case of a seaman would be very difficult. A question has been raised in regard to men being taken out of ships by crimps. But, as I have said before, if the provisions of this Bill are properly carried out, there will be no crimping. The crimp in the past has only thriven by means of advance notes. </para>

I am very anxious to see this Bill put through, but I consider that it is worth while having a good fight to prevent the fine of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;10</inline> being inflicted on men for refusing to join a ship. I again say that the superintendent is the proper person to deal with such cases. He would act fairly, and he would have to report to the Minister, who in his turn would be responsible to Parliament. </para>

The proposal now made is that a seaman, who refuses to join his ship without reasonable cause, shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding  ^10.  We are all prepared to pay due deference to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie&#39;s</inline> knowledge of maritime law and seafaring matters. But I should like to ask him what the Seamen&#39;s Union themselves did in a case identical with that now under consideration? They actually sat in judgee- merit upon the case of some men who refused to join their ship, and punished them by suspension. That was done in the case of the <inline font-style="italic">Koombana,</inline> in Western Australia. </para>

I fail to see why a seaman, because he breaks an agreement, should be hauled before the Court and practically manufactured into a criminal ; or why a shipping company, if a man breaks an agreement with it, should not proceed against him, in the ordinary way, for civil damages. I believe that a breach of an agreement ought to be taken out of the category of

                        <para>- If they do not get a fair deal, it is because there is not a sufficient number of men, like myself, who are interested in their cause. If there were more men of my calibre and position, such things as took place recently would not occur. So that, instead of the Vice-President of the Executive Council throwing sneers at me, he ought to pray that, if private enterprise is to continue, it should be in the hands of people of my way of thinking, rather than in the hands of those who take an opposite view of things. To come back to the question at issue, I think that it is a proper thing to take the offences dealt with in this clause out of the sphere of semi-criminal powers, and put the shipping companies in the position that, if a seaman breaks his agreement, he shall be sued in the ordinary way, under the common law. Believing that to be the proper procedure, I intend to vote, not only against the proposal of the Government, but also against any penalty whatsoever. </para>

                        <para>- The obligation ought to be imposed upon the shipping companies to provide such a number of men known to be competent as would leave a margin for sickness, or inability, or physical weakness, to do work in the tropics. No such obligation rests upon shipping companies at present, and, unfortunately, we are doing nothing to impose any. The whole of my argument simply echoes what the Royal Commission have said, that if the shipping companies would only make the conditions on board ship what they ought to be, they would have no difficulty in getting men, and. their men would, not desert. They would be only too anxious to retain their employment if conditions were what they ought to be. The central point in connexion with this matter, upon- which we ought to keep our eyes fixed, is that of doing nothing to make the companies lax or unfair in their treatment of their men. I have come to the conclusion to vote, not only against the Government&#39;s fine of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;10,</inline> but also against <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie&#39;s</inline> proposal to deprive a man of his discharge. </para>

                        <para>- I shall vote to strike them out if I get an opportunity. (The more we discuss this matter the more light we get. It cannot be stated too often that all the trouble which ship-owners have with their men springs from the fact that they do not treat them fairly. In the old days, sugar-growers, when they had kanakas, could not get white men to work for them. Why? Because they treated white men as they treated kanakas. The ship-owners are in the same position &#39;to-day as the sugar-growers were in then ? I am not referring to Australian shipping companies, because; fortunately; public opinion is against, that sort of treatment on our coast. It is notorious that British shipping companies look upon their seamen, as the- scum of the earth, and treat them as they think such individuals ought to be treated ; and, in addition,, they place them very often in competition with cheap coloured seamen. The whole conduct of the British mercantile&#39; marine is- a disgrace to the Empire. It is a long record of brutal extortion and sweating, and we in the Commonwealth ought not to countenance that sort of thing, even in the slightest degree. I appeal to the Committee to take a common-sense view of this question, and remove this offence from the criminal or semi-criminal sphere; and deal with seamen just as we would do with- an ordinary landsman who fails to implement an agreement he has made. </para>

                        <para>- Of course, the conditions are not the same, and that is why I insist upon seamen getting good pay, adequate accommodation, and health-sustaining food. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> seems to think that a seaman would get fair play between the superintendent, and the Government. I ask him to think for a moment of what might happen under a* Conservative Government, over which the shipping companies would have a great pulL Some member or members of the Government might have an interest in one or other of- the shipping corporations,, or a number of members of Parliament might be interested in the industry. Just imagine what chance of fair treatment a seaman, would have under such conditions. Would the Minister be at all likely to immediately give a discharge to a man who had put a shipping company to some inconvenience, or would he not be more likely to hold it up probably for as long a period as the Seamen&#39;s Union did to one man recently ? I think that the period for which he was suspended was six months. </para>

                        <para>- No; and that is the point I wish to emphasize. I should* like to hear&#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> again in connexion with this discharge business. With&#39; a Conservative Government it might mean that a man would be permanently deprived: of the kind of work to which he had beer* accustomed, and I am not prepared to expose a man to a danger of that kind. Of course, I realize that, with a Labour Government in power, a man would get a fair show. The Navigation Commission hinted that it would be a very good thing if the. penalty for desertion were completely abolished, and I believe that it was right.. I consider that, if men were free to leave at any moment, the shipping companies would take very good care that they had&#39; every inducement to remain. As. it is,- the shipping companies can immediately invoke the law, with all its pains and penalties, im conveniences and injustices, against the seaman. For that reason the ship-owner takes very little or no care to see that the seaman is treated -as a human being ought to be treated. I should like to support the amendment &#39;of . <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie,</inline> because he has a much more accurate . knowledge of the whole subject than I have. I know that he also speaks in a very great measure for the seamen, and probably what he advocates is something which they would be prepared to approve of. </para>

                    <para>. - There has been a very considerable amount of time wasted on this clause, and, to my mind, in an irrelevant discussion. I believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> is earnestly endeavouring to do the best he possibly can for the&#39; seaman. I do not doubt that Senators Guthrie and Rae are trying to do exactly the same thing. We ought to look at a question of this kind from a broad view-point. We ought not to look at it altogether from the point of view of the seaman. </para>

                        <para>- Navigation is a matter of great interest to the wholecommunity. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> has given us a very long oration on the hardships, and everything else, which have been endured by seamen, but this is a Bill -for the purpose of relieving seamen from hardships. He has stated that the Navigation Commission pointed out that if seamen were treated well in respect of food, working hours, accommodation, and everything else, they would be more contented. The purpose of this Bill is to give better conditions in connexion with food, accommodation, and space. </para>

It applies, not to men who have been in service on a ship continuously, or for any period, but to men who have . engaged to go on board a ship, and carry out their duties on a certain voyage. It applies to men who have joined a ship, and entered into an agreement to work there for the future. </para>

                            is under a misapprehension. This clause is not intended for men who have had the experience of bad food on a vessel, or for men who have been overworked, or for men who have had insufficient accommodation, but for men who have joined a ship under the conditions set down in the Bill. I want him to bear that in mind. It is not even for men who under the conditions which will be established by this Bill have sailed in a ship, but for men who have agreed to join a ship at a certain port, and at the last minute, when she is about to sail, step ashore for some fancied or other reason, which they should have discovered before they engaged. They should make inquiries before they sign articles to go on board a ship.

                        <para>- How are the authorities to know that men have deserted&#39; the ship ? Does the honorable senator know anything at all about a ship? A ship is not like a market garden. You cannot see all over it at once. You can tell if fruit? pickers are continuing their work or have left it, but we are dealing with a ship, and not a garden, and a ship is a very different thing. &#39; Seamen could go ashore without being noticed. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> knows that very well, and he knows also that a ship might go to sea before the desertion of men was discovered. We will say that the Inter- State vessel to which I have referred! goes to sea short of three or four hands,, and, when she gets into the Australian! Bight, a storm arises, and it requires a fulh complement of seamen to manage the ship under such conditions. What would honorable senators who object to this proposal do then? Would they send for one of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley&#39;s</inline> dirigibles to bring three or four seamen on board from Port Adelaide? The ridiculousness of the position which some honorable senators set up should be apparent to the simplest person in the Commonwealth. </para>

They are the people I am  considering in this matter. If three or, four men step ashore from a ship, and she is lost in a storm in the Australian Bight, because there are not sufficient sear men on board to handle her, and hundreds of men and women are lost, who will be responsible? Will it not be the men who in this Senate are not prepared to pass such legislation as would make the means to*  secure the safety of people travelling on our ships as perfect as they can be made? </para>

                        <para>- Its effect will be  to deter men from breaking their engagements. I am not one of those who permit their prejudice or their bigotry to overwhelm their common sense. I say that we have a right to make this -Navigation Bill as perfect as we can, and we must consider the safety of the passengers and cargoes of ships sailing around our coast, leaving out the question of the application of the Bill to foreign ships altogether. If, by imposing a penalty upon men who are not prepared to carry out their obligations, we can do something in that direction, we ought not to hesitate to impose such a penalty. I have no sympathy with the man who, whether on land or at sea, enters into an engagement, and at the last minute declines to fulfil it without a reasonable excuse. This Bill provides that if a man has a reasonable excuse for refusing to join his ship, he will be exempt from any penalty; and the man who has no reasonable excuse for breaking his agreement will never have my sympathy, whether he works on land or at sea. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator is apparently aware of the grave dangers which ships may run if we reduce the penalty proposed by the Government. But I want to know from him what constitutes a reasonable cause for a seaman failing to join his vessel after he has entered into an agreement to do so? I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> that the sea man should be treated in this matter in the same way as the ship-owner. If any injury is caused to a ship-owner because a man fails to keep his agreement, the shipowner has his remedy by the institution of a civil case. Suppose I agree to join a ship in some capacity, and when I go and have a look at her, find that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger is the captain, that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> is first mate, or that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> is cook, or that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> is purser, I venture to say that, in such circumstances, I should feel justified in refusing to go in the ship ; but a magistrate hearing the case might riot think so, and he might fine me in the maximum penalty, because a good opportunity might have been missed to get&#39; rid of the lot of us. I quite recognise all the inconvenience to which ship-owners, masters and passengers may be put; but, beyond all that, there is the individual right of a man to say whether he will go to sea or not. It may be that to-day I am offered a position on board a ship, and agree to accept it. The ship may be going to sea to-morrow, and before she leaves I am offered a much better position to remain on land. If I do so I should, under the proposed amendment, be penalized for breaking my agreement. The shipping companies have their remedies at law, and why should we put the seaman in the position of a criminal liable to arrest, to fine and imprisonment. I take the case of a carpenter or a shearer, and if such men break their agreement, they are summoned, and the charge is heard against them in the usual way. </para>

                        <para>- Since the adoption of modern methods of punishment, there has not been the same necessity as previously existed for the gaols of Australia. It is a remarkable fact that since the Labour party came into existence in  1891,  owing to the making of penalties more moderate, and- the providing of better and more reasonable conditions, we find that, in New South Wales, with an increased population,, there are not half as many people in. the prisons of the State as there were previously. This is. due to the adoption of more humanitarian methods of dealing with people. The old Conservative idea of penalizing men for this thing and that is rapidly giving place to more humanitarian methods. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie can never be accused of supporting progressive movements of that kind ; the honorable senator is altogether too dense. </para>

We have been informed by the Vice-President of the Executive Council that this Bill was considered by the Navigation Commission, but I remind him that this provision never appeared in it until after it was returned to the Senate from another place. According to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould,</inline> it has been inserted at the request of the ship-owners. </para>

The fact remains that this provision never found its way into the Bill until, as the result of influence from somewhere, it was inserted in another place. . When- the Bill was drafted it did not include such a provision, and yet the Government, at the time, had the report of the Navigation Commission in their possession. </para>

                        <para>- Certainly not. I recognise the right of another place to make amendments in the Bill, and I am prepared to support every amendment which I consider an improvement upon the measure. We are dealing with one now which, in my opinion, imposes a great disability upon thousands of men, many of whom voted to send me here, and whom I was sent here to represent. </para>

                        <para>- We have to deal with these matters as we see them. When this Bill was introduced in the Senate it contained no such provision. Apparently it was not then recommended toy the Navigation Commission, and such a penalty was .not considered necessary. Now it is sought to make provision for this penalty, and, as one representing people vitally interested, I am not satisfied with the measure. </para>

I am satisfied that my honorable friends opposite should continue to occupy the Opposition benches. I hope they will remain there until a seat is provided for them outside this Parliament altogether. I am voting in this matter against the big companies and combines, and the big shipping concerns, that are preying upon the people, mot only of the Commonwealth, but of every other country. The people of the Commonwealth have to pay nearly double what they ought to pay to ship-owners for the sea carriage of goods ; yet we have the Government, with the assistance of honorable senators opposite, submitting such a proposal as this. </para>

                        <para>- I am anxious -to assist &#39;the Government in getting this measure through. This is only the second &#39;time I have spoken upon the Bill since it ;has been before the Senate, and I rose now because no notice whatever was taken by the Vice-President of the Executive Council of the questions I put to him. I asked the honorable senator to say what would be considered a reasonable cause for refusing to join a vessel. I ask now whether a strike in the industry would be .considered a sufficient cause? If a strike in the shipping industry took place to-morrow, and I was employed on board a vessel which :was to .sail .to-morrow, and, -walking ashore, joined my fellow unionists, and refused &#39;to work on the ship, I should become liable under this provision to a fine of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;10.</inline> I am not prepared to inflict upon other men a penalty which I would not inflict upon myself. When I asked that question, the Minister, in his reply, never mentioned the matter. So that the imputation that I am talking against the clock is scarcely a fair one in the circumstances. </para>

                        <para>- I was wondering whether I would have sufficient time to impress upon the Minister the importance of dealing with this matter in the way in which we suggest. This is one of the biggest Bills we have ever had to deal with, and I have refrained heretofore from discussing the subject, because it is one about which I know very little.. But we are dealing here with a matter which can be as easily understood by a man who has had no sea experience as by a seaman, and I want the Vice-President of the Executive Council to tell me whether a seaman leaving a ship because of a strike in the shipping industry would not .be liable under this provision to a fine of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;10.</inline></para>

I have had a fair amount of experience of working amongst men, and I say without hesitation that no man will give up his occupation unless he has, in his own mind, a sufficient reason. It is said, however, that because of the inconvenience to which people will be put by sailors leaving vessels it is necessary to inflict a heavy penalty. But by doing so we may be inflicting the greatest possible injustice. If I am a seaman, and, because my child is ill, I refuse to go to sea, ought I to be liable to a penalty of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;*o? .</inline></para>

Of course, <inline font-style="italic">&#163;io&#62;</inline> to a man who is in the habit of writing his cheque, and never bothers until his banker reminds him that his overdraft has gone too far, is a mere bagatelle; but to a man who has to depend upon his day&#39;s labour for the support of himself and his family it is an enormous sum of money. </para>

                    <para class="block">One of the principal reasons which actuated me in placing this motion on the notice-paper was that at the Labour Conference held in Hobart this year a new plank was added to the Federal Labour platform.

                    <para>As is well known to honorable senators on each side of the chamber, we, as a party, have a peculiar habit of giving effect to our platform as speedily as possible. Our planks are not mere election placards, but are framed because we believe that there is vital need of the legislation which they indicate. In view of the latest addition to our platform, I desire to draw attention to the need, when commencing our fleet of Inter-State steamers, of connecting Tasmania with the mainland. </para>

                            <para>- I intend to give an estimate of the cost, and also to state what, in my opinion, are the business prospects in establishing such a line. I do not ask the Senate to carry this motion as a mere favour. I ask honorable senators on both sides to carry the motion as a business proposition, pure and simple ; and if it cannot be justified on business grounds, I shall be quite content to ask leave to withdraw it. I think that I shall be able to show that a line of steamers will be entirely self-supporting, and a very desirable service for the Commonwealth itself. </para>

                    <para>I realize that, in adding this new plank to the platform, the Labour party will probably be accused of doing something which is rather unprecedented. It has been said that there is no need for the Labour party to interfere with our shipping. It has also been said that it is an innovation for a Government to engage in sea transit. Now that is not the case. I have here some information from the Italian Consul, who states tha* .recently the Italian Government bought out the companies running between Italy and Sicily, between Italy and Sardinia and on the lakes of Italy. I find that previously they possessed a line of sixteen&#39; vessels, with an aggregate gross tonnage of  25,000  tons, which they were running mainly in conjunction with their railways. I have a list of the vessels, and I notice that the largest approaches  4,000  tons, and that the smallest is about  400  tons. These vessels, I understand from the Italian Consul, are not only paying, .but are a very successful adjunct to the railway systems ot Italy. </para>

                            <para>- No, for many years longer. Tasmania occupies a rather unique position, as it is the only State which&#39; is separated from the mainland by water. This Parliament, in its wisdom, thought fit to link up Western Australia with the eastern States by means of a transcontinental railway, to a certain extent for the purpose of defence, but principally for the purpose of communication. Considering that we are about to establish InterState steamers, it is quite logical to ask that a start should be made with the little State of Tasmania. At present there is no prospect of a remedy. The position must become ever increasingly acute, and we in Tasmania realize more and more that our products cannot be satisfactorily sent to market on the mainland, that our people will be charged ever increasing fares and freights, and that the combine between two steam-ship companies will press more heavily each year upon the people of the State. &#39; </para>

                    </continue>
                    <para>Logically, therefore, the only remedy we can see is the establishment of a steamship communication by the Commonwealth Government. In a previous speech I dwelt at some length on the unsatisfactory position of Tasmania. I showed then that we were paying about 50 per cent, more on cargo freights from Tasmania in comparison with what we paid a few years ago. I also demonstrated that our passenger rates have gone up steadily, and that at present the charge per mile between Launceston and </para>
                    <para class="block">Melbourne is the heaviest imposed by any steam-ship company trading round Australia. </para>
                    <para>The profits of the steam-ship companies controlling the Tasmanian trade have been materially increasing. I could not give a stronger instance of that fact than by mentioning that when Huddart, Parker, and Company was recently floated into -a limited company there was, owing to the business being so profitable, such a rush for shares that, within three or four days after their issue, shares were sold at a premium of 50 per cent., and people could not possibly obtain shares anywhere. A gentleman in Hobart has stated that he applied for a large number of shares, for which he was quite willing to pay cash, and, although he applied very early, he could not obtain a share after repeated efforts. This information I had personally from the applicant. The new issue was mainly secured by the existing proprietors. Undoubtedly the profits of Huddart, Parker, and Company have been steadily increasing. Take light produce, for instance. A few years ago it was conveyed from Launceston to the mainland at 12s. 6d. per ton, but to-day &#39;the price is 18s., showing a rise of 50 per cent. That increase has to be borne by the producers of Tasmania, and the burden upon them is ever increasing. </para>

                            <para>- I am going to deal with that matter presently. I hope to show the company&#39;s receipts and expenditure, so far as the passenger traffic is concerned. It will be remembered that the representatives of Tasmania in the Senate raised a protest against the Commonwealth Government letting a mail contract to the combine between the two shipping companies. I wish to state briefly what occurred on that occasion. The Commonwealth Government desired to convenience not only the people of Tasmania, but the people of the mainland, by providing them with a better service. Accordingly they approached the steam-ship companies, who are running a tub which is forty years old, and which, although it has been a good boat in its time, is now absolutely inadequate and unsuitable. I refer to the s.s. <inline font-style="italic">Rotomahana.</inline> Although the Federal Government asked for another <inline font-style="italic">&#34;Loongana</inline> to be put on, the terms asked were such that they were forced, in justice to themselves and the people of the Commonwealth, to turn down the proposals. The shipping companies asked that if they put on another boat equal to the <inline font-style="italic">Loongana</inline> their present subsidy should be increased by ^2,000 a year. They were receiving ,&#163;1.3,000 a year for carrying out a mail contract. That is a very handsome subsidy, but they asked that it should be increased to ^15,000. Further, they asked - and this is, I think, the part of the request to which the Government objected - that the Commonwealth Government should give them a seven years&#39; contract, and tie the people of Australia and Tasmania up to their freights and fares for that term without being able to get out of the arrangement if we should eventually put on our own boats. Rightly, to my mind, the Government refused the demand, particularly as the shipping companies offered only to run four trips a week, namely, two <inline font-style="italic">via</inline> Burnie, and two direct from Launceston to Melbourne and back. That was a very slight improvement on the present service, in which the companies run three boats, two doing the Launceston trip and one doing the Burnie trip. </para>

I take it that, in view of the new plank in our platform, the Government would have acted entirely against the interests of the people of Tasmania and the mainland had they accepted the proposals from the shipping companies. They let a contract for two years, and it is quite open&#39; to them to make any arrangement they think fit at the end of that term. </para>

On more than one occasion the question has been raised as to whether the Government have constitutional power to establish a line of steamers. I think that, in the last debate on this subject, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> representing the Government, said it was a matter for the Tasmanian Government, and not for the Commonwealth Government. The honorable senator did not quote any constitutional authority in support of his statement, but he gave it as his opinion that this Parliament has not the power to establish such boats. </para>

                            <para>- I shall adhere to a 4 per cent, basis, as I think that is a fairly sound financial proposition. Now, ,&#163;13,000 capitalized at 4 per cent, would amount to ^&#163;300,000, and leave ,&#163;1,000 for a sinking fund. What would it cost to establish these boats? The <inline font-style="italic">Loongana</inline> is a boat of 2,500 tons, and she cost &#163;80,000 to build. At the present time, that vessel would cost <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> 25,000 to build, because of the rise in the cost of shipbuilding. It may be said to have been phenomenal, since within a short period there has been an advance of 25 per cent. Two vessels of the type of the <inline font-style="italic">Loongana</inline> would cost, at the present time, delivered in Australia, &#163;250,000. That could be easily financed with the amount we. at present pay as a mail subsidy. </para>

                    <para>The Commonwealth would be in just the same position,, and we would have a profitable service; which would benefit, materially the people of the Commonwealth. I wish now to show what a profitable service it is. I can quote the opinion of a Hobart resident who has- made a study of shipping statistics. He says - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>Taking the year 191 1, there were 41,503 people who arrived in this State,, and 45,064 people went out of the State. Last year there were approximately 3,000 passengers who were&#39; landed&#39; at Hobart from England, and South- Africa1 for transhipment to the other States,, so that if you  take  that 3,000 from the figures I have given you, you will have a total Inter-State passenger traffic of 84,167. If you average the fares paid for their passages at <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2</inline> per head, it gives a total of ,&#163;160,000 for passenger fares that went to the shipping companies.  Those figures refer to the whole of the traffic to Tasmania, and not merely the Launceston-Melbourne traffic. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Williams,,</inline> another Hobart gentleman, who is, I think,, rather inclined to overestimate&#39; matters,  says - </para>
                        <para>When the&#39; companies spoke about the service not paying, I do not think that could be said with regard to the Launceston to Melbourne service-, because the subsidy, I believe, is  j&#163;i  1,0001 a year to Launceston-, and &#163;2,000 to the West Coast. That comes out at about &#163;73.5 per trip; that is, from Launceston to Melbourne and back to Launceston. T think it a fair average to say there are 200 passengers per trip. T turned up the newspaper this morning, and there were 157 passengers travelled across on the last trip. </para>

                    <para class="block">I have some figures which I have had taken out specially to show the average passenger traffic between Launceston and Melbourne, and to give the Senate some idea of the profits which the steam-ship companies concerned must be making. It is commonly reported in Tasmania, and. the report has not been officially contradicted, that the <inline font-style="italic">Loongana,</inline> which cost &#163;80,000, has paid for herself already; that the company have been more than paid for her cost by what they have made out of her running. I should like to mention that the Australasian United Steam Navigation Company&#39;s steamer <inline font-style="italic">Wyreema,</inline> which is a vessel of 6,000, tons, cost . &#163;154,000, and the <inline font-style="italic">Levuka,</inline> another 6,000-tons boat, engaged in; the Fijian trade, was obtained for &#163;140,000. For the ,&#163;300,000 I have mentioned, we could obtain two boats of over 4,000- tons each. </para>

                            <para>- That is so* and we would require boats that could do from 18 to 19 knots. The boats I have mentioned are not exactly the style of boats that we require: We should require an improved <inline font-style="italic">Loongana</inline> for our purposes. Honorable senators; who know anything about what is1 occurring in Tasmania will probably have noticed from the newspapers that the Launceston Marine Board have introduced a scheme&#39; in connexion with which they propose to spend no less, than &#163;500,000 in removing- the bends in the River Tamar, cutting a straight channel, establishing a deep-water port, and deepening the river, so that ships of 6,000 tons may go at. low tide right up to. the Launceston wharf. Some honorable senators have contended that the Tamar is not capable of carrying the traffic for which we desire to provide^, but they will recognise that that is an&#39; objection which will be removed. The Launceston Marine- Board are taking steps now to have a Bill passed through the State- Parliament in order that they may proceed with their scheme as expeditiously as possible. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. It is interesting to note the receipts for these trips. In the case of the lowest list, quoted, 223 were first saloon passengers and 87 second saloon passengers; and the total amount received in passenger fares for that week was ,&#163;752 5s. In the case of the highest list quoted, 1,216 were first, and 688 second saloon passengers; and the total receipts for the week amounted to &#163;3,824. That was the high-water mark for the year. I have consulted with a person who knows what he is talking about in connexion with this matter, and if I cannot give my authority it is for a very good reason ; and I am informed that the average passenger list per week, all the year round, may be fairly put down at 500. If we assume that 300 are first, and 200 second class passengers, this will give a total &#39;receipt for the week of &#163;1,370.  <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lt.-Colonel Sir Albert</inline> Gould. - What are the fares each way? </para>

It will be admitted that these are most exorbitant fares for what is really a ferry service.

                            <para>-  She carries a fair amount of cargo. Now let us consider the expense to the company of running the boat. I put the expenses down in the following way : - &#163;360 per week for coal ; &#163;150 for food; &#163;175 for wages; ^275 for other .expenses ; and &#163;125 for interest; or a total of &#163;&#91;1,085 per week, or of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;4,340</inline> per month. I think it will be admitted that if I have erred at all it is on the liberal side. The figures I have given place the expense of running the vessel at &#163;4,340 per month, whilst the receipts from passenger traffic alone are shown to amount to &#163;&#91;5,480 per month. So that, on .the passenger traffic alone, the vessel is returning a very handsome profit to the company. </para>

I have allowed &#163;275 for &#34;other expenses.&#34; I have had an estimate from a shipping authority, who has a high reputation in shipping circles in Tasmania, showing that the <inline font-style="italic">Loongana</inline> can be run for &#163;3,000 per month, and in the figures I have given, I have allowed for an expenditure of &#163;4,340.

It is generally admitted that the shipping companies have a veritable goldmine in the <inline font-style="italic">Loongana,</inline> and the Melbourne-Launceston service. Undoubtedly, the profits in the service are very large, and the people are penalized by the imposition of heavy fares and freights. </para>

                            <para>- That is an entirely different service. I think I have said enough to show that if this service were taken in hand by the Government, it would represent a valuable adjunct to our railways. We have a tourist traffic with Tasmania that is practically in its infancy. That tourist traffic is increasing every year, although the accommodation provided &#39;has not improved. For the last twenty years we have practically been in the hands of two shipping companies, and to whom should we look for relief if not to the Commonwealth Government? In order to give honorable senators some idea of the importance of the .port of Launceston, I have collected information which shows that for the year ending 31st December, 1911, the outward tonnage of steamers leaving the port was 213,465 tons, and of sailing vessels 293, making a total of 213,758. The inward traffic for the same period was 242,806 tons. I find that in the three years prior to 1909, Launceston topped the record of railway stations in Tasmania; in 1905-6, by 33.575 tons; in 1906-7, by 20,097 tons; and in 1908-9, by 34,968 tons. From 1902 to 1911, the goods traffic increased by 29.85 per cent., and the passenger traffic, which is the chief traffic, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers</inline> will admit, increased from <inline font-style="italic">1904-5</inline> to 1910-11 by 74.32 per cent. This year, the total -number of passengers carried to and from Launceston was 210,463, and in 1910-n, the number was 337,429. In view of these facts - the growing importance of our trade, the rapidly increasing rates and fares to which we are subjected, and the isolation of Tasmania - I contend that I have made out a case for the establishment of a Commonwealthowned line of steamers. I am going to ask the Senate, in debating this motion, to endeavour to realize that if we are to make a start in connexion with controlling steamship traffic, we should, in the first instance, take into consideration the State most needing such communication. That State is, undoubtedly, Tasmania. </para>

                            <para>- Undoubtedly, because, by reason of our isolation, we feel the defects of the present situation most. But the mainland States also require this accommodation to a great extent. At the present time, a Select Committee is sitting in Tasmania to inquire into the steam-ship traffic. But that Committee, which has been appointed by the State Parliament, is dealing particularly with the Hobart-Sydney and Hobart-Brisbane service. I believe that the idea - I have it on fairly good authority - is to endeavour to induce the State Government to establish vessels to .trade, not only from Hobart to Sydney, but to continue right up to Brisbane, and give us a direct service with Queensland ports. If the State Government does that, well and good. I believe that the avenues of trade are such that the service will be very profitable. But that is in a different category altogether from the service which I am now advocating, which is a matter concerning the means of communication of an integral part of the Commonwealth. . </para>

                    <para>If the Commonwealth is going to establish steamers, undoubtedly, Tasmania can put in the best claim for consideration. It is for that reason that I have taken this course. I trust that the subject will be thoroughly ventilated. I shall be glad to hear the opinions of honorable senators opposite. It is rather a big subject. The subsidies that the Commonwealth is already paying to private companies would be more than sufficient to pay interest on a line of steamers that would furnish us with a reproductive service. </para>

                            <para>- I believe that the venture would be profitable from the outset, and that it would largely increase the traffic between the mainland and. Tasmania. We should largely develop the cargo traffic, for the simple reason that, one boat travelling between Launceston and Melbourne and back on the same day is not able to load cargo to advantage. With two boats running in the summer, there would be more time for loading cargo, and consequently more produce would be shipped to the mainland. On account of the very short time that the <inline font-style="italic">Loongana</inline> remains in port, she is handicapped in this respect. But, under the system that I advocate, producers would1 be able to ship more regularly, and we should establish a trade that would be worth many thousands of pounds a year toTasmania. </para>

I have dealt with it as it presents itself to my mind ; and I trust that honorable senators on both sides will consider it fairly, and see the advantage of taking this further step in the direction of practical Socialism.. If the States composing the Commonwealth of Australia can spend  &#163;150,000,000  on railways, surely we can logically spend  &#163;250,000,  or a little more, on steam-ships. There is no reason why we should not. I am one of those who believe, in common with other public men, that in a few years&#39; time we shall have to have our own oversea vessels, as well as our own InterState boats, manned by our own seamen, worked under Australian conditions, and1 flying the Australian flag. That would be a magnificent advertisement for us on the seas of the world ; and we should not only gain the benefits of cheaper freights and fares, but should be able to bring out a regular stream of desirable immigrants on more favorable terms than has been possible before. </para>

                            <para>- I am aware that they have to pay heavy dues; but, at the same time, the Orient Steam-ship Company is paying something like  16  per cent, in dividends; so that it is doing very well, notwithstanding the canal dues. The establishment of a service of our own would bring to an end many of the grave problems which confront our exporters to-day in connexion with shipping space. In the butter trade, we have learnt how certain merchants have commandeered the available space by making arrangements with the shipping companies, and have consequently been able to tax the producers to an inordinate extent. We have had the spectacle of many of our industries being absolutely controlled by a few merchants, in conjunction with the shipping companies. In consequence, many of the producers have been looking confidently to the Commonwealth for a solution of the difficulties under which they labour in regard to oversea exportation. 1 trust that I shall have the support of honorable senators on both sides of the Senate in connexion with the advocacy .of this progressive plank that was recently added to the Labour platform. Even those who do not agree with our platform generally should recognise that, as Australia is an island continent, steam-ship communication is of vital importance to us. It is as important as internal communication by means of railways. The only way in which we can grapple with the great problem of transport is to establish such a line of boats as will enable us to relieve our people from the many grave disadvantages under which they are now suffering. </para>

                    <para class="block">I am sorry that there should be any necessity for moving a motion of this kind, and for asking for the appointment of a Select Committee to inquire into the subject with which it deals. The fact is that there has been continuous dissatisfaction amongst members of the Post and Telegraph Association of South Australia. That dissatisfaction has existed for a number of years, and has been strongly marked since the year  1904.  Up till that time the officers had received the same salaries as they received prior to the foundation of the Commonwealth. But they consider that the classification of  1904  morally, if not? legally, robbed them of a considerable portion of their income. The Federal Convention, when it drafted the Constitution,, certainly intended to conserve all the accrued and accruing rights of public servants. I could quote from a number of speeches made at the Convention from which it is abundantly clear that it was intended&#39; that public servants should not be put under/ any disadvantage on entering the Commonwealth Service. I do not think it is necessary that I should quote those speeches again, inasmuch as I made use of some of them last year, when the report of the Postal Commission was under consideration. </para>

The members of the Convention were anxious that those votes should be secured&#39; for Federation.

                    <para class="block">I think it will be admitted that the Commonwealth Parliament inserted that section in the Public Service Act with the idea that it was carrying out the provision of the Constitution itself, and with the desire to preserve the rights of transferred servants. Moreover, when the Public Service Bill was introduced, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne, who was in charge of -it, &#39;referred to this matter very distinctly. He said, in moving the second reading of the measure - </para>
                    <para>I  wish to emphasize the fact that in clause 51 and 52 of this Bill -  which are now section 60 of the Act -  and  in  section 84  of  the Commonwealth Constitution, there is a provision to make it quite certain that no trouble shall arise in regard to transferred officers, and that all the rights which accrue to those officers which have been . taken over from the various States will be respected. </para>
                    <para class="block">Nothing could have been plainer than that. Evidently, what <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne had in his mind was the wish to respect the assurance given to the public servants in regard to their position. That position, however, was violated by the classification of 1904. Claims were then ruthlessly disregarded. The classification ignored all the undertakings of the Convention, and of section 84 of the Constitution. There are about 100 postmasters in South Australia whose incomes were detrimentally affected to the extent of from <inline font-style="italic">&#163;5</inline> to&#163;150 per annum, the average being no less than&#163;34. There were between eighty and ninety officers who were entitled to increments, who were called upon to lose from <inline font-style="italic">&#163;20</inline> to&#163;30 per annum. Some of them had long service behind them. I shall quote a few cases from the list of the officers to show that this was the fact. The late John Bastard, who died some years ago, had behind him, at the time of the classification, a service of forty-eight years, and he was called upon to lose in emolument&#163;152 a year, or 32 per cent. of his income. J. Skinner had behind him a service of thirty-eight years, and he was called upon to lose a year in emolument, which was equal to 32 per cent. of his income. And so it goes on, until it comes down to those who lost about&#163;5 a year. It runs down from&#163;157 a year to about <inline font-style="italic">&#163;5.</inline> The officers themselves sum up the position in their reply to the Public Service Commissioner, with regard to the classification - </para>

                        <para>The anxiety of the National Convention to protect transferred officers from loss found expression in clause 84 of the Constitution. The Commonwealth Parliament when it enacted clause 60 of the Commonwealth Public Service Act of 1902 legislated in conformity with the obligation thus imposed on it by the Convention, and there is absolutely no room for doubt that both bodies believed that they had most effectively protected every interest of transferred officers. To yet further protect the rights  of  individual officers, and to secure purity of  administration,  the &#39;Federal Legislature delegated its powers in Service matters to a Commissioner, who was to be a man of the highest integrity and ability, and immune from political influence. </para>

It was acknowledged that, in taking over the Service, there might be some anomalies to be provided for, but that they would simply continue during the life-time of the officers concerned, and that afterwards the conditions of the Public Service might be uniform throughout the Commonwealth. The Post and Telegraph Association in South Australia hoped for a good deal from the adoption of the report of the Postal Commission as regards future management, and so on; but the most important part of the report, in their judgment, has not been adopted, and that is with regard to the working of the Service. The officers- cannot apply to the High Court in this matter, that body having declared that the Federal Parliament is a competent authority to vary or abolish such rights.

                            The Federal Convention, in dealing with the question of the rights of transferred officers, was faced with the possibility that, if the transferred officers were left open to possibly unjust treatment by their new employer, they- would vote against Federation. Those very words were used by one member of the Convention. The various members of the Convention referred to what had been done in a particular case in Victoria, and another case mentioned in India, when the servants of one company or one service went over with the business to another service. In each of these cases it was stated that the rights of the officers were so preserved that they could not suffer loss; and clause 84 of the Constitution was designed by the Convention for their protection. I take that to be the whole tenor of the debate. It was designed to prevent the officers who were to be transferred being unjustly treated or losing anything under their new employer. That is the way we viewed it, and that is the way we accepted Federation.

It is like the case of an apprentice transferred by one employer to another - if the transfer is properly done, then all the apprentice&#39;s rights continue to the transferree, and the new employer has upon him all the burden that the original employer had. The transfer does not alter it, nor can he alter it without consent. I only want to point out to you that the analogy of a private employer is quite different from that of the State employer. The South Australian Legislature could, if it liked, of course, simply say that all its employes should have ^600 a year, or, on the other hand, only ^50 a year, and) there would be an end of it so far as the law is concerned, but not, of course, so far as other things are concerned. </para>

                            <para>- I think that the statement of these officers has been put clearly enough. First of all, Parliament passed a Public Service Act, in which it handed over its judicial powers to a Public Service Commissioner. He gave certain decisions with regard to public servants, which neither section  84  of the Constitution nor section  60  of the Public Service Act warranted him in giving. From that time these officers have been fighting for justice. They could not go to the Court, because the Court held that Parliament had the power to do away with -the whole thing if it so desired, and Parliament handed its power over to the Public Service Commissioner, and that settled the matter. </para>

                            <para>-  I am asking for the appointment of a Select Committee to take evidence on both sides, and bring up a recommendation to this Parliament for a solution of the difficulty. I submit the motion, because I do not think that it is good for the Service that it should contain a number of men smarting under what they believe to be an injustice. If the Select Committee were appointed, and reported against them, I take it that that would settle the matter&#39; once and for all. They were promised arbitration, . but the Minister backed down from that, and so far as I can see they have no other course open to them but to ask that a Select Committee should inquire into the whole matter, and make a recommendation to Parliament. These officers were quite willing, should the matter be referred to arbitration, to abide the result if they were satisfied with regard to the arbitrator. I think they would be willing to abide by the finding of such a Select Committee as I ask for. I hope that I shall have the support of the Government in the matter, and that they will agree to the appointment of a Committee to investigate the facts with a view to a satisfactory settlement of the whole question. </para>
