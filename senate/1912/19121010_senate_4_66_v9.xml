                                <para>- This course has been taken previously, but the practice is to give notice of a motion for the following day. This is not the usual report of the Printing Committee. The usual report was presented and adopted by the Senate a few days ago. But in the other Chamber the usual report was referred back to the Printing Committee on account of a resolution which it contained. Consequently there has been another meeting of the Printing Committee, and the report just read to the Senate recommends that the resolution at the end of the previous report should be rescinded. Yesterday <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> asked whether the action of the other House would prevent the printing of the papers with which the Printing Committee had dealt. So far as this side of Parliament is concerned it did not prevent any papers from being printed, because all the papers  which have been laid on the table of the Senate and all the papers which were common to both Houses had been sent to the printer. We had no power, of course, to deal with papers which had been laid upon the table of the House of Representatives only. Is it the pleasure of the Senate that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> have leave to submit a motion ? </para>

                <para>The only extraordinary feature in connexion with this measure is that it asks for three months' Supply, which will carry us on to the end of the calendar year, that is, until the Appropriation Bill has been passed and the financial year has been provided for. We wish to avoid the necessity of bringing in a Supply Bill at the end of every month. The practice in most of the States is to ask for a quarter's Supply, but that has not been done in this Parliament up to the present time. In this session we asked, first, for a month's Supply, second, for two months' Supply, and now for three months' Supply. The proposed appropriation is based upon the Estimates, and is required for the purpose of carrying on the ordinary services of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- It is £150,000, and no doubt honorable senators will recognise that that is a very moderate amount in comparison with what has been asked for previously for three months. We have asked for as much as that for one month, or for two months. The Treasurer has cut down the amount of the Advance as much as possible. The total amount of the proposed appropriation is .£2,252,661. The items in connexion with the different Departments for three months bear a very fair proportion to what has. been asked on previous occasions for one month, or for two months. We ask for £8,512 for the Parliament, £9,759 for the Prime Minister's Department, and £39,770 for the Treasury Department. We consider that, on account of the reasonableness of these requests, there will be very little opposition offered. I have no desire to curtail the right of honorable senators to ventilate any grievances which they may have, because this is a fitting opportunity for them to do so. The Attorney-General's Department requires £12,326, while the External Affairs Department - owing to the development in the Northern Territory and otherwise - needs £106,663. Honorable senators realize, of course, that there are certain Departments whose requirements at all times . are almost stationary. For the Department of Defence we are asking for £641,700, for the Department of Trade and Customs for £88,051, and for the Department of Home Affairs for ^74,2.35- </para>

These go to swell the total amount. The Postmaster-General is asking for £1,046,645. The amount required for refunds of revenue is £75,000, and the Treasurer's Advance amounts to £150,000. In the last Supply Bill, No. 2, we asked for £1,503,574. The amount now required is only about £3,000 more than proportionately to that sum. Consequently, the amount set down in the Bill comes very near the mark. In Supply Bill, No. 1, which was only for one month, the amount was £882,768. It will, therefore, be seen that the sum now required for three months is only a little over three times that amount. The Government are submitting the measure in this form for the convenience of both Houses of the Legislature. We do not desire, when we reach, the busier stages of the session, to delay the business by the introduction of Supply Bills for one month. If, during the debate, any points are raised or inquiries made requiring explanation, I shall endeavour to furnish honorable senators with the particulars they need. In Committee, honorable senators will have every opportunity of asking questions, and departmental officers will be in attendance for the purpose of furnishing information. </para>

                        <para>- It is required immediately. The expenditure of it commenced on the 1 st October, but up to the end of the first fortnight, no large amounts will be expended. There may be a few sums paid on account of small contracts. But before the end of the second week of the month, money must be available for paying officers who receive their salaries fortnightly. Although honorable senators may take advantage of the opportunity to discuss the policy of the Government, and the Bill itself, it is obvious that we cannot delay this measure for a week or two. We still have the debate on the Budget-papers in front of us, and honorable senators are thus afforded an opportunity' of entering fully into questions of policy. Therefore,  1  am sure that they will be reasonable with respect to the discussion on this Bill. </para>

                    <para>.. -I do not intend to discuss the Bill itself on the motion for the first reading. I shall reserve my remarks upon it until a later stage. But, as honorable senators are aware, the first reading of a Bill of this nature affords an opportunity to refer to matters not contained within the measure itself. I propose to take advantage of that opportunity. The subject which I propose to discuss is a difference which arose last, week between <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger and myself. In the course of a speech which I made, I good-humouredly twitted <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger with having been at one time rather a. promising member of the Labour party; and I expressed my regret that he stopped short at promising, and did not attain fulfilment. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger, being very much aggrieved, took exception to my remarks, and used some rather strong language. Of course, he was entitled to do so if he wished. I believe that yesterday afternoon, while I was temporarily absent from the chamber, he made a personal explanation, in which he denied <inline font-style="italic">intoto</inline> the whole of my remarks, and stated emphatically that he never had coquetted with the Labour party, and, in fact, would never have had anything to do with them - would not even have been found dead in a 40-acre paddock with them, or words to that effect. I do not desire the Senate to accept my " say so " on the matter at all. For anything that I say which I cannot support with evidence, I have no right to claim the credence of honorable senators. I want to call <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger himself into the witness box. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator cited as a proof of his anti-coquetting propensities that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Anderson</inline> Dawson, at one time Premier of Queensland, had offered him a portfolio in his Ministry. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger had any logical faculty at all, he would recognise that the fact that a (Labour Premier had offered him a portfolio was proof positive that he had been coquetting with the Labour party. A man does not ask a woman to marry him unless he gets an encouraging glint out of the corner of her "ee." A close connexion was contemplated in this case, at any rate. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger was under the tutelage of a very able and distinguished gentleman at that time. I think that, if the prospects had been better, he would have jumped at the chance. But the probabilities of the continuance of the Labour Ministry seemed to be so slight that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger, whilst willing to eat the apple, was afraid that it would turn to ashes in his mouth; and that was the reason why, the offer was refused. </para>

I  have already put on record the reports of those remarks which appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Bundaberg Star</inline> of the same date.

                <para class="block">I say that it was very peculiar.

The trouble with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger is not that I am not recording these things in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> to remind him of the past; it is with his own conscience, which is so evidently pricking him.

I have nothing to add to what I have said as a justification of the re- marks which I made a few days ago, and to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger took such violent exception. I have quoted the statements of people who are not Labour men, but who were of exactly the same way of political thinking as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger himself. I have quoted the honorable senator's own previous remarks, and I say now, emphatically, that it was well recognised amongst the State Labour party of Queensland in1899 - and I was then a member of the State Parliament - that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. St.</inline> Ledger, as he then was, only required a reasonable prospect of successfully contesting a seat on behalf of our party to come into the party. The honorable senator may have had entirely opposite opinions, and may have been utterly opposed to our views, but I say that his conduct was to lead members of the party, and especially their leader, the late <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Anderson</inline> Dawson - who is, unfortunately, no more - to believe that we had only to open our arms and, metaphorically, Mr. St. Ledger would have fallen upon our bosoms. As I have already said, if I were a very religious man, and much given to devotional exercises, I should go down upon my knees ten times a day and thank God that the honorable senator did not succeed in doing so. </para>

                <para>SenatorST. LEDGER. - Yes ; after that interview. There was an influential deputation of representatives of both Houses of Parliament, the Chambers of Commerce, and various industries, that waited upon the Prime Minister. I am not going to traverse, though I might do so, what was said on that occasion. At previous conferences, some things were said which were necessarily more or less confidential ; but I think that everything at the conference with the Prime Minister was above board. Your memory, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> may be refreshed, as it was just now in connexion with another matter, when I recall the fact that, towards the close of the interview which the deputation referred to had with the Prime Minister, I said that the trouble with the Queensland people, and possibly with the whole of the people of Australia, was whether the Vancouver service was to continue on the deep blue sea, or be consigned to the care of  His  Satanic Majesty. At that time, if there were to be any odds laid on the event, I was going to back  His  Satanic Majesty. Now the Vancouver mail service to Queensland and New South Wales has gone, and the half-prediction at that time has been fulfilled. The Government received ample warning between 1910 and the present year that their negotiations were likely to end in that way. I propose now to call attention to the extraordinary course which the Government took with the people of Queensland, and, to a certain extent, with the people of Australia, upon this matter. Between May or July, 1.910, and subsequently, the Prime Minister, time and again, gave the assurance that things were all right. Shortly after the Government assumed office with an overwhelming majority and an overflowing purse, the result of the policy we had initiated and carried out with the States, the question of the continuance of the service, occupied the attention of this Parliament, and representatives of Queensland drew frequent attention to the matter. </para>

On the 5th October, 1910,  .1  expressed in this Senate a fear that the service was to be abandoned. At that time I had reason to believe, on the highest authority, that the negotiations were being conducted in such a way that the Government must have known that, unless they altered their policy, a service from Canada to New Zealand would be inaugurated in spite of them, and Australia would be left. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> replied to my question, on the 15 th October, in these words - </para>

                    <para>There is no occasion for that anxiety. 1  still entertained fears upon the matter, and, on the 25th November, 1910, I stated in this Chamber that, although much that was said - I was then referring to the Brisbane and Sydney Conferences, at which the -Postmaster-General and the Treasurer were present - was confidential, I could- say without any breach of confidence that I had forecasted the present position. I then warned the Government and the Postmaster-General that it was pretty certain that Queensland was going to be "left" in this matter. That warning, however; was brushed aside. It was thought that I was playing a mere game, but it is now evident that my information was perfectly accurate. The matter was again referred to in another place on 4th October, 1910, when a specific question was asked in regard to Auckland being made a port of call. On that occasion the Postmaster-General replied - </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator's interjections convey to my mind something which is no more than a quibble. If the Government will vouchsafe an explanation of their position in regard to this matter, I feel sure that explanation will be little less than a quibble. The next step taken was to call for tenders for this service, and those tenders were made returnable on the 1st November, 1910. In another place, the Postmaster-General was questioned in regard to the tenders, and especially in regard to whether the fact of Auckland being made a port of call might not prove prejudicial to the claims of Brisbane and Melbourne. That was a very important point. Here is the answer which the Postmaster-General gave in all solemnity. It is a remarkably solemn reply - in fact, in the light of after events, it is rather sad to the people of Queensland - </para>

                <para class="block">Now, I have searched <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> but I cannot find that that information was ever given. I was watching negotiations pretty closely at the time, and I am not aware that that promise has ever been fulfilled. When nothing resulted from all these inquiries, and conferences, not to mention petitions from the Chambers of Commerce in Sydney, Brisbane, and Melbourne, my anxiety was increased, and on 20th December, 1911, I asked another question in the Senate. In reply, the Minister of Defence informed me -  that the whole thing is in such a tangle that I cannot see my way out of it. I know the matter engaged the close attention of the ex-Postmaster-General, and I have no doubt that when the present session is closed the Postmaster-General will devote his attention to it. </para>
                <para class="block">The session closed, and though we are here again, we have never heard a single word as to how that tangle was brought about, and why the service disappeared. _ If I had not pressed the matter on this occasion we should most likely have gone back to our constituents, and had to confess to them that we did not know how the tangle was produced or how it was unravelled. The Government have no excuse for the present position. I think they will find it difficult to justify themselves, either to the commercial " community of Queensland or of Australia. Prior to Federation - and since Federation - we have talked of our important position in the Pacific, and of the duty which devolves upon this Parliament to take a dominant hand in its trade. The Pacific Islands and the countries around them are likely to be customers of ours, and we are likely, <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> be customers of theirs. Trade is developing in all directions in the Pacific! and it is the desire of every Power touching upon it to capture a large amount of that trade. The most important portion of the trade to which we can legitimately look is the trade with Canada and the United States of America. Unless we get a large volume of trade, in the Pacific the Commonwealth can newer be a dominant power in the Pacific. When we find the Government with ample funds, and a strong majority, neglecting its manifest opportunities, it is no longer a matter of comment, but a matter of strong censure. </para>

                        <para>- So it was; but would there have been a single railway built in Australia if that consideration had been the determining factor? If any Government in Australia announced that it would wait until there was a trade before it would undertake to build a railway, it would be turned out of office at once. So it is with the development of trade in the Pacific. The Vancouver service did not pay, but it was becoming more and more popular. We all recognise that trade in the Pacific must increase, by reason of the fact that the population and the wealth of the Commonwealth must increase, and that the population and wealth of many countries in the Pacific will also increase. </para>

                        <para>- If the honorable senator will speak a little more, possibly we may get more light thrown on this matter. It is rather an unfortunate defence which he is trying to make by interjection. This service did not directly touch South Australia or Western Australia; but will he or the Government give that as a reason why the other States were left out of consideration in this matter? </para>

                        <para>- After that interjection, I think I am justified in saying that it was the reason, and possibly the only reason, why the service was abandoned In  1907  the imports from Canada to Queensland alone were worth  , £39,000;  in  1908, £35,000;in1909, <inline font-style="italic">£43,600</inline> ; andin1910, £46,230.  Although the trade from Canada to Queensland alone did not represent a very large amount, it was increasing, and giving promise. The exports from Queensland alone to Canada during those years were as follow: - In  1907, £15,000;  in  1908,  £11,000; in  1909, £12,000;  and in  1 9 10, £37,800.  While the imports to Queensland during that time had increased at a comparatively small rate, its exports had risen by  200  per cent. </para>

                        <para>- Did you, sir, ever hear a more irrelevant interjection? What on earth are we here for but to legislate in such a way that our trade and commerce, not only internal, but external, will develop? To what markets do our great primary industries look? To the markets of the world - the United States, and Canada. The mail service to 'Canada has been abandoned, and we are told by some strong Government supporters that we will look after our internal trade. The people of Australia will not stand that kind of thing. In 1907 we imported from Canada - mostly food stuffs of animal origin - goods to the value of £40,000 ; in 1908, £49,000; in 1909, £55,000; and in 1910 , £101,000. Other portions of our imports showed a gradual increase. This goes to show that, even if the trade was not remunerative, it was promising. </para>

                        <para>- Canada, the United States and Australia talk about their Tariffs. One Government is approaching the other by means of its Tariff machinery to promote reciprocity, and the object is, of course, to increase trade. Of what use is it to resort to, this course if the means of carrying on trade is not simultaneously developed ? Of what use is it to talk of establishing closer trade relations with Canada or the United States, which we all desire, unless we give some practicable means by which we can bring about that reciprocity ? If we are to develop trade relations with Canada, we must have a mail service. </para>

                        <para>- They may not have done much. From one point of view, the Tariffs themselves may be barriers to an increase of trade. There can be no practical result in this matter of Tariff reciprocity until the Government give substantial help towards the main factor in carrying on trade. All this talk about our position in the Pacific, and developing reciprocal trade relations with Canada and the United States is mere" hot air " unless we subsidize a mail service in some form. </para>

If we wish to develop close commercial relations between the United Kingdom and Australia through the Suez Canal, the necessary complement to that policy, it seems to me, is to develop in the Pacific the trade between the Commonwealth, the United States of America, and Canada. </para>

The facts, to concentrate them shortly, are that Queensland and New South Wales pioneered the service, and paid for it for a number of years. The trade was steadily increasing. The two States were anxious that the service should be continued. Chambers of Commerce, and other representative men, again and again, pointed out that, it seemed likely that the service would be abandoned, but they were assured that they need have no fear. Finally, the service was abandoned as predicted, and has now apparently gone to the care of  His  Satanic Majesty. </para><interjection>

                        <para>- Perhaps if we could get the enemy tied up and make them browse on <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> a capitulation of their forces would speedily follow. It is generally understood, nowadays, that given well-trained officers on the one side, and ill-trained officers on the other, a war is pretty well over as soon as it is begun. It was said in connexion with the American Civil War that the officers who came out of West Point Military Academy were worth a whole army corps. I trust that the agencies used for the training of officers in our army will not be starved. I draw attention to another feature which makes me rather uneasy. The Inspector- General reports that 643 officers and 7,973 other members of the Citizen Forces attended camps for manoeuvre purposes, but that only thirty-three officers and 1,058 others, or a total of 1,091, remained during the manoeuvres. In other words, of those who went into camp only 13 per cent, took part in the manoeuvres. There may be some explanation. </para>

                        <para>- I presume that these people went into camp for training purposes. Camps, nowadays, are not supposed to be a sort of picnic. It was understood that we had abolished that sort of thing. Camps are intended to familiarize our soldiers with manoeuvring. If it is not compulsory for those who go into camp to take part in manoeuvres, the sooner we re-cast our Defence Act the better. I am sorry that the Minister of Defence is not present when we are discussing these matters. We have a right to expect him to be here. </para>

                        <para>- Why should they not? I believe that the reason I was sent here was that those who had been sent here before did not go into these things properly, and it was thought as well that a change should be made, and that some one should represent Queensland who would go pretty extensively into things. The subject I intend now to refer to is immigration. What are we doing in connexion with it? It is evident that the State Governments are doing something, but what co-operation is there between the Commonwealth and State Governments in connexion with the matter? We are voting money for advertising the resources of Australia, but the Government are not spending half the money voted for that purpose. Let me point out what other countries of the same race and similar conditions to ours are doing in the matter of immigration. From a report of the Board of Trade on "Emigration and Immigration," dated May, 1912, I take the following particulars. I find that between 1906 and 1911, the persons of British nationality who went to the United States of America numbered in 1906, 85,941 ; in 1907, 99,944 <inline font-style="italic">;</inline> in 1908, 31,451; in 1909. 56,377; in 1910, 73,569; and in 191 1, 49,732. I find also that the number of persons of British nationality who went to all foreign countries during those years was - in 1906, 194,671; in 1907, 235,092; in 1908, 91,156; in 1909, 139,693; in 1910, 233,7°9; and in 1911, 261,809. In the year 1910, the total immigration to Canada was 311,084, and the Canadian authorities estimated that in 1912 the number would be increased to 450,000. In 1910, 121,084 persons went from the United States into Canada. I believe that these people are a desirable class of settlers for Canada and the United States, and if they are going to those countries in such large numbers, why cannot Australia secure some of them. There is only one answer to the question, lt is that the Commonwealth Government do not want to get them. Australia is as attractive as any place on earth. There is no country on God's earth where a man has a better show to bring out what is in him than he has in Australia. If Canada can secure 300,000 or 400,000 immigrants in a year, and the United States of America about 1,000,000 each year, why is it that some of these people do not- come here? It is because they are not invited, or, if they are, they are not invited properly. There is only " hot air," and no more. </para>

                        <para>- That is the only " get out " that the Government have. I admit the statement right away. But the Minister of Defence knows well that when I sat on the other side supporting the last Government, I spoke just as strongly on this matter, and commented just as sharply upon their administration in connexion with immigration. The Minister is very prone in making excuses to hope that two blacks will possibly make a white. There is this answer to his interjection, that, so far as the present Government are concerned, while they have more money than any other Government of the Commonwealth has ever had for this purpose, and they can find, money to lavish on many other purposes, in the matter of immigration, which is the very life-blood of the nation, and- without which we cannot hope to ad.vance, they are entirely indifferent. We know that time and' again resolutions are passed' by various Trades Hall Councils, and1 conveyed' to us, directly or indirectly, to the effect that a policy of immigration must pui! down wages in Australia. We are told that to bring immigrants to the country at the expense of a State or of the- Commonwealth is to introduce labour which must compete with local labour, and thus bring down the wages of the working classes The present Government appear to be compelled to bow down to that delusion. In other words, they are afraid to face their masters in this- matter. We are told that the Trades Hall Councils- pass no condemnatory resolutions, and there may be some saving clauses in- many of their resolutions, but, in this matter, the Government are following, and' seem prepared to go on following, a lead that is given them, not by this. Parliament, or by the people of Australia, but by the Trade Unions. Why dd we not hear from the Prime Minister and Treasurer a refutation' of that awful economic fallacy that the increase of population in the country is a menace to the worker ? There- is no country in which wages are higher for city or rural workers to-day than they are in the United State of America and Canada. That is due to the fact that, with the increase of population, the resources, of a country are developed, capital is invested, and increased development and the investment of capital must benefit the worker to some extent. It is about time that we ceased playing with this important question. If we do not settle it very shortly, some outside nation will give us no chance of settling it, but will settle it for us in their own way. I am reminded' by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Shannonof</inline> a matter which supports my argument. When the Maternity Allowance Bill was under consideration in this Chamber, it was several times pointed out by honorable senators opposite that the Australian baby is an. asset to the country. If that be so, surely its adult population must be a more valuable asset B The reason, which was assigned by the Government and their supporters for. granting a maternity allowance was a desire, to develop' the asset which is represented by the child-life of this, coun-try. But when we; talk about the subject of immigration; we are expected to approach it with our hands encased) in velvet gloves, so to&gt; speak.. The two positions are absolutely inconsistent. If. it is desirable that we should increase the birthrate by offering a bonus of £500,000 a year, for Australian babies, why should we not expend £100,000 a year in bringing able-bodied immigrants into this country ? The- reason is that the adoption of the former course suits the book of the Government, whereas the latter does- not. </para>

                </continue><para>I note with some pleasure a remark which was made by the Prime Minister, in Sydney, the other day, in- regard to the Commonwealth note issue. It was to the effect that out of the profits of that issue money would be reserved to build up a fund' with which to deal with the State debts question. That report was published in the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> of 5th October, and- I have no reason to doubt its, accuracy. In one sense, the note issue is not a source- of profit te the people of Australia. That issue merely represents the transfer of one source of profits from the States, to the Common- wealth. From the very beginning it has been very properly contended that when the Government established a note issue the proper purpose to which to apply the profits arising from it was to build up a fund with a view to paying off the State debts. I hope that policy will be further developed. The question of the State debts must be faced, .and faced very shortly. I congratulate the Treasurer upon the beginning which he has made in that direction, small though it may be. It is the only way to deal with the profits accruing from the note issue. In this connexion I take it that the criticisms of members of the Opposition in both branches of the Legislature is having a 'beneficial effect. </para><para>I come now to some appointments in the Northern Territory. In regard to the appointment .of the Administrator, I have nothing to say against the gentleman who was selected to fill that high office.

But it is somewhat remarkable that, though there were .a large number of applications for the position, every one of .those applications was turned down. </para><interjection>

                        <para>- No. Amongst all the applicants, therefore, the Government did not consider there was one who was competent to administer the affairs of the Territory. No other conclusion can be drawn from the circumstance which I have cited. I beg to express my dissent from that view. I know of one man who has had long experience, and who is a capable and trustworthy administrator. There is no man in Australia who possesses more knowledge of the difficulties of administration in the Northern Territory than he does, and no person, in my opinion, knows better than he does how to grapple with them. He was trusted by more than one Government, and yet, at the first opportunity he had of exhibiting his ability, the Government turned him down. </para>

                        <para>- I am not expressing dissatisfaction with the appointment of Professor Gilruth, who may be one of the ablest men for the position which he fills. But I mention this matter more particularly because of the reasons which the Government assigned for turning down <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Herbert. When the Vice-President  'Of  the Executive Council was brought to book by the Leader of the Opposition over this matter, he said that in making appointments the Government necessarily had to choose officers who were in accord with their policy. I admit that there is something in that contention, which the Vice-President pressed very strongly. It was his trump card when this and other appointments in the Northern Territory were questioned. What was that policy? The leasehold principle. Then the Leader of the Opposition renewed his attack upon the Land Ordinance, which the 'Government published as embodying their land policy in the Territory. That Ordinance received such a severe hammering, not only from members of the Opposition, but from many Government supporters in the Senate, that it left this Chamber an absolute cripple, and is now laid up for repairs elsewhere. Even the supporters of the Government are anxious to get it out of the hospital, in order that they may have another go at it. So that this leasehold principle was not the settled policy of the Government, and when we were told that the appointment of Professor Gilruth was justified on the ground that he was in accord with that policy, the statement was more or less in the nature of a blind. There is another appointment in the Northern Territory which calls for some explanation/ </para>

                        <para>- It is valuable to the inspector. If there be any position of ease and dignity in the Commonwealth, it must be that of a school inspector who has only three classified teachers and two schools to look after. To me, the appointment appears to be a piece of pure political patronage, and to have had its origin in a desire to find a billet for somebody. It is idle for the Minister of Defence, or anybody else, to tell me that a school inspector is required to overlook two schools and three classified teachers. Further, the classification of a teacher carries with it the assurance that he or she is competent to discharge his or her duties. It is a further guarantee that when teachers are appointed to responsible positions they may be trusted to loyally discharge their duties. Otherwise they will not be classified. It is a maxim in modern education, even in primary schools, that the less the inspection of the school, and the more skilful the teaching, the better, and that inspection in the past, as carried out in every country, was rather a drag on the schools than a help to them. If you cannot trust your teachers, and they have not sufficient ability to carry on alone the work of education, inspection and inspectors do not enable that work to be done. I know of nothing more striking than an appointment of this kind. I should like to hear from the Minister how the Northern Territory was able to get on for so many years without a special school inspector, what extraordinary circumstances have suddenly developed to cause this appointment of an inspector at a large salary, and, in the face of the answers given to my question, what is the justification for the appointment? These appointments seem to be flung about with a reckless hand. </para>

                    <para>.- As the motion for the first reading of this Bill affords an opportunity for ventilating grievances, I wish to refer to a statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> in speaking on the Budget-papers in connexion with taxation.

                    adopted a similar line of reasoning, and implied that, as regards the imposition of land taxation, we on this side generally are more timid when we are in possession of the Treasury bench than we are when we are asking the electors to return us. There are many points in
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart's</inline>
                    remarks, with which I very cordially agree. But during the course of his speech he implied, perhaps unintentionally, that our land tax has not been effective in bringing about what we, on this side, desired ; that is subdivision or the breaking up of land monopoly in Australia. I do not think that any honorable senator on this side would claim for a moment that, in the short time in which it has been in force, the land tax has done all that we require of it. I am sure that no one on this side will claim that it is, by any means, perfect. But we do claim, and, what is more, we have the figures to back up the claim, that it has done more for closer settlement in Australia than has any measure passed at the 'instance of a State or Federal party since we have been a self-governing nation.
                </para>
                <para>Honorable senators, on the other side, are very fond of implying that our Land Tax Act has not been a success, and. probably, they will tell the people so. But let me show as briefly as possible what the land tax has accomplished already. Let me put the position in a nut-shell. In the Commonwealth to-day 12,988 resident land-holders and 2,283 absentee land-holders, or 15,271 persons in all, are contributing £1,366,000 to the revenue. Last year they contributed according to <inline font-style="italic">Knibbs</inline> £1,370,357, or, in all they have contributed about £2,750,000. The unimproved value of the land of Australia liable to that tax is £178,446,698, and after deducting the exemption the taxable value is £115,641,772, so that the average yield per £1 of taxable value is just 3d. We have instituted a tax which has an average incidence of 3d. per £1 on the taxable value. When we study the result of this taxation we find that it has not been altogether valueless, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> implied, but has had a very great effect in causing the subdivision of many estates. </para>

                        <para>- From working out the figures given in the report of the Commissioner, and from supplemental figures which I obtained from the Land Tax office. I find that, in addition, there were 14,414 purchasers of subdivided estates with an average value of £620. That is a small holding in every sense of the word. During the first year's operation of the land tax £21,000,000 worth of big holdings was cut up and disposed of by their owners. That is not a bad record to point to. Seeing that during the first year of its operation our land tax has done more to encourage closer settlement than has been accomplished by all the efforts of the State Governments, surely we can point with pride to something achieved by the imposition of the tax? </para>

                        <para>- That is so. Let me put the result pithily; 12,000,000 acres of land have been brought into cultivation in Australia, and of that area 1,000,000 acres have been brought into cultivation during the past two years, showing that the economic incidence of our land tax has had a very remarkable effect. During the first year of its operation the large estates in Australia decreased from  15,013 to 14,352. That is not a bad effect so far. Let me now briefly state what has been done in Tasmania. It is only a small State, but naturally it is the one with which I am best acquainted. We have 342 resident taxpayers and 142  absentee taxpayers, or 484 altogether. Those people pay a total tax of £32,662, or an average per head of about £68. I shall deal now with the efforts made by the Tasmanian State Government to' promote closer settlement. I find that after five years of the policy of subdivision of big estates the Government of Tasmania have purchased 34,441 acres. </para>

                        <para>- I do not believe in the system alone. I want to show how much better is the system which we have adopted, and how much more it has achieved within a comparatively shorter time. The value of the 34,000 acres was £98,142. Taking off about £28,000 for improvements, you get, in five years, £70,000 worth of unimproved land made available for closer settlement. Now take the operation of the Federal land tax for a period of only twelve months. I find from the Commissioner's report that in Tasmania there were 298 sales of land owned by Federal taxpayers, amounting in value to £355,676. The same taxpayers only purchased 105 lots, amounting to £203,839 in value. So that really £101,737 worth of land was subdivided and sold by Federal taxpayers. I presume that a fair proportion of this land was used for closer settlement, inasmuch as it was sold in lots under the £5,000 exemption. That contrasts in a remarkable manner with the amount of land made available for closer settlement in the previous five years under Tasmanian administration. That alone is ample justification for our policy. We can point with pride to something achieved as far as even Tasmania is concerned. The estates in Tasmania, however, are comparatively smaller than those on the mainland. </para>

                        <para>- That is the Van Diemen's Land Company's estate. As a matter of fact, I am pleased to say that the Van Diemen's Land Company will not be paying £7,000 a year in Federal land tax very long, because the company is selling out very largely, with the result that the beautiful land on the north-west coast of Tasmania is being made available for settlement. In New South Wales there is one estate which pays £24,000 a year in Federal land tax ; another pays £16,000, and a third £13,000. In South Australia there is one estate which pays £18,000 a year in Federal land tax. So that our largest Tasmanian estate is comparatively small compared with the estates on the mainland. I do not believe that the system pursued by some States of purchasing land will ever achieve the best results. In Tasmania estates bought for closer settlement have, in some cases, commenced to re-aggregate within a few years into the hands of the very people who were connected with them before they were subdivided. The futility of the policy of land purchase is shown by a statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Ward in reference to the policy of the New Zealand Government. He said - </para>

                <para class="block">The Federal land tax has, within nine months, settled about four times the number of people who have been settled by land purchase in New Zealand in twenty-two years. So that, from all points of view, I think that any one who looks carefully into the figures will agree that our land tax has, at all events, partly achieved the results that were expected from it. Some of our critics will naturally attribute the increased production of Australia to the good seasons. They attribute most of the 'good effects of our policy to the good seasons. </para>

                        <para>- No, the figures are quite clear ;I will hand them to the honorable senator. The production of wool has increased from 642,0000,000 lbs. to 792,000,000 lbs. The production of butter has increased by £1,585,000; the fruit production from £2,844,000, in 1909., to £3,945,000, in. 1911. I think it can fairly be claimed, therefore, that the tax has undoubtedly stimulated production. If the figures are studied, it will be seen at once that the increase has been most marked during the two years since the land tax has been imposed. </para>

                        <para>- Unfortunately, I am already heavily taxed on my block. I favour making the graduation extend up to1s. in the £1, and shall be at all times prepared to make it go to that amount in the higher incidences of the tax. There are some estates in Australia that it would certainly be to the best interests of the country to cut up, and I believe that the only way of checking their growth is by making our taxation heavier on the larger values. I find from the Land Tax Commissioner's report that there are 146 landholders holding over £100,000 worth of land. One of them owns more than £1,000,000 worth. </para>

                        <para>- No ; but I could give some striking illustrations as to how some people in Tasmania got their land. It is not in the interests of this country that any one man should own £100,000 worth of land.. Nor do I believe that any man can have acquired such an estate fairly. It is too large an area for one man to have acquired by fair means. Therefore, I would deal with such land-holders as severely as possible by making the tax run up to1s. in the £1. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator's party would be ready enough to, shoot down strikers, but I am sure that they would object to treat large land-holders in that way. I would not only increase the tax to is. in the £i on the very large estates, but would make the tax stiffer on estates of medium size. When the Land Tax Bill was introduced, we heard some violent speeches from our honorable friends opposite. The tax was described as robbery, confiscation, and plunder; and ruin was prophesied as the result of it. </para>

                        <para>- Let us consider the facts. It is interesting to ascertain how many applications were made for the remission of the tax on the ground that it pressed hardly and cruelly upon those called upon to pay it. In section 66, I think it was, of the Act, we made provision that where a land-owner might be ruined or crippled by the tax, he should "be at liberty to apply for its remission. The matter was to be dealt with privately, and no public fuss was to be made about it. </para>

                        <para>- I should be pleased to pay double that amount of land tax if I owned land of that value. In spite of the frenzied prophecies of our honorable friends opposite that the tax would be ruinous and confiscatory, we believed that the land-owners would be able to pay it. </para>

                        <para>- Possibly it would; and in my opinion that is the only step to take to bring about the subdivision of the very big estates. Land-holders who keep out of use so large an area of land commit an act which, in my opinion, should not be tolerated in an up-to-date civilized country like Australia. Honorable senators on this side, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> possibly amongst them, believe that the tax on the medium-sized estates is not heavy enough. I confess to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> that, so far as Tasmania is concerned, my observation, and that of others who have been watching the operation of the land tax, shows that it has failed to cause the subdivision of some estates, because it is not heavy enough. For instance, an estate of the unimproved value of £6,000 pays only £4 6s. 2d. One worth £10,000 pays £24 6s. id; £20,000, £93 15s.; £25,000, £140; and an estate of the unimproved value of £40,000, which would be a very big estate in Tasmania, pays a land tax of only £315. In Tasmania, the bulk of what we call the big estates range in unimproved value from £10,000 to £25,000. Added to the State land tax of1d. to 2½d. in the £1, our Federal land tax is so low that our land-owners are able to pay it and laugh at the efforts of &lt; the Commonwealth, by means of the tax, ' to secure the subdivision of their estates. </para>

                        <para>- That may be due to a combination of the banks. We require more money, and I believe that legitimate avenues for obtaining it by direct taxation are still available. I find from statistics issued by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs</inline> that, apart from land, there is an avenue of direct taxation which we have not yet touched. I am not speaking for the Labour party in this matter, as I have no right to do so. I am voicing my own personal opinion. I find that there are 9,257 persons in Australia with incomes of over £1,000 a year, and aggregating £30,000,000. There are 5,001 persons with incomes of over £1,500 a year, aggregating £25,000,000. There are 3,536 persons with incomes of over £2,000 a year, aggregating £22,000,000. I say that if the Government, in their wisdom, though fit to introduce a super-tax on unearned incomes of over £1,000 a year, I should be found heartily voting with them. </para>

                        <para>- I suppose that he would pale into insignificance beside the honorable senator. I say that I voice my own opinion in this matter, and not those of the party. I believe that we are wrongly exempting mortgagees from taxation. We ought to deal with them under our Land Tax Act. I believe that we need more money, and we need not borrow it if we still go on taxing wealth. I regard the medium-sized estates as still representing a legitimate source of increased revenue. I desire to see the land tax operate more quickly in bringing about the subdivision of estates. </para>

There is no doubt that many of the estates were secured by, to use the words of my honorable friends opposite, plunder, confiscation, and robbery. That is a strong statement, but it can be substantiated. Of  6,000,000.  acres of land alienated in Tasmania,  2,000,000  were obtained for nothing. </para>

                        <para>- It is, if we give away what we have no right to give away. So far as Tasmania is concerned, I recommend honorable senators opposite to read up its history. They may secure an ancient volume, published in  1835,  by Henry Melville, the editor of the <inline font-style="italic">Hobart Town Almanac.</inline> He was sent to gaol for twelve months by Governor Arthur for writing it, because he exposed the abuses of the time. Everything he said was subsequently justified by other writers. If honorable senators will read that book, they will find that the greater portion of. the fertile areas of Tasmania were handed over to land robbers, whose descendants now occupy them and enjoy their benefits. An edict was sent out by the Imperial authorities to the effect that no land exceeding  2,900  acres in extent, should be given to any one by means of a Government grant. In spite of that edict, during the <inline font-style="italic">regime</inline> of Governor Arthur, some families in Tasmania secured over  100,000  acres for nothing. </para>

I may tell the honorable senator that I have in my possession a letter from one of the descendants of persons who obtained an extensive free grant of land whilst this edict was in existence. Even Governor Arthur himself grabbed a good many thousands of acres of the best lands in Tasmania, in addition to making indiscriminate grants to all his toadies and crawlers. </para>

                <para>Your letter as to breaking in horses has been received by me, and in reply I beg to state that I think if you took my horses to break in you would make a mistake, and if I let my horses go to you I would make a mistake. In the first place, the horses are mine - the property of one of those "hateful men" (as you and your party express it) who are called Liberals. In the second place-, the sires and dams of each of them belong to Liberals. In the third place, they are fed on pastures grown on land owned by Liberals, but which land the party you belong to are trying to deprive us of. In the fourth place, your party believes in eight hours for a day's work. If you broke my horses in to that custom we should some night find ourselves stranded some miles away from home on a pouring wet night. In the fifth place, these young horses might be taught to Believe in " preference to unionists," and treat my other horses in the same way as non-union men had been treated by union men - " Join our union or starve" - and sometimes, following the example of some of the party you represent, kick and assault and batter my other horses: Or perhaps, when my harvest is just ready to cut (as the horse is a very observant animal) they might all strike. I thank you for your application, but I think you will agree with me that were you in, my place you would hardly risk such a contingency. </para>

                        <para>- When the applicant received that reply, he handed it to me-. I think it is rather clever; but I say. it is a direct insult to the man who asked for work. When he received that communication he naturally felt hurt about it, particularly as the land about which . <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Archer</inline> boasts is probably a part of the very extensive free grant which was made to the family in the early days of Tasmania. If honorable senators will turn to Henry Melville's <inline font-style="italic">History of Van Diemen'* Land,</inline> they will find that, notwithstanding the Ordinance which forbade grants being made in excess of 2,000 acres, the Archer family received a Crown, grant of 70,000 acres for nothing. Yet when a working man applied to a descendant of the family for employment, that descendant talked about his liberal horses and his liberal land. The best part of the land in Tasmania has been "peacocked" in this way. In passing, I may add that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Melville,</inline> in the very interesting volume which I have mentioned, advocated the single-tax as far back as 1835 - before the time of Henry George. He contended that all revenue in Tasmania should be raised from quit rents, which should be re-appraised at regular periods, and that such quit rents should be applied wholly to governmental purposes. He pointed out that in twenty-five years these quit rents would suffice to defray the cost of all the Government services of that State. And this is the man whom the authorities gaoled. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, and very interesting articles they are. We have also to recollect that in Tasmania what was. known as the " Scotch Thousand " was operated' for many years. Whenever a man arrived in that State with £1,000 he obtained a free land grant from' the Crown. The head of one of the foremost families of Tasmania, who possessed £1,000. promptly went to the Government and received a grant of so many thousand acres. Afterwards, he passed the money on to his relatives, who each in turn took the bankbook to the Government to show that they possessed the required £1,000, and were each granted some thousands of acres. In this way they obtained 200,000 acres of the best land in Tasmania. </para>

                        <para>- I am dealing with the way in which land was obtained in Tasmania. As a matter of fact, there were in Hobart, in 1835, money-lenders who were prepared to" advance a couple of hundred pounds to any person who could not too readily clear out, to enable him to go to the Government and work the " Scotch Thousand " wrinkle. The authorities winked at this practice, which continued for years. During that time they brought out immigrants to Tasmania- </para>

                        <para>- I prefer to deal with this matter in my own way. In those days immigrants were brought to Tasmania, but unless they had friends at court they could not get their grants of land surveyed. The result was that the big land-holders used to acquire these grants from them for the sum of £20 or £30, and even less, and the areas covered by those grants were added to their already large holdings. That is the way in which a good deal of the land in Tasmania was obtained. </para>

After we return from' the elections - and I am satisfied that the members of the Labour party in this Senate will return here - one of the first questions which we shall have to face is that of making the middle gradations of the land tax heavier than they are at the present time. </para>

                        <para>- -No. I would point out that there is a principle of unimproved land values taxation which favours the big man. We have been told by political economists that land values taxation acts equitably in the case of small and large holdings alike. That is a fetish which many have come to believe. As a matter of fact, the principle operates to the detriment of the small estates, and to the advantage of the large estates. </para>

                        <para>- Our definition of " unimproved value," and also the definition of that term which has been adopted by many of the State Parliaments, is based upon the selling value of lands. If there are two blocks of land side by side, and each is of equal value from the standpoint of situation, soil, &amp;c, many persons assume that if one block, which contains  10  acres, is worth £10 per acre, the other block, which contains thousands of acres, must also be worth £10 per acre. Under the definition of unimproved basis adopted by both this Government and the Tasmanian Government - that is the selling value - that is not so. A small piece that is worth  £10  an acre will sell for that price. A large piece, if subdivided into10-acre blocks, might sell at £10 an acre, but, sold in the aggregate, it might fetch only £8 an acre, and, therefore, it would be assessed at £8, and the small man, through having a small holding, would thereby be penalized. I advance that fact, which must be well known to many honorable senators, as an additional reason why we should increase the taxation on the bigger estates. Our Government, with their customary fairness in spite of the great excitement which has been worked up from the other side in connexion with certain appointments- </para>

                        <para>- I know of one very shocking appointment, and that is the appointment of a Liberal ex-member of the Tasmanian Assembly as a valuator. Judging by the way in which he has valued lands which have been brought under my notice, and the opinions which have been expressed by persons more competent than myself, this Liberal ex-member of the Assembly has been very favorably inclined in his valuations towards big estates. I expect that his appointment, which I suppose my honorable friends opposite must regard as a partisan one, will result in a considerable amount of trouble. </para>

In the State Assembly, he said that he had a great deal of fault to find with the State valuation of his estates. I may mention here that a new State valuation has just been made on the same definition of unimproved value as is contained in the Federal Act, because the two are very similar in that regard. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Norman</inline> Cameron told the House of Assembly that the State valuator had assessed his land at . £33,000 unimproved, and that the Federal valuator had assessed it on the same basis at£19,000. </para>

If such a condition should continue in Tasmania, particularly under the gentleman who has valued this property, there will be room for a searching inquiry as to the methods of valuation. I called upon <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. P.</inline> C. Douglas, the  Deputy  Commissioner - a very capable officer, who, no doubt, thoroughly understands land values - and he is going into this case. I believe that the instance quoted by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Norman</inline> Cameron could be multiplied if one liked to look round Tasmania, and take notice of the Federal valuations. That, again, is an additional reason why we should increase our graduation. I believe that if this kind of thing is allowed to go on, our land tax will not be effective in Tasmania, and we shall not be able to ' secure what we promised the people when it was imposed, and that is the subdivision of many of these estates. </para><para>I should like the Minister representing the Postmaster-General to take a note of the objection which is urged in Tasmania, and I think in other States, to the present system of allowing the municipal council to decide whether- a small-allowance postmaster shall have a half-holiday or not. It may have been the best method which the postal authorities could devise for obtaining an indication of local opinion, but it is one which is very seriously open to condemnation and criticism. Every honorable senator will, I am sure, admit that these allowance post-offices are a continual source of pin-pricking and worry. I have found in several instances that, while the people of the district were quite willing that a small-allowance postmaster receiving <inline font-style="italic">£*°&gt; £J5&gt; £2°&gt; °r £25</inline> a Year should be allowed to have a half-holiday every week, some of the local councillors, particularly those who represented the ward in which the post-office was situated, refused to give their permission to the postmaster to close it. </para><para>I know of one instance where a woman who lives in a very small place on the Tamar is unable to get to Launceston to do her shopping for the simple reason that she has to be at her allowance post-office every day. At the instance of the " Great I Am " of the municipal council, who is, like a number of other authorities, dressed with a little brief authority, that body has refused to give this poor woman a half-holiday. A similar instance was recently brought under my notice. All the residents of the locality desired that the allowance postmaster should get a half-holiday. The matter was brought before the municipal council, and in a high-handed way its consent was refused. I happened to be in the locality. </para><interjection>

I, for one, feel rather surprised at the thought that, after all this trouble on the part of the residents and myself, the Deputy Postmaster-General who, I understood, would recommend the request to the central authorities, sent it back to the municipal council, and asked the advice of that august body. I think that if it can be shown clearly that the people of a hamlet want their postmaster  to have a half -holiday - and surely a petition signed by a majority of them does show that - there should be no bar in the way of them getting their request acceded to as speedily as possible. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. I understood from the  Deputy  Postmaster-General that if a petition were sent in for the closing of the office on the weekly half-holiday he would recommend that the prayer be granted, but he merely sent the petition back to the municipal council, and there is an end of the matter. The name of the place I may mention is Gravelly Beach, on the Tamar. I believe that a system could be inaugurated whereby a majority of the people in a hamlet would be in a position by means of a petition to secure their desire at once, and so enable the postmaster who is getting what is merely a pittance to enjoy the benefit of a weekly halfholiday. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not propose to even make a pretence of following <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> through some of the strange economic windings in which he has been travelling for the last half-hour. But I do want to direct his attention to the great advantage which underlies such a casual attention as he has been paying to certain figures in the little pamphlet which he has handed to me, and I do this in the hope that he will not repeat outside the very grievous error into which he has clearly fallen here. I am rather pleased that I am able to save him a certain repetition of the mistake. He quoted certain figures, and I think he will agree with me when I say that he quoted them to show that there has been a considerable increase in cultivation and production since the Federal land tax was imposed. </para>

It is shown in the pamphlet which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> has handed to me mat, in the year19089that is to say, a year before this Government came into office - the increase in the area under crop was over 1,000,000 acres. </para>

                        <para>- No, in the Commonwealth, though <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> spoke of Tasmania as though it were the whole Commonwealth. In the year 1909-10 the increase had fallen to 900,000 acres, whilst in the year 191 1- 12 - the first year the land tax was in operation - the increase fell to 211,000 acres. So that, in the year before the Government took office, there was an increase of 1,000,000; in the first year they were in office the increase was 900,000; and in the first year of the operation of the land tax the increase fell to 211,000. This shows with what ease <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> can misunderstand figures. I come now to the matter of sheep, to which, also, he drew attention. I do not take the value of wool in this regard, because the price of wool 'has a habit of rising and falling. I take the number of sheep; and I find that from 1901 to 1907 - a period of six years - the average increase was 2,600,000. </para>

                        <para>- Of course the honorable senator did not. He evidently knows enough about figures to refrain from quoting those that do not suit his case. The figures as to cattle tell exactly the same tale. The increase of stock in Australia for the first year under the land tax was less than for the preceding years. </para>

                        <para>- Let me deal with one thing at a time. I turn to' another instructive statement in the same pamphlet. I find a table setting out the value of our agricultural products. I submit that if the land tax is operative at all, it must make its effect felt more powerfully with regard to agricultural production than as to any other form of production associated with land. The very purpose of the land tax, according to its advocates, was to turn land from sheep to  the  plough. We have a  Eight  to see what has been the net result of the tax, if it has  had  any effect at all, upon agricultural production. The fact is that the agricultural production of Australia has fallen from £41,000,000 in, 1909, to £39,750,000 in 1910. </para>

                        <para>- Only yesterday, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce's</inline> colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> at a gathering at which we were both present, twitted those who put forward the argument that Providence has been a great factor in the progress that has been made in this country. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> discounted Providence in the matter. He said, " You have had Providence all. the time, and this progress did not take place; it is only now, when you have the Labour party in power, that you ascribe the prosperity to Providence.." I thought Providence would never dare to raise its head again after that statement. While I listened with all the satisfaction in the world to that declaration yesterday, I point out that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> is again trying to reinstate the 'Providence which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> only a few hours ago, successfully destroyed. Let the Government make up their minds as to whether they are going to enter into an alliance with Providence or not, but I object to their calling Providence to their aid on one occasion, and scurvily kicking Providence out of doors the next. </para>

                        <para>- I have taken the pamphlet which the honorable senator handed to me, and from which he quoted. It shows that there has been, in the year in which the land tax has been operating, only an increase in the total area under crop of 211,207 acres for the whole of Australia, whereas, in the two years before, the increase was over 2,000,000 acres in extent. Although I admit, even there, that the seasons may have an effect upon the acreage put under crop. </para>

                        <para>- The' recent increases cannot be said to be the result of a revaluation which is admitted to be not complete. I turn to another matter, in which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> has served a very useful purpose. Speaking only for himself, he has rendered a service to the people of this country, and has done something to which he is entitled to credit, more particularly as he is a young member of Parliament. He has held up a warning hand to the electors in the references which he has made to increased taxation.  His  remarks, to be understood, must be taken in conjunction with a statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> during the debate on the Budget-papers. He has pointed out that he himself believes that the Commonwealth ought to 'levy tribute or toll upon the larger incomes earned in this country. In other words, he spoke in favour of an income tax. </para>

                        <para>- I am coming to that. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> expressed a willingness to go up to great altitudes, indeed, in the matter of land taxation. I forget whether he said that he was willing to tax land up to 5s.  in the £i, or up to £i in the 5s.; but apparently there are no limits which would frighten him. With regard to income tax, he went on to say that the larger incomes, which appeared to be particularly attractive and alluring to him, should bear additional taxation. He was even engaging enough to indicate the source to which he would resort, and ranged himself alongside <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd-George</inline> - much, no doubt, to the satisfaction of that gentleman. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> speaking not long ago, defended the action of the Government in reference to the expenditure disclosed by the Budget, and argued that, the Government having the money, either from revenue flowing into the Treasury or from the Trust Fund, were justified in spending it. He added that within the next year or two, if expenditure continued at the same rate, the Government would find that only certain courses were open to them. One was that the Government would have to face the problem of additional taxation. . That is where the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> fit in with those of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce. Senator Pearce</inline> indicated clearly that if the present rate of expenditure is to continue in the next financial year, we shall have to face the problem of additional taxation; and we now have <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> indicating the source from which, in his opinion, that additional taxation should be raised. There is a prospect of additional taxation clearly indicated by the Budget-papers, and to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has directed attention, and now we have a member of the party opposite indicating the means by which it could be raised. </para>

They may be the honorable senator's opinions, and remain so until the party adopt them, but he is not the only member of the party who has expressed the same views.  His  views were frankly and openly applauded by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart.</inline></para>

                        <para>- Perhaps the Minister will do me the courtesy of turning up what he did say. Tn some language or other, the honorable senator pointed out that next year, if the present rate of expenditure be continued, the Government will be faced with the problem of additional taxation. No man can study our national balance-sheet without coming to the same conclusion. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> does not stand alone in arriving at that conclusion. I make the statement now, if the honorable senator does not care to make it. We are, this year, spending £2,250,000 more than is coming into the Treasury. If that rate of expenditure is maintained next year, and assuming that the revenue will be no greater - and the Treasurer anticipates that it will be less - it is quite clear that we shall, next year, be faced with a deficit of  £2,250.000,  or we must raise that amount by additional taxation. It cannot be too frequently emphasized that we are not, this year, living within our income. There would be a deficit in this year's national balance-sheet but for the fact that we are drawing upon the surpluses of previous years. </para>

                <para>Turning for a moment to other matters, it might be as well to recall the fact that there is a Supply Bill before us. We have been told by the Vice-President of the Executive Council that it provides for three months' Supply on a normal basis of the year's expenditure. I wish to do no more than point out that there is no justification for introducing this measure, and suspending the Standing Orders in order to carry it through at one sitting. I ask honorable senators to consider the business with which the Senate has been engaged at any time since the first of this month. Let me take it for granted that the Bill proposes the appropriation of an amount equal to one-fourth of the year's expenditure at a normal rate. It is quite obvious that every item in the Bill is to be found in the Estimates presented weeks ago with the Budget-papers. The clerks in the Treasurer's Department had only to divide the several items of the Estimates by four to discover what would be required for three months' Supply, and that information could have been available to honorable senators at least a fortnight ago. There was no business in the Senate, or in another place, to prevent us having a fair and reasonable opportunity to consider the proposals in this Bill. I am sorry to say that the practice is becoming established of introducing these Supply Bills at a time when it is absolutely impossible for any one to look into them, or to get information upon the various items, unless by continuing the sitting indefinitely into the night. The Senate appears to have agreed to accept it as inevitable that the Government should bring forward these Supply Bills with the intention of carrying them through at one sitting. I am satisfied that the practice is followed with the one object of denying to Parliament a fair and full opportunity of getting the information to which it is entitled, and of considering the sums it is asked to appropriate. It is not possible in regard to any single item in this Bill to know how the expenditure proposed compares with that for last year. If we compare the items in this Bill with those set out in the Estimates-in-Chief , we can do so. But I ask honorable senators to say whether it is possible, during the time the Bill will be before the Senate, to compare the different items with the Estimates, in order to see whether there are any differences between them calling for examination and inquiry. It appears to me that honorable senators behind the Government are quite satisfied, and so long as the Government say that they want the money, they are prepared to vote it. In the circumstances, we might just as well dispense with these periodical Supply Bills, let the Government take what money they want, and adopt some other method for the discussion of grievances. </para>

                        <para>- I am not complaining about the freedom of debate, but of the absolute impossibility of the Senate exercising any control over public expenditure proposed in a Bill which was presented here only an hour or two ago, and which the Government intend to carry through at this sitting. If there were any necessity for that, I should not complain, but I do not hesitate to say that the Treasury officials had all the information available, and ready to be printed, over a fortnight ago. What I am complaining of is done systematically, with the object of denying to honorable senators a proper opportunity for the careful examination of the various items contained in the Bill. It is brought forward at this stage deliberately for that purpose. Ministers will say that if we require any information they will give it, but we have no opportunity to study the Bill in order to see what information is* required. It would be just as well to pass the measure without any pretence of going &lt; through the items. I direct attention to one rather curious fact. The first Supply Bill passed this year was for one month, and the amount appropriated was  £882,000.  Even the moderation of the </para>

This  UL11,  therefore, should propose the appropriation of three times 'the -.amount asked for in the monthly Supply Bill, or £.2,648,000. But .the Government ask for £400,000 Jess than that amount. We were told that the amount asked for in the -first monthly Supply Bill represented, on :a normal (basis, one-twelfth of the -amount that would be required for the whole year. If that were so,  1  wish to know how it is that the amount asked for in this three months' Supply Bill is £400,000 less than three times the amount asked for in the first Supply Bill for one month? </para>

He makes a similar statement in connexion with this Bill for three months' Supply, and if he is correct, the amount asked for now should be .three -times the .amount asked for in the first Supply Bill submitted, this year. </para>

                        <para>- I can claim for the Government of which I had the honour to be a member that they introduced at least two reforms in the Senate. One that 'is being continued was by a motion for the printing of the Budget-papers to give honorable senators an opportunity to discuss the finances of the Commonwealth, which we never had before. Further, I may say that in regard to the Budget-papers, we gave more time, even though under greater pressure, for their discussion than has been given this session by the present Government. </para>

In- the meantime, I have had an opportunity of looking at the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report of the speech which was made in this Chamber by the Minister of Defence last week.. As I merely desire to quote his utterance correctly, I propose to give his exact words in order to show honorable senators that  my  presentation of his statement was substantially correct.

                        <para>- It may be absolutely foolish to establish a Government factory, but, when once the plant to run it has been provided, it is quite another proposition to abolish it. Take, for instance the bank which the Government have established. Much as I opposed it, an entirely different position arises after it has been started. Men have deposits there, and others have secured overdrafts from it. </para>

                    <para>. - The Leader of the Opposition has challenged certain figures which were given by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready,</inline> or, rather, he has put forward figures which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> did not use, and challenged them. In. order to supplement the figures which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> did use, and which supplied a complete answer to the question of whether or not the land tax has been effective, I would refer <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> to page 111 of the Budget-papers. I would particularly draw his attention to the area under our principal crops from 1903-4 to 1911-12. He will there find that, from 1903-4 to 1908-9, the area under these crops was practically stationary. It varied from 9,301,785 acres in 1903-4 to 9,891,243 acres in 1908-9 - a variation in six years of about 590,000 acres. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. The year 1908-9 was a 12-bushel year. In 1909-10 the Labour Government came into office. In that year the area under our chief Australian crops was 10,972,299 acres. During the first year of their advent to power the Government brought forward the progressive land tax. In 1910-11, during the whole of which year the shadow of that tax was looming over the big land-holders, the area under our chief crops increased to 11,893,838 acres - a greater increase than took place during the whole six years preceding 1909-10. </para>

In 1910-11 the area under our principal crops was 11,893,838 acres - a gain of nearly 1,000,000 acres. In 1911-12 the area under those crops was 12,105,125 acres - an increase of another 500,000 acres. </para>

                        <para>- To show how wrong is the basis upon which the honorable senator wanted to argue one has merely to divide the Australian wheat production by the area under wheat cultivation during the years 1908-9 and 1911-12. It will be seen that during 1908-9 the average yield was over 12 bushels per acre, whereas in 1911-12 the average was only 9$ bushels per acre. To show whether the land tax has had any effect I wish to refer honorable senators to page 24 of the first annual report of the Commissioner of Land Tax, on the Land Tax Assessment Act. The Commissioner says - </para>

                    <para>This return throws some light on the effect  of  the tax in bringing about the subdivision of large estates. Through the inspection  of  contracts of sale produced by sellers of land in support of claims to be divested of taxable ownership at 30th June,  1910,  the Department is aware that immediately prior to the date named many land-owners, in anticipation of the imposition of tax, sold largely. .In the period between June and September the concession of separate taxation of the areas, made the subject of sale, was given by law. In this period land to the value of ^,'2,712,775 was sold by taxpayers, and the land thus sold was not aggregated with the remaining estate of ' the taxpayers. </para>

                    <para>This return throws additional light upon the effect of the tax on land ownership. It shows that taxpayers sold more than ^18,000,000 worth of land in 18,288 separate transactions, and other taxpayers, or, in some instances, the same taxpayers, bought over ,£9,000,000 worth of land in 2,874 transactions. </para>
                    <para>This indicates a substantial subdivisional movement as  a  result of the tax, and the purchases by taxpayers show that the fact that the tax has to be paid has not deterred many from increasing their holdings. It is probable that there will be a reduction in amount of tax in the ensuing year as a consequence of the change of ownership. As  a  rule those who have relieved themselves of tax are the taxpayers who are subject to the higher scales - </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has stated that, while our progressive land tax may, for the purpose of argument, be taken to have had the effect of bringing more estates into use, it has not had the effect of reducing land values generally. There is a certain amount of truth in his statement. I ask honorable senators for South Australia to take their minds back to a practical instance, where, by the subdivision of an estate, the land values were not reduced, but probably have actually been raised. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, it was. Take the well-known Yongala Estate, near which I lived for many years. The value of that land after subdivision was infinitely greater than its value a year or two prior to that event, for the very reason which causes land to have any value at all. In other words, where there used to be one settler and a number of sheep and cattle, there are now some hundreds of settlers and many more sheep and cattle, and, consequently, the land in the district has gone up in value. </para>

The total number was  8,616;  and on the day on which the General made his visit, there were  1,091  remaining in camp. That is about  12  per cent. Let me now refer to the point the honorable senator made about the Inspector-General commenting on the radical re-organization required in the Ordnance Department. That is an absolute fact which cannot be gainsaid, but we are taking action. We propose to ask the </para>

                        <para>- With ordnance stores generally. It is a Department in which money can be wasted more quickly than in any other Department. Prior to Federation, the States had six different systems. In some States, it was purely a. Public Service Department, dealt with by a layman; in other States, it was purely a Military Department dealt with by a soldier; whilst in other States it was a mixed Department. The Commonwealth continued the systems of the States, and when a public servant dropped out, a public servant was put in his place, and a soldier was replaced with a soldier. This method did all right while we had simply Militia Forces; but when we began to introduce the new system, we soon realized how .such a mixed Department must come to grief.- We have now reached a stage when a radical re-organization is absolutely necessary. We are in communication with the War Office, .and the name of an officer is shortly to 'be submitted to us. It is proposed to ask him, when he comes here, to lay down the lines on which the Ordnance Department should be reorganized, and action will be taken on his report. It is obviously impossible to re-organize the Department without proper advice. There is no more intricate Or difficult Department to deal with in the whole of the Defence Service. Therefore, we need the .advice of men who know bow the Department ought to be run. It is no reflection upon our own officers to say that they have not the necessary experience. We have not had a properly equipped Ordnance Department yet. Of course, we shall have to do the best we can until we can secure proper advice, and then it will be for the Government to take the ball by the horns and do what is proposed. Undoubtedly, what is proposed will be in the nature of a radical alteration. But, until that is done, things will not be entirely satisfactory. </para>

In regard to defence, I wonder whether the Government have thought of the wisdom of providing a fund from which to replace the vessels of our Fleet as they become obsolete. .An annual amount ought to be set aside, so that we may be able to purchase new war vessels without a tremendous amount of additional taxation, if they are to be paid for out of the annual revenue. </para>

                        <para>- I was in hopes that more would be said about a residence for the Governor-General in Sydney. 1 take it that the New South Wales Government are more to blame in the matter than the Federal Government, though our own Government have had an opportunity of rectifying a very serious mistake. To judge from the way some parliamentary people in Sydney speak, one would think that the Governor-General ought to live only in the Federal Territory. I take it that he ought to have a choice of three residences, one in the Federal Territory, a second in Sydney, and a third in Melbourne. Apparently the New South Wales Government want the Federal Government to pay a rent of  £3,500  a year for Government House, Sydney, and  10  to  12  acres of land. I think that, as a business matter, the Federal Government would be justified in acquiring Government House, with  12  acres of land. On the basis of a rental of  £3,500  a year, they could probably obtain the property for  £100,000.  When we have erected a residence for the Governor- General in the Federal Territory, if Parliament saw fit to abandon the residence in Sydney they would find that the investment had been a very profitable one. </para>

                        <para>- Let me contrast what took place in  1900  with what has taken place in  1912.  As soon as the Commonwealth Constitution Act was passed by the Imperial Parliament, the New South Wales Parliament passed an Act by which that State undertook to contribute annually towards an additional  £10,000  to be paid to the Governor-General, making his total salary  £20,000  a year, an amount similar to that paid at that time to the Governor-General of Canada and the Governor-General of India. The other States did not fall into line, but if they had done, the proportion paid by New South Wales would have been  £3,600  a year on the basis of the present Commonwealth population. Yet the New South Wales Government now object to the Governor-General occupying in Sydney a residence valued by them at a rental of  £3,500.  I consider that the Labour. Government in that State have disgraced their position. Let me remind the Senate of what happens in the little island of Ceylon. The island has an area of25,332 square miles, and in  1901  its population was  3,578,000.  Its present estimated population is  4,294,000.  In Australia we have a population of  4.500,000.  Ceylon gives her Governor three residences, one in Colombo, a second in Kandy, and a third in Newara  Eliya. There is evidenced a difference between an Imperially-governed Colony and Australia. </para>

                        <para>- The climate in Melbourne has been very trying during the last few days. I do not think that the salary of  £10,000  a year which we pay to the Governor-General is sufficient. There are many private persons who, to my own knowledge, have larger incomes than that. The Governor-General has to travel around Australia, taking a suite with him, and his hand is continually in his pocket. The Commonwealth pays  £4,000  a year to the Governor of its Bank, though the largest and oldest bank in Australia only pays  £4,000  a year to its general manager, who, moreover, does not get four guineas a day for travelling expenses. We pay the Governor of our Bank a larger salary than we pay to the Chief Justice of Australia. </para>

I had the pleasure of cooperating with him. I have not been so fortunate on my own account. I brought in a Bill nearly three years ago,  and it passed through the Senate. It was brought in again this session, and went to another place. Now we learn that all private members' business has been set aside. There seems to be no chance for a man with special knowledge to get a Bill passed. I shall not have the honour of being here in the next Parliament, and can speak freely on these matters now. I wish, also, to refer to legislation which has been passed in breach of the Constitution. We have continually passed measures which, on appeal to the i High Court, have been ruled <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires.</inline> There is not the slightest doubt that there is a constant endeavour on the part of some unificationist members of the party opposite to circumvent the Constitution. </para>

                        <para>- I rise to order. I wish to ask whether it is in order for an honorable senator to state that this Parliament has committed breaches of the Constitution in legislation passed by both Houses, and assented to by the Governor-General, and which has never been challenged in the High Court. I take it that that legislation must be assumed to be valid until it is successfully challenged in the High Court. It appears to me that it must be out of order for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> to accuse this Parliament of having committed breaches of the Constitution when no proof exists that that has been the case. </para>

                        <para>- I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> is in order. The honorable senator was referring to a number of Acts passed by the Federal Parliament, some of the provisions of which were subsequently declared to be <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires</inline> pf the Constitution. It is a common thing, when a Bill is introduced in another place, or in the Senate, for members of either House to take exception to it on the ground that, in their opinion, it contains provisions which are <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires</inline> of the Constitution. They may still adhere to that opinion, though the Bill may be passed, and subsequently be assented to by the Governor-General. They may continue to hold the view that if the question were tested before the High Court the measure would be declared to be outside the constitutional powers of this Parliament. </para>

I have not the slightest doubt that if they were to rake up that question, and have the matter referred to the High Court, the Court would say that the Act to which I have referred should not have come into operation before the 1st January, ion; and that the States should have received 12s. 6d. per head of their population for the half-year ending 30th June, 1911, instead of about 6s. per head which they did receive, if so much. </para>

The Executive Government of Queensland did make such an application. I understand that they have since expressed their intention to send in a bill to the Commonwealth for the costs to which they were put at the time, and, if it is not met, to appeal to the High Court. I have been interested to note the clever way in which the present Government and their friends have tried to get round the Constitution. Although the Constitution is not sacrosanct, the Government of the Commonwealth should be the first persons to prevent the slightest infringement of it, excepting by referenda. We have heard of an individual called Machiavelli, ' and there would appear to be some person / in the present Government possessed of a wonderful brain, a fertile imagination, and ! an acute intellect, and whether it be of the Machiavellian or of the Mephistophelean  order, future Australian historians will perhaps be able to decide. Having been absent during the earlier part of the session, the Senate will excuse me for having taken up a little time on these matters. </para>

As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has said, it is simply impossible to find fault with items contained in it when there is no opportunity to compare the expenditure proposed with that voted for the corresponding period of last year. I may say that I had occasion to speak to a member of the Ministry regarding certain amendments of the Navigation Bill. I asked him whether, in another place, the Government occasionally accepted amendments from the Opposition? When he said they did, I told him that we could not succeed in getting any one' to accept amendments from us in the Senate yesterday. </para>

                        <para>- Honorable senators opposite said it was outrageous, and denounced it in the most vehement language. Yet we find that the learned Justices of the High Court have unanimously declared the provision referred to to be within the powers of this Parliament to enact. Each of the Judges gave a learned judgment, expressing the view that, as a matter of common sense, this Parliament should possess the powers we exercised on that occasion. </para>

                        <para>- I am not alluding to that matter at all, but to a provision in the Electoral Act which honorable senators opposite so loudly denounced last year. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> was speaking this afternoon, the Leader of the Opposition challenged his figures, and, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has pointed out, subsequently quoted figures dealing with other phases of the question in order to prove that those used by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> were not correct. That kind of slim politics may appear very clever, and may raise a laugh amongst those who have not even the ability to use such tactics, but they are not valuable for purposes of criticism.. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister of Defence gave the figures for every year in his reply, and still proved the statement made. By manipulation figures can be made to prove anything, for as much may depend on those which are left out as on those which are used. I am not going to try and prove a case by anything which is open to refutation in that way. Speaking of the effects of the land tax, I think it is fair to admit that a certain amount of subdivision has been going on for a number of years, and, with or without a land tax, it would continue to a certain extent. But the question is whether the land tax had anything to do with accelerating that subdivision ? Honorable senators who opposed the tax, and said it would be confiscatory in its operation, informed us that the markets would be flooded with land, which would have to be disposed of at a ruinous sacrifice, because no one could hold it and expect to make a profit from its use when such a tax had to be paid upon it. Those statements were made throughout the discussion upon the Land Tax Bill. I do not attempt to repeat the exact language used by honorable senators opposite, but they will not deny the general accuracy of my statement. </para>

                        <para>- We have experienced a number of fairly good years. While partial droughts may have prevailed here and there, we have, on the whole, been blessed with good productive years. Population has been increasing, and trade and commerce have been flourishing in nearly every part of the Commonwealth. Any effect which the tax might otherwise have" had has been neutralized by that upward growth, which has resulted in general prosperity. Naturally, as one set of circumstances operated to considerably neutralize another set of circumstances, the effect of the tax has not been so apparent as it otherwise would have been. I point out this circumstance, not with a view to instructing honorable senators opposite, _ but because I think it ought to be' admitted that there are many factors in these complex matters which tend either in one direction or the other. Sometimes the contrary operation of these factors confuses the minds of those who endeavour to ascertain the facts, and it is to be deprecated that, for party purposes, politicians sometimes attempt to confuse these very complex matters. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> that the land tax has not had such a marked effect as it would have had if it had been heavier. . </para>

                        <para>- That point is one which I have already put from the other side. The good seasons have helped to minimize the effects of the tax. I consider that it would have been wise on our part if we had made the gradations of this tax so steep, and its higher incidence so heavy, as to put beyond all dispute the result of its operation. </para>

As he is already getting all the rent that he can, he cannot, in the very nature of things, do anything to increase it. The pressure of population on the small habitable area in our cities has had the effect of raising rents. If there are more people looking for houses than there are houses available, they will naturally have to offer premiums to obtain them. </para>

                        <para>- We can achieve nothing in this world unless we are prepared to accept some risks. I should be prepared <inline font-style="italic">-</inline> -if it were possible to pass on rents - to put a sprag in the landlord's wheel by means of other legislation. While the Labour party remain in power, our object is to achieve certain beneficial results. We do not pretend to be so infallible as to enact legislation which can withstand all the onslaughts which may be made upon it by time. Should our legislation prove ineffective, we must devise some other means of dealing with the difficulty. We are out to benefit the people, and if we cannot do that in one way, we must do it in another. To quote an old saying, " If the sword will not win a battle, perhaps shot-guns may." We have a majority in both Houses of the Legislature, and consequently we are able to apply the remedies that we advocate. If we apply those remedies in a sufficiently drastic manner, there will be no room for my honorable friends opposite to argue as to the effect of their operation. I would make the tax very much steeper than it is in its gradations. When once we commence to tax land, there should be no doubt whatever that the tax should be high enough to compel the land-holder either to put his land to the best possible use, or to sell it to somebody who will do that. In the higher grades, I would do away with all the complicated machinery which permits of an exemption of so much, taxes- so many pounds' worth of land at a halfpenny in the  £1,  and so many pounds' worth at a penny in the £i. In such circumstances, I would not allow any exemption at all. </para>

                        <para>- That is what I advocate. I would make the higher gradation apply to every pound's worth of land that a man owns. Estates of  £80,000  value and over should have no exemption and no gradations. That would force them into market, if nothing else' would. But if it did not, I would double the tax until it did. If I have a goal in view, I will not stop until I reach it. </para>

                        <para>- Not at all. We have been twitted with requiring more revenue, and with having incurred commitments which ought not to have been incurred. When the Leader of the Opposition was challenged to point to these commitments, he trotted out the insignificant item of the proposed laundry at Port Darwin - a most ridiculous anti-climax to his heroics as to' what expenditure he would save. In regard to these Socialistic institutions, I would point out that the experience of every country has been that, in times of war, army contractors, taking them by and large, are the biggest unhanged scoundrels that the world has ever evolved. There may be honorable exceptions, but I have not heard of them. In times of emergency, every country has to put up with the most rascally plundering tactics of army contractors, whether the supplies which are needed take the form of saddlery, rifles, -cutlasses, or anything else. Every country has to accept supplies which are so far below the specifications that they not only -cause ruinous loss from a monetary standpoint, but bring loss of life to thousands of troops. There is nothing in our commercial system more natural than that such things should occur. For instance, we find that what was supposed to be leather for the boots of soldiers in the Crimea was mainly brown paper. </para>

                        <para>- It has to come from some country before it can be put into the calico. The point is that, while my honorable friends opposite are always booming enterprise, all commercialism is so honeycombed with rascality that they are prepared to import calico which, in the aggregate, is loaded up with thousands of tons of clay. In the same way all kinds' of deleterious or useless material is incorporated in nearly everything that we eat, drink, and wear. It is manifest that, in the time of war, when large supplies have to be obtained in a very limited time, there are very much bigger opportunities for that rascality to operate than there are in the ordinary times of peace, when you can to some extent pick and choose whom you want to deal with. If we are to have an effective Defence Force, we should take steps to see that, as far as possible, the material required for making uniforms, saddles, or other articles, should be of the best possible quality. Honorable senators must admit that there is no more effective way of attaining that object than by having the commodities made in Government 'factories, where no person has an interest is spoiling or adulterating material. </para>

                        <para>- We must establish the factories in times of peace, in order to have a trained and efficient staff to provide a large output in the event of war being threatened. It is all nonsense to say that we could establish the factories in three months. We know that, whenever there is an urgent demand for locomotives for the State railways, the cry is that there has been no time to get them made locally, and so the orders are sent abroad1. That would be an unanswerable statement for any Ministry to make if a war were threatened or mooted. If we are to have anything like honest and faithful work done in the way of supplying our troops with everything necessary for their comfort and efficiency, and even for their safety, then in times of peace the necessary - provision should be made for the manufacture of the articles. </para>

                        <para>- I am acquainted with the people who run one of the woollen factories in New South Wales, and their statement to me was not that there was not time enough, but that the orders did not extend over the whole year. They said that at one particular period the Department wanted so many thousand yards of cloth, and that to undertake the contract they would require to have a larger staff than they could guarantee to keep permanently employed. Rather than extend their works and increase their staff, they declined an order of that kind, preferring to fulfil ordinary orders. If special conditions apply in regard to the provision of commodities of any kind for the Defence Force or other Commonwealth services, it is well to have our own factories, because it would dislocate private factories to supply unusual orders. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> made some remarks regarding the demand on the officials of little country post-offices for a half-holiday. Recently I asked a question as to the number of allowance offices in New South Wales which had a Saturday half-holiday, and further questions as to the conditions under which it was granted. Instead of having anything to gain, perhaps I may have something to lose by expressing my opinion here, but I shall do so in what I deem to be the public interest. I was informed that twenty-eight allowance offices have been permitted to close on Saturday afternoon. I happen to live in a district which is somewhat isolated from railway communication, and in which there is a number of little settlements, each with a post and telegraph office. One has to find a postal official in order to get access to the telephone. I found that one or two of these offices, perhaps several, have been closed on Saturday afternoons - they are all within  20  or  30  miles of Sydney - as the result of a petition having been sent in by the local residents. I have a personal knowledge of how these petitions are got up. A postal official, or perhaps a charming daughter, will go round the district and ask the residents if ' they have any objection to the postal official getting a half -holiday ; and the neighbourly feeling which exists in little communities prevents those who may be very adverse to the closing of the post-office from refusing to sign the petition. They also ask young fellows and girls whom they have met at social functions to sign the petition. There is no oversight on the part of the Department, and to a petition' may be attached the signatures of children of ten years of age, for all that it knows to the contrary. Consequently, these petitions should have no weight or value attached to them. These places, .situated1 many miles from a railway, are just those places which above all others should have their post-offices open on every day in the week. Instead of finding the telephone-office closed on Saturday afternoon, I would be glad if there were some means by which it could be, kept open on Sunday. </para>

                        <para>- I only want to deal with the question of public safety. In the district in which I live - and there are districts farther out - it costs nothing less thai*  £5  to get a medical man to attend a person. If a death occurs, or an accident takes place, there is no possible way, when the post-office is closed,' of getting telephone communication with the nearest town or the metropolis from Saturday at noon until  Monday morning. If the officials are not paid enough to allow them to have one member of the family available in a case of emergency, the Commonwealth, at any cost, should provide them with sufficient salary to be able to demand that, their services shall be at the disposal of the general public. I know that many of these officials, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> pointed out on the last Estimates, are miserably underpaid, but that is largely their own fault. They have a. good deal of that black-leg instinct which leads them to compete against one another. They take the offices at next to nothing, and, grumble afterwards. I hope that the position will be very much harder if the Department does not pay these men a fairer salary for the very valuable work" which they have to do. I deprecate the idea that, so long as the means of communication are made available at any hour of the day or night in the metropolitan areas, country places* must put up with any deprivation. If we are to effectively settle the country districts, we should not take away any facilities that exist, but rather grant more. Of what use is it to me to go to Sydney and find that a telephone-office is available if the post-office at the other end with which I want to communicate is closed? Of what use it it to have the telephone-offices open in the big towns, where medical aid, doctors, police, fire-brigades, and ambulance corps, are available, if you take away the very few facilities which exist in little isolated country places? If the Department is going in for that retrogressive sort of administration, it will meet with my uncompromising hostility. It \s a mean way of escaping the just obligation that there is upon the Department to pay these officers an adequate salary, and then expect them to be available when they are wanted. In the district where I live, a petition was recently taken round by the local postmistress. It was sent along to my residence with a vacant line at the top, for my signature there would be useful. It was accompanied with a polite note asking me to sign in this place. Although the postmistress was a friend of my wife and myself, I refused to sign in the public interest. I said, " We want the telephone open at all times, and1 the mail-bags also should be despatched. I shall be no party to depriving the district of these conveniences, no matter how many persons may sign the petition." No opportunity is given to those who think differently to voice their opinions. If this matter is to be settled by the voice of the people in the district, a much fairer way would be to cast upon the official who wants a half-holiday the obligation of convening a public meeting by an advertisement and a local notification. Every one would then have an opportunity of being present, and a fair decision would be obtained as to whether the majority were in favour of it or not. </para>

                        <para>- Just so. It really is not a matter upon which there should be a majority decision. But if any representations are to be made on the subject, they should not be made by means of a faked petition. The matter should be threshed out in the light of criticism. A petition which is taken round by a person individually interested, and who may have it in his power to perform little favours for people whom he asks- to sign, should not be seriously regarded in a matter of this kind. Country people sometimes go late for their mails, and put themselves under a little obligation to a postmaster or postmistress. They cannot then refuse to sign a petition when it is brought round to them. The occasional accidents and calamities which occur in country districts are a sufficient warrant for demanding that country offices shall not be closed ; and if those who look after them are not sufficiently paid for their work, the Government should pay them properly, and then expect their services to be available in the public interest. </para>

                        <para>- There is need for increases. In the district where I live, an increase of £20 a year would not have been out of the way, considering the duties which those who look after an allowance office are called upon to perform. But when application was made for an increase, the Department granted one of something like 30s. a year. I do not believe in running our Departments in a mean and pettifogging way. The Post and Telegraph Department is really the most important service under our control, because by means of it we maintain communication from one end of the Commonwealth to the other. It should not be starved out of any desire for profit-making. I wish to refer to the rather slim treatment extended by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready's</inline> figures. The honorable senator did not seem to recognise that he did not deal with the same set of figures as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> did. </para>

                        <para>- Every one must admit that. There are so many factors that enter into the value of land, and the value of production, that it is useless to quote one factor and try to prove a case from it. The charge against the Government of expending money wastefully and extravagantly has not been borne- out by anything that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> said.  His  one illustration, by way of interjection, was that the proposed laundry in the Northern Territory should not have been built, and that in that way the Government could at least have saved something. If the honorable senator cannot bring a more direful indictment against the Government than that, the charges do not amount to much. I quite admit the perfect soundness of his argument that a Government may start enterprises or works which another Government would not have started, and that nevertheless a new Government would be unable to abolish those that had been started. But nevertheless it is a fair thing to challenge the Opposition as to which of these enterprises are in themselves extravagantly conducted df"* will not prove profitable in the broader aspect to the Commonwealth. Take our Small Arms Factory. Would <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> leave the manufacture of small arms to private enterprise? Take the Cordite Factory. Would he leave that to private enterprise? If we want honest and serviceable commodities for our troops, surely it is a wise and statesmanlike thing to provide factories for their manufacture? We need to provide good material during times of peace, and to have factories that can work up to a war capacity if war should become imminent. Why allow ourselves to be placed at the mercy of rascally 'army contractors of whose services we should have to avail ourselves if we did not provide for these things in time of peace? Surely we should! take warning by what has happened in other parts of the world, and should start on new and better lines ourselves. It is. "up to" <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> to point out which' of these Commonwealth enterprises is in itself a mere Socialistic fad, or which is objectionable from a national stand-point. He should indicate which of them is being extravagantly or recklessly managed. As he has failed to do that, we must assume that he cannot make out a fair case. The money which has been expended by thisGovernment hitherto has been raised from taxation, mainly through the Customs. Personally, I am one of those who think that we are raising too much money from Customs. I am very much surprised at <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> devoted Free Trader as we know he used to be, stating that any form of taxation of a direct kind that is proposed is infamous - that it is a hideous thing for us even to suggest by a chance remark or by an alleged observation from' a Minister which he can piece together with a statement made by a private member of our party, that there is even a suspicion in the Ministerial ranks of favouring directtaxation. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> thinks that he has in that way obtained a weapon with which he will be able to punish us before the people of the country at the next election. If it be such a deadly sin to propose to raise more revenue from direct1 taxation, what becomes of the much-vaunted Free Trade views of the honorable senator ? </para>

                        <para>- I am not. But  Protectionist  and Free Trader may well meet in this respect. Absolute Free Trade would abolish the Customs House, and absolute Protection would abolish the revenue from Customs. Consequently both doctrines pushed to their logical conclusion would reach the same goal. If you are to have good government you must have an. ample revenue. You must get that revenue from land, from income, or Customs taxation. Personally, I am in favour of decreasing the purely revenue items in the Tariff. If we are to have Protection, let us make it effective right up to the hilt ; although I must say that I am not much of a believer in the efficacy of Protection, because, instead of encouraging, people by means of heavy duties to manufacture commodities, I would start factories to manufacture them under the <inline font-style="italic">Go-.</inline> vernment. I am an open, undisguised, whole-hog Socialist, and should not hesitate to put my principles into force. </para>

On the contrary, the whole community has a personal and collective interest in it as a beneficient in:stitution. So it should be with every other institution. </para>

                        <para>- Of course there are things that require to be remedied ; but this played-out yarn about dividing up is unworthy !of any man of intelligence. Socialism, which means collective ownership and the pooling of interests, is the opposite of dividing up. I say that that is the course I advocate, and will continue to advocate, as opportunity affords. So far as the Customs House is concerned, I am in favour of doing away from time to time with the purely revenue Tariff items, and of doing that as compensation for the increase of taxation on land values, and, if necessary, on incomes not gained from personal exertion. I desire by the gradual, but not too gradual, operation of those principles to relieve the classes which now bear the greatest burden of taxation, and are least able to bear it, and at the same time to place it equitably upon the shoulders of those best able to bear it. Any efforts I can make publicly or privately in that direction I shall be prepared to make. </para>

By their management of the business of the Senate, the Government have so mixed up things that we hardly know where we stand. There are various matters to which one might refer on this Bill. I asked some questions the other day in connexion with a steamer which the Government bought for work in the Northern Territory at a cost of £1,250 or £1,500. I saw recently from a photograph in the <inline font-style="italic">Australasian</inline> that she is now hung up at a wharf in Mackay.- The Government paid something like £350 to have her taken up to the Northern Territory, but apparently she has not been able to get more than a few hundred miles up the coast. </para>

                        <para>- The people of Australia cannot afford to pay too much even for the attractions of such a splendid place as Mackay. I am referring to the steamer on which the Minister of Trade and Customs-would not trust her own crew. He made a contract to have her taken up to Port Darwin, but she is not getting up there. I do not know to what extent we can trust the newspaper reports, but I notice 'that at Broken Hill they are still passing resolutions, and doing all they can to oppose the system of compulsory military training. I admit that I have some good things to say for the Defence Department, but when we rind lads and their parents penalized, I ask the Minister of Defence whether, after all that has happened, he is now prepared to deal with those adult societies which are doing their level best to induce the boys of Australia, to break the law, and defy himself as Minister of Defence. I hope that the Defence Department are not treating my son better than the sons of any other person. If I may be allowed to refer to a purely personal matter, I should like to say that my son sent in a medical certificate to excuse his absence from drill. Nothing was heard of it for a time, but eventually, when he. made inquiries he was told that in view of the medical certificate presented, he would be considered as having been present at the drills from which he was absent. That was playing, as I think, and as the boy thought, very fairly with him. But I wish to know whether all other boys are being treated in the same way. In one case after another we find that cadets are being prosecuted, and themselves, or their parents, fined, and yet we have certain organizations - I do not care whether they are Conservative, Liberal, Labour, or Socialistic organizations - holding meetings and doing all they possibly can to induce lads to break the law. In the circumstances I say that if the Government intend to do what is fair by everybody it is up to them to tell these people to " turn it up." or they will be prosecuted. I brought this' matter up some twelve months ago, and the Minister, in answer to certain questions I put, said he thought it advisable to let the matter alone for the present, and not to take too much notice of these people. The same thing is still going on, and though boys and parents are prosecuted, the people who have been preaching sedition and violation of the law from one end of the country to the other are left untouched. I do not wish to suggest motives in this matter, but I repeat that it is up to the Defence Department to deal with these people as they should be dealt with, rather than with the ignorant boys and their ignorant parents, who pay attention to those who say, " We should not train our sons to shoot down their fathers," and all that sort of rubbish. If trouble arises later on the blame will be placed on the right shoulders. It will be no use then for any honorable senator to ask why this matter was not brought up for consideration, because it cannot be denied that I have referred to it on several occasions in the strongest terms I could use. The question of the Vancouver mail service has been dealt with very fully by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger. He referred to a certain meeting held in Brisbane. At the request of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thomas,</inline> who was then Postmaster-General, I went over to Sydney and attended a meeting there in connexion with this matter. You, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> attended that meeting and strongly objected, in common with others, to the expression of certain views which, if adopted, would have put the interests of New Zealand before those of </para>

                </continue>
                <para class="block">Queensland, New South Wales, and the rest of Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thomas,</inline> at the time, asked* us to regard the views stated as confidential.. I ask why in Heaven's name we should regard them as confidential, when we are being jewed  out of the business we established . and continued for many years in Queensland ? Later on a meeting was held in Brisbane, which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger attended, at the request of the Postmaster-General, to meet representatives of ' the Chamber of Commerce. I received a similar request, but was unable to get away. In the language of the music hall I had done my "stunt" in Sydney, and I had had' quite enough of it. Again those who were present at the meeting in Brisbane, with the hushing of the melodramatic stage, were asked to keep what was said secret, not to give it away, and to regard it as confidential. What has been the result? The interests of Queensland have been turned down, and she has lost a big trade in frozen meat and frozen butter, which she had built up with Canada. Why should Queensland's interests be turned down in this way? We are told that something, may be done to secure a renewal of the Vancouver service when we have arrived at a reciprocal Tariff agreement with Canada. We have a right to complain in the matter. We have a right to complain that, there is no business now being done on certain wharfs on the Brisbane River, because Queensland has lost the Canadian trade. We shall certainly make such' a complaint at the next election, unless the Government submit some reasonable arrangement for the renewal of the Vancouver mail, service.. The Queensland people can have no use for a Vancouver mail service by which their produce must be taken to Sydney, and thence to Auckland, before it can reach Vancouver. Such a service will be of no use to people who had built up a direct trade with Vancouver. We know how the feelings of the people of the State were expressed in 1906 over the loss of the Orient trade, and we can anticipate what their feelings will be when they discover how they have been compelled to lose the Vancouver trade. I shall not detain the Senate by going into the details of that trade. I have the figures by me, but this does not appear to me to be an opportune time to deal with the matter at length. I say that Queensland considers herself badly treated by the manner in which she has had to lose a trade which she had built up.  Her  interests have been turned down* by a Minister who calmly said, at the meetings held in Sydney and in Brisbane, " You must keep it dark." That is not the way in which public business should be transacted. </para>

This journal published an article on 2nd May of the present year, which is headed " Sapphira on Tramp." It will be recollected that Sapphira was the wife of Ananias.

                <para>A flatulent female named Cameron held forth in the 'Mechanics' Hall, Warrnambool, on political matters last week. She went there to assist the Western District squatters and the Collins-street rooks to defeat certain Labour candidates at the next Federal elections. In the course of her remarks she pointed the skinny finger of prophecy at Wannon, Indi, and Corangamite, and exhorted the fatty degenerates present to fight on and pour out their gold for the reconquest of those electorates. She claimed to represent the Women's National League, but like the rest of that whiskery brigade of pup-cuddlers and poodle-kissers, who rage about the marriage tie and the purity of the pram, she lied with the ferocity of a fiend about the Labour party and all its works. </para>

                <para>Sapphira, the frothy, was listened to by a few red-faced females, who spend their time in efforts to hide their pimples and blotches with toilet powder, and by a handful of bulbous-necked and bald-headed Fatmen of the type that generally get close up to the footlights when giddy girls are giving a wild and whirlsome exposition of the art of high-kicking. Sapphira belongs to the common - we might say very common - variety of Tory organizers. She has neither beauty or eloquence to back her. Economically, she is grossly ignorant. Were she to attempt to pass off on an audience of well-informed people the Tory taradiddles she regaled her hearers with at Warrnambool, they would rise up in a spasm of disgust and walk out on the pavement. Sapphira's statements about the Labour party were at once false and slanderous. She repeated the bulk of the parrot chat of <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Morton</inline> who, when she was at Framlingham some 'time ago, <inline font-style="italic">told</inline> the people there, among other things, that "Although members of the Labour party did not say openly they would  take the children away from the mothers, that was their secret intention." Instead of two impudent liars like Sapphira and Morton being reported in detail by the allegedly respectable press, they ought to have their tongues slit publicly as a warning to other vicious females of the parasite class not to enter on a campaign of falsehood and vilification in the interests of the sweater and landlord class. </para>

                    <para>SAPPHIRA IN BUSINESS</para>
                    <para>Sapphira told the people of Warrnambool  that the Labour party is against the Federal form of government. This averment of Sapphira's is a lie, and if it was the only one she had ever told, it would likely have stuck in her false throat and choked her with the convictive persistence of an Adam's apple. She said, too, that the Labour party loaded the primary producer with a double tax. If is probable that this cryptic allusion of Sapphira is to the People's party lie that the State Land Tax, with which, in a spirit of revenge, Murray hit the farmers, is the work of the Labour party. If that is what Sapphira said, meant, or inferred, then she is the most impudent liar that sniffed the atmosphere of this planet since Leathersnout died.  I think he is probably one of Balzac's characters - </para>
                    <para>The Stale land tax was the work of Murray and his gang. That is unchallengeably true. If Sapphira believes she ' states the truth, let her put up£100 and it will be promptly covered with another  £100  by the party, which is prepared to prove that, politically, she is a wilful and malicious liar. But she is like the crowd to which she belongs; her programme is a programme of wind, and she attempts to deceive the people with blatant falsehoods. When she and others of her class are bowled out and convicted of trying to gull the electors for the lowest party purposes, they have never the decency to apologise. They simply pass on with the sullenness of routed pigs to the consummation of further mischief. </para>
                    <para>THE DISLOYALTY GAG</para>
                    <para>Sapphira accused Fisher of having torn down  the Union Jack, and trampled it in be sodden degradation in the blood of slaughtered Fatmen. If she didn't say that she tried to say something equally tragic. Here again Sapphira lied. Fisher is a loyal Scotchman who, time after time, has repudiated to the satisfaction of the public the dirty charges made by a lot of dirty political harridans and hooligans - the pimps and bootwipes of the trust bosses and Freetraders. Sapphira raged about the Caucus domination and other vague imbecilities, that haunt the barren minds of Tory windbags of either gender. Of course, there is no such thing as domination of Labour members of Parliament by the Caucus or by the Union, outside the imagination of Conservatives afflicted with political jim-jams. </para>

                        <para>. - There is a matter in connexion with the; Customs House, of which I should like the Minister to take a note. Several complaints have come to me about the extraordinary amount of duty which is charged on some medicines. A person who has been suffering from asthma for the last twenty years was advised to try an American remedy which is well recommended. He has to pay  £5  for the medicine and the advice which comes with it... It is a good medicine, which has done him a lot of good. The value of the medicine is 18s. 9d., while the duty charged at the Customs House is 16s. 9d. Two cases of a similar character have been brought under my notice. I think that the matter deserves to be looked into closely. The heavy duty is very hard upon, poor people. It is a matter which seriously affects a number of suffering persons. I wish to remind the Minister of Defence that three or four months ago he promised to supply audited balance-sheets of the various Government factories. </para>

                            <para>- A little while ago I moved for a return as to the cost of the new Treasury building. I made no charge against any person, nor did I cast a single reflection. The return was laid before the Senate, and there was a good deal of flaunting as to the cheap way in which the work was carried out with day labour. I mentioned that the State had  been perfectly satisfied, but I wish to withdraw that expression of satisfaction, because it appears in the light of fuller information that the building has cost far more than it ought to have done. The latest statement is, that while it cost 9.8 pence per cubic foot a similar building alongside cost 6.75 pence per cubic foot. </para>

                        <para>. - I listened to the debate on land value taxation which was initiated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> in a very, instructive speech. While he claims that the tax imposed by the Labour party has done something to break up land monopoly, he admits that a good deal more requires to be done. That is exactly the position I took up. Tasmania has not gained in population. It is the one State in the Union which is losing population. I think that proves conclusively that our land tax has not been effective there. My own opinion is that Tasmania, with its great natural advantages, ought to be the most prosperous State in the  Commonwealth ; but, instead of that, it is the most reactionary in politics, and the least prosperous as regards social conditions. </para>

                            <para>- When a young State like Tasmania loses population, it is ample evidence that there is something seriously wrong with the country or the people, or the government. I am satisfied that there is nothing wrong with the people; I am satisfied that the State is a good one ; and, therefore, the only conclusion I can come to is that the government is bad. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> has asked me would not people naturally leave Tasmania, so that they may visit a larger territory? There may be something in that suggestion, but my experience of the human family is that they usually congregate where they find themselves most comfortable. With regard to land monopoly generally throughout Australia, we have the members of the Opposition contending that the land tax of the present Government has done nothing to break up that monopoly. On the other hand, we have a majority of the Government party maintaining that a good deal has been done to destroy the condition of monopoly which existed before the passing of the Land Tax Act. It is quite natural that Government - supporters should claim credit for a measure which they have helped to pass ; and probably it is just as natural that members of the Opposition should say that it has had little or no effect. I have attempted to take, from the party stand-point, a disinterested view of the position, and I have come to the deliberate conclusion that the land tax has done little or nothing to destroy land monopoly. Land monopoly is just as rampant in Australia to-day, as it was before the tax was imposed. The price of land, instead of going down, as it ought to do if the tax were effective, continues to mount up. No doubt, the good seasons have had a considerable influence on this movement. Owing to the seasons and the high price of various commodities produced by agriculturists, there has been quite a rush 01 people on to the land during the last seven or eight years. But if we have three or four years of drought, and that will inevitably take place sooner or later, land values will fall, and the rush to take up land will not be nearly so great. The complaint hitherto has been that, owing to monopoly, land was scarce, and consequently dear. </para>

                            <para>- That has nothing to do with the question that I am discussing. People who require land for settlement cannot get it at present at a price which they are able to pay. My complaint against the Labour party is not that it imposed the land tax, but that it refrains from pushing the tax home. The party got a mandate from the people of Australia to destroy land monopoly. The mandate was not to impose this tax or another. It was simply to break the neck of land monopoly. But land monopoly is as strong to-day as ever it was. Unless the present policy is altered, what will happen will be this : Estates will be cut up and people settled upon the land. The fact of their settling will increase the value of neighbouring lands, and values will increase, until the, tax itself will be only of very slight assistance to people who desire to get land upon which to settle. What every rational reformer desires is that land shall be made so cheap and so readily available in Australia that any man who wants a good piece can get it. There is plenty of land in this continent. There is enough along our railway lines, and contiguous to our ports, to settle  30,000,000  or  40,000,000  people. Yet when people want Crown land in Queensland, where it ought to be fairly plentiful, they are driven back from the railway lines into country where the land is of comparatively poor quality, where the rainfall is scanty, and where they have to drag their commodities over miles of bad roads. There is plenty of land in Queensland, but, unfortunately, it is not available. </para>

                            <para>- But* <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger belongs to a party which buttresses land monopoly. I do not trouble my head about what he says in this connexion. In Queensland, if a man wants a selection from the Government, he has to wait from a year to eighteen months before he can get it. In a young country like Australia, with so much good land, it should be as easy for a man to get a piece of country upon which to settle as it is for me to go down Bourke-street and buy a suit of clothes. As a matter of fact, not only has a man to wait a considerable time before he can get land, but in a great many cases he never gets a piece at all. I mentioned some time ago a case where there were  400  applicants for two pieces of very indifferent country. In the Claremont district recently two grazing areas were thrown open - one of  5,000,  and the other of  7,000  acres. For the  5,000-acre  area there were ten applicants, and for the  7,000-acre  area there were sixty-seven. </para>

                            <para>- That is probably near the mark. The fact that sixty-seven people applied for one piece of land proves conclusively that there is a land famine in Queensland. If there is a dearth of available land there, the state of affairs in the other States must be much worse. The safety of Australia depends on our getting a big population as quickly as we possibly can. The only way to get that population is to offer, not only our own people - who ought to have the first chance - but people from other countries who are looking for outlets for their energy, cheap and good land. A large area is of no use to an immigrant. Immigrants who come here from other countries have little more than their strong right arm. But a man who wants to .settle under favorable circumstances in Australia to-day must have money. Ordinarily, a man with money does not want to leave his own country. He is well enough off where he is. He is not going to tempt fortune by going elsewhere. The people who desire to leave their native land are those who have nothing save their own health and strength. To these people we absolutely offer nothing in Australia. </para>

                            <para>- And no Legislative Council to contend with. If it will only put its hand to the plough, it can completely destroy the condition of land monopoly that exists on this continent, and, whatever the after effects may be, it ought, as a reform party to seize the opportunity which the electors have given it to do them this great service. The immediate after effects might be very bad for the party. It has very often happened in the political history of a country that the people who have carried reforms have been turned out of power soon after by those in. whose interests they have been working. I do not believe, however, that such a thing would happen to the Labour party. I am satisfied that the benefits of this policy would become so apparent that, instead of being turned out of power if they carried it through, they would be given an almost permanent lease of office. The people of Australia would be so convinced - in fact, the evidence of the benefit of 'this policy to the country would be so complete - that no one would dream of ever substituting for them such a party as we find now in Opposition. </para>

I believe that the policy I am advocating is the only policy that will do the working men and women of Australia any good, and, believing that, I am not afraid to tell them so. I believe this policy is the best for the people who are settled upon the land, or who intend to settle upon it. The only people who will be injured by a policy of this kind, if it is carried out to the fullest extent, are the land speculators, the land monopolists, the men who buy up huge areas without intending to use them. Have honorable senators ever considered what land monopoly means? We hear a great deal about the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, which has a monopoly of the manufacture and distribution of sugar; but the land monopolist corners everything. He corners our food, our clothing, our furniture, and everything else that we require. </para>

                            <para>- And as long as I have a seat in the Senate the honorable senator, if he is here, will continue to hear me. I do not know whether that time will be long or short, but as long as I have breath to enunciate my views, I shall give utterance to them. I do not intend to labour this question. All I wish to do is to try to impress upon the party with which I am associated the absolute necessity of dealing with this question, not in the half-hearted fashion in which it has already dealt with it, but by pushing it right home, and breaking up land monopoly, which is undoubtedly doing the people of Australia a great injury. There is one other matter to which I wish to refer. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> I think, asked <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> whether the Government intended to resort to additional taxation to meet the expenditure, which is going up, as the phrase has it, by leaps and bounds. The honorable senator replied that he thought that the revenue from Customs and Excise, together with that obtained from the present land tax, would be sufficient to meet all expenditure without imposing additional taxation. If that statement reflects the mind of the Government on the question, it is, from my point of view, one of the most serious statements that has been made in this Chamber for a considerable time. It simply means that the Labour Government intend to persist in the policy of revenue.tariffism. </para>

                            <para>- The working people of Australia have everything to gain and, nothing to lose by changing the system of taxation. Each family pays, on the average, from £10 to £20 a year in Customs taxation, but if we had a system under which the bulk of our revenue was raised from land values, probably the taxation would not be more than a few shillings, the bulk of the revenue coming from huge city values. It is extremely desirable that we should have a clear understanding of the intention of the Government with regard to the Tariff. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> is right, and the Government is leaning on the Tariff for its revenue, good-bye to Protection. Every one knows that if the Tariff were made protective, it would yield much less revenue. The Government needs revenue, and if it is not going to take other measures to raise it, the Tariff must remain as it is, without revision. That is a fine look-out for the young industries of the continent, and very disappointing to those of us who have gone up and down the country trying to persuade the people that the best policy for Australia is to begin with protection against the land monopolist, and, in the next place, give protection against the cheap sweated labour of foreign countries. The Government will have the support of the Opposition in maintaining the Tariff as it stands. </para>

                            <para>- No. They are revenue Tariffists. But we who are members of the Labour party cannot consistently support a policy of that kind. The bulk of our revenue must be derived directly. Such a great change in our financial arrangements could not be brought about suddenly; it must be accomplished gradually. We have only to guide us as to the intention of the Government its inaction and the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> which indicate that the existing Tariff is to be maintained.  1  object to that. If the present Government is still in power in the next Parliament, I trust that better counsels will prevail, and that something will be done, not only to increase the land value taxation, but also to make our Tariff more effective than it is at the present time as an instrument of Protection. If the Tariff does not protect sufficiently to enable us to establish industries, the wall must be heightened. If the people of Australia prefer Free Trade, I would rather have that pure and simple than the present revenue Tariff, because it would make direct taxation inevitable, and with direct taxation and the freeing of our natural resources which would result, Protection would not then be nearly so necessary as it is now. But my preference is for high Protection with direct taxation. That policy will break up land monopoly, and give to our people the opportunity to settle on the soil, or to those who wish to engage in manufacturing, the opportunity to use and develop the great natural resources of this new country. </para>

                        <para>. -As I do not wish to repeat what has been said by other senators regarding the Vancouver mail service, I will only say that Queensland spent a lot of money in trying to establish that service, thinking that it would greatly benefit her industries. We were promised that Brisbane would always be a port of call, but we find now that that promise, like many others, was not intended to be kept. I join in protesting against what has been done, but I shall not speak more fully on 'the matter now, because of what has been said by Senators Chataway and St. Ledger. Honorable senators opposite have said that we on this side were opposed to the land tax. I opposed it, not because it was a tax on land, but because I thought that the right to impose such taxation belonged to the States. I am in favour of the taxation of land by the State Parliaments, and always voted for such taxation when a State member. It is the business of the State authorities to open up the country by the construction of railways and the making of roads, and it is not right that the Commonwealth Government should reap the results of their enterprise. In Queensland, only about '6 per cent, of the land has been alienated, and the revenue from any taxation on land should go to the State Government to be used in its development. </para>

                            <para>- I have seen Melbourne poor and poverty-stricken when the boom burst. Like other cities, it depends on the prosperity of the country ; and a few bad seasons would make a change. There are some facts disclosed in the Budget-papers in reference to the Public Service that require explanation. I see that in the Postmaster-General's Department the average pay of the officers in New South Wales, in 1902, was £n6 4s., and that it gradually increased until now it is £128 2s. In the same period the pay in Victoria has increased from £123 8s. to £130 8s., but in Queensland it has decreased from £136 4s. to £129 is., though in 1903-4 it was £142. In South Australia the average pay has increased from £ir6 5s. to £135 5s., and in Western Australia, from £126 2s. to £137 3s. </para>

                            <para>- The Queensland public servants urge that they are not receiving the fair play that is extended to others nearer the Seat of Government. At any rate, the figures require some explanation. The number of public servants in the Post and Telegraph Department in Queensland has increased from 1,502 in 1909 to 2,977, but in Victoria there has also been an increase from 2,400 to 4»529 &gt; and I suppose that some juniors must have been appointed in the latter State. The public servants of Queensland believe that they are not getting fair play. I am not in a position to say whether they are justified in that belief, but I give the official figures supplied by the Post and Telegraph Department, and I say that they require explanation. Honorable senators are bound, I think, to say what they believe to be true, and I believe that some system is adopted which places Queensland in an invidious position. I hope that Ministers will be able to explain the matter, not for my sake, but for the sake of the people who feel aggrieved. _ I asked a question to-day in connexion with the matter, and was told that it was under consideration, and would be remedied. I had to put up with that answer, but I now quote specific figures, and why lower rates should be paid in Queensland than in other parts of Australia I do not know. </para>

                            <para>- I shall not continue the argument. The facts speak, for themselves. I do not know what wages are paid in the coal mines of Queensland, as I have never had anything to do with coal mining in that State, but I say that in the gold-mining industry there are still being paid in Queensland, and have been paid for the last forty years, higher wages than are being paid in any other State with the exception of Western Australia. We know that a big rush took place to Western Australia when gold was discovered there, and as things were very dear, it was necessary that the wages paid should be very high. But we find that they are now gradually coming down more nearly to the level of those paid in the other States. </para>

                            <para>- If we take into consideration the cost of living in the two States, I think we shall find that the wages paid in Queensland are really higher than those paid in Western Australia. We have heard a lot about what the land tax has done for Australia, but my reading leads me to believe that, instead of the area of land under cultivation increasing, as it ought to do, by thousands of .acres, the figures show a falling off. </para>

Honorable senators have said something about a match industry in Victoria, which employs 400 people. I have every sympathy with the people engaged in that industry, but we have in Queensland an industry which supports, not 400, but some 25,000 people, who are not getting what they asked for from this Labour Government. </para>

                            <para>- Within the last ten years the Federal Parliament has bled the people concerned in, that industry to. the tune of £2,100,000. According to the official returns, that amount of money has been taken from the " man on the land " in Queensland. It is he who finds work for the mills, the shipping, and the labour on the wharfs. But is there any consideration extended to him? We know there is mot. We have done away with black labour. I was in Queensland forty years ago, and long before <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens,</inline> who mentioned my. name in connexion with the matter to-day, saw the place. There is no man who can say "that I did not fight my best from 1873 or 1874, when the first kanakas were introduced to be taken out west, to prevent their introduction.. When <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Thomas</inline> Mcllwraith and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith became members of the same Government in Queensland, although I was returned to the State Parliament to support <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith, I crossed the floor of the House, and spoke against the Coalition Government. I have all my life been against the introduction of any black labour into this country. We have got rid of coloured labour now. It was done away with some time ago ; but we still continue to exact an Excise duty of £1 per ton on sugar in excess of the bounty paid, and that is taken from the grower. No one can deny that, because the millers have said that if the Excise duty were done awa]' with they would be prepared to give the growers 2s. 2d. per ton more for their cane. Has the Federal Parliament risen to the occasion in dealing with the sugar industry ? It is indifferent to those engaged in that industry. They are 2,000 miles away, and, apparently, do not concern us. I have stated that since Federation those engaged in the industry have paid into the Consolidated Revenue of the Commonwealth no less than £2,100,000. Now they ask that the Excise should be abolished. I contend that the Commonwealth is not dealing fairly with the sugar growers of Queensland, who were induced to embark upon the industry in the expectation that they would be fairly dealt with. </para>

The honorable senator did not tell us the value of the land - probably he does not know, nor does he care, what is its value.

                            <para>- Probably the honorable senator is correct. People would not trust him, I suppose. In South Australia there have been as many as  200  applicants for a single block. So long as a man puts up the deposit that is necessary in the case of the most valuable block for which he applies, he is at liberty to apply for every block that is available. So that the honorable senator's argument does not prove anything. I also desire to refer to a statement which was made by the Minister of Defence. If his argument was intended to apply only to that one piece of land which was purchased by the South Australian Government, there might be something in it. But the value of the country in which I knew him first has risen from  15s.  per acre, a year or two ago, to £6 or £7 per acre, because its productive capacity has increased under improved methods of cultivation. It was the Yongala Estate which he had in his mind. It was purchased by the South Australian Government for something like  £3  per acre, and it is a fact that the adjoining estate has been sold during the past few months at <inline font-style="italic">£6</inline> or £7 per acre. But it is not the circumstance that people have been settled on that land which has raised its value. Its enhanced value is the result of its increased productive capacity. </para>

                            <para>- They were there before. I sold land in that neighbourhood a few years ago for  15s.  per acre. The enhanced price is due to the adoption of an entirely different system  of cultivation.  It is directly traceable to the use of the combined seed and fertilizer drill in the cultivation of crops, and to the adoption of bare fallow. It is not due to the fact that the Labour party occupy the Treasury benches. When the Minister of Defence quoted figures with a view to showing that the area under our principal crops had increased largely since the advent of the Labour party to power, he was asked by the Leader of the Opposition to state the increase which occurred during the year  1911-12  as compared with  1910-n.  He stated that that increase amounted to  500,000  acres, but when the Leader of the Opposition pinned him down he said it was  300,000  acres, and eventually he confessed that it was only  211,000  acres. If that is the way in which the Government want to hoodwink the Senate, I am very sorry. I had .a much better opinion of the Minister of Defence. I thought that if he had to quote any figures he would quote them correctly, and not try to mislead the Senate. </para>

                        <para>. -I should not have risen to reply if honorable senators had allowed the measure to pass a little earlier, but there is still plenty of time. I want to correct one statement made by  the  Leader of the Opposition. There are many other statements which I would also like to correct, but I shall not waste the time of the Senate by doing so to-night. When the honorable senator referred to one month's Supply of  £882,000  and multiplied it by three, making a total of  £2,600,000  odd, he thought that he had discovered something. But if he had looked down, he would have found that the one month's Supply included  £50,000  for refunds of revenue, and  £150,000  for the Treasurer's Advance; while the three months' Supply with which we are dealing includes only  £75,000  for refunds of revenue, and  £150,000  for the Treasurer's Advance. If you multiply the  £150,000  by three, and the  £50,000  by three, you will get a difference of  £400,000.  That does away with anything in the argument of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> with respect to the disparity between the first one month's Supply and this three months' Supply. I think it is only fair that it should be pointed out, in the hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> before he makes rash statements again, will take the trouble to  find  out the correct position. </para>

                        <para>. - The honorable senator will recollect that a question was asked here with respect to the number of schools and teachers in the Northern Territory, and that in reply it was stated that there were three teachers. He will also recollect that the provision in this Bill is only for three months. So far as I know, the appointment of the highly-paid officer he referred to has not yet been made. The honorable senator will see that this vote is for the teachers who are already there. With respect to the appointment of the highly-salaried officer to whom reference has so frequently been made, I may say that if honorable senators will turn to the Works and Buildings Estimates which we have already passed, they will see that provision was made for the erection of several schools for the purpose of teaching native children, and also schools exclusively for half-castes. These schools will be in operation probably before this highly-paid officer has an opportunity of exercising his ability in the Northern Territory. </para>

                    <para>I wish to make a statement for the information of honorable senators. The Maternity Allowance Bill was assented to by the Governor-General to-day, and a proclamation was issued. Consequently all those now entitled to the maternity allowance may send in claims from to-day. But, payments cannot be made before the1st November. It is impossible to bring the necessary machinery into action before that date. I may add that until the1st November it will be necessary for claims to be sent to the various State capitals. They cannot be received elsewhere. As soon as the Department is properly organized, officers for receiving claims will be appointed in various parts of the Commonwealth. It will, however, be recognised that some time must elapse before the printed application forms, and other papers respecting this legislation, can be distributed, and officers authorized to receive claims and make payments. The Government are doing all they possibly can to make the maternity allowance available to the women of Australia as speedily as possible. </para>

                        <para>. - I wish to bring under the notice of Ministers a curious practice which has recently been followed in relation to calling for applications for positions in the Public Service. They are advertised in such a way that officers in distant portions of the Commonwealth are not enabled to send in applications at all. Cases have been brought under my notice where the last date for sending in applications has been so fixed by notice in the <inline font-style="italic">Government Gazette</inline> as absolutely to preclude persons in Western Australia from sending in applications. </para>

                            <para>- For positions in the Public Service. This happens even in regard to the coastal districts of Western Australia, where people have the best opportunities of sending in applications through the ordinary channel. It applies still more forcibly to persons situated in far-distant localities. I bring this matter under the notice of Ministers in the hope that a speedy alteration will be made. I do not say that other distant parts of the Commonwealth are not similarly situated in this regard, but it is manifestly unfair to call for applications in such a way as to debar possible applicants from distant parts of the Commonwealth from competing on equal terms with those residing in the Seat of Government or close at hand. I do not say that the people of the West are more anxious to secure positions in the Public Service than are residents in any other part of the Commonwealth. We are quite prepared to pay our share of the bill in respect of the Public Service ; but we are certainly anxious to have equal opportunities with people resident in towns and districts nearer at hand to obtain employment in the Service. I merely bring the matter under the notice of Ministers in order that greater care may be exercised in the future, so that persons residing in remote parts of Australia will have just the same chance  of  competing for positions in the Public Service as have residents of Melbourne, Sydney, or any other big centre of population near at hand. </para>
