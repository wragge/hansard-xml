                            <para>- I am afraid that the question asked by the Leader pf the Opposition will not assist a solution of the industrial problems at Newcastle. Honorable senators opposite  seldom  miss an opportunity to ventilate industrial disputes in this chamber for political propaganda purposes. I remind him that .in 1940, when we were in the midst of a war, 10,000 coal-miners were on strike at Newcastle for more than ten weeks, during which coal production amounting to nearly 1,000,000 tons was lost. An anti-Labour government - was in office at that time, but the then Opposition did not take advantage of the occasion for propaganda purposes. This Government is just as desirous as the Opposition or anyone, else that there should be a continuity of production, but certain factors arise. The dispute at Newcastle is an inter-union dispute, and efforts ere being made to settle it. The machinery for settling such disputes exists, and I do not think that any government, whatever its political, complexion may be, should interfere with the work of industrial tribunals. I ask the Leader of the Opposition what action he would have this Government take. </para>

With regard to the question he asked concerning the loss of orders for export of steel for this country, I have not seen the press report to which he refers. I do not always have time before coming to the chamber  to  read all the various newspapers. However, I would point out to the Leader of the Opposition that because of Australia's natural resources and the ability of its workmen, this country produces the finest steel in the world, and I should be surprised if orders were lost to Australia through industrial disputation. There may be some falling off of production, but that is not to be wondered at in such a huge industry as the steel industry. Industrial unrest is not confined to Australia ; indeed some of the disputes which have occurred here have been the result  of upheavals in the industrial life of the </para>

                            <para>- The Glen Davis project is one of the industries that the Labour Government inherited from its predecessors. This industry was established by the Menzies Government and it has had the full support of the present Government, which believes in the development of Australian industries. Unfortunately, the history of the Glen Davis project has not been a happy one. Extreme difficulties have had to be overcome. For example, water supplies were not adequate for the proper conduct of the industry, Large quantities of water are needed for treatment of the shale. Only in recent months has sufficient water been available. During the war, it was not possibleto instal an adequate water supply system because men and materials had to be employed on more urgent war requirements. I shall endeavour to obtain the figures requested by the honorable senator and supply them to him at the earliest opportunity. I believe that he will find that a considerable improvement has occurred at Glen Davis and that there is a prospect of oil being recovered at a reasonable cost. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator has not indicated the period during which prices have increased to the degree mentioned by her. It is a fact that the prices of clothing have risen, but the Prices Commissioner exercises a close scrutiny over such matters. If manufacturing costs rise appreciably, it is only to be expected that they will be reflected in some degree in the prices- of manufactured goods. "With regard to many items, of that kind, it has been the. policy of the Government to ease prices by means of a su'bsidy, but the policy of the Government now is gradually to eliminate subsidies wherever possible. It is impossible to avoid increases of prices of goods of the kind mentioned by the honorable senator. I should like to check up on the figure of from  300  per cent, to  400  per cent, increase. I snail examine the matter further. </para>

Other anomalies have arisen under the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act. which also could be dealt with by a committee similar to that which was appointed some years ago to examine repatriation legislation. Does the Government intend to appoint a similar committee for the purpose I have mentioned ? </para>

I snail bring to the attention of the Minister for Repatriation the suggestion made by the honorable senator. It may be that, with the passage of time various anomalies have arisen and that improvements oan now be effected to the legislation which was first enacted following World War I. I assure the honorable senator that the idea underlying his suggestion will receive careful consideration by the Minister. I remind the honorable senator, however, that at the time ordinary civilian, pensions were increased, an announcement was made that war pensions also would be increased. Legislation to do so will .be introduced shortly in the House of Representatives, and 1 : believe that it will come before the Senate before the present session concludes. </para>

                            <para>It is practically impossible to buy mechanically-sound second-hand cars at all, because their owners want them for their own use. Used cars are normally placed on the market for one of three reasons - (a) The owner has acquired a new one; (6) the owner has left the Commonwealth; (c) the owner has died. It is evident therefore that only a limited number of cars reaches the secondhand market and under present conditions the owner of a. vehicle is not anxious to part with it. The black market in second-hand motor cars consists mostly of a limited number of worn out and useless vehicles which come back again and again into the hands of unscrupulous traders. There is not the flow of used cars on the market that existed when there were ample new cars to replace them. </para>

                            <para>The fictitious value placed on second-hand cars to-day is based on the shortage of supply and not on the value of the vehicle as a piece of mechanical equipment. If there were a plentiful supply of new cars to-day even at current new prices it is believed that few second-hand cars -would realize the maximum prices fixed by the Prices Commissioner. The maximum price of <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> .popular car for which the new price in 1939 was £412 is now £294 - representing a. depreciation of less than £15 a year for eight years. If the price had been as high as £700 in 1939, the maximum price of £294 would still be higher than its normal value for insurance purposes or its normal value for taxation purposes. </para>

As an example of what is happening in that country there is evidence that a price of £850 was realized at auction for a used 1940 vehicle of which the new price was £422. If cars were decontrolled the same thing would happen in Australia. </para>

                    <para class="block">The bill before honorable senators provides for a substantial reduction of the existing rates of income tax payable by individuals. The reduced rales will apply to income derived from the 1st July, 1947. As I indicated in my second-read ing speech on the Income Tax Assessment Bill, the Government also proposes to increase the amounts on which concessional rebates for dependants are to be based. The combined effect of these proposals will be to reduce the revenue from income tax by £24,500,000 per annum. Taken in conjunction with the proposed reduction of the social services contribution, the total relief to be granted to taxpayers will approximate £33,000,000 per annum. Under the new scale of rates, liability to income tax will not commence until the income reaches £251, instead of the present figure of £201. The personal exertion rate will average one-tenth of one penny in the £1 on a taxable income of £251, and will increase progressively until an average rate of 9s. 1.6d. is reached on a taxable income of £5,000. Where the taxable income exceeds £5,000, the first £5,000 will bear tax at the rate of 9s. 1.6d. in the £1, and the excess over £5,000 at the rate of 13s. 6d. in the £1. In addition to income tax, a social services contribution at ls. 6d. in the £1 is payable, making a total maximum combined rate of 15s. in the £1 . Rates of tax for property income are slightly in excess of those for personal exertion in the lower brackets of income. The margin between the two rates progressively increases until the income reaches £1,000, at which point the combined rate of income tax and social services contribution on income from property is approximately 25 per cent, greater than the combined rate on income from personal exertion. Thereafter, the difference between personal exertion and property rates gradually diminishes until the maximum income tax rate of 13s. 6d. in the £1 is payable on the excess over £5,000, whether the income be from personal exertion or property. </para>
                    <para>The new rates of tax, combined with the proposed increase of the amounts upon which rebates for dependants are to be based, will have the effect of raising the amounts of income which may be derived by persons with dependants before incurring any liability for income tax as distinct from the social services contribution. The amounts which may now be derived before becoming liable to income tax, as distinct from the social services contribution, as compared with existing i mounts, are as follows.: - </para>

                    <para>As I have already mentioned, the new r;ites will apply as from the 1st July next, and, under the " pay-as-you-earn " plan, will be reflected in the tax instalments to be deducted from salary or wages payable on and from that date. A corresponding reduction will also be made of the provisional tax payable in respect  if  income, other than salaries or wages,  nf  the year ending the 30th June, 1948. Tables showing the amounts of income  i :ix  and social services contribution payable by persons on selected incomes and comparing these amounts with amounts payable under the existing scale and under the war-time scale, have been circulated to honorable senators. These tables show that although all classes of taxpayers will benefit from the reductions, the greatest benefit will be received  by  persons with dependants. These taxpayers will receive reductions ranging from 100 per cent, on the lowest income to approximately 10 per cent, on high incomes. </para>

                        will also be noted that the total tax iii id contribution payable by the majority nf taxpayers will be less than one-half, of the war-time tax on a corresponding income. For example, a taxpayer with  m  dependent wife and two children will hil ve received reductions amounting to more than 50 per cent, of his war-time tax if his income does not exceed £800. The other provisions of the bill correspond to those included in the annual income tax rating measure. I commend the bill to the Senate.

                    <para class="block">The purpose of this bill is ito reduce the rates of' social services contribution payable in the lower income ranges. The proposed reductions, combined with the increased rebatable amounts for dependants, as proposed for income tax purposes, will cost approximately £8,500,000 per annum. "When the reduced income tax rates are also taken into account, the total loss of revenue will be £33,000,000 per annum. It is proposed that the new rates of contribution shall operate as from the 1st July next. </para>
                    <para>The rate of contribution payable by a contributor who would not be entitled to any rebates for dependants, life assurance, &amp;c, in his income tax assessment, &lt; is the basie rate. This rate at present commences at 3d. in £1 and increases by one-eighth of Id. for every £1 of income in excess of £100, until the maximum rate of 18d. in £1 is reached at an income of £220. The bill proposes that the basic rate shall commence at 3d. in £1, but shall increase by only one-tenth of Id.. instead of one-eighth of Id., for every £1 of income in excess of £100. The effect of this proposal will be that the maximum rate of 18d. in £1 will be reached at an income of £250 instead of £220 as formerly. In cases where the contributor is entitled, for income tax purposes, to rebates for dependants, life assurance.&amp;c., the basic rate will be varied by reference to the total amount on which these rebates are calculated. The rate ;so ascertained will be termed the concessional rate. A slight variation of the method of ascertaining the concessional rate is proposed. This variation, taken in conjunction with the proposed increase of the  amounts upon which rebates for dependants are to be based, will have the effect of raising the limits of income which may be derived by persons with dependants before incurring liability for social services contribution. A further effect will be that the maximum concessional rate of 18d. will be reached at approximately the same point as that at which liability to income tax commences. </para>

                    <para>One of the effects of heavy war-time taxes, particularly estate duty and income tax, was to cause people to endeavour to avoid some part of these lia bilities by making gifts of their assets to members of their families. The main purpose of the gift duty legislation was to protect these sources of revenue by discouraging this tendency, or at least to obtain from such persons a payment of gift duty to off-set the loss of revenue resulting from such gifts. The experience of five years' administration of the legislation has shown that some amendments of the act are desirable, and this bill contains those amendments.I believe that honorable senators will find that these amendments are not of a contentious nature. </para>
                    <para>Under the present law, the statutory exemption is £500, i.e., if the value of all gifts made by any one donor within a period of three years does not exceed £500 no duty is payable. It has been decided to increase this exemption to £2,000. The purpose of the increase is to avoid imposing duty in a large number of exceptional cases to which it was not intended the law should apply, such as the transfer of a family residence from a husband to his wife, or the purchase of a residence bya wife in her name with money accumulated from housekeeping savings. Another type of case which will be relieved of liability for gift duty under this amendment is the settlement of a son on the land by a primary producer where the gift involved in property and stock does not exceed £2,000 in value. This decision to increase the exemption will be effected by an amendment of the Gift Duty Act, which sets out the rates of duty payable, but an amendment of section 19 of the Assessment Act is also involved. That section at present provides for the lodgment of a return by a person making a gift, the value of which taken together with all other gifts made within the preceding eighteen months, exceeds £250.This provision is being amended to increase the exemption from £250 to £1,500. Whilst the statutory exemption is £2,000, the figure of £1,500 is being adopted so as to provide for a difference of opinion between the donor and the Commissioner of Taxation as to the value of the gift. Section 16 of the act was intended to make liable to duty any disposition of property between relatives where the whole of the purchase money is not paid in cash at the time the transfer takes place. It has been found, however, that the section does not operate in an equitable manner. An instance of inequitable operation, is that if the outstanding balance is secured by mortgage, or in a  way  which brings it within section 16, the transaction is liable to duty, whilst, if the balance is not secured, the transaction is not liable to duty. A transfer of land in consideration of an annuity charged upon- the land would be subject to duty, but if the annuity were not charged on the land no duty would be payable. In such h case if the transferor retained a life interest in. the property instead of taking an annuity charged upon the land, there would be no duty payable. It was intended that the section should prevent a parent giving his son a property valued at, say, £10,000, and making it appear that he was selling the property to the son by requiring a deposit of £500 and leaving the balance of £9,500 outstanding as a debt due by the son. This outstanding debt could then be forgiven by periodical gifts small enough to avoid gift duty. However, even with, the benefit of increased exemption it would take nearly fourteen years to forgive such a balance without attracting duty. The possibility of loss of any substantial amount of revenue by such a device is therefore considered to be negligible. Under the circumstances the Government decided that, instead of amending the section to remove the anomalies which exist, it would be preferable to repeal it. </para>
                    <para>Some gifts which have been subject to gift duty subsequently become liable to estate duty by reason of the fact that gifts made within three years of the death of the donor form part of his estate for estate duty purposes. In order, therefore, to avoid a double liability in respect of the same gift, section 15 of the act provides for the allowance of a rebate of the gift duty or the estate duty applicable to the gift, whichever is the less. This is a more appropriate provision and will make for better administration if it is incorporated in the Estate Duty Assessment Act. Section 15 of this act is therefore being repealed and a comparable provision is being inserted in the Estate Duty Assessment Act. </para>

                    <para class="block">This bill gives effect to the Government's decision to increase the minimum amount liable to duty from £500 to £2,000, and removes an existing anomaly by providing for the tapering-off of the duty in those cases where the value of the gift exceeds £2,000 by only a small amount. The rate of duty on gifts up to £10,000 is 3 per cent., so that, if no tapering-off of duty were provided for, gifts of an aggregate value of £2,001 would be subject to duty of £60, whilst if the value were only £2,000 no duty would be payable. This anomaly is overcome by the insertion of a provision which ensures that the duty on the gift shall not in future exceed one-half of the amount by which the value of the gift, or the aggregate value of all the gifts within the statutory period of three years, exceeds £2,000. By this means the full rate of 3 per cent, tax does not apply until the value of the gift exceeds £2,127. </para>
                    <para>One of the effects of the increase of the exemption is that it will comply with many requests recently received by the Government that exemption from gift duty should be granted on gifts to ex-servicemen to a maximum value of £2,000. The Government is glad to have been able to comply with these requests. </para>

                <para>It was found necessary to amend the Estate Duty Assessment Act in regard to the special deduction of  £5,000  allowed in the case of estates of members of the forces, and opportunity has been taken to make some other necessary amendments, none of which is of a contentious nature. </para>
                <para>Clause  3  of the bill provides three amendments to the principal act, the first of which will, I am sure, be very welcome to solicitors and trustee companies. It provides for exemption from duty of all gifts <inline font-style="italic">inter vivos</inline> of amounts not exceeding  £50  in value, or, where more than one gift is made to the same person by the deceased, the aggregate value does not exceed  £50.  It has been represented to the Government that it is inequitable to charge duty on small gifts which form part of the normal expenditure of the deceased person. Furthermore, the tracing and identification of these small gifts in the accounts of the deceased impose additional work on executors and solicitors out of all proportion to the revenue involved. It has, therefore, been decided to grant the exemption contained in the bill. The second amendment embodied in clause  3  corrects an anomaly arising from the present wording of paragraph <inline font-style="italic">c</inline> of sub-section 4 of section 8 of the act. That paragraph provides for the inclusion in the estate of the deceased person of property comprised in a settlement made by the deceased under which he had a life interest, whether or not he had surrendered that interest at any time before his decease. Under this provision the property comprised in such a settlement forms part of the deceased's estate for estate duty purposes even though he may have surrendered his life interest many years prior to his decease. The surrendering of such an interest more than three years prior to his death means, of course, that the deceased has divested himself of all interest in the property comprised in the settlement, and that the same conditions should apply as to other gifts <inline font-style="italic">inter vivos,</inline> i.e., they should not form part of the estate unless made within three years of the death of the deceased. It is therefore proposed that effect shall now be given to this view, and where the lifeinterest of the deceased has been surrendered more than three years prior to his death the property shall not form part of his estate. The third amendment proposed by clause  3  inserts in the act a provision for the allowance of a rebate to avoid double duty in respect of property included in the estate as a gift <inline font-style="italic">inter vivos,</inline> which is also subject to a gift duty. Provision for the allowance of such a rebate is at present contained in the Gift Duty Assessment Act and it is being transferred to the Estate Duty Assessment Act in order to make the administration of both acts more efficient. Clause 4 of the bill redrafts section 9 of the act. Section  9 provides  for a deduction of  £5,000  in the case of the estates of members of the fighting forces who have died or die during the war or within three years after its termination, as a result of injuries received or disease contracted on active service. It has been found, however, that the section does not apply in the case of persons who have been discharged from the forces. Clause 4 removes this anomaly and the new provision will apply in the cases of discharged members as well as members of the forces. </para>
                <para>Sections 17 and 18 of the act provide for the deduction of debts due and owing by the deceased at the time of his death, including Commonwealth and State income and land taxes which become due and payable after death and within one year after the payment of estate duty. The intention was that income andland taxes assessed subsequent to death on income derived and land owned prior to death should be allowed as deductions. Because of the wording of the present act, however, many large estates are receiving deductions for substantial amounts of taxes assessed in respect of income derived and land owned by the executors of the estates subsequent to the date of death. The amendment made by clause  5  of the bill will ensure that the original intention shall become effective. </para>

                        <para>. - In continuing the debate which was adjourned last night, I express any delight that such an important billis being initiated in the Senate. Far too few measures are initiated in this chamber ; almost invariably honorable senators have to deal with legislation which has already been thoroughly debated in the House of Representatives. My delight is, however, tinged with regret that the discussion by the Senate of this important bill, which will affect every person in the community, is not being broadcast to-day. En my opinion, arrangements should have been made for that to be done. It is true that the speeches of honorable senators will be recorded in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> but the listening public will not have an opportunity to hear the debate in this chamber. </para>

                            <para>- I have not that figure at hand; but we know that the total cost of social services at present is £72,000,000 a year. This Government has done more than any other government in the world in an honest attempt to give effect to the first two freedoms of the Atlantic Charter - freedom from want and freedom from fear. In view of the magnitude of the benefits to be provided under this measure, it behoves all of us to do everything possible in the future to ensure that the money required to finance them shall he provided. To my mind one of the most welcome features of the scheme is that the money necessary to provide these benefitswill be provided from the incomes of those best able to carry this burden. I was interested to note that a taxation measure introduced this morning will exempt from income tax, and also from social service contribution, a large section of the people who will be eligible to receive the benefits under this measure. </para>

                    <para>I should like the Minister in charge of the bill to enlighten me on several points. I refer, first, to persons who have reached the age of 65 years, but, because they have been sufficiently thrifty to put aside savings, cannot qualify for the old-age. pension, and at the same time, because  they are not able to sustain themselves from those sources are obliged to continue to work in industry. In the past, these persons have been at a very distinct disadvantage, because, unless the Director-General of Social Services saw fit to approve their application, they could not qualify for an old-age pension; whilst, should they lose employment because of strikes in other industries, or other causes they are not eligible to receive unemployment benefit. They are excluded from receiving either the old-age pension or unemployment benefit. I should like the Minister to inform me what is to he the permanent position of that class of person under this measure. </para>
                    <para>Child endowment is another important feature of the bill. "Whilst I do not wish co take any credit from the Opposition parties for placing the Child Endowment Act upon the statute-book, nevertheless, that legislation was introduced for a purpose not altogether worthy. The government of the day called into consultation on the matter a judge of the Arbitration Court, because at that time the trade union movement had applied for an increase of the basic wage, and the judge had determined that the basic wage at that time was sufficient only to meet the cost of living of a married man with a wife and one child. It was in order to save industry from having to pay the cost of an increase of the basic wage based on the regimen then in existence that child endowment was introduced by the government of the day, and was paid at the rate of 5s. a week in respect of each child excluding the eldest under sixteen years of age. That resulted in the abandonment of the Arbitration Court's inquiry into the basic wage. Had the inquiry been pursued to its conclusion, an increase of the wage would probably have been granted; but that increase would have been payable to a much wider section of the community than is covered by child endowment, because that increase of the basic wage would have been payable to a single man and a married man with a wife and only one child. Therefore, while the Opposition parties claim full credit for the introduction of child endowment, their action was not so praiseworthy as one might be led to believe. The Oppposition parties were not so liberal as this Government has been in the matter. They introduced child endowment in order to relieve industry of the additional cost of an increase of the basic wage. That was the atmosphere in which child endowment was instituted. Whilst the Opposition parties havestrongly advocated endowment in respect, of the eldest child under sixteen, I am pleased that the Government has not made any move in that direction which would penalize any section of workers, and I hope that it will not do so unless it can see its way clear to pay endowment in respect of the eldest child under sixteen, and, at the same time, retain thu basic wage assessed on the existing regimen which is based on the cost of living of a man, wife and one child. Otherwise, no material advantage will be given to the single man or a. married man with a wife and only one child. Until some improvement is madein the computation of the basic wagewhich allows an amount of 12s. 6d. in respect of one child, the Government, should do nothing to disturb the present arrangement. </para>
                    <para>The pharmaceutical benefits to be provided under this measure represent a substantial advance upon those already provided. I hope that when the Government has finally reached an agreement on this matter, the friendly societies' medical associations which have co-operated with the Government right from the commencement of this scheme, will not be in any way debarred from disbursing such benefits. The friendly societies movement ha? done a great deal to assist the Government in implementing this scheme. As a matter of fact, some of those societies have gone so far as to offer, in the event of no agreement being arrived at between the Government and the private chemists, to do what they can to implement the scheme. But, of course, that would he beyond the resources of friendly societies in some of the States, particularly the larger States where the friendly society movement has not developed so rapidly on the medicine benefit side as it has in the smaller States. Whilst friendly societies in one State might be able to meet the Government's requirements, those in another State are not. sufficiently equipped to do so. I hope that every encouragement will be given to the expansion of friendly societies so far as their participation in the disbursement of these benefits is concerned. That will not place upon the societies a very great burden, because to-day, they employ trained chemists and will only need to obtain sufficient staffs to undertake the duties involved in the free medicine scheme. However, that will involve the training of more chemists than are now available. I mention this aspect because I am particularly anxious to see the greatest possible co-operation between the Government, the friendly societies and the pharmaceutical societies for the mutual advancement of all sections involved. </para>
                    <para>I  should  like to obtain an estimate of the actual saving that will be effected in the interests of recipients of these benefits. What cost would they have to meet in order to obtain these benefits personally through insurance companies or other organizations? What would be the weekly contribution involved to obtain coverage in respect of the total benefits provided under this legislation ? I know that it will be said that a section of the community will not receive these benefits because they are debarred by the means test; but there are certain benefits to which the means test does not apply, and it is the intention of the Government to work towards the total elimination of the means test. I hope that we shall be able to achieve that goal. In view of the amount required to be invested at 3£ per cent, interest in order to yield a weekly return of £1,199,000, which is the cost of these benefits, what contribution weekly would recipients have to make personally to an insurance company to cover them for these benefits'!- I believe that the estimate would be astonishing. </para>

                    <para class="block">T am not clear whether that means that in future those who pay contributions to friendly societies and other bodies for sickness benefit will be obliged to join approved societies. At present those entitled to sickness benefit can receive £2 a week without affecting their actual sick pay benefit provided the society is an approved society under the act.' Thousands of workmen in industry contribute weekly to what are known as sickness and accident funds. These funds provide certain weekly payments ranging from £1 a week upwards. When the unemployment and sickness benefits scheme was inaugurated, it was found that these payments were deducted from the sickness benefit because the societies making them had not become approved societies within the meaning of the act. This caused the organizations concerned to amend their rules to provide that the payment should be made not to the member of the fund himself, but to his wife or some other dependant. This device overcame the obstacle, but I hope that this measure will rectify the anomaly. My reading of the bill leads mo to believe that it will, but I hope that the Minister will enlighten me on this matter, because it is one in which I have been particularly interested. I shall have more to say about the details of this measure when it reaches the committee stage. In conclusion I should like to commend the Minister most sincerely for his enlightening second-reading speech, and for the capable manner in which he has handled the introduction of this measure. </para>

                        (Western Australia) 1 12. 3]. - I welcome the introduction of this 'bill, the object of which is to consolidate the laws relating to social services. Our social benefits come broadly under five headings, invalid and old-age pensions, widows' pensions, maternity allowances, child endowment, and unemployment and sickness benefits. A measure such as this is essential, not only because of the benefits for which it provides, but also because it is most desirable that our social services legislation should be available in a concise form. As a member of this Parliament I have been requested on innumerable occasions in the last few years to supply information in regard to social service benefits. Answering these inquiries has very often necessitated a search of our statute-hook. This bill will provide easy reference to these matters.
                    </para>
                    <para>I, too, congratulate the Minister for Social Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator</inline> McKenna)  upon the work he has accomplished in relation to this measure, and upon the wealth of information that he provided in his second-reading speech. Any one who listened attentively to that speech could not fail to understand the exact purport of the bill. I was. pleased also to hear the Minister express appreciation of the services rendered to this Parliament by his two predecessors, namely, the present Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holloway),</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser,</inline> who last held the portfolio of Social Services. These gentlemen worked hard to improve OU] social services. When holding ministerial office, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline> worked most assiduously on the many intricate problems associated with our social services generally. I have particular regard for the efforts that he made to reach an understanding with the Australian, section of the British. Medical Association in respect of the proposed pharmaceutical benefits scheme. I say " proposed ", because although the Pharmaceutical Benefits Act is already on our statute-book, it was declared invalid by the High Court, and has yet to be re-enacted in accordance with the new social services powers conferred upon the Commonwealth at the last referendum. In his second-reading speech, the Minister informed the Senate that the Commonwealth's new powers enabled this Parliament to make laws with respect to maternity allowances, widows' pensions, child endowment, unemployment, pharmaceutical, sickness and hospital benefits, medical and dental services, but not so as to authorize any form of civil conscription, benefits to students, and family allowances.. This measure does not embrace all those services ; but wc know that at a later stage the Government proposes to introduce further legislation pursuant to the new powers that have been conferred upon the Parliament. It is interesting to note the Minister's statement that the alteration of the Constitution not only confirmed the Commonwealth's authority to provide social services benefits already in existence, but also granted almost unlimited power in new and important fields of social services. .That is most important and illustrates the fact that since 1941 when the Curtin Labour Government assumed office,. Labour's approach to the question of social services generally has been most constructive, and its accomplishments substantial. Compare the achievements of the last six or' seven years with what has been done by all previous Commonwealth Governments since Federation. In 1909, our first social services legislation, the Invalid and Oldage Pensions Act was placed on the statute-book. In 1912 the Maternity Allowances Bill was passed, and then, in 1941, the Child Endowment Act became law. It is estimated that expenditure on social services for the year 19-47-48 will be £72,000,000. Prior to 1941, the total annual expenditure by the Commonwealth on these services was between £14,000,000 and £16,000,000. These figures emphasize the development that has taken place in national welfare under Labour administration. The Minister said that the total annual cost of social service* in recent years was indicative of the extensive growth that had taken place. He showed that in 1938-39 the expenditure under this heading was £16,400,000, in 1939-40 £16,800,000 and in 1940-41. £17,700,000. Expenditure increased progressively year by year until in 1944-45 it reached £39,400,000. In the following year it rose steeply to £52,000,000, and then in 1946-47 it reached £57,500,000. The Leader of the Opposition( <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLeay)</inline> expressed the view that owing to the huge social services bill that we were incurring, there was a danger that we might be unable to -find the finance necessary to meet our liabilities. </para>

                        <para>- It is not. This Go.vernment unlike other administrations in this country and elsewhere in the world has not based its social services structure solely on the principle of contributions. It has based its method of financing these services on taxation, which is graduated according to the ability of people to pay. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para class="block">As cbe Leader of the Opposition has said, approximately 86 per cent, of the taxpayers of Australia pay for social benefits. What is wrong with that? The Government has endeavoured to spread social service contributions and income - tax. payments over as great a range of the people as possible. Owing to. the tremendous expenses caused by the war, it had to levy income tax and social service contributions upon low ranges of income r.hat previously were exempt. However, it Kas since raised the commencing levels, and, as from the 1st July next, further exemptions will become operative. Under the present system, a taxpayer without dependants must earn a little over £2 a week before he is required to make a social service contribution; a taxpayer with n dependent wife must earn a little over £3 a week ; a taxpayer with a dependent wife and one child must earn about £3 7s. a week; a taxpayer with a dependent wife and two children must earn a' little over £4 a week; a taxpayer with a dependent wife and three children must earn nearly £5 a week; and a taxpayer with a dependent wife and four children must earn about £5 7s. a week. Those commencing rates will soon be raised. This shows that the Government is financing its social services with the least possible hardship to the taxpayers. In effect, what is happening under the present system of social services Ls that people are .receiving, benefits from Consolidated Revenue not because they belong to a contributory scheme "but because, as taxpayers, they are called upon to contribute to the nation's revenue on' a <inline font-style="italic">pro rata</inline> basis. These services benefit not only those who contribute to them but also other -m embers of the community who are not in a -sufficiently favorable economic position ' to enable them to contribute. I ask leave to continue my remarks at a later date. </para>
