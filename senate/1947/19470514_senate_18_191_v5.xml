                        <para>- The honorable senator suggests that there are stocks of these materials available at New South Wales ports and that they cannot beshipped to other States because of transport difficulties. This matter was raised in the Senate repeatedly by the Opposition prior to the last elections. Immediately after the last period of the present session of Parliament, I had 150 waterside workers brought from Brisbane, where things were slack, to Newcastle, and within three weeks the back-lag of cargo at that port had been cleared. There is a small back-lag at Newcastle at present, but that is a general condition in the absence of sufficient ships to provide an adequate service. The shippingtonnage available has to be used as economically as possible, and the endeavour of the Australian Shipping Board has always been to distribute cargo equitably. I assure the honorable senator that the Government is endeavouring tohavewhatever materials that are available especially those referred to by the honorable senator, . and building materialstransported as speedily as possible. </para>

                        <para>- I have observed ar meal times that the sugar basins are not so full as they generally are. I do not know whether the shortage applies particularly to the Australian Capital Territory, because, due to various causes, including industrial dislocation and transport difficulties, sugar shortages have occurred in various parts of the Commonwealth. I am sure, however, that in ordinary circumstances, and in the absence of any further undue dislocation, supplies of sugar will be sufficient to meet the needs of the people. </para>

Experimental plantings on a commercial scale were inaugurated in collaboration with  the New South Wale.? Government in 1045, with a promising variety of linseed developed by the New South Wales Department of Agriculture. Further efforts are being made in several States to . develop varieties suited to local conditions and all problems associated with the establishment of this new production are receiving close attention. </para>

I am also able to inform him that recently a conference of  Deputy  Directors of Posts and Telegraphs and other senior postal officials from each State made a thorough survey of the telephone situation. As a result, committees representing various tranches of the department have been set up in each State. They will thoroughly investigate the requirements of each State and, consistent with the availability of materials, will do everything possible to satisfy the demand for telephone installations. The department is now negotiating with the object of establishing additional factories and workshops in Australia so that it will not be dependent upon overseas sources for the supply of equipment. It hopes to be in a position soon to supply all ##'##telephone requirements, including the equipment needed for automatic exchanges in country areas. </para>

                        <para>- The Government has a full appreciation of the work that was : done by- manufacturers in producing hand tools in Australia during thewar, when such equipment could not be obtained from abroad. As far as I can ascertain, the quality of Australian-made tools used in carpentering and othertrades is good. The policy of the Government is to give every encouragement to Australian industries in this regard.. Even if Australian-made tools were not up to the standard of those made overseas, I believe that, .with the improved technique which is being developed . in Australia, the quality could be. made as high as that of imported tools without difficulty. </para>

 <para>The principal cause of the shortage of new cars in Australia is, the loss of production in the manufacturing, countries during the war years. The  present  exceptional demand overseas for new  vehicles  is such that the motor industry is unable to supply the whole of the quantity of new chassis which Australia is prepared to take. The industry has not been able to keep pace with production schedules owing to scarcity of essential materials and other factors  which have limited the output. A contributory reason for the shortage is the difficulty of maintaining, production of locally built and assembled bodies for the chassis, which have been imported due mainly to the scarcity of steel, sheets and other material requirements. The productive capacity for motor body building in Australia is sufficient to supply normal requirements, but the available production has been directed towards supplying bodies for the chassis ot makes in greatest demand. I understand that this has resulted in delays, in equipping some types of chassis with bodies, but the causes ot such delays are due to factors over which the Government has no control.</para>

      <para>No. The Government has- endeavoured to relieve the position by seeking new sources of supply of deep drawing auto body type steel sheets, but this type of sheet is not available in sufficient quantities to supply any appreciable portion of Australia##'##s requirements. </para>

  <para>Australia is at present represented in the Netherlands East Indiesby a consulgeneral atBatavia with a small staff, which from time to time has been augmented to deal with particular problems. In view of the complex political situation that has existed in the area, no alternative arrangement has been either practicable or appropriate. ##'## Functions of an information nature are being discharged by the consulate-general in the course of its normal duties. These functions are supplemented by daily short-wave broadcasts in Dutch and Malay from Australia. The point to be made is that in South-East Asia, Australia and other powers have had to adapt the nature and scale of their representation to the particular circumstances obtaining from time to time in each country where representation is necessary. In most of these countries there have been varying degrees of instability, of one kind or another, as a result of the Japanese war. This is especially true of the Netherlands East Indies where the prospect of settled conditions is only justnow appearing. The Australian Government, which has already established Australian consular representation at six points in South-East Asia whore none existed before, namely, at Singapore, Manila, Bangkok, Batavia, Dili and Colombo, is fully alive to what is required in the way of future representation. Its proposals in this respect make full provision for an adequate measure of Australian publicity throughout the area. </para>

This provision was incorporated in the act on the recommendation of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Broadcasting (1942). The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Broadcasting in its first report to Parliament in February, 1943, stated that ##"## the trend of development now in evidence in favour of Australian composers and the engagement of Australian artists should be allowed to continue without further legislation for the time being##"##. In its eleventh report relating to the control of overseas material for Australian programmes (March,1946), the Standing Committee recommended that certain statistic? should be obtained in respect of programmes transmitted during portion of 1946-47 for the purpose of enabling a decision to be made as to whether there should be quantitative control over the use of imported material and whether any alteration should be made to the 24 per cent. quota prescribed in section 88 (2) of the act. </para>

It is reasonable to assume that as time goes on, and various matters of interpretation are determined, by the High Court, appeals to this superior jurisdiction will become fewer. </para>

                <para class="block">Sundry amendments were made to that section down the years, until in 1930 the Senate, against the wish of the Scullin Government, imported certain amendments into that section, and in particular, to the sub-section that I have quoted. It was then that the appeal to the High Court was instituted. I dealt with this matter fully last Friday. TheGovernment wants speedy decisions in relation to matters affecting industrial disputes. It <inline font-style="italic">has</inline> strengthened the appellate jurisdiction of the Arbitration Court, until now, for the first time, it is the final court of appeal from all judicial decisions of inferior tribunals in proceedings for breaches of awards, offences against the act, matters of interpretation, and so on. So, rather than the status of the Commonwealth Arbitration Courtbeing undermined by this measure, that court is having vested in it an appellate jurisdiction which hitherto has been lacking. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay)</inline> referred to the number of appeals to the High Court over a period of ten years. On Friday, I said that I was not aware of the exact number of appeals involved, but that I considered that they would not have been numerous. I also indicated that I was more particularly interested in what had transpired during the war years, when certain appeals were made from the Arbitration Court to the High Court in circumstances that negated justice. I invited the Leader of the Opposition to have regard to these developments down the years from 1940 to the present.

I believe that the honorable senator is concerned with the definition of ##"##industrial authority ##"## in the Wage Pegging Regulations, and, therefore, I refer him to section 14 of those regulations. The full definition is as follows : -  ##"##Industrial Authority ##"## means the Court and includes any other tribunal or person constituted by or under any law of the Commonwealth for the purpose of hearing and determining industrial disputes and making awards or orders in settlement thereof, and any tribunal which is a State Industrial Authority within the meaning of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904- 1934, and also includes the Public Service Arbitrator and any tribunal, body or persons having power, by virtue of any law, to determine rates of remuneration for apprentices. </para>

                    <para>. - The definition of ##"## organization ##"## is not dealt with in this clause. The point with which the honorable senator is concerned might well be raised when the. committee is considering proposed new section 43o in clause S of the bill. That proposed new section deals with the representation of parties before the court or a conciliation commissioner. However, I see no reason why an organization existent in Victoria that is affiliated with other bodies, should not be registered with the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. I consider that it would be desirable for a body having interstate affiliations, thus demonstrating the possibility of an interstate industrial dispute, to be registered with the court. Honorable senators will agree that the ambit of the court is constantly expanding, and it is highly desirable that bodies engaged in an industry that spreads throughout Australia should be registered with the court. I believe that the difficulty envisaged by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gibson</inline> would disappear if the body which he has in mind would become registered as an organization under the act. </para>

Of  c##'##Ours##'##e,  before such persons can appear they must obtain the leave of the court and the consent of both parties.

                        <para>asked a question regarding the allocation of duties##'####'## between the commissioners. The Chief Judge will first of ail decide whether -any commissioner is to be allocated to -##'##any particular industry. H##'##e may elect to Utilize the  alternative##'##  power ##'##con##'##tain##'##ed in section 15##'## (21), and himself assign a ##'##conciliation commissioner to a- particular industrial dispute. I do not think the legislature should ##'##tie ##'##the hands of the ##'##Chief Judge but should  1##'##e##'##ave  ##'##both avenues  ##"##Open  to Min. Quite frankly, I think what will happen will be this : A man of outstanding ##'##qualifications will be selected for the position, of chief conciliation commissioner, and the Chief Judge##"## , will then allow him to allocate the work between the conciliation commissioners because the chief conciliation commissioner will have  -a  much closer liaison with the commissioners. I ##'##do not suppose that the Chief ##'##Judge will interfere with the allocations made by the chief conciliation commissioner unless##'## he finds that something is  going  wrong or unless a dispute of particular urgency arises and -he is riot satisfied with the allocation made by the chief ##'##conciliation ##'##commissioner. I assure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gibson</inline> that there is no possibility ##'##of conflict between the Chief Judge and the chief conciliation commissioner iri ##'##the allocation of duties because the bill ##'##clearly provides that if the, Chief Judge acts iri the matter the chief conciliation commissioner has nd power to interfere with that allocation. In the past the practice has been to allocate conciliation commissioners to ##'## particular States. For .instance, brie##'## ##'##commissioner is how allocated to  cover  disputes in Victoria and Tasmania, whilst two ##'##other commissioners deal with disputes in South Australia arid Western Australia. From time to time a his-n with##'## particular qualifications may be selected to deal with a dispute anywhere in Australia.- The Government does . not think that in matters of this kind there should be rigid provisions. It admits that this is a new approach to industrial problems, and that to a degree this legislation which is based on judgment and hopes, is experimental. Accordingly, the Government prefers to leave a degree pf flexibility in the legislation so. that, i##'##f necessary, we may proceed by the process 6f trial and error. Although it -is important that the conciliation commissioners shall be selected because . of their knowledge of industry generally, that does  not  necessarily mean that they shall have##'## worked through  every##"##  stage of ari industry. </para>

                <para>Apart from the power vested in the Parliament to remove a conciliation commissioner for proved misconduct or misbehaviour, no other sanctions are imposed. These men will##'## be selected for their outstanding qualifications, including character, so that the likelihood of any of them ceasing to comply with lawful orders is about as remote as is the possibility of a justice of the High Court following such a course. No real difficulty is expected in that connexion. I assure the committee that the Attorney-General recognizes the necessity to appoint the right kind of men as conciliation commissioners. As the Government realizes that the success of this legislation will depend largely on the choices that are made, great care will be taken in the selection of conciliation commissioners. </para>

                <para class="block">I understand that when this legislation is proclaimed proposed section 21 will stand, and also that wage-pegging regulations to which I have just referred will stand. If that be so, a peculiar situation will arise. If the wage-pegging regulations remain, before any of the fifteen . conciliation commissioners can make an award providing for increased rates of pay he will have to obtain the approval of the Chief Judge of the Arbitration Court. This matter was raised in the press and it was discussed in the House of Representatives, but for some unknown reason the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> did not refer to that aspect of the measure in his second-reading speech. Perhaps he thought that it was a matter of high political importance, but whether it was by accident or design, the fact remains that he did not deal with- that point. This committee ought to know that the general opinion held by the public is that the conciliation commissioners will be free, and that their decisions will not be subject to appeal. That misunderstanding may lead to confusion and illfeeling. I do not know how many cases are likely to be affected, or what types of cases which would be subject to those regulations might arise, but I am certain that when this legislation has been assented to there will be hundreds of cases which will come before the conciliation commissioners for determination. If my contention that the##'## wage-pegging regulations will still remain in force be correct, I can visualize a state of affairs arising which will make it physically impossible for the Chief Judge to say whether an increase of wages will, or will not, be in the interests of national economy. As this is a matter of great importance, I sought legal advice regarding it. Among those from whom opinions were sought was the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies).</inline> The first paragraph in his opinion reads - </para>

                <para>Is it the intention of the Government that the new Conciliation and Arbitration Bill should terminate -wage-pegging? If so, the public and particularly the trade unions, should be told this plainly. If, on the other hand, the Government believes that the new bill does not over-rule the previous regulations will it say so plainly? Will it equally make it clear to the public that, on that view of the legislation, there will be in effect an appeal to the Chief Judge on questions of remuneration on a great number of the decisions of the conciliation commissioners, since the last wage-pegging regulations gave this control to the Chief Judge and not to the. Full Arbitration Court? </para>
                <para class="block">Time will be saved if the Minister in charge of the ##'## bill will explain exactly what restrictions will be imposed on the conciliation commissioners by the wage pegging regulations to which I have referred. I again ask the Minister whether the conciliation commissioners will be limited by the wage-pegging regulations.

                    <para>. - The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay)</inline> has suggested that the question of the relation of the wage-pegging regulations to the bill now under consideration escaped parliamentary attention. It is true that it escaped parliamentary attention when the bill was before the House of Representatives; but it is also true that the matter had full consideration by the Government. If there was a failure to deal with the matter in the Parliament, the fault does not lie with the Government; and that for another good reason, too, that the legal position is obvious. It is true that the wage-pegging regulations operate to-day, not under the National Security Act but under the Defence (Transitional Provisions) Act, and with limited operation only to the 31st December next to override and control the provisions that are .being inserted in the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act under this bill, which is of a permanent nature. I do not like throwing Latin phrases at honorable senators, but I suggest that this matter is governed by the. phrase, <inline font-style="italic">generalia specialibus non</inline><inline font-style="italic">derogant,</inline> which means that special provisions override general provisions. To reduce that to lay terms: Here we have a special act, the Defence (Transitional Provisions) Act, giving the virtue of statutory law to the regulations which the Leader of the Opposition has read. When the bill was drafted it was decided not to incorporate anything in it which was related to an act, or regulation, of such transient operation as the regulation cited by the Leader of the </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>Opposition. But for another reason, too,  the  wage-pegging regulations apply. The Leader of the Opposition read the regulation dated the 9th April, and. I shall not read it again. The effect of it is, as he has stated, that where an industrial authority, and##'## that will include a conciliation commissioner, is about to make an award he must first seek the concurrence of the Chief Judge if, and if only,  the  rate of remuneration is affected. The broad question of rates is left to the court; and there are numerous matters outside the question of remuneration that a conciliation commissioner can attend to under the wage-pegging: regulations to-day without any reference at all to the Chief, Judge. </para>
                <para>I draw the attention of the##"## committee to this position: The wage-pegging regulation cited##'## by the Leader of the Opposition determines what shall happen before an award is made.  An industrial authority, contemplating the making- of an. award, must go to the Chief Judge and tell him what he has in contemplation, the principles he- proposes to apply and the reasons for the proposition he is putting to the Chief Judge. Section 20 (1) refers to ##"## an award, or- order of a conciliation commissioner. That; unquestionably, means a valid order, or a valid award; and a-- conciliation commissioner, under another law dealing- with anterior aspects of making an award, must consult the Chief Judge. The two thing?- are in water-tight compartments; and the intention in the mind of the Government, at- least, has always been that the  wage-pegging  regulations- shall apply, despite the amendments only that are now being- effected 1 to the principal act: I- do not think that is going- to cause- any industrial trouble, or1 unrest: There,, certainly,  was no  attempt on the part of the Government to conceal that##'## position. I disagree with the Leader of the Opposition- when he says that there is a general impression that this bill will dispose of wage-pegging regulations. From my association with the##'## industrial units of the country; that is completely wrong; There is the clearest##'## understanding: industrially that wage1 pegging regulations shall continue to apply. The unionists##'## understand, too, that those regulations must come up for parliamentary review before##'## the end of the year. They understand, further that the Government##'## is continually reviewing##'## the position regarding wage-pegging, and has given ample evidence of its desire##'## to terminate the operation of those##'## regulations as soon as possible. Honorable senators will remember that in March last year the first relaxation: took place when the- unions##'## were permitted to go to the Arbitration Court on the two main questions of hours and wages; and, in fact, if the Leader of the Opposition has followed closely the trend of events##'## from that day lie will find that the initiative has remained##'## with the Government throughout; because it was the Attorney-General who intervened in the printing industry case and elevated- the question of the 40-liour week, and, later, the##'## question of the basic wage##]## to a position which had: a general application to1 all union##'##s coming within the ambit of. the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. Further relaxation of those regulations were effected- in December##'## of last1 year##'## and March and April of this year, and the Government had been##'## active- in##'## seeking to get- rid ofl those regulations- in common with all other war emergency regulations. The Leader of the Opposition can rest assured that no unionist is under ,any misapprehension about the point: he raised. </para>
                <para>Regarding the difficulties which the Leader of the Opposition says might arise because fifteen conciliation commissioners may need to approach the##"## judge and##'## thus chit tei- up the court with work and##'## cause difficulties that will make for entanglement, I repeat the point I made a moment ago, that many matters before th##'##e conciliation  commissioners will##'## not relate to the one aspect that is required##'## in the wage-pegging regulations, that is, where the rate of remuneration is affected. But. in any event, I point out##"## that throughout the war period when we had a spate of industrial unrest and more instances of industrial unrest than hitherto, the. Chief Judge, aided by eight commissioners, was able to cope with them. Frankly, f do##'## not expect that. there will.be any. greater difficulty under, the new proposals. It is obvious that- by the time this measure:is proclaimed and##'## conciliation,  commissioners  are set up and##'## allocated, their various duties, some reasonable time will elapse: Lam not- prepared, at this stage; because the matter has- not been considered, to forecast- whether, the wage pegging regulations will##"## still be in1 operation when this- measure comes,into force. That may, or##'## may not, be the position. </para>

                    <para>:- The Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McKenna)</inline> has stated the position very- clearly and frankly. He says that th##&amp;## conciliation commissioners- will ##"##be- handicapped- when dealing, mainly- with remuneration: I suggest that in##"## 99 per- cent, of the cases that will come before##'## the conciliationcommissioners the question of: remuneration will be included, because the basic wage, hours; remuneration ##&gt;##of female l a bour and - sick leave and holidays do not come within their jurisdiction. What are the fifteen conciliation commissioners going to- do? I anticipated that a- considerable amount##'## of work##'## would ##'##be given to##'## them, and that1 they- would be called upon to deal with hundreds of##'## cases. If their jurisdiction is limited there will##'## be chaos and confusion. So far as -lie wage pegging##'## regulations- are concerned, the committee must bear1 in mind that many of the serious strikes which have taken place during the last two years- have occurred because##'## of the Government##'##s##'## policy with respect to wage-pegging. Those strikes have really been##'## a ##'##challenge to the Government; and it; is interesting to note that during that period the Government has been forced by political pressure##'## to appease and to retreat. It;is interesting -to read the comment of a well-  known authority  upon these  wage-pegging##'## regulations, particu-la##'##rly: the- latest regulation, which  places upon  the Chief Judge the onus of deciding; more or ##"##less; the eco-  nomic  policy of the Government; <inline font-style="italic">l.l</inline> seems##'##- ludicrous that the Chief Judge should be obliged to make##'## that decision; but, under##'## this measure, there is no right, of appeal from the conciliation commissioners##'## decisions- to the Arbitration Court as a court, in spite of.##"## the fact: that##'## fifteen different opinions may he##"## given. The last1 absurdity- occurred##'## when Cabinet: shuffling out of its responsibility ##'##for economic policy, transferred to the##'## Chief Judge,##'## and in the##'## coal-mining  industry to  another##"## authority, the obligation to decide whether it would be- in the national interest to grant applications !for increases of wages. I should have thought; that the economy of th.ev country was the responsibility of the Government. The. Government created the wage-pegging regulations. That is the Government##'##s own law ; yet now, in effect, it says##'## to one judge of the Arbitration Court,. ##"##Will you please accept the responsibility for deciding when, and under what conditions, our own. law is to come into the matter.? ##"## That transfers to a judicial authority the whole of the Government##'##s responsibility- for economicpolicy. It represents a complete abdication on the part of the Government.; and that abdication has accounted fbr practically##'## every strike which has occurred during the last twelve months: Honorable senators from South Australia will, be aware that during the last week steps were taken in a prominent trade union organization to bring, pressure to bear upon the Government to dismiss Chief Judge Drake-Brockman, because those unionists thought that it would be impossible for them to get all ##'## they, wanted while he. remained Chief Judge of the court. The law must be observed. The Government must govern. It cannot afford to appease. It cannot afford to continue its retreat from the wage-pegging regulations- whenever political pressure is brought to bear upon it. Even when this measure becomes law, it will not be possible to get quick decisions on matters affecting##'## wages because such decisions will need the approval of the Chief Judge of the Arbitration Court, or, in the case of th##'##e coal industry, the  chairman  of the Joint Coal Board, to be effective. It would##'##be better##'## to##'## scrap the wage-pegging regulations and provide for the right of! appeal to the Arbitration Court. Th##'##e </para>

Let the employers and the employees get round a table and show a sane approach to the problem of ending the industrial civil war that is doing so much to-day to retard production, prevent a higher standard of living, and nullify our efforts to render humanitarian service to people overseas who are starving for our goods.

                    <para>. - Dealing first with the formal matters relating to the bill raised by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay),</inline> I##'## wish to say two things. Thereafter, I shall take the honorable gentleman to task for several of his later comments which were unquestionably on the political level. Down the years the Chief Judge of the Arbitration Court has been in the same responsible position as he is in to-day, and has had matters going to him,  not only from Commonwealth and State tribunals, but also from every industrial authority in this land. The Chief Judge is not without assistance. ##'##He has his brother judges who are specialists in particular industries, and I have no doubt that he co-opts them for their assistance and advice. At all events, the Chief Judge has not been sending out any distress signals. I repeat that apart from the provision inserted by the April amendment, the honorable gentleman will find in section 18 of the National Security (Economic Organization) Regulations, many matters relating to remuneration that can- be dealt with by an industrial authority, including a conciliation commissioner, without reference to the Chief Judge of the Arbitration Court. There is, for instance, the much discussed formula relating to the increase of marginal rates by approximately 25 per cent. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>I take strong exception to the comments made by the Leader of the Opposition in regard to what he described as the appeasing and retreating policy of the Government in relation to industrial un rest. His utterances were. unquestionably propaganda, and I regret that they  should  have been imported into a debate  which  I hoped would be confined to the bare merits of the legislation with which we are now concerned. Of course, the honorable gentleman has a perfect right to raise any matter he wishes, but I say to him at once that his statement that the Government has appeased and retreated is quite at issue with the truth. Apparently, the honorable senator has forgotten what happened a year ago last Christmas when there was an ironworkers##'## strike at Port Kembla. With Sydney, and most of* New South Wales lacking electric light, power, transport and so on, it would have been very easy for the  Government  to have intervened against constituted authority, but anybody who has studied industrial relations in the last year or two will realize that the Government made a stand against those who were seeking to destroy the .arbitration system - a stand that has been reinforced and has had a potent influence on the cleansing of destructive elements from the industrial sphere in New South Wales. In that regard, the Government has also given a lead to the moderates, if I may perhaps improperly refer to them as such - the ordinary trade unionists - to take similar action throughout the rest of the Commonwealth. There was no appeasement in relation to the recent Victorian metal trades strike that dragged on from October of last year until quite recently. Time and time again this Government has said, and has insisted that whoever is on strike must sooner or later come back to the  processes of law, and of arbitration and conciliation. The Government has upheld those processes most strongly throughout its history. If that can be called retreating and appeasing, then the Government is guilty. Does the Leader of the . Opposition suggest that the Government should intervene in matters that are before the courts? If it were to do that, I have no doubt that the honorable gentleman would say immediately and with justification that it was interfering improperly. If the Leader of the Opposition ponders for a moment on the settlement of the metal trades strike  in  Victoria, he will realize that there was a triumph for the processes of conciliation because it was the conciliative processes of  the court that settled that strike after the court had intervened by calling a compulsory conference. It showed too that the court had in its hands all the coercive powers that it required. </para>

                        <para>- I am not prepared to debate in this chamber why the Arbitration Court did or did not take action.No doubt it had very good reason for the course that it adopted. It is an expert tribunal with a very wide understanding. It also has complete tolerance. Down theyears, it has accumulated a great deal of wisdom and its judges, more than any one else in the community, realize how easy it is to throw a flame into a petrol tin and start a conflagration spreading from one end of the Commonwealth to the other. I do not propose to go into what might have influenced the judges in not acting sooner or more drastically, but I am prepared to pay them the tribute of saying that rhey acted wisely. I repeat that the initiative in industrial matters in this country has lain with this Government. On its own motion, it has modified the wage-pegging regulations. From the beginning, its object has been to get rid of emergency regulations as soon as possible. The Government has moved under its own power. It has listened to representations from all sections of the community, and it has made its own decisions. </para>

                <para>I thought for a. moment from the way that the Leader of the Opposition was developing his argument that he was about to suggest that the wage-pegging regulations should be re-imposed. I do not know whether or not that was his intention, but apparently he is prepared now to concede the need for conciliation commissioners. He said. ##"## Letus appoint our conciliation commissioners##"##. That is the third voice with which he has spoken on that subject. Last Thursday he said that he wanted nothing to do with conciliation commissioners. He favoured the appointment of more Arbitration Court judges and the strengthening of the court. I invite the honorable senator to decide what he really does recommend to the Government. The Government has made up its mind, and is pursuing two courses to, an end that it believes will give a reasonable chance of industrial peace in this country. As one instance of Government initiative and activity, I point to the war-time referendum. In the war period and during the most disturbed industrial era that this country has ever known, the Government was prepared to take the full responsibility for industrial conditions. Would it have done that had it lacked courage? However, the people of the Commonwealth, acting on the advice of members of the Opposition amongst others, did not concede the powers that the Government sought. I ask the Leader of the Opposition, in view of what I have said, to let us hear no more of charges of appeasement and retreat, but. more credit for the results that have been achieved. . </para>

                <para class="block">This amendment, varies from a similar amendment moved in the House of Representatives by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> in regard to leave to appeal by either party from a decision of a conciliation commissioner to##'## the High Court. The amendment moved in the House of Representatives provided  for the : right of appeal - on  any  grounds whatsoever.

It? was inserted by the Senate against the will of the Scullin Government1 in 1930: It will he eliminated.- The Government recognizes that there- are two strong viewpoints##'## in relation to appeals and that  only time will tell which of the two is right. Past experience has indicated the wisdom of trying out this new provision. I repeat that the appellate jurisdiction of the Arbitration Court will be strengthened very considerably by the bill and that the High Court will retain a certain over-riding jurisdiction. It is necessary for the High Court to retain such power in order to ensure that the Arbitration Court and other bodies remain within the bounds of the Commonwealth Constitution. That requirement is not abrogated. </para>

I have not been able to discover the reason why they are not registered. I know that there must be hundreds of such bodies throughout Australia.

It is well known that, in spite of the fact that these organizations have a federal body; the State organizations have industrial officers regularly employed to deal with industrial matters. This is due to the large area of Australia. I am informed that so far as the chambers of manufactures in Australia are concerned, the only chamber that is registered is the Victorian chamber. I have been requested: by the Victorian Chamber of Manufactures and the various State chambers, the Chamber of Commerce and its various State chambers, the South Australian Builders and Contractors Association and other organizations to make a plea to the Government to alter this clause so that the industrial officer regularly employed by them will have the right to appear before a conciliation commissioner. I know that solicitors and barristers are barred, but where an organization has an industrial officer who is neither a solicitor nor a barrister he will -according to my interpretation of the clause - be disqualified from appearing before a conciliation commissioner. Furthermore, conciliation commissioners are to be appointed for all States of Australia and it is quite possible that cases will be heard simultaneously in more than one State. I understand that it is a sheer impossibility to get men with experience of industrial arbitration to appear, and F desire , to place on record the request of the South Australian Builders and Contractors Association.

                    <para>. - T think that there has been much ado about nothing. The position has not altered substantially since ##]##!J04, when section 27 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act enacted that barristers and solicitors were prohibited from appearing before a. court or before a conciliation commissioner ##"##except by consent of all the parties or by leave of the  President##"##.  The provision in this bill is, therefore, substantially a reenactment of the relevant provision in the original act. In 1910 the section was altered and the prohibition was extended to include a paid agent. In 1938 a further provision was inserted stating that ##'## no party shall be represented by counsel or solicitor or ##'##by paid agent except by leave of the court##"##. In 1940 the section was further amended, the words ##"## or by ##"## being deleted and the word ##"## and ##"## inserted. That amendment was intended further to discourage legal representation. Honorable senators opposite know that barristers, solicitors, and paid agents have enjoyed an enormous practice in the Arbitration Court, and I have no doubt that, when major matters arise for determination involving fundamental principles, statements of account and matters traversing the  economy of this country, employers and employees will still find it necessary to engage expert assistance. I emphasize the fact that professional representation has always been, possible with the consent of the parties and by leave of the court. So far as the court is concerned the position is not altered by the bill. Now that we are giving a new emphasis to conciliation we want to eliminate from that jurisdiction all elements of legal and tactical manoeuvring by persons retained to placate their clients rather than to conciliate the other party. The measure of efficiency that is applied to lawyers and professional advocates in a jurisdiction such as this is completely foreign to the spirit of conciliation, and f agree with what the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay)</inline> said last year when he urged that it was desirable to bring employers and employees together. ##[## agreed with him then, I agreed with him the other day, and I agree with- him now. I think that it is a logical deduction from those premises to say : ##"## Let us eliminate all the people who are sent into the courts to fight on , bell alf of their clients, whether they be barrister, solicitor or paid agent of any kind, and let us bring the actual parties together ##"##. If there is any. hope for conciliation that hope can be realized only in the way that the Leader of the Opposition himself suggested, namely, in an atmosphere where employer meets employee without formality, and where they may freely confer without the intervention of professional advocates, who measure their ability by how little they give away and how much they receive. That atmosphere is completely foreign to conciliation, as we. on this side of the chamber understand it, and we are adopting the suggestion made by the Leader of the Opposition that we should push everybody else out of the way so that we can bring face to face the employer and employee. </para>

                <para>If I am not mistaken, it was the Leader of the Opposition who said, during the last few days,  that there should be a ##"## peace iri industry ##"## conference. He is reported as having importuned the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> to adopt the suggestion that was on the tapis some twelve months ago. If there is any value in that suggestion there is infinitely more in bringing together the employer and employee in the very establishment where a dispute occurs and in any particular sec tion of industry where trouble develops. I have no doubt that a ##"##peace in industry ##"## conference held on the##'## highest levels would achieve some good because it would undoubtedly promulgate some sound principles; but the real work that has to be done to achieve permanent peace in industry can be accomplished only when employer and employee sit around a table and discuss their difficulties informally and without recrimination. That is the keynote of the Government##'##s policy in this matter. Whilst I accept the suggestion of the Leader of the Opposition that there should be more conciliation in industry, I regret that I cannot accept his amendment, and 1 point out that in strict fact it is quite unnecessary. If he will refer to sub-para i of para <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> of sub-section 1 of proposed new section 43g he will see that it is provided that a party, not being an organization,  may be represented ##"##by an employee of that party. The honorable senator##'##s amendment reads - ##"## including a person who is regularly employed as an industrial officer ##"##. If such a person is regularly employed in any capacity, he is an employee. </para>

Failing immediate success in that capacity, he can adopt the role of a dictator and deliver a judgment provided, of course, that##'## it is acceptable to the Chief Judge.

In Victoria it is not necessary for##"## a police magistrate to be either a barrister or a solicitor. Despite the ramifications of the .Commonwealth Arbitration Court, Victorian wages boards deal with large sections of industry. If employers believe that they should be represented at* hearings before conciliation commissioners they shouldselect##'## from among themselves some person or persons to represent them. In that way their views  could be made known in an atmosphere of conciliation, rather than in the strained legal atmosphere associated with paid agents acting, for their clients. I have had experience of##"## the Victorian wages board system, and there is nothing in it of which honorable senators opposite need be afraid##'##. </para>

When, because of old age or physical unfitness aman may not be able , to do a full measure of work, provision should be made whereby the partiescancome to the arrangement I have indicated. This provision is em bodied in the lastawardtobe made for the pastoral industry. Honorable senators will appreciate that very often a man comes to a shearing shed and wishes to earn his keep, or a few pounds, but. for reasons ##'##of the kind I have mentioned, he is not capable of earning the basic wage. In such circumstances, it should be possible for the employer and employee to enter into an agreement as to the rate of remuneration to be paid. The clause provides that before such an. arrangement can be made the employer and employee must obtain the approval of a person authorized by either the court or a conciliation commissioner. In isolated areas this would involve the parties in unnecessary expense and delay. Generally speaking, the provision in the existing shearing award has given satisfaction. </para>

                    <para>. - I regret that I cannot accept the amendment, because it would negative <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> whole purpose of the change proposed to be effected in the law. Experience has shown that an employee who is under : a disability, whether it is physical or otherwise, is at a very grave disadvantage in negotiating forwork; and it has been found particularly in the rural industries that employers have taken advantage of a man##'##s disability, or evenslightdisability, to engage him at far less than award rates. The clause is designed to soe that justice is done between the employer, who is in the superior position, and the employee who may be suffering from a disability. If I were to accepttheamendment, the position would be entirely the reverse of what the Governmentseeksto set up under the bill. It is not a case of bargaining where one man is under a disability and the other is not, but of another interposing to see that justice is done. The Government will not give way on this matter. It has a good deal of information with respect to irregularities under the law as it stands at present. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay)</inline> will understand that his amendment is a direct negative of the clause. </para>

                    <para>.- This clause. I understand, provides that an employee may within a period of twelve months apply to the court for the recovery of wages. That, period is not long enough. In Tasmania there are numerous minor employers who work their men normal hours during the day and then employ them in shops at night. I know of a market  gardener  who employs a man during the day in his gardens, and then. ##]##  puts  him in has shop on Friday nights, :-##'##nd also, I understand, on Saturdays. In most cases employees who are- called upon to work overtime in this way do not, receive any extra wages.##'## Fearing dismissal if they claim overtime, they usually wait until they are dismissed or decide to leave before taking action to recover the extra money due to them. An employee might continue his employment for three or four years before getting an opportunity to claim overtime. I know of a man who worked overtime . for his employer, but received no payment because he was afraid to ask for it. Labour was not scarce at that time, and he feared losing his job. I told him to keep a record of the overtime that, he worked. This went on for two years, but as the limit for recovery was six months, he could only claim for that period. I am sure that the Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator M.cKenna.)</inline> ##'##will give sympathetic consideration to this matter, because he agrees that twelve months is not long enough. In fact, two years is not long enough. In my view, no time limit should be specified. When employment is scarce some men will work overtime for nothing, and when they lose their employment they cannot sue in the courts for money owing to them beyond a period of nine months under the present law. </para>

                    <para>. - Early last, year I did express myself in this chamber in favour of the application of the statute of limitations to. the recovery of wages. This would have permitted action to be taken any time up lo six years after a. debt, had been incurred. In recent months, however, .1 have changed my views on the matter. With other Ministers, I attended many conferences with representatives of employers and. employees. Representations that the time for recovery be limited to twelve months were made by one of the most powerful unions  in  Australia. That union had found that, in rural centres in particular, men were working for less than award rates quite knowingly. In the larger centres of which the honorable  sena tor speaks, such as Launceston, this difficulty  really  does not arise because employees know their rights. Union organizers are amongst employees all the time, and it, is unthinkable that there could be anybody in a. major centre who would not be aware of his rights or would not bc told of them within twelve months. The aim of this provision is to prevent##'## men knowingly, and in defiance of awards and union principles, continuing year after year to work for less than award rates. The period has been limited to twelve months at the request of industrialists although, considering the matter apart from actual experience, one might, be inclined to think that the term should be the same as that prescribed in the statute of limitations, namely six years. The Government gave##'## a very mature consideration to the representations made to it and accordingly has limited the time to one year. Tn rural centres, of course, organizers cannot get around employees <inline font-style="italic">m</inline> easily us they can in the cities, but we were assured that every employee would bc co n tac ted in the course of one year, and we feel that the provision limiting lim time in which arrears may be recovered to twelve months is reasonable having regard to all the circumstances. Until 1930 the limit was six months. The Scullin Government proposed to extend rite period to twelve months, no doubt actuated by the considerations that have now altered my own personal view, but the Senate objected and a compromise was reached on nine months. Therefore, this measure does what the Scullin Government proposed to do in 1930. and for the reasons that .1 have given to the committee! </para>

                        <para>- It is most unlikely that an employee would allow his wages to accumulate for twelve months without claiming them. Also, if that were a matter of honorable pact between employer and .employee, it would be a very rare case where an employer would lie so dishonest as to take advantage of I hat section. Surely twelve months is sufficient time for employer and employee to resolve a matter that, relates to one week##'##s wages, because that is really what it means in effect. </para>

                    (Tasmania) ##'####[##8.25 1.  - I. raised this matter in my second-reading speech. I should like to know whether there is  any  provision for the imposition of penalties upon employers who deliberately floi.it awards. An employee should have become thoroughly acquainted with the award under which he is working within twelve months; but .1 remind the committee that Commonwealth industrial inspectors, have been responsible for the recovery of huge amounts of wages consequent upon the flouting of awards by employers. At present the period of recovery is nine, months. This measure will extend it to twelve months##'##, but as these abuses have occurred in the past,  there  is no reason to believe that they will not continue in the future, lt is most unjust to allow an employer who has flouted an award for say two years to enjoy the benefit of having underpaid an employee -for twelve months. The employee may be as much to Marne as the employer, but the deliberate flouting of the law is not fair to fellow employers and fellow employees. I believe therefore that some penalty should be imposed upon an employer who wilfully  desregards  an award. His obligation should not be discharged merely by making restitution of wages withheld for a period of twelve months.

                    (Tasmania) ##[##8.26J.- I have been requested by the Launceston Trades Hall Council and the Hobart Trades Hall Council to protest against this provision. These organizations believe that the period allowed for recovery is too short because of the peculiar circumstances of industry in Tasmania. I have in mind a recent case in which an employee recovered ##£##1.7 from an employer for back wages, whereas he- was actually entitled to more than ##£##60. In the opinion ##'## of the two councils the present proposals are inadequate, and I ask that the matter be postponed to give the Government an opportunity to see whether the period cannot be increased to at least two years.

                <para>As nearly every award provides for weekly payments, failure to pay wages for a year would represent 52 separate defaults, each of which would render an employer liable to a penalty of ##£##20. So there is ample provision  in  the act to impose a heavy penalty on an employer who fails to carry out the terms of  an  award. The section that I have  just  quoted is also facilitating recovery under the proposed new sub-section of section 44which states -  (3.) Where, in any proceedings against an employer before a Court specified in subsection (1.) of this section,it appears to the Count that an employee of that employer has not been paid an amount to which he is entitled under an order or award, that Court may order that the employer shall pay to the employee the amount of the underpayment but no order shall be made in respect of so much of the underpayment as relates to any period more than twelve months prior to the commencementof theproceedings. </para>
                <para class="block">The two points amount to this : Heavy penalties  in  respect of each week or each  pay  period of  an  award, may  be  imposed upon  an  employer who fails to make the payments, and  in  the course of the proceedings  in  which the employer is being prosecuted, the magistrate or the court may simultaneously order the payment of arrears up to  twelve  months only. I  believe  that this is a reasonable provision. It was thought to be so in 1930. As I have said, the Government has given mature consideration to this proposal, and it is because of strong and well supported representations that the period has been limited to twelve months. I argued quite strenuously  in  favour of a period of  six  years, but after hearing of the difficulties arising in the outback areas where  it is  not easy for  a  union representative to meet employees regularly, I am quite convinced that this proposal does real justice. </para>

I want to know who is to take the initiative in launching prosecutions for offences against awards. Will action be initiated by the union whose member is affected, by the inspectors, or by the Arbitration Court, to secure a penalty against an employer who deliberately flouts an award? In the past, awards have been deliberately flouted by employers and  the  unions whose members have been defrauded have had to , go  to  the Arbitration Court to recoverarrears of payments. In so doing, they have had to expend their funds and fight against strong opposition. In such instances, no penalties have been imposed upon the offending parties. They havebeencalled upon only to pay the money owing to their employees. I consider that##'## the use of the word ##"## may ##"## in the penalty provisions has allowed them to escape just punishment. This word gives the court discretion regarding the imposition of penalties. As a specific instance, I cite the timber workers##'## case. </para>

                    <para>.  --^Sometimes- there, is a difference  of  opinion as. to the. exact meaning of  an award.- Such differences-: arise -in industries in, which thora is a very fain* line of demarcation- between different types of work. Arguments, develop, as  to-  .whether certain work .should be paid for at one award rate or at another award.ra.te. Such disputes may take some time to reach an authority competent to determinethem. There is a provision in -the bill which will ##'## enable local boards to deal with such matters which are referred tothem. The existing- act also enables Boards of Reference to clear up- disputesbetween employers- and employees- in matters of interpretation: In the railway service- of ##'## Victoria, a Classification Board ##'## was established-, and after the-  union  became registered with##'## the  Commonwealth Arbitration Court -and applied for Commonwealth##'## arbitration awards,, the -court used- ##'##th##'##e- services of that board for the purpose of investigating conditions of ##'##employment .and so forth. The board still exercises its authority as a State, instrumentality in cases in which the- union is unable to prove that :a disputeis of an interstate character. Disputes regarding##'## the appropriate rate -of pay for a certain class of work may not arise until an-##'## award ##'## has been- in operation  for twelve months ##'##or more. Then, the tribunal to -which##'##- the dispute-is referred may take another twelve months, to reach  adecision . I have known-  cases  in  whichrailway ##'##men have been awarded higher rates- of pay than they had- ##'##been receiving, the-decision being retrospective for a period of eighteen- months.- -Such  anomalies have occurred, not because ##'##the Railways Commissioners desired##'## tounderpay th##'##eir  i  employees, or because-thc employees -deliberately worked at a -lower rate- than that fixed <inline font-style="italic">b*v</inline> the  award with the object of claiming back pay at a later date, but because there was a difference of opinion regarding the interpretation of the award. Will the Minister give an assurance that, in circumstances such as I have mentioned, men will not be debarred from receiving money 10 which they are rightly entitled for periods of more than twelve months? I have no sympathy with men who deliberately take advantage of employers who are hot <inline font-style="italic">am, fait</inline> with industrial ;i wards by working for a number of years al; low rates and then prosecuting for amounts that are outstanding. However, I. seek an assurance that the interests of employees will be safeguarded in cases where claims for back pay are legitimate, and where the difficulty arises from inability to agree upon the exact meaning of an award. </para>

                    <para>. -  The honorable senator showed that he realizes that the function of interpreting an order or award is necessarily reserved to a. court because it is essentially a judicial task. It will not be competent for an arbitrator to interpret an award. Such questions must go to a court. That is provided throughout the bill. In the circumstances envisaged by the honorable senator, when an appeal or hearing is pending in a superior court as to the interpretation of a particular clause in an award and time is running out against men who are awaiting a decision, the men may protect their rights merely by issuing a complaint against their employer and letting it rest pending the pronouncement of the judicial body. Ti the interpretation given ##'##by the court is against their view, they may simply discontinue their action. It is very easy for men to take proceedings in a court of inferior jurisdiction. The mere lodging of a claim protects their rights, even should the delay in obtaining an interpretation from the superior court extend to two years. In view of the fact that appeals, even in relation to matters of interpretation, will in future be limited to the Arbitration Court-a court that. is skilled in that jurisdiction - I do not expect that there will be any long delays. Questions of interpretation arise when actions are brought in inferior courts for the recovery of wages, for breaches of awards and for ##"##offences against awards, and, as a result of this bill, appeals from such courts will be made direct to the Arbitration Court. Therefore, I do not expect any long delays in relation to interpretations. Howe ve##]## , should there be delay, the men may protect their interests as, I have explained. </para>

                    <para>. - Am I to understand that, if there is. a dispute regarding, the rate of pay applicable to a certain class of work, the matter must be determined by a judge? Consider conditions in the engineering industry. In that industry there are firs-class machinists, second-class machinists and third-class machinists. The men who operate drilling machines are also classified in that way. Sometimes arguments occur as to whether certain work should be paid for at the rate provided for first-class machinists or at that provided for second-class machinists. Such disputes occur time after time. The margins between the various classifications are not very great. I cite a hypothetical case. A union secretary goes to an employer and says##"##, ##"## The work that Jack Brown is doing should be paid for at the rate for first-class machinists ##"##. The employer replies, ##"##No, I think it is secOnd-class machinists##'## work##"##. An argument develops. Does the Minister say that, in such an event, it is necessary to invoke all the machinery of the Arbitration Court in order to obtain a clear decision? I have strong faith in conciliation commissioners as opposed to judges. Generally speaking, judges know nothing about the details of a trade. My faith in conciliation commissioners depends upon the fact that they will have practical knowledge of particular industries, and that, because of their association with such industries,, they will be able to settle disputes of the character I have mentioned on the spot. Surely the parties will not have to go to the Arbitration Court to obtain an interpretation in such a dispute. </para>

                    <para>. - Nothing that could be included in this bill would alter the fact, that interpretation of an award is  purely a matter for judicial decision. But I do not think the honorable senator need be disturbed. It may be that a dispute as to whether an employee comes within a certain category resolves itself into a question of fact, in which case there is no question of law to be decided, so that judicial interpretation is not required. But invariably the conciliation commissioner, although he cannot exercise the judicial function of interpreting an award, expresses ah opinion. That opinion is not binding, of course, but it is usually accepted by the parties. Again, if a commissioner finds himself in difficulty he can simply amend an award, and he has complete power of amendment. I feel that in those circumstances the honorable senator need have no misgivings. </para>

                    <para>.- It is interesting to note that since the Conciliation andArbitration Act was passed in 1904, the act has been amended no fewer than sixteen times. One of the most important amendments was made by the Scullin Governmentin 1930, after ith ad achieved a substantial victory at the polls. In spite of all that has been clone and all that the Government hopes for, something more is needed to bring to an end the industrialwarfare which the country is experiencing. In the last two years, Australia has lost through strikes andlockouts a splendid opportunity to increase its production, and gain overseas markets. It has lost a wonderful opportunity to improve its economic position. That is an opportunity which it never had before, and we have not made the best of it. Obviously, what happened after World War I. will recur. ##'##The present inflated priceswill deflate, and the markets whichwill beavailable to this country for the next few years will then be closed to us.I repeat what I said in 1945, namely, that every Minister and every member of thisParliament has a duty to give a lead to employers, employees and the people generally to achieve; peace in industry, and, as far as possible,keepdisputes away from the Arbitration Court and theproposed conciliationcommissioners.I do not say where the fault lies,but unless something isdone along the lines that I have indicated the great bulkof the people of this countrywill experience hardship before long. IregretthatLabour leaders have not seen fit to condemn the actions of those fanatics in the community who are causingso much trouble. The time is ripe for the members of all political parties to do some clear thinking and straight talking. A good deal of nonsense is talked about a shorter working week and lessened production, but these things can only lead to chaos. I do not say that the faults are all on one side. I believe that all sections of the community should use the opportunities available to them to improve industrial conditions. Employers, as well as employees, must do their part to avoid the troubles which, unfortunately, seem to occur almost from day to day. The present-state of affairs is unfair to ex-servicemen requiring homes andfarms. It is an insultto the intelligence of the people that practically a state of civil war should exist. I am glad that the Prime Minister . <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)has</inline> saidthathe is prepared to convene a conference of employers and employees with a view to securing , peace in industry. Inmy opinion, that is the best means of solving the problems confronting us, and I hope that something will.be done in that direction. Great opportunities are open to us, but we are not availing ourselves of them.If we realized our responsibilities towards future generations, and adopted a proper attitude towards the Empire of which we form a part, we should be courageous enough to give effect to a principle in which we believe. </para>
