                <para>I thank honorable senators for the high honour which they have conferred upon me. I have now occupied the chair of the Senate for four years, and during that period I have done my best to be impartial. Of course, I owe certain allegiance to my party at voting times, but I have always endeavoured to be completely impartial in conducting the business of the Senate, knowing no party whatever. Although as  President  I have no politics, I cannot allow this occasion to pass without noting that the political pendulum has completed a full swing. Seeing <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings</inline> in front of me, my mind returns to the time when he and I belonged to the group of Labour party senators known as " The Three Musketeers ", who held the fort against 33. Times have changed since then. The political colour of the Senate has changed, too, and the situation has now been reversed. I make these remarks in order that I may say to our friends in Opposition, who number only three, that the Chair will not take advantage of their position, and of their small number, but will give them every assistance to conduct their affairs and will ensure that they shall receive fair and just treatment. I say no more, except to thank honorable senators once again for the honour which they have conferred upon me. </para>

We appreciate your statement that you will be entirely impartial and will give to the Opposition, although it is small, every consideration and encouragement. From my past observations of your actions in the high office which you hold, I know well that we have nothing at all to. fear  from  you in the discharge of your duties. Your task may not be arduous for the next three years ; nevertheless I am certain that you will ably uphold the very high traditions of the office to which you have been re-elected. I believe that you will conduct yourself, as President, as you have done in the past, viewing your high position, not as a political appointment, but as one made by the Senate to ensure the maintenance of its high traditions. </para>

I gathered from them that their allowances and salaries are quite inadequate to meet their needs, and I ask the Minister for Supply and Shipping whether the Government will give consideration to increasing payments to members of Australian legations, consular staffs, and trade commissions throughout the world, but particularly in those countries where inflation has occurred and the cost of living has increased considerably. I have been informed that living costs in many countries are such that Australians engaged in important business on behalf of their country are precluded from enjoying the living standards that would Lave been theirs had they remained in this  country. </para>

History has been made to-day in the election of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Annabelle</inline> Rankin as Whip, because I believe that I am right in saying that she is the first woman to hold office in this Parliament. The representation of political parties in the Senate to-day reminds me of an almost similar position in September, 1935, except that the numbers have been reversed. On that earlier occasion there were 33 supporters of a non-Labour government, with three members of the Labour party in opposition. It may interest honorable senators, particularly yourself, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings,</inline> if I make a short quotation from page 5 of volume 147 of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of the 23rd September, 1935. On that occasion <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings</inline> announced, by leave, that he had been elected Leader of the Opposition in this chamber. The <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> .report of his remarks is as follows : - </para>

                    <para>All that I desire to say at this juncture is that I shall endeavour to carry out the duties which devolve upon me to the best of my ability, and that any criticism I may offer will be honest and sincere. Although the Opposition in this chamber is small in numbers, it  represents 46 per cent.' of the electors who cast their votes at the election held on the 15th September, 1934. The duty devolves upon us therefore to see that justice is done to that section of the people which voted for Labour representation. </para>

                        Is the honorable senator referring only to Queensland?
                    </para>
                    <para>Senator Collings - I am speaking of Australia generally. It must be realized that there is something wrong with the system of electing the members of this chamber since 46 per cent, of the electors obtained no representation at all, the other 54 per cent, receiving the whole of the representation. Those are the official figures. My object in referring to this matter now is not to grieve about the result, but to meet in advance the satirical remarks which will, no doubt, be heard in this chamber later, if not this afternoon, concerning our depleted numbers and our ineffectiveness as an Opposition. </para>

                <para class="block">To day, as 1 have said, the position is reversed ; there are 33 Labour members in the chamber, whilst the Oppositionconsists of three members of non-Labour parties. By an extraordinary coincidence those three members again represent Queensland. I agree entirely with foe remarks made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings</inline> on the occasion referred to, and I assure the Senate that the present Opposition will follow his advice to the letter. Honorable senators may rest assured that what the Opposition lacks in numbers will be made up in virility, and that we shall oppose to the utmost any legislation which attacks the liberty of the individual. Lest an air of complacency should be adopted by imposing the galaxy on the Government benches, I remind honorable senators opposite that my two colleagues and I represent 48 per cent, of the primary votes recorded at the elections for the Senate held on the 28th September, 1946, and that we are determined to do all in our power in the interests particularly of almost half of the people of Australia, whom we represent in this chamber. </para>

                        <para>- Throughout Australia, nearly every hospital is registered and approved under the Hospital Benefits Act. That result has been achieved with some difficulty in New South Wales, but, due to very strenuous efforts on the part, of officers of the Department of Health, about 102 hospitals have been registered in that State  during the last seven months. In South Australia only very few hospitals are not registered. The difficulty mentioned by the honorable senator could be solved  readily  by the proprietors of those hospitals coming in under the regulations and giving to their patients the benefits which the Government intended all hospital patients should enjoy. I suggest that it would be quite wrong to disturb the 'present system, which is working evenly and well throughout Australia, by providing for payment direct to patients when a little co-operation on the part of a few hospital proprietors would enable the difficulty to be overcome. I shall have a careful look at the 'position, with a view to making a further approach to the few private hospitals outstanding, in an endeavour to obtain a 100 per cent, result. In at least two States, Tasmania and Western Australia, all private hospitals have come under the scheme, and throughout the whole of the Commonwealth only a few are now standing out. of it. </para>

I know that it is a' fact that no trainee has suffered any loss by reason of the fact that he has not an enforceable right at law. In each case where injury has been  suffered during training, the Government has met the trainee upon the same basis as if he were covered by the Commonwealth Workmen's Compensation Act. There is virtue in people having an enforceable right instead of a right which depends upon the discretion of even a government. </para>

                <para>The  Budget,  1947-48 - Papers presented by the  Right  Honorable J. B. Chifley, M.P., on the occasion of the Budget of 1047-48, and move - </para>
                <para>That the papers be printed. </para>
                <para class="block">Et has been the custom to submit this motion immediately after the budget has been presented in the House of Representatives and, at the same time, to inform honorable- senators in some detail of the budget  position. Some weeks have elapsed since the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> delivered his budget speech for 1947-48 and copies of it, together with the Estimates and the budget papers, have been distributed to honorable senators. In the circumstances, I propose on this occasion to make only a very short statement outlining the central features of the budget. </para>
                <para>Actual revenue in 1946-47 was £412,000,000 as against the budget estimate of £385,000,000. The largest increases were income tax £6,000,000, sales tax £5,000,000 and customs and excise duties £13,000,000. Expenditure on defence and allied services was £129,000,000. This was £18,000,000 below the budget estimate. Post-war charges, on the other hand, involved an expenditure of £161.000,000 compared with an estimate of £131.000.000. </para>
                <para class="block">Expenditure on this item, however, included the gift of £25,000,000 to the United Kingdom for which provision had not been made in the budget. Credits against defence and post-war- charges were £58,000,000, so that net expenditure on defence and post-war charges was £232,000,000, which was £11,000,000 more than was estimated. Other expenditure was £218,000,000, which was £5,000,000 less than the Estimates. Total expenditure in 1946-47, therefore, was £450,000,000, and the gap between revenue and expenditure which was financed from loan moneys was £38,000,000 as against a budget estimate of £59,000,000. </para>
                <para>Net expenditure on defence and postwar charges in 1947-48 is estimated to be £168,000,000, as compared with £232,000,000 in 1946-47 and £378,000,000 in 1945-46. Provision is sought for gross expenditure on defence and allied services this year of £80,000,000, as against £129,000,000 last year, and for post-war charges this year of £120,000,000, as against expenditure last year of £161,000,000. Credits for 1947-48. are estimated at £32,000,000, compared with £58,000,000 in 1946-47. An amount of £75,000,000 is provided this year for expenditure by service and production departments, whereas actual expenditure last year was £121,000,000. Of this £75,000,000, it is estimated that £40,000,000 will be spent under the postwar defence plan, which envisages the expenditure over five years of £250,000,000 on the development of a comprehensive system of modern defences in Australia. </para>
                <para>Expenditure of £161,000,000 last year on post-war charges included nonrecurring items such as the United Kingdom grant of £25,000,000 and the lend-lease settlement of £8,000,000. Notwithstanding these reductions, total expenditure on post-war charges in 1947-48 is estimated at £120,000,000. This includes expenditure on re-establis'hment and repatriation of £39,000,000, an increase of £10,000,000, due mainly to larger intakes of ex-service trainees by technical colleges and/ universities. </para>
                <para>Total expenditure other than defence and post-war charges in 1947-48 is estimated at. £259.000,000. which  represents  ah increase of £41,000,000 over last year. The main increases are £4,000,000 in payments to the National "Welfare Fund, £15,000,000 on new works, £4,000,000 on postal services, £4,000,000 in payments to States, and £11,000,000 on administrative votes. In most of these increases the effect of rising wages and other costs is reflected, although it should be noted that in these estimates of expenditure allowance has not been made for the operation, as from the 1st January, &gt;1948, of the 40-hour week. Total expenditure in 1947-48 is, therefore, estimated at £427,000,000, as against £450,000,000 in 1946-47. Defence <inline font-style="italic">and</inline> post-war charges are expected to decrease by £64,000,000, and other expenditure to increase by £41,000,000. </para>
                <para>With the rates of taxation in force before the 20th September, it is estimated that revenue this year would have been £404,000,000, compared with actual revenue last  year  of £412,000,000. After taking account of proposed taxation concessions, revenue for the current year is estimated to be £397,000,000, a decrease of £15,000,000 from last year. Income tax and social services contributions are expected to show a decrease of £12.000,000 and sales tax a decrease of £7,000.000. Revenue from customs and excise duties is estimated to be approximately the same as last year. Other items, including pay-roll tax and post office revenue, are expected to show increases amounting to £4,000,000. Hence, with total expenditure this year estimated at £427,000,000, and total  revenue at £397,000,000, the  gap  to be financed from loan fund is  estimated at £30,000,000. The gap last financial year  was  £38,000,000. . </para>
                <para>The Government proposes to abolish the war-time company tax, which was imposed during the war period as a levy upon the exceptionally high profits made by some public companies under war conditions. Since its purpose has been fulfilled, it is considered that the tax should no longer be continued. Therefore, it will cease to operate as from and including the present financial year, which means that company profits of the year ended the 30th June, 1946- or the accounting period substituted for that year - will be the last year's profits subject to the tax. The cost to revenue of removing the tax is estimated at £3.500,000. </para>
                <para class="block">Concessions are proposed in respect of  sales tax, which are estimated to reduce revenue from this source by £3,500,000 in a full year, and by £2,800,000 in this financial year. Mainly these concessions will take the form of transferring items from the maximum rate schedule of 25 per cent, to the standard rate of 10 per cent. With a view to encouraging production of gold as a means of earning dollars, and having regard also to increasing costs in the gold-mining industry, the Government proposes to suspend the operation of the gold tax. On the present rate of production, the estimated cost to revenue will be £350,000 in this financial year and £550,000 in a full year. </para>
                <para>The Government considers that full employment is the key to many of the economic problems of the community. If conditions overseas deteriorate we shall have to adapt ourselves to circumstances, and nothing must be left undone that will contribute to the main objective of providing constant employment for all available man-power. This policy involves an unremitting effort to achieve greater production and it also requires the continuation of measures designed to prevent unwarranted increases of costs and prices. There are many great tasks confronting Australia, and they can only be accomplished if the nation's entire resources are marshalled and the people lend their willing assistance. . </para>

For the week ended 14th June, 675 tons were on hand for shipment to Melbourne and of this quantity the " Iron Knob " is at present loading from 300 to 400 tons.

                    <para>.- This is the first opportunity that has presented itself since the rising of the Senate last June to speak of certain events which have transpired during the period the Senatehas been in recess. I am sure that I am expressing the thoughts of all members of the Senate when I say how deeply we regret the passing of two of our former colleagues in this chamber - - ex-Senator the Honorable Herbert Brayley Collett, O.M.G., D.S.O., V.D., of Western Australia, and ex-Senator the Honorable , John William Leckie, of Victoria. ExSenator Collett passed away on the 15th August, and ex-Senator Leckie on the 25th September - the former only 46 days and the latter only 87 days, after retiring from this chamber. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>The late ex-Senator Collett performed valuable work in the interests of ex-service men and women. He played an active part in the formation of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia in Western Australia, and was  president  of the State branch of the league from 1925 to 1933. He was born at Guernsey in the Channel Islands in 1877, and came to Australia at the early age of seven years and was educated at Perth Grammar School. He entered the Public Service in 1891, and was Assistant General Secretary to the Public Library, Museum and Art Gallery in Western Australia from 1915 to 1933, when he entered this chamber as senator for Western Australia. He filled many important official positions relative to the repatriation and re-establishment of ex-service men and women. He was appointed to the Senate in 1933, and was Minister without portfolio administering War Service Homes from 1939 to 1940. He assisted the Minister for Repatriation from the 14th March, 1940, to the 28th October, 1940. He was Vice-President of the Executive Council and Minister in charge of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research from the 14th August to October, 1940, Minister without portfolio in 1940-41, Minister for Repatriation in 1941,  chairman  of the Western Australian Economic Survey Committee in 1941, member of the special joint all-party committee on the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act  in  1942-1943, and member of the joint committee on the proposed war gratuity  in  1944-45. The ex-Senator had a most distinguished military record having joined the volunteer forces in 1894. He ^commanded the 11th Australian Infantry Regiment and the 88th Infantry Battalion, Citizen Military Forces, raised and commanded the 28th Infantry Battalion, served in Gallipoli, Egypt and France in the 1914-18 war, and was wounded at Pozieres in July, 1916. He was mentioned in despatches and received the Distinguished Service Order  in  1917. He attained the title of Companion of St. Michael and St. George in 1919 and was promoted colonel. He -commanded the 13th Infantry Brigade, Australia Military forces from 1922 to 1927, and was Aide-de-Camp to the Governor-General from 1922 to 1926. </para>
                <para>In addition to his war service, ex-Senator Collett wrote several valuable publications, including <inline font-style="italic">Infantry in Attack,</inline> in 1906, and in 1922 <inline font-style="italic">The 28th-</inline> a record of his brigade's war service. </para>
                <para>The late ex-Senator Leckie had a most distinguished political career. As well as being a member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly, the House of Representatives, and the Senate, he was a man of many parts. He was elected to the Victorian Legislative Assembly for the constituency of Benambra, in 1913, which seat he held till 1917, when he resigned. He was elected to the House of Representatives for Indi, in 1917, but was defeated at the 1919 general elections. He was elected to the Senate for Victoria at the general elections of 1934 and 1940. He was a member of the Bankruptcy Legislation Committee in 1935-36, Minister without portfolio from the 28th October, 1940, to the -26th June, 1941, Minister assisting the Minister for Munitions from the 26th June, 1941, to the 29th August, 1941, Minister for Aircraft Production from the 26th June, 1941, to the 21st August, 1943, and  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition in the Senate from the 22nd September, 1943. He  was a champion athlete at Scotch College, Melbourne, and played league football for Fitzroy from 1900 to 1905. He was a sportsman in every sense of the word.  His  criticisms were often pungent, but always constructive. Even in the heat of debate, he always retained a sense of humour which endeared him to his comrades. It is sad to think that he was with us in this chamber only a few months ago; but even at that time he indicated to his closest friends that his life's work was nearly over. To his sorrowing relatives, among whom is the wife of the distinguished Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies),</inline> the Opposition extends its heartfelt sympathy. </para>
                <para>I am sure that those honorable senators who were so recently actively associated with their late colleagues, and the honorable senators who have taken their seats in the chamber to-day for the first time, desire to record their deepest sympathy with the relatives of the deceased exsenators in their sad bereavement. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-style="italic">in reply</inline> - On behalf of my colleagues in this chamber and of the Government, I wish to associate myself with the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cooper)</inline> regarding the two ex-senators who have died in recent weeks. Ex-Senator Collett had a distinguished military record. Ex-Senator Leckie was a vigorous and tenacious debater, but outside of this chamber he was a very good friend. The  3ame  may be said of ex-Senator Collett. I had many personal contacts with both these gentlemen and to me their death is a personal loss. The country is poorer for their passing and I extend my deepest sympathy and that of my colleagues in this chamber to their relatives. </para>
