                                <para>- I  shall not answer the honorable senator's question at length, but I assure him that the provision of adequate supplies of meat to the people is being thoroughly examined by all of the appropriate authorities and every' endeavour is being made to overcome the difficulties. Probably the major difficulty arises from adverse seasonal conditions which have caused a shortage of supplies of stock. I am hopeful that in the flush season disputes like the present dispute will become things of the past. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-style="italic">by leave</inline> - Last weekend a newspaper version of two paragraphs of the Auditor General's Report for the year 1945-46, which was tabled in the Parliament last Friday, gave a somewhat inaccurate impression of certain contracts made during the war by the Department of Aircraft Production. To correct this impression I point out that the war-time contracts of the Department of Aircraft Production were arranged with proper authority and that the financial transactions were carried out in accordance with Treasury procedure. The winding up of the extensive war-time contracts of the Department of Aircraft Production is a matter to which unremitting attention is being given by officers of the Aircraft Production Division of the Department of Munitions, which now incorporates the Department of Aircraft Production. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>The first allegation in the newspaper statement is that " the extent to which advances totalling £14,375,000 and materials from overseas sources valued at £1,790,000 have been utilized for the purposes of production is not recorded in the departmental accounts ". The contractor in this case is Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation Proprietary Limited. The reply to this allegation is that details of advances of both cash and materials are segregated in the departmental records against each individual major contract, and that these advances are being adjusted as final costs of the respective projects become available. The contracts between the Commonwealth and this company were subject to review by a special committee that was appointed by the Treasurer during the war. The committee recommended the project margin and the financial bases of these contracts, and the recommendation was approved by the Treasury. The committee, which consisted of the then Director of Finance of the Department of Munitions, the Director of Finance of the Department of Aircraft Production, and a representative of the Treasury, appointed an officer who was then employed by the Defence Division of the Treasury to make a special investigation of the financial accounts of the company. As a Treasury officer, he completed his investigations in respect of the war years ended the 30th September, 1943, and, after he had returned to private practice as a chartered accountant, he was retained by the department to make a. similar investigation in respect of the two years ended the 30th September, 1945. In view of his special knowledge, it is proposed again to retain this officer to make a similar investigation in respect of the financial year ended the 30th September, 1946, the accounts for which will be available shortly. It should be noted that the last report of this officer was completed since the 30th June, 1946, that is, after the completion of the Auditor General's Report. </para>
                    <para>The second newspaper allegation is that " another contractor was supplied with materials valued at £7,375,000., and with advances totalling £9,800,000, although formal agreements between the Commonwealth and the company had not been completed ". This refers to the contract allotted to De Haviland Aircraft Proprietary Limited, of Sydney, for the manufacture of the" Mosquito aircraft. The financial accounts of this company are subject to continuous cost investigation by departmental officers - both technical and finance - and this investigation lias fully covered the company's project since its inception. It is true that a formal agreement was not completed during the war period in respect of the Mosquito aircraft contract, but the project was covered contractually between the Commonwealth and the company in the form of an exchange of letters and formal orders. The negotiations preparatory to the completion of a formal agreement, which in the circumstances was not an urgent matter, extended over a long period and, in fact, these negotiations have just been completed. All points at issue have been determined and the company has recently indicated that it is prepared to sign an agreement along the lines of a draft which has formed the basis of the discussions with it. The statement that "the basis for subcontracting under this major contract had been determined and that departmental cost investigation was proceeding in regard to sub-contractors'' accounts " is merely a statement of fact, as also is the statement that the project allotted ,to the De Havilland Company, which originally was for the production of 370 aircraft, was, with the termination of the war, reduced to a total of 209. This contract will not be completed at the present reduced rate of production until June, 1948. The final costs of these large and complex contracts can not be determined until the projects have been completed and actual costs of materials and equipment supplied from overseas become available. The department has found it necessary to charge out " on consignment " large quantities of 'materials and equipment at estimated prices pending the receipt of actual .costs from the </para>
                    <para class="block">British Air Ministry, by which the overseas supplies were arranged. In conclusion, I assure the Senate that full and complete records of all the transactions of this division have been properly maintained as required by the Treasury, and whilst there have been delays in some cases in effecting adjustments as between the departmental books and the contractors' accounts, such delays are unavoidable because of factors beyond the control of the department. </para>

                            <para>- Apparently the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> has erred more than any other newspaper. In 1942, its representatives ° were excluded from the Senate, the King's Hall, the Library and, I believe, the bar. On that occasion, as <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of .the 2nd June, 1942, shows, the then <inline font-weight="bold">President, Senator Cunningham,</inline> said that that journal had published an article which - contained a number of statements concerning the Senn te and its members which could only be construed as a deliberate attempt by the newspaper in question to discredit the Senate in the opinion of the people and to bring it into contempt. The article also contained offensive and scurrilous personal attacks on various members of the Senate. </para>
                        </talk.start>
                    <para class="block">Later, a statement was made on behalf of the newspaper, and its representatives were again allowed to come within the precincts of the Parliament. On the 27th September, 1945, Senators Amour and Lamp asked me whether I would consider the expulsion from the precincts of the Parliament of this newspaper's representatives. On that occasion the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> had published an article which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Amour</inline> said referred to the Parliament with contempt. On that occasion I did not take action, except to address the Senate for about twenty minutes, giving my personal views as to the freedom of the press. I speak from a personal point of view w  now, and repeal what I said then. </para>
                    <para>Personally, I do not care what the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> says about the Parliament, or what it has said on several occasions about myself; but, as President of this Senate, I have to take action if there is gross contempt of the Parliament. E believe in freedom of speech, even in the freedom that is exercised by the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday Telegraph.</inline> At the same time, I deplore the fact that by their conduct they are  lowering  the prestige of the press in the eyes of the people. There was a time when people would say with regard to a matter : " It is true, "because I read it in the press ". The attitude towards the press to-day has changed entirely, and many people say : " Oh, that is only a press statement ". It seems to me that the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> would be well advised to be more careful in the presentation of its reports. It is possible for newspapers to publish the truth, but by failing tq publish necessary qualifications to give a wrong impression. </para>
                    <para>What I am now about to mention is nothing more than a minor matter concerning myself. I appointed my daughter as my secretary, and I make no apology for having done so. She is now a student at the University. On two occasions the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> referred to that appointment and placed in brackets the words, "Position not advertised ". I realize that that is not a world-shattering matter. It is merely something of a minor nature, but it shows what a newspaper can do. The position of confidential secretary to a Minister is never advertised. The  President  of the Senate and the  Speaker  of the House of Representatives have the same rights in this matter as have Ministers. I am well satisfied with the appointment that I made; but I deplore the dirty way in which these statements are published and the attempt to create a wrong impression. The <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> would have the public believe that I have acted in an underhand way. Indeed, that impression has been created in different parts of the Commonwealth. Prior to the recent elections in South Australia I received a letter from a branch of the Australian Labour party asking if it was true that I had appointed a secretary without calling for applications for the position, and whether other statements which were in circulation concerning members of Parliament were, true, also. I replied that I had appointed a secretary without calling for applications, and I added that I made no apology for having done so. The only purpose of placing in brackets the words " Position not advertised " is to mislead the public. It may interest some members of the public to know that a confidential secretary to a Minister loses his position when the Minister goes out of office. </para>
                    <para>I recollect a speech made by the honorable member for Brisbane <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. George Lawson)</inline> in Brisbane a year or two ago. In one newspaper his speech was reported with a number of omissions, but every word that was published had, in fact, been uttered by the honorable member. No complaint could, therefore, be made that he had been reported incorrectly, but by leaving out certain words, that newspaper was able to place an entirely different construction on what he said. Newspapers can do these things, and at times they do them. It is to be regretted that some sections of the press seem to regard members of Parliament as fair game for this kind of thing. I do not accuse all newspapers of such tactics. Indeed, a few weeks ago a leading pressman came to me, following a newspaper report which was derogatory to nae, and apologized, saying that 95 per cent, of the members of the press gallery in this Parliament did not agree with that paragraph, or with others that had been published with the object of belittling me. I know the reason for those paragraphs ; they were the outcome of certain action taken by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> and myself. I shall not go into that matter, except to say that they were written deliberately by some one who resented that action. I can afford to laugh at these things, but I do say that representatives of the press are descending to low levels indeed when they adopt such an attitude. I could refer to another report of such a nature that could have been written only by a man full of bitterness and envy, but I shall not say more on that subject. Some honorable senators know what I am referring to. </para>
                    <para>In regard to the request of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Amour</inline> that representatives of the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> be excluded from this building, I cannot see my way to refuse them the right to enter it. The case in which President Cunningham was involved was a deliberate attempt, and he said at the time, to bring discredit on the Senate. The attack was personal and scurrilous and, in my opinion, President Cunningham took the right action ; but on this occasion it is difficult to say whether the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> deliberately distorted what was said. I do not know whether that newspaper deliberately set out to mislead the public or whether a mistake was made, but judging by what it has published in the past, I am inclined to agree with <inline font-weight="bold">.Senator Amour.</inline> In to-day's issue of the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> its publishers have been fair enough to print a report of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Amour's</inline> speech yesterday, and also a statement by me in relation to the Parliamentary Refreshment-rooms, but iti reporting <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Amonr'a</inline> remarks, in which he said that the gathering of news by the Australian Broadcasting Com-, mission would cost the Australian taxpayer about a id. a month, that newspaper gave the amount as ls. 2d. Whether that was done deliberately, or was merely a typographical error, I do not know. The <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald,</inline> which is more fair, gave the amount as a id. </para>
                    <para>I repeat now what I said to the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> in September, 1945: I ask it to be fair. As the custodian of the rights of the Senate I have been fair to the press. I have never sought publicity in any way, and I have always tried to do niv best for representatives of the press, and to treat them well. In. no other Parliament in the world are the representatives of the press treated as well as they are here. They have access to practically every part of the building, including the Refreshment-rooms, where they are charged for meals the same as members of Parliament, notwithstanding that the cost of the meals provided exceeds the charge. Representatives of the press have their own rooms and their own bar, and in every way they are treated with consideration. I am glad to say that most of the pressmen here realize that they have been treated fairly. On one occasion representatives of the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> in the press gallery had to take action against the editor of their newspaper, and he was fined by the Australian Journalists Association for a broach of its ethical code. I hope that in future the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> will act fairly in reporting the proceedings of the Parliament. </para>

                    (Queensland) [4.3J. - This bill is to approve the ratification on behalf of Australia of the convention on international civil aviation which was concluded at Chicago on the 7th December, 1944. Australia is already a party to the convention, because it was necessary for Cabinet to ratify the agreement before the 1st March of this year in order that Australia should he an original signatory to the convention. The bill has now come before Parliament so that Parliament may, in effect, ratify what Cabinet has done. Because of the immense developments in aviation during the recent world war it was necessary to revise the provisions of the Paris Convention of 1919 and the Havana Convention of 1928. When the Paris Convention was drafted one might say that aviation was merely being tried out. At that time we thought the aeroplane had been greatly improved in efficiency during the first world Avar, but in the light of what we havewitnessed since,we now realize that developments in aviation had scarcely begun. Australia has played its part in this remarkable progress, and it is vitally necessary in the interest of the defence of this country that we should continue in the forefront of aerial development, particularly in view of its vast distances and small, scattered population. To-day Australia is only a few days' aerial journey from any country in the world. During the recent war aircraft proved of immense value to the security of Australia, both in defending its long coastline and in attack, and honorable senators remember that Australia was used as the main base for the aerial assault on Japanese occupied countries in the southern Pacific. It is obvious that aviation will continue to play an important part in the defence of Australia. With regard to civil aviation, it is clear that the Government is much more interested than it was in the past. TransAustralia Airlines was established by the Government and is completely under its control. The Government has gone further and made an agreement with the old aerial pioneering firm of Qantas Empire Airways Limited, under which it becomes a partner in that undertaking. I mention these two examples merely to show that there are opportunities for the Government to employ some of the many distinguished flyingmen who have served this country so well. Some of them had proved themselves as flyers and as administrators prior to 1939, whilst others rendered distinguished service during the last war. I suggest that the Government should make a special effort to obtain the services of these men, either in its own company or in Qantas Empire Airways Limited, where it can exercise its prerogative to secure their appointment. Unfortunately, up to the present a number of the appointees have  had no previous experience in aviation.
                </para>
                <para>I am in complete agreement with the principal provisions of this measure and I believe they are necessary to put international aviation on a sound basis. Because modern aeroplanes can fly in a few hours or days from one country to another it is absolutely essential that there should be unanimity of conditions and regulations in all parts of the world. I commend the measure to the favourable consideration of honorable senators. </para>
                <para>SenatorLECKIE (Victoria) [4.13].- This bill is commend ably brief,but at the same time quite a lot has been left unsaid. I had occasion to make the same criticism of the bill to implement the Bretton Woods Agreement. In both measures far too much latitude has been left to the respective authorities.

                <para class="block">I should like that to be explained. Does it mean that the Government can prohibit any private aviation company from carrying goods between states, or between Australia and other countries ? In its present form the clause gives that power to the Government, and establishes the right to set up a government monopoly. Under this clause Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited, or any other aviation company, could be debarred from carrying mails, parcels or goods. I should like to know whether that is the Government's intention. If not, is the Minister prepared to give an undertaking that the Government will preserve freedom of trade, and will not seek to establish for itself a monopoly over air transport? </para>
                <para>Paragraph / provides that regulations may be made - for carrying out and giving effect to any other international convention or agreement relating to air navigation to which Australia is or becomes a party. </para>
                <para class="block">Under that provision it would not be necessary for the Parliament to be consulted in future about any aspect of air travel or air carriage. Surely that is going too far. It savours too much of Hitler's gestapo. In effect, it enables the Government to say, " The Government is superior to the Parliament and can take power to itself to do anything it likes in relation to air travel, or the carriage of goods by air. " Under the legislation introduced by this Government the Parliament is gradually being robbed of its powers. The control of the business of the country is being taken from the Parliament and vested in other authorities. </para>

                        <para>- I assume that regulations made under this legislation will be subject to the usual review by the Parliament. That means that unless a motion disallowing them is agreed to within a certain specified period the regulations become effective. In the event of the Parliament being in recess for several weeks, or for several months, the regulations remain in force without the Parliament having an opportunity to disallow them. The bill empowers the Minister to control trade between the States and between Australia and other countries, and to decide whether any aviation company shall be allowed to carry freight. That is a dangerous power to vest in any Minister. It will probably lead to favoritism; the company which first gets the ear of a Minister will be in a most favoured position. It would appear that the Government desires to have in its own hands the control of all carriage of goods by air, and it may be all air passenger traffic also. I recognize the need for stringent regulations in respect of safe air traffic, but I am not convinced that air travel is yet as safe as some would have us believe. </para>

                            <para>- I am prepared to support such a proposal, but I am confident that the Government would not agree to any system of two-party control. This measure leaves all power in the hands of the Minister. I object to any' Minister having the power to ruin any company which disagrees with him. I object also to the insidious way in which Parliament is being robbed of its powers. Much e-f the legislation brought before the Parliament during the regime of the present Government is not so innocent as it looks. When I find that the deliberations of the Senate are cut short, as happened in connexion with the Bretton Woods Agreement- </para>

                        <para>.  -  Whilst I do not oppose the bill,  I  take this opportunity to address myself to the general principle which has been dealt with by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie.</inline> I believe that, in the future, governments will resort still more frequently to the practice followed in the past of submitting agreements of this kind merely for the Parliament's ratification, whilst, at the same time, the Parliament as a whole is not given a timely opportunity to express its views upon the subject-matter of such agreements. When an agreement is submitted to Parliament for ratification, we can either ratify or reject it, but we cannot alter it, even should it be shown, as the result of debate, to be likely to prove irksome, or suggestions be made to improve it in our own interest. Under the procedure now followed, an agreement of this kind can be altered only by resubmitting it to a conference of representatives of those countries which drafted it. I believe that we can best serve the interests of our own country by giving to the Parliament an opportunity to debate subject-matters about to be submitted to international conferences. We should thus ascertain in advance the views of the Parliament as a whole, and the Minister appointed to represent the Government at such conferences would be better equipped to safeguard Australia's interests. In the past, certain agreement? emerging from international conferences have not met with the wishes of either the Parliament as a whole or our people. Although the Opposition cannot force its will upon the Parliament, it can render considerable assistance to the Government in its responsibility to deal thoroughly with every aspect of a matter in respect of which an international agreement is about to be considered. Under the existing system, however, the Parliament is not consulted beforehand; it is automatically obliged to ratify any agreement which the Government accepts. A change of Government may occur after a convention has been entered into at an international conference. It is significant that we do not follow this procedure in dealing with legislation of a domestic nature. I fail to see any reason why we should follow a different course in dealing with legislation involving international agreements. </para>

                        also dealt with the implementation of international agreements by regulation. All of us appear to be too apt to accept the principle of legislation by regulation; but, having the power' by regulation to make good any omission from a measure, the Government is content to submit to Parliament what might be described as skeleton bills. The danger of this tendency to legislate by regulation was dealt with fully by Lord Hewart in his book
                        <inline font-style="italic">The New Despotism.</inline>
                        All measures submitted to Parliament should, as far as possible, cover all aspects of the problems with which they deal. However, governments find it all too easy to make good the defects of statutes by passing regulations, and I regret that that system seems to be encouraged by heads of government departments. The danger of such a practice is emphasized by the number of cases in which it has been shown that regulations have not been consistent with the relevant statute, or have been practically on the border-line. Before the Government's representative leaves this country to attend conferences to consider international agreements, every opportunity should be given to the Parliament to discuss the subject matter of such conferences. That could be done, if necessary, by submitting such matters, even informally, to a joint session of honorable members and honorable senators. In that way the mind of Parliament as a whole would be clearly expressed, and, subsequently, the Parliament would be better enabled to see to what degree international agreements submitted to it for ratification really meet its wishes.

                        <para>. -  It is extraordinary that whilst the Opposition did not oppose the ratification of the Bretton "Woods Agreement yesterday, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hays</inline> should oppose the agreement embodied in this bill, because, under the Bretton "Woods Agreement, Australia hands over certain powers to an international body whereas under this agreement it will retain a full measure of control of the activities concerned. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie</inline> went so far as to liken the Government's procedure in submitting this agreement for ratification to Gestapo methods. Whereas, yesterday, he supported the ratification of the Bretton Woods Agreement, he opposes the ratification of this agreement, which is of less importance. He objected to the provision in thus measure empowering the Government to make regulations dealing with its subject-matter. </para>

                            <para>- By ratifying the Bretton Woods Agreement, Parliament surrendered certain powers to an international body, and the Opposition did not object; but honorable senators opposite now make a tremendous fuss about ratifying an agreement under which the Government will retain full control of the activities covered by the agreement. If this agreement is all wrong in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie's</inline> view, how can he say that the Bretton Woods Agreement was all right? Honorable senators opposite complain that we must either accept, or reject, the agreement but can not amend it. It must be obvious that once an agreement has been made only the parties to it can alter it. </para>

                            <para>- No, but it can reject an agreement just as it can reject regulations. Any regulation that is issued under Commonwealth legislation may be disallowed by either House of the Parliament. If an honorable senator has an objection to a regulation, he may take the matter up with the appropriate Minister, and, if he is still not satisfied, he may move in the Senate for the disallowance of the regulation, but, so far as I am aware, few motions for the disallowance of regulations have been made in this Parliament during the last five or six years. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie's</inline> argument is based on entirely false premises. </para>

I have been giving some thought to the matter of regulations for some time, although not for the same reason as that which prompted <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie's</inline> interest in it. In the South Australian Parliament, there is a committee known as the Subordinate Legislation Committee, which examines all regulations issued under the statutes of that State.

I have pointed out that either House of the Parliament may disallow a regulation; but the constitution of a. committee similar to the South Australian Subordinate Legislation Committee would remove any doubts that the honorable senator may entertain, in regard to the issuing of regulations. </para>

                    <para>I have not heard  one  word of commendation of this bill from honorable senators opposite. Are we to believe that it has no good points? It is true that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hays</inline> said that he did not quarrel with .the bill; but he did not say that any benefit would accrue to Tasmania from it. In my view, that State may benefit considerably. One objection that has been raised is that competitive organizations will be squeezed out of existence; but the Commonwealth has possessed power similar to this for some time, and, so far as I am aware, none of its competitors has been squeezed out. In fact, I have no knowledge of the abuse by any Minister of power conferred upon him under legislation of this kind.  Certainly,  honorable senators have not voiced complaints in this regard. There is no foundation for the fears that some honorable senators- opposite apparently entertain, and I trust that we shall not hear any more about the alleged dangers of conferring administrative powers upon subordinate authorities, particularly in view of the Opposition's acquiescence yesterday in the legislation to implement Australia's participation in the Bretton Woods scheme. </para>

                        <para>. - <inline font-style="italic">in reply</inline> - Australian airline services have a record for safe operation which compares most favorably with that of similar services in other parts of the world, and with the development of the latest navigational aids, Australia is visualized as remaining in the front rank of air-minded and airequipped nations. Australian airline operators have rendered a good service in the past, and, with the arrival in this country of Constellation and Convair aircraft now on order, we shall have the most up-to-date machines in the world. The operation of a commercial airline service requires sound business administration and expert aeronautical knowledge. Members of the board of management must possess a combination of these qualifications. The Government's representatives on the board of Qantas Empire Airways Limited have been selected after due consideration of these requirements. They are, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Keith</inline> Smith, a pioneer of aviation, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> Taylor,, who is experienced in business administration and a viation, law, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt,</inline> the representative of the Treasury and of the taxpayer. With few exceptions, the TransAustralia Airlines organization is staffed by ex-servicemen. In setting up that organization the Government gave full consideration to the claims of ex-servicemen, and in cases where their qualifications met requirements, preference was given to them. They are doing excellent work to-day. </para>

                        complained of an alleged lack of clarity in certain provisions of this measure. Without wishing to be offensive, I am afraid that that is a chronic complaint with the honorable senator. He referred to. clause 5 which will give the Government power to pass regulations. Such regulations, of course, will he within the constitutional authority of the Government. The High . Court has already ruled that the Government may not monopolize commercial air transport between States. Reference was made to this matter in my second-reading speech. The honorable senator directed particular attention to paragraph
                        <inline font-style="italic">f</inline>
                        of proposed new section 5. This is not designed fo obviate the necessity for parliamentary approval of international conventions. Its purpose is that, in the event of Australia ratifying such a convention, the Government shall be empowered to apply regulations under the act without the necessity for a further amendment of it.
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie</inline>
                        is well aware that regulations must be tabled in both Houses of the Parliament and that either House may disallow them. The honorable senator argued that a regulation might escape the no'.:'fi of members of the Parliament; but surely that is the responsibility of members themselves and not of the Government. If the Government fulfils it's obligations  to Supply  members  of tie Parliament with copies of regulations, the final responsibility rests with the members themselves. I point out, too, that there is in existence a Regulations' and Ordinances Committee of the Senate, provision for which was made in 1932. Paragraph 3 of Standing Order 36a of the Senate states - 36a. - (1.) A Standing Committee, to be called the Standing Committee on Regulation^ and Ordinances,- shall be appointed at the commencement of each Session. (3.) The Committee shall have power to send for persons, papers and records, and to sit during Recess; and the quorum of such Committee shall bc  four  unless otherwise ordered by the- Senate. (4.) All Regulations' and Ordinances laid' on the Table of the Senate shall stand referred to such Committee for consideration and, if necessary, report thereon. Any action necessary, arising from a report of the Committee, shall be taken in the Senate- on motion after notice.

I refused to be a , party to that sort of thing, arid I resigned' from the committee. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie</inline> was a member of the Government at that time, but he took no action in' the matter.

                            <para>- That was to meet the necessities of war. The Government did such a good job with its regulations that honorable senators opposite had very little' to say about them'. I assure the Senate that all regulations relating to the administration of the Department of Aircraft Production were closely examined arid that careful consideration was given to their implications''. ( Up to the present, I have not had complaints about regulations giving rise to abuse of power. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie</inline> said something, about favoritism, implying that the Minister could give a contract to a personal friend. That, is riot" correct. The honorable gentleman's statement was exaggerated. The Minister1 does not have power to give exclusive contracts to persons of his own choice. As I said in my second-reading speech, the High Court ruled that the Government may not monopolize interstate trade. It seems to the'' that' <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie*</inline> was influenced more by a* desire to impute  ulterior motives to respectable gentlemen like myself on this side of the Senate than by any desire t6 deal with the bill on its  merits.  The honorable gentleman should be aware that a multitude of technical regulations must be promulgated for the purposes of air . navigation and' that it would be beyond the capacity of Parliament to deal with them all in detail. The more technical the subject of a regulation may be, the more closely, critically and constructively m 11,st it be reasoned out. Such a matter can be discussed only in a general way in this chamber. unless some honorable senator happens to be an expert on it and can give the Senate the benefit of his knowledge. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hays</inline> would have us believe that the Government wishes to do all sorts of things without consulting the Parliament.

Commercial stations broadcast serials and plays on Anzac Day. Presumably no objection is taken to this, and therefore it is difficult to understand why objection should be taken to the broadcasting of the quiz, which will serve a national purpose. The use of Anzac Day for loan publicity is not new. During the war broadcasts in connexion with Commonwealth loans were made on Anzac Day. and it is not considered that they detracted from the proper observance of the day. </para>

I am now able to advise the honorable senator that seventeen merchant vessels are at present on order for the Commonwealth Government and are in various stages of construction. These comprise one 9,000-ton d.w., six 6,000-ton, five 2,500-ton and five 550-ton freighters. In addition Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited is building for its own use four 12,500-ton ore-carrying vessels. No shipyards that have built large merchant vessels have been closed. The Cockatoo and the Naval Dockyard, Williams town, are now engaged solely on naval construction. Merchant vessels completed and in commission to date aretwelve 9,000-ton River class and five 2,500-ton D class freighters. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Aylett</inline> can supply the names of the shipyards he has in mind which have been closed down a further reply will be furnished to him. </para>

                    <para>. - I desire to bring under notice the matter of providing transport for members of Parliament having to travel between Adelaide and Canberra. There has been a shortage of coal in South Australia for quite a long time, with the result that members of Parliament have been unable to get berths because there are no extra interstate trains and there has been curtailment of trains in country areas. "We have to give a fortnight's notice to the railway authorities before we can secure berths on the trains travelling from Adelaide to Melbourne. Travel between </para>

                <para class="block">Melbourne and Canberra is not so difficult to arrange, but the same trouble is encountered on the return journey from Melbourne to Adelaide. I ask the Leader of the Government <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Ashley)</inline> to inquire into the matter to see whether some arrangement can be made to have berths on the trains made available. Many years ago I bought a railway pass and with that pass I was always able to secure berths on the trains. I understand that a certain amount of money is paid every year by the Commonwealth to the State railway authorities for members' passes, and, that being the case, it should be possible to secure berths at less than a fortnight's notice. During last session an arrangement was made whereby four berths were reserved for members travelling between Melbourne and Adelaide so that they could be accommodated at a moment's notice. There are occasions now when members have to come to Canberra at very short notice and it is not possible to give the railway authorities the fortnight's notice which they require. There is, of course, the alternative of air travel, but considerable difficulty is encountered in that regard because only limited passenger accommodation is available and members have to pay their own fares. </para>

There has been no cancellation of the quota of newsprint for that journal, and I believe that it is still being published. <inline font-style="italic">The Rock</inline> has been generously treated, as it has secured an increase of the quantity of newsprint originally allocated to it. "When its publishers applied for newsprint' about two years ago they said that the quantity asked for would be adequate for a certain period, but its over-usage of newsprint has been persistent. The Government does not control the allocation of newsprint; that is done by a committee consisting of men associated with newspaper production. Every endeavour has been made by that committee and the Government to deal fairly with <inline font-style="italic">The Rock.</inline> but if newspapers generally were to use more newsprint than is authorized the whole system would soon break down. This newspaper has been treated fairly and it will continue to get its proper quota of newsprint. </para>
