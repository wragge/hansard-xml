British authorities? What proportion of the postage paid on these parcels is retained by his department? Is he aware that the present high rates are a serious deterrent to many generous-hearted Australian men and women who desire to . increase their effort's in the provision of food for Britain? Willhe make an earnest effort to secure a reduction of postage approaching that made on parcels to troops overseas ? </para>

            <para>- I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration what is the history of the draft of immigrants who arrived at Fremantle on <inline font-style="italic">Misr on</inline> the 13th April last? ''Whence-, and under what authority, were those immigrants collected and despatched to - Australia? How many nationalities did they represent? To what States and in what numbers did they take passage? ' Did the Minister visit the ship when it arrived at Fremantle? Has he read reports in the daily press of Perth of the . 14th April dealing with the arrival of the vessel 1 . If so, and in view of inquiries which, possibly, he has made in the meantime, does he consider the complaints and comments -published in the <inline font-style="italic">West Australian</inline> 'and the <inline font-style="italic">Daily News</inline> of that date to be, true in substance,  and justified ? Is it a fact that the large .proportion of the extraordinary mixture of nationalities on board <inline font-style="italic">Misr</inline> showed during the voyage that they possess few of the qualities desirable in Australian citizens? Has the Minister expressed the desire to establish in Western 'Australia, as a voyage terminal, what might be described as an immigrant depot. If so, what would be the purposes of that depot? Has. the Minister consulted with the .Government of "Western Australia on that 'matter? If not, why not? Has the Commonwealth Government's policy on - immigration been communicated to State Governments'? If so, has their concurrence and support been indicated and offered to the Minister?  </para>

            <para>- The Minister for Immigration maintains very close contact with the State governments in respect of immigration. Nothing. is done in the Commonwealth sphere except after consultation . with .State immigration Ministers and' officers. Recently a conference of -State Ministers in charge of immigration was held at Canberra, and that' conference agreed upon methods for the handling of immigrants. It also decided to set up centres for the reception of immigrants. That was done with the full concurrence of all of the State governments. I have no knowledge of the reports in the Western Australian press to which the honorable senator has referred; but I know that the Minister is happy about the kind of migrants who arrived on <inline font-style="italic">Misr.</inline> Fifty per cent, of them were children, and 80 per cent, of them were young. Only a few of them were . elderly, and they have como here to join their families with whom they hope to spend the lastfew years of their, lives in the shelter of this country. An absolutely wrong approach is being made by certain sections of the community to the arrival of those .people in this country. Instead of giving them the welcome that they deserve, the press of Australia, and certain individuals, including the honorable member for Reid, and certain members of the Opposition in . the House  of Representatives,' have taken up the cry that these immigrants are undesirables. Frankly, they are an excellent lot of people. I am' certain that they will be happy here, and' that as' time goes on we shall be very proud to have them. I shall ask the Minister for Immigration to provide a detailed reply to the honorable senator's questions. </para>

            <para>- A new schedule of prices recently announced provides for  an increase of the price of edible beef tallow to £45 a ton, edible white mutton tallow to £40 a ton, andinedible mixed prime bright tallow to £42 10s. a ton. In each casethe increase is considerable. The price of export tallow is not determined in this country. It depends upon what overseas purchasers are prepared to pay for it. However, because of the need for tallow in this country , none is being exported . at present. I shall give consideration to the honorable senator's request for an investigation of the amount of tallow that is held in this country. </para>

            <para>-I have not read the statements to which the honorable senator has referred. I imagine, however, that an airline service, like a newspaper, or theextension of. railway facilities to countrydistricts, must inevitably encounter initial losses. Most of the initial outlay, however, is nonrecurring, and I am given to understand that in a short time TransAustralia Airlines will be a payingconcern. I am not prepared to consult with the Prime Minister in regard to the conversion of aircraft for the development of the hinterland of this country,because I believe that the Australian National Airlines Commission is capable of handling its own affairs. The Government seesno need for interference. </para>

            <para>- On the 26th March, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Allan</inline> MacDonald asked whether, in view of persistent press rumours of a possible shortage of sugar in this country, I would make a comprehensive statement on the matter, and give an assurance that adequate steps are being taken to ensure the availability of sufficient sugar to meet our domestic requirements and to permit the export of the largest possible quantity to the United Kingdom. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Over the last few years, owing to shortages of man-power and materials and adverse weather conditions, the Australian sugar crop has been below pre-war levels. Nevertheless, sufficient sugar has been produced in Australia each season to supply the local market on a rationed basis and to provide a quantity for export. There have been occasional temporary shortages of refined sugar in certain areas, but I stress that this does not indicate that there has been an acute shortage of the commodity generally in Australia. These temporary shortages have been due to the fact that refineries in some States have had at times to close down or to operate below normal capacity due to various causes, such as man-power shortages, delays in transportation of raw sugar from Queensland ports to refineries, industrial disputes, and insufficiency of available supplies of coal and lime. In pre-war' years, it was the practice to build up reserve stocks of refined sugar during the period of the year when demand slackens in order fully to meet requirements during the periods when consumption is at its peak. Over recent years, for the reasons already given, this has not been possible. To alleviate the position in areas where recently there have been shortages of refined sugar, transfers have been made interstate. Demand for sugar normally slackens in the winter months, and it is expected that if, during the coming winter months, refineries can operate continuously at full capacity, there will be adequate supplies of refined sugar available for all requirements throughout Australia on the existing rationed . basis. Consideration is always given to the question of determining the maximum quantity that can be supplied for export. In this regard, it should be made clear that all of Australia's sugar exports do not necessarily go to the United Kingdom. The world's available sugar supplies each year are surveyed and allocated to consuming countries by . the International Emergency Food Council, Washington, mainly on a regional basis, in order to make the best use of available shipping. </para>

          <para class="block">The object of this bill is to amend the Quarantine Act 1908-1924 in several particulars, which, for convenience, may be grouped into two parts, one dealing with human, and the other with animal quarantine. Section 6 of the bill refers to quarantine of humans, and is designed to confer on quarantine officers additional power to control the movements of travellers from overseas, who may be <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> menace to health, until it is established that they are not "infected with any serious communicable disease. The Quarantine Act provides that an oversea vessel or aircraft arriving in Australia is " subject to quarantine "  and  remains so subject until pratique has been granted. '  Any  person who is. or has been, on board such a vessel or aircraft is also " subject to quarantine ", but ceases to be so subject when pratique has been granted to the vessel. The act empowers quarantine officers to vaccinate or inoculate oversea travellers only while they are " subject to quarantine ". Travellers who refuse to submit to this process may be prosecuted; conviction involves only a monetary penalty. Immediately after arrival of an aircraft at  a  first port of entry in Australia  a  quarantine officer enters the aircraft and examines each person on board. If no one presents- . any evidence of disease, if there are no suspicious circumstances, and each traveller has a certificate of successful vaccination against small-pox, pratique is granted to the vessel; the travellers are then free to land and go where they will. There may, ' however, be a passenger who has spent the previous week in, say, Calcutta, where small-pox is rife, and who cannot satisfy the quarantine officer that he is protected against small-pox. This person may actually be incubating a disease, but shows no evidence of it and may not do so until several days later. The present law stipulates that he should be vaccinated, but it does not provide for him to be kept in quarantine or under surveillance unless pratique is withheld from the aircraft. </para>
          <para>The quarantine officer may, therefore, be faced with whether he should withhold pratique, to the great inconvenience of all travellers on board, or grant pratique and risk the entry into Australia of a person about whose freedom from quarantinable disease he may have a doubt. </para>
          <para>The amendment proposed by the bill will remove this difficulty by enabling him to grant pratique, but place in quarantine or under surveillance a traveller about whose freedom from disease he may have doubts. I mention at this point that section S4 of the act states that a quarantine officer who maliciously, and without reasonable cause, orders any vessel, person, goods, animal or plants into quarantine is guilty of an indictable offence for which a penalty, of two years imprisonment is provided. </para>
          <para>The vast increase of air traffic from overseas into Australia has drawn attention to the necessity for this amendment, which will strengthen the hands of those who are entrusted with the responsibility of guarding Australia against the introduction of diseases which do not exist in this country. The bulk of overseas air traffic originates in or traverses the very countries, in Asia especially, where smallpox, cholera, plague and typhus are so prevalent. By reason of the island nature of its conformation, and its distance from other lands, Australia is ' in a unique  position to provide an effective quarantine guard against importation of disease. The effectiveness of this barrier may be gauged by our freedom down the years from the major quarantinable diseases. On rare occasions in the past, some of them have gained a foothold here, but they have always been eradicated. For approximately a quarter of a century none of these diseases has passed our quarantine barrier, although on many occasions they have been detected on vessels arriving at our seaboard. Australia and New Zealand are the only considerable countries in the world which are completely free of small-pox, cholera, plague and epidemic typhus, diseases which cause tremendous loss of life and efficiency in other lands. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Andrew</inline> Balfour, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, ' a foremostauthority on public health, referred to Australia's quarantine service as " possibly the most advanced and efficient in the world ", and no less an authority than <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Macgregor, physician, colonial administrator, explorer, author and former Governor of Queensland, stated that " in Australia, quarantine safeguards are established on a firm and scientific basis ". Australia may take pride in this international reputation, but the greatest satisfaction of those responsible for our happy position is to know that their efforts have helped to keep our country free from these scourges. </para>
          <para>Until comparatively recent years, our quarantine defences have had -to operate only with respect to comparatively slowmoving maritime traffic. The advent of air traffic has introduced a new factor into the problem. No longer can we rely on the lapse of time involved in a sea passage from port to port to assist us in our efforts. A traveller may be in Calcutta to-day and in Sydney, to-morrow, and even this speed of travel may be eclipsed in the near future. Air travel has speeded international communication to such a degree that it is possible for a person infected with smallpox or other exotic disease to arrive in Australia during the incubation period, and, unless adequate precautions existed, to traverse the length and breadth of the land before the disease is manifest. Such a happening could cause a major disaster in this country. Medical science has provided, in prophylactic vaccinations and inoculations, a means of protecting individuals against infection with certain diseases. The most important bulwark in Australia's protection against the eventuality that I have indicated is strict insistence on travellers themselves being .protected against these diseases by proven prophylactic measures. </para>
          <para>Clauses 3, 4, 5, 7, S and 9 of the bill relate to animal quarantine, and,, in the main, are designed to embody in the Quarantine Act powers which it was found necessary to grant under National Security (Control of Animal Diseases) Regulations during the war years, and which are, at present, contained in the Defence (Transitional Provisions) Act 1946. During the war years the abnormal shipping conditions vastly increased the risk of introduction into Australia of animal diseases. This increased risk drew attention to certain omissions from the legislation, which were rectified temporarily by regulations under the National Security Act, which the bill now proposes to incorporate in permanent legislation. To illustrate the very real danger to which Australia is exposed in this respect, I shall mention some of the animal diseases against which protection is needed. Rabies, or hydrophobia, is a frightful scourge, and Australia is the only continent which is completely free of it. It is widespread in Asia, Africa, the Americas, and in many parts of Europe. All mammalian animals can be infected with rabies, but carnivorous animals, chiefly dogs, are the main source of infection. Dogs are also the principal means by which humans become infected with rabies. Encephalomyelitis occurs in horses and allied species. This disease may be transferred from animal to animal, including many varieties of birds, and to man, by insect vectors, mosquitoes being the commonest. .This disease does not exist in Australia, but is very prevalent overseas, notably in North and South America and in part of Asia. The names, at least, of rinderpest and foot and mouth disease are known to most Australians. If these diseases became established in this country, they would cause chaos in our animal production. They are both highly  infectious and are spread by animal contact and ; by animal products and contaminated materials. In 1923,Western Australia had an experience of rinderpest, fortunately confined to a small area, and eventually eradicated. As a result of this experience, a prohibition was placed on the importation into any port in Australia of all cloven-footed animals unless they were for regulated importation. However, some difficulty has always been experienced in dealing with cases in which this prohibition was flouted. </para>
          <para>Ships' pets, such as monkeys, dogs, cats and various birds are required by regulations to be kept in confinement while a ship is in Australian ports. If these regulations are not observed, the ship's master is liable to prosecution. Such prosecution, however, does not render the animal any less menacing to Australia's animal health, and power is sought to have such animals seized and destroyed if they are not securely confined on board. This power existed under National Security (Control of Animal Diseases) Regulations Nos. 9 and 10, and it is considered that it was largely responsible for the effective way in which serious animal disease was prevented from gaining entry here during the war years. The hill provides for thepermanent retention of this power, so that Australia may be preserved from the tremendous economic loss which would result from the introduction of diseases of the type I have mentioned. </para>
          <para>The bill will enable the Quarantineservice to maintain a closerguard against the introductionof those diseases which have never become established in this country, hut which are a constant threat to the national health and economy. I commend the bill to the Senate. </para>

          <para>. - In answer to a question in relation to food for Britain which I asked this after noon, the Minister for Supply andShipping <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Ashley)</inline> sought further information. I know that the Government is doing everything possible to assist thepeopleofGreat Britain, and probably other dominion governments are doing the same, but communist and fascist organizations, mainly the latter, . are taking action designedto prevent food from being sent to Britain. When one takes up the daily press, one reads anti-Australian and anti-British statements  by  would-be fascists, claiming that Australia is being governed by bureaucrats, and is under a tyranny. These fascists are urging thepeopleof thisCountryto rebel. Obviously, they wish to foment revolution. They do not want to assist thecountry in its (present difficulties; they want to disrupt it. And they are aidedby conditions throughout the world generally. To-day, conditions are not very bright in any country. The people of Europe as a whole are practically confronted with semi-starvation, and the people of Great Britain are not much better off. Australia is the only country which , has continued rationing control into the peace in order to assist the people of the United Kingdom. While the people of this country are supporting the Government in its endeavour to help our kinsmen overseas, this anti-Australian and anti-British element is attempting to undermine our economic position with a view to' creating chaos. Surely, we are confronted with sufficient difficulties in the existing industrial unrest, in which the Commonwealth Government, because of our antiquated Constitution, is powerless to intervene. But these fascists are not content with that position, They seek to adapt the methods that were employed by Mussolini in Italy and Hitler in Germany in order to bring about disruption, with the object of overthrowing constitutional government, regardlessof party. It was for these reasons that I asked the Minister earlier to-day whether the security service was checking up on these people and keeping a tab on them, because I believe that they are a menace to Australia and if not kept under control will bring ill upon this country. </para>
