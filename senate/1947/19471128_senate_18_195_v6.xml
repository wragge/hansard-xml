                        <para>- I have received official advice of the matter mentioned by die honorable senator, and because of it's possible effect upon the pineapple industry in Queensland, I am experiencing considerable concern. I have not yet had an opportunity to review all the facts connected with the matter, but the difficulty has arisen, of course, from the acute shortage of dollars in Canada. The Government takes a most serious view of the situation and will do its utmost to safeguard the pineapple industry. </para>

                        <para>- I have not seen the reports to which the honorable senator refers. I understand that some complaint has been made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brown,</inline> who controls the distribution of coal in Victoria. That gentleman is very voluble with regard to this subject, and he constantly blames New South Wales when he alleges that Victoria does not receive an equitable share of the coal produced. Some time ago an arrangement was made with the Government of Victoria, through the Minister for Fuel and Electricity Undertakings in that State and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brown,</inline> whereby certain quantities of coal would be sent to Victoria and South Australia provided those States put aside a quantity each week in order to build up a stock for essential services during the miners' holidays. Those quantities were based on a certain production. That production has been achieved, and I am glad to be able to confirm the report that production this week will be a record for this year. I hope that the present rate of production will continue, and I am sure that the Opposition does so, too. There may be some justification for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brown's</inline> claim, because we have not been able at all times to obtain the necessary shipping to shift the coal to Victoria; but the Government is making every endeavour to provide the quantity which was promised by the Prime Minister and myself to Victoria in order to enable essential services in that State to be carried on during the Christmas holidays. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>On a previous occasion this week I had cause to complain about the calamity howling of the press and certain individuals about hold-ups in industry, hut in the interim reports have been published that gasworks and other utility undertakings will have sufficient coal if production continues at the present rate. This calamity howling will not help us in any way to meet this problem. However, whilst newspapers invariably appoint themselves as advisers to the Government on these matters, they cannot even agree as to how they should cut up a bit of newsprint among themselves. I assure honorable senators that, as far as it is humanly possible to do so, coal will .be distributed equitably among the States requiring it. Calamity howling in this matter is entirely unjustified. </para>

                        <para>- The Prime Minister' has supplied the following answer: - t)uring the war with Japan it became a common practice foi- allied service personnel to be employed at Australian ports, as well as at other bases of supply throughout the Pacific, in the loading of vessels conveying munitions and other supplies to front-line areas. This practice, which was designed to supplement the civilian labour available at Australian ports, was fully concurred in by the Australian Government as a means of expediting the shipment of urgently needed supplies to areas of active hostilities. Since the end of the war Netherlands service personnel have been allowed to continue to load Netherlands-owned supplies at Australian ports for shipment out of Australia. Throughout this two-year period the matter has been under review with the Netherlands authorities, and the Government has now asked .that the Netherlands service personnel be withdrawn. It is not considered desirable for allied servicemen to be employed in Australia f6r waterside work so long after the termination of hostilities. </para>

                        <para>.- This is a bill to grant sums of money to certain States and is similar to legislation which has come before the Senate annually for many years. The claims of those States for assistance from the Commonwealth are investigated carefully by the Commonwealth Grants Commission which then makes a recommendation to the Parliament. The Commonwealth and the States have every confidence in the commission, and it has become the custom for the Parliament to accept its recommendations and to make grants to the States accordingly. I shall not deal in detail with the proposals contained in the bill because the Senate, 'being a States' house, is fully representative of all of the States. The Opposition is in full accord with the recommendations of the Commonwealth- Grant's Commission and will not delay the passage of this bill which is designed to give effect to those recommendations. </para>

                        <para>.^ - The purpose -of this bill is to increase the salaries of Ministers of State. The Constitution made temporary provision of £12,000 a year for a maximum of seven Ministers. In 1941, the number was increased from eleven to nineteen, and the salary provision was raised accordingly to £21,250. The provision made under the Constitution represented an average of approximately £1,710 for each Minister. In 1941, the average was £1,120 for each Minister, and under the proposals now before us, the average will be £1,450. The measure is reasonable in view of the increases that have been granted to members of Parliament and to Commonwealth public servants to cover the higher cost of living. Ministers of State are carrying out a big job, and should receive an adequate remuneration. There is a responsibility upon us, 'however, to ensure that the people of this country shall get value for the money that they pay out in this way. I shall not impede the passage of this bill. </para>

                        (Queensland) f 20.52]. - I have no objection to the quantum of the allowance proposed. A man who is occupying the responsible position of a Cabinet Minister, and carrying out the onerous work of administering departments, must be adequately compensated for his labour. All our public men are entitled to a reasonable remuneration for the work that they do and the responsibility that they carry. However, I believe that as the exigencies, stresses and strains of war have passed, the number of Cabinet Ministers could be reduced. I do not suggest that with the idea of reducing the amount of the remuneration. As the Leader of the Opposition
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cooper)</inline>
                        has pointed out, in 1941 the number of Cabinet Ministers was increased from eleven to nineteen. That was justified in view of the additional work imposed upon the Government by the war; hut now peacetime' conditions have been restored, and I believe that the number of Ministers could be substantially reduced. This would involve not only the elimination of several portfolios, but also1 the saving of the huge expenditure incurred by redundant departments. For instance, staffing of the service departments could be substantially reduced and their administration amalgamated. Similarly, other departments now under the control of separate Ministers could conveniently be merged under the control df one Minister, particularly where the nature of the work and responsibility is cognate if not identical.

The position just prior to the war was that certain Ministers were controlling three or four departments and were overworked. Apart from that, adequate attention could not be given to the detailed administration of each department. Australia to-day is in a position to have the affairs of every major department controlled by one Minister. Even now, the task of certain Ministers is very onerous indeed, and rather than reducing the number of Ministers, we should be giving consideration to the appointment of assistant Ministers. </para>

                        <para>. - 1 disagree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Sullivan's</inline> contention regarding the number of Ministers, and I am quite prepared to leave the allocation of portfolios in the hands of the Government. However, I do not agree that the number of Ministers is really adequate, because I do not imagine that the Ministers of any government overseas have such a wide range of functions to perform as do the Ministers of the Australian Government. As one who has had some experience, through mem'bership of a State parliament, of the conduct of public business, I know that, unless a Minister's duties' are limited to supervision of one department, it is absolutely impossible for hiro to make himself conversant with every aspect of the duties which he is called upon to perform. Therefore, a reduction of the number of Ministers would worsen, rather than improve, the position. So far as the arrangement of ministerial duties is concerned, I have no  comment to' offer. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>I unhesitatingly support the bill. Reverting, for a moment, to the contention that the number of Ministers should be reduced, I believe that Ministers and members of the parliamentary institution are themselves responsible in no small degree for the growing contempt towards it. If we do not ourselves show sufficient regard for the dignity and importance of the Parliament, including insistence on adequate remuneration of Ministers and members of Parliament, we cannot expect the public to do so. </para>

[ have before me the list which shows the allocation of ministerial duties amongst mem'bers of the Government. That list shows that the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> also discharges the duties of Minister for External Affairs and is, in addition,  Deputy  Prime Minister. The Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holloway)</inline> certainly has a full-time job. The next portfolio which appears in that list is that of Minister for Air and Minister for Civil Aviation <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Drakeford).</inline> Whilst his duties in regard to the administration of the Royal Australian Air Force have declined considerably since the end of the war, his functions as Minister for Civil Aviation have increased very considerably. With regard to my own portfolio of Supply and Shipping, I find that I have so much to do that the days are not long enough. The Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Dedman)</inline> is also Minister for Post-war Reconstruction and Minister in charge of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. The Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward)</inline> also holds the portfolio of Minister for External Territories. In the case of Ministers who administer only one department, such as the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cameron),</inline> the increase of the functions and the volume of work of their departments more than warrants the full-time services of a Minister. I can assure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Sullivan</inline> that every Minister is fully occupied, and because of that the Government has no intention of reducing the number of Ministers. </para>

I was a member for a number of years, and gained thereby a first-hand knowledge of its purpose and functions. In view of that knowledge I believe that the present measure should have been introduced some time ago. The Opposition certainly does not oppose the bill. </para>

                        <para>.- The bill extends the benefits provided under the principal act to those who continued to serve in the forces after the cessation of hostilities and are still in the service. Secondly, it limits the date up to which eligibility may :be established by those who enlisted after the cessation of hostilities on the 2nd September, 1945. The latter provision conforms with the policy already established in  respect  of other forms of rehabilitation of ex-service personnel. </para>

                    <para>I have just received advice from the Minister for Works and Housing <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lemmon)</inline> that recently an alteration was decided upon regarding charges for architects' fees for persons eligible for assistance under the act. Instead of the 3 per cent, charged for specifications and plans by private architects, the War Service Homes Division has prepared at least 40 standard type designs from which applicants may make a selection. Under the new system the applicant may select any of these house designs, and will be supplied with copies of plans and specifications and working drawings for a fee of £4 4s. That improvement will be greatly appreciated by ex-service personnel. Under the old system, considerable delay was incurred in obtaining the services of private architects to supply designs to suit the individual requirements of applicants. </para>

                        <para>. - As I had much to do with the training of tradesmen, particularly ex-service personnel, after World War I., I welcome this measure. In the past, only the metal trades were represented on the dilution committees. Under this measure the provisions of that system will apply to employees in the boot manufacturing trade. I pay tribute to the valuable contribution made by the boot manufacturing industry to our war effort. No dispute occurred in the industry during the war, and the footwear turned out for our service personnel was equal to that produced for the forces of any other country. Following World War I., I was in charge of a large boot factory in Western Australia in which many ex-service personnel were trained. Under the old system, the expense involved in training .was shared by the Government and the employers. Under the agreement embodied in the measure, the employers and employees have arranged for the engagement of ex-service personnel in the industries concerned, and as soon as a trainee becomes 40 per cent, efficient in his trade he will be paid the full tradesman's wages. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>The dilution agreements and the arrangements between the Commonwealth, the unions and employers' organizations, permitted dilution in the skilled metal trades on the understanding that, when the emergency period had ended, normal trade practices would be resumed, and that at no time should dilutee tradesmen prejudice the rights to employment of recognized tradesmen. That understanding has always been regarded by the unions as the vital part of the dilution scheme. In addition, each added tradesman signed an agreement to abandon his employment if, and when, a competent recognized tradesman offered for such employment. Approximately 40,000 added tradesmen who had not qualified as tradesmen in the normal way were introduced into the trades covered by dilution arrangements. All of those men were associated with the metal trades. </para>
                    <para>In December, 1945, the unions which had been parties to the dilution schemes voluntarily relaxed their agreement with the Commonwealth in order to permit members of the forces with trade training and experience in the forces to train and qualify as recognized tradesmen. The Tradesmen's Eights and Regulation Act regulates the training and employment of such ex-servicemen, and in addition, deals with the abnormal industrial conditions directly resulting from the operation of war-time dilution regulations. As soon as these men .become 40 per cent, efficient, they are eligible to become tradesmen. This will not interfere in any way with the young men who are already apprenticed to the trade. In times gone by it was said by various organizations that there were too many apprentices in a particular trade and that young men such as these could not be taken into training. When I was working in Western Australia I trained nineteen, young soldiers, and I can say without fear of contradiction that eighteen of them became really good tradesmen. In fact, three of them are now working as foremen. It cannotbe said that the training of these young men will be detrimental to the apprentices. At the present time there are 8,600 journeymen in the boot trade throughout Australia, which entitles it to 2,866 apprentices, hut there are in fact only 1,249. Those figures will give an indication of the position to these young men who have so ably served their country. </para>
                    <para class="block">The rights of recognized tradesmen are safeguarded by an arrangement made by the employers, the employees and the unions. It is provided that an employer shall not, without the consent of the local committee, dismiss a recognized tradesman while any person of the same classification, other than a recognized tradesman, is employed by him in the sameestablishment. The award right of an employer to dismiss for malingering, neglect of duty and misconduct may still be exercised, although provision is made for an appeal by the person dismissed. It is the right of a probationary tradesman to receive not less than the rate of wage prescribed by the appropriate award. If the local committee is satisfied - that is a committee set up in each State, the Government appointing the  chairman  and two members being nominated by both the employers and the employees - that he has satisfactorily completed his period of probationary employment, it may issue him with a certificate of recognition as a recognized tradesman. When he is issued with such a certificate he enters the class of recognized tradesmen and has all the rights accorded to such tradesmen. </para>
                    <para>I was for 29 years a foreman in a boot factory, and therefore I should know something about the trade. Many of these young men who went overseas never had an opportunity to learn a trade while they were serving in the forces, but there are all sorts of crafts they can learn in the boot trade. There are, for instance, pattern cutters and clickers, both of which are skilled jobs. The trade is divided into six sections, not counting those who work in the stores. The work is not child's play; I have always argued that a worker in the boot trade Ls one of the hardest working men in Australia. He has to stand at his bench and slog away from the time the gong goes for starting work until the time it goes for finishing work. </para>
                    <para>I congratulate the Government on bringing this measure forward and for including in it these provisions relating to the boot trade, which has at all times, both in the 1914-18 war and in the last war, rendered yeoman service to the people of Australia. </para>

                        <para>. - I am in general agreement with the principle underlying this bill, which is to pay <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> bounty on all tractors manufactured in Australia for a period of years. Thi* matter was investigated very thoroughly by the Tariff Board in 1947. It presented its report on the 16th September, 1947, and I must commend the Government for having taken action so quickly upon the recommendations contained in that report. One of the recommendations was that the limits, if any, of the total amount of bounty payable in any financial year should be large enough to permit of payment in full of all claims likely to be made in each of the three years of continued operation. That will give these companies which are prepared to manufacture tractors in this country every stimulus to increase their rate of production. This industry is one that is very important to tikis country. The war taught us that it is very necessary to be. able to produce heavy types of machinery in Australia. Not only is the tractor most valuable in peace-time, but in wartime it becomes an absolute necessity. Experience gained from work on these tractors in peace-time will be of great value if it is ever necessary again to turn to war production. The tractor is becoming more and more essential to the carrying on of our farming industries. Although at the present time the local market is limited to a certain extent, the different companies which are manufacturing tractors of various types could perhaps <inline font-style="italic">get</inline> together in an attempt to standardize tractor parts and thus reduce the overall costs. The bounty will not only stimulate production and result in an assured market for the tractors when they are completed, .but it will also ensure that the machines shall be sold at reasonable prices. Especially will it ensure that tractors shall be available at reasonable prices to primary producers. It is to be regretted that more Australian-made tractors are not available now, but it takes some time for  ian  industry of this kind to get into full production. I am pleased that the output of the Australian factories is expected to reach 8,500 tractors in the financial year 1950-51, and I hope that that aim will -be realized. The manufacture of tractors is practically a new pea-ce-time industry in Australia and there is room for its considerable growth. The continuation of the bounty on tractors, and their manufacture in greater numbers in Australia, will he of groat value to Australian primary industries and I therefore have pleasure in supporting the bill. </para>

                        <para>. - I am pleased that the Government has seen fit to continue the bounty on tractors, because during recent years Australian primary industries have been at a great disadvantage through lack of man-power and machines. At times when there are man-power shortages, a lack of machinery on farms is a serious matter. This industry will give employment to a large number of skilled and semi-skilled worker? and the bounty, in addition to assisting employers and employees in the manufacturing industry, will be of great benefit to farmers and other primary producers who are the chief users of tractors. I hope that in the near future there will  be  mass production of  tractors  in Australia and consequently no need to import these machines. </para>

                        <para>. - tn <inline font-style="italic">reply</inline> - I appreciate the attitude of the Opposition to this bill as expressed by its Leader <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cooper)</inline> ; 'but I am not astonished that the measure has received the general support of honorable senators. The difficulties associated with dollars and exchange demand that every encouragement shall be given to industries of this kind in Australia. Tractors are of great value, especially to primary producers, and the demand for. them is strong. The Government believes that a continuation of the bounty will not only help those who use tractors, but will also be of advantage to Australia's economy generally. </para>
