I can recall Senator Alston complaining last year about a bill from the Hyatt. I got a refund from the Hyatt because at that stage I was charged a small suite rate for a larger suite or something; I do not recall. I do not even know what the percentage difference was, and I do not intend to run around spending the rest of my life trying to find out.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The United Nations has formally requested Australia to provide urgently to the UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia a movement control unit of 30 personnel for a period of four months. The Government has agreed to meet this request. The provision of this group is a critical requirement which can be met without detriment to our own capability and at minimum cost. There are about 4,000 UNTAC military personnel already in Cambodia, and a major influx of as many as seven battalions and support staff from a wide range of countries is about to begin.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The UN requirement is a temporary measure to meet an urgent need which will also allow the United Nations to get a permanent movement organisation in place without jeopardising the implementation of the settlement plan. The component will comprise nine teams of three specialist movement officers plus a coordination element. They will be deployed widely within Cambodia at major sea and airport locations and in Bangkok. The movement control group will be drawn from the three services. It will be ready to move to Cambodia by the end of this week. Costs will be met from the $49m allocated for Australia's UNTAC contribution.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister for Transport and Communications to the answer he gave yesterday to my question about the clandestine meeting that he has admitted he had in his car in 1986 with convicted criminal and standover man Joe Meissner, and in particular to the Minister's claim that its purpose was to inquire of Meissner what it was that he was prepared to sell to Mr Gary Sturgess of the then Opposition Leader's office for $100,000.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister can refer to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> if he wishes. I will repeat the last bit. I refer the Minister in particular to the Minister's claim that its purpose was to inquire of Meissner what it was that he was prepared to sell to Mr Gary Sturgess of the then Opposition Leader's office for $100,000. I ask the Minister: firstly, how did he know that Mr Meissner was negotiating to sell documents and photographs to Mr Sturgess for $100,000, when this information did not become public until the recent Meissner-Perger court case?  Secondly, did the Minister or Mr Warren Anderson, who arranged the Minister's meeting with Mr Meissner and at whose home a subsequent meeting with Mr Meissner took place in 1986, provide any inducements to Mr Meissner sufficient to result in the documents and photographs that had been offered for sale to Mr Sturgess being withdrawn from sale?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2178" SPEAKER="Richardson Sen The Hon G.F." NAMEID="4E4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="NSW" MINISTERIAL="TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would imagine that no-one would have wished to provide inducements which had anything to do with the photographs because they never existed. Ms Perger has made four statements about the `Love Boat'&mdash;two on oath and two on heroin. I take the view that we are better off looking at the ones on oath.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of yesterday's statement, I said that there was $100,000 in a suitcase which was being offered to Mr Meissner to say something about me or my colleagues in the Labor Party. That is what I said yesterday, so I can repeat that now. As far as Senator Baume saying that knowledge of this $100,000 only became known in the Meissner court case, he has got to be joking.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Sturgess performance in a Kings Cross coffee shop has been well known in Sydney for several years. Senator Baume does not want to know about it but, since he has given me the opportunity, I think he should be told. I think he should be given every detail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What happened on this occasion was that the now Director of the Cabinet office in New South Wales, with the express approval of the shadow Attorney-General and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, got one hundred grand and put it in a suitcase. I do not know where he got the one hundred grand from. I would be fascinated to know. Perhaps Senator Baume can enlighten us on that. Where did it come from?  The hundred grand was then taken to the office of a solicitor by the name of Barwick, a well-known name, one might say.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, a well-known name in the Liberal Party, as a matter of fact, as Senator Bolkus says. The money was put in a safe. It was at various times moved in and out of said safe, depending upon the meetings which Mr Sturgess was going to have. This now Director of the Cabinet office was sitting in a coffee shop in Kings Cross with one table between him and Meissner&mdash;he tried to claim later that there was no meeting with Meissner&mdash;and he had someone running between the tables, he said, to relay information.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I found it extraordinary when that story started doing the rounds in Sydney years ago and I thought it would not be a bad idea to find out to just what depths Sturgess and his colleagues might have gone. But, then again, I should have gotten the hint from the way Senator Baume has carried on here and from the way he slandered the Speaker yesterday; an apology for that should be forthcoming, and should be forthcoming now.</PARA>

In terms of documents, I can recall publicity about documents at the time&mdash;there was a great deal of it. I can remember a series of documents, which causes terrible embarrassment, that I had signed clearances for dead people to move from one branch to another, and these were supposed to be being offered for sale. What Senator Baume has probably conveniently forgotten is that I did a number of interviews at the time explaining that, in the Labor Party office, the General Secretary simply certifies that a branch secretary is sending a transfer. I am sure there were documents. There were probably lots of documents. They did not scare me one little bit. I said so at the time.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was not up in the coffee shop, but I can remember that at the very time that this was going on, the then Leader of the Opposition, amidst a great fanfare of publicity, said he was going to produce documents for the police commissioner. As a matter of fact, it was Mr Sturgess again who went up to produce the documents. What did he produce? Absolutely nothing, because for 10 years Senator Baume and his colleagues have been going on about this without one shred of evidence ever being produced, bar the word of Virginia Perger. That is the only thing they have ever had. They have never had a scrap of evidence, not one.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Improvement in affordability has come about for two reasons. First, interest rates have fallen. Senator Panizza would know that we are now able to get mortgages at rates of about 9 per cent. Secondly, the median price of first homes has fallen. That must be very gratifying to those of us who wish to encourage young couples, in particular, to make their first home purchase. Home buyers in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth are benefiting, therefore, not just from falling interest rates but also from lower house prices. On a national basis, the median price of a first house fell from $118,700 in December to $114,200 in the March quarter. This is good news. But, of course, the Opposition has a policy which will only increase house prices.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable senator has asked the question and I will answer it. The Parliament is now familiar with the fact that the Opposition would force up the cost of new houses by about $3,000 by imposing the GST on them. That is a very simple proposition. In addition, the Opposition would lift the cost of agents' and solicitors' fees by 15 per cent&mdash;that is, 15 per cent on the fee for the real estate agent and 15 per cent on the conveyancing fee for the lawyer. As I have said, that is added on to the impost of GST on the new houses. It is quite clear. What about the cost of furnishings and other additions to the house? The Senate can see how these would all add up. These price hikes would wipe out the gains made by home buyers over the last six months.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>I would have thought that that is what micro-economic reform is all about&mdash;about lean industry competing to deliver maximum benefits to the consumers, to the public.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Hill interrupted me when I was making an important point about what Mr Addis, the Director of the Tasmanian Forest Industries Association, had to say. He said that the decision:</PARA>

Much of this will need to be provided as food aid by donors because the countries affected have limited or no resources with which to pay for commercial imports.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At several meetings with the industry body, the Federation of Australian Radio Broadcasters, I have indicated that I agree with the industry's basic push that the number of new licences that have occurred in the last few years, added to the recession, have meant very difficult times for radio in Australia. Anyone who looks at the figures around the nation realises that there are an enormous number of radio stations losing money. Consequently&mdash;I am not sure whether it was the day before; I would have to check the dates&mdash;I did ask that a supplementary licence be looked at as an alternative in Lismore.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The way the current Act is drafted, however, I would imagine that there is no possibility of a supplementary licence getting up. I wanted to see, though, what view the Tribunal might take of having it, because once the Australian Broadcasting Authority is up and running after 1 July&mdash;that is, of course, on the brave assumption that we will get the new Bill through here in the next few weeks&mdash;I think supplementary licences in the new Act will be much more common than they have been in the past.

I believe it is important to recognise that under the National Campaign Against Drug Abuse and the Drug Offensive strategy there is a very clear realisation that if Australia is to deal with drug abuse, it must do so by a combination of means, including education, preventative programs and health and rehabilitation programs for those who are the victims of such abuse.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure that within that context, and given that goal, if the Government has decided, as the question suggests, that the methadone program might be modified, at least so far as government and taxpayer funded support is concerned, then it would be in relation to an alternative program or emphasis which would provide for the proper treatment of those who have become addicted, particularly to heroin.</PARA>

Are the 43 per cent increase in bankruptcies in the first nine months of this financial year compared with the corresponding period of last year and the current prevailing high levels of unemployment a reflection on the economy and the fact that it is not yet climbing out of a recession, as the Government claims, but is still deeply embedded and entrenched in it?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable senator refers to its being planned on the basis of the misinterpretation of a particular comment. The Liberal Party Government certainly did not plan its recession; it bungled into it and left this country with 10.5 per cent unemployment and 10.5 per cent inflation. Now, in an attempt to try to correct history, the shadow Treasurer and Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party has gone on television and said that inflation always comes down at the time of a recession.

The inflation rate in Australia is the envy of countries in the OECD and of countries in the Western world&mdash;also countries which have very substantial recessions.

The Australian Maritime Safety Authority is pursuing a range of initiatives aimed at improving both the standard and safety of shipping plying the Australian trade, particularly in the carriage of bulk cargoes.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this case, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Manila Transporter</EMPHASIS> developed a severe hull fracture in heavy seas and high winds while in the south Indian Ocean on a voyage carrying iron ore from Dampier to Port Talbot in Wales on 7 July last year. The crew had to abandon the ship and were rescued by another vessel. Despite later salvage attempts, the ship eventually sank about a month after its abandonment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The investigation that was subsequently carried out found that AMSA's inspection of this ship's lifesaving equipment in Australia prior to its departure from Australia had led to the repair of a number of serious faults in that lifesaving equipment and was directly instrumental in the crew's safe evacuation from the ship.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> AMSA is constantly reviewing and, as required, upgrading its ship inspection process. It has increased the number of ship surveyors, it has improved the inspection procedures and it has encouraged international cooperation in the sharing of information between countries in this region.

<PARA>The answer give by the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Richardson) today has not properly addressed the many questions that must be raised about his action. The circumstances surrounding this issue will shed light on why the Minister has acted inappropriately. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In May 1988, applications were called for an FM licence in the Lismore area. Two applications were received from interested parties. The Australian Broadcasting Tribunal conducted its hearing into the granting of the licence and, after waiting for a relevant decision from the Federal Court, the decision was handed down in December 1989 granting the licence to a syndicate named Northern NSW FM Pty Ltd. A legal challenge was then mounted asking for a re-hearing of the case. This was eventually granted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another legal challenge was mounted and eventually the re-hearing was set for 9 March 1992, four years after the applications were originally called for. At this meeting, the ABT received a request from radio station 2LM, the current AM licence holder in Lismore, to further delay the decision while it applied for a supplementary licence. This supplementary licence, if granted, would give 2LM control of both AM and FM bands in the Lismore area. This proposal comes four years after the original applications were called for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also at the ABT hearing it was revealed that Senator Richardson had written to the ABT, in this letter that I am holding, requesting that it consider the supplementary licence application in conjunction with the present hearing of the ABT. This, of course, would further delay the decision of the ABT. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time of Senator Richardson's letter, only a day before the hearing, the Minister had not received an application for the supplementary licence. It is completely unreasonable for the Minister to intervene to help a Johnny-come-lately at the last minute stage of the ABT proceedings. The process has been dragging on for four years and, just as the ABT hearing is about to conclude, the Minister intervenes on nothing more concrete than an assurance from an interested party that it would apply for a supplementary licence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fortunately, the ABT hearing continued as scheduled. However, a decision has still not been handed down by the ABT regarding the granting of the FM licence in Lismore. The ABT hearing concluded two months ago. As of this morning, the ABT had still not received any application for a supplementary licence. Therefore, the question immediately arises: what exactly is preventing the ABT from making its decision on this issue? The only answer can be the intervention of the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question then arises: on what grounds does the Minister intervene? The law, as it stands, requires that the ABT grant an independent licence if the market can support such a licence. The ABT has already ruled that this is the case in the Lismore market. Therefore, if the ABT is to give 2LM a supplementary licence, it must award an independent licence as well. It would therefore not prejudice the 2LM case for a supplementary licence if the ABT were to award the independent licence now and stop this ridiculous delay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also seriously questionable whether the ABT can actually hear a simultaneous hearing in this situation due to the sequence of events. For a simultaneous hearing to occur, an application for a supplementary licence must be lodged at the time of the notice of calling for applications for an independent licence or when an application for a supplementary licence is received the Minister must publish a notice calling for applications for an independent licence. Clearly, neither of these situations has occurred as the ABT still has no sign of the supplementary application. The Minister had not received the application by 6 March&mdash;almost four years after the original notice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thus, we do not have an adequate reason as to why Senator Richardson&mdash;the Machiavelli of Australian politics, as referred to in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Good Weekend</EMPHASIS> magazine&mdash;has seen fit to request that the ABT delay its decision. These delays are costing the applicants a great deal in time, money and effort. The people of Lismore have been waiting for four years for an FM radio service, a technology that has been available to the rest of the world for 40 years. The applicants for the licence, the people of Lismore and, by association, the people of Australia deserve a detailed and adequate explanation of the Minister's actions and an immediate resolution of this matter. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>Very briefly, I draw attention to the fact that the key findings of the audit were that absenteeism&mdash;that is, sick leave, special leave and short term leave without pay&mdash;accounted for about 6 per cent of the available staff working days, representing an annual salary cost of about $30m. This compares with an Australian industry work force average rate of only 4.5 per cent, dramatising the fact that staff savings and increased productivity could be achieved if the level of absenteeism was reduced to the Australian average, let alone to a better figure than that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General's report notes that the Australian Taxation Office has recognised the need to monitor overall absenteeism rates and identify, where possible, the causes of absenteeism. It further notes that the Australian Taxation Office had devolved attendance recording responsibilities to sectional management without identifying and documenting the risks and benefits of doing so. The Australian Tax Office has agreed to conduct a post-implementation review of the devolution of control over attendance recording. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final basic finding of the report was that there was a need for improvement in management control over attendance and leave recording. Attendance records were subject to limited checking by sectional management and leave taken was not always properly recorded on staff leave records. As a result, it was found that staff absence entitlements could be exceeded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is always a risk that within the public bureaucracies, particularly when there is flexitime, there is scope for a considerable amount of absence, both formal and informal. The Australian Auditor-General has quite properly pointed to the extent to which formal absences in the Australian Taxation Office have exceeded the Australian average. Clearly as a result that is a matter of some concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that the positive response by the Australian Taxation Office to the Auditor-General's report will lead to an improvement.

<PARA>Report No. 31, the Auditor-General's project report into the use and management of consultants by the Australian Taxation Office, is very damning. In 1990-91 the cost to the Tax Office of the consultancy services that it engaged was, according to the Auditor-General, a figure in excess of $8m. In fact, according to the table on page 2 of the report, the figure was $8.7m, which compares with a figure of only $5m the year before. So in the year 1990-91 the increase in the cost of consultancy services was a huge 74 per cent. I note that the findings of the report relate to issues other than the actual cost of the consultancy services. Nevertheless, I draw the Senate's attention to that very high cost of consultancy services engaged by the Australian Taxation Office and the enormous increase that occurred in 1990-91.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The more significant fact is the finding of the Australian National Audit Office that the Tax Office had not formally implemented administrative arrangements for the purchasing, managing, monitoring and reporting of consultancy services until December 1991. Indeed, in many instances it had not complied with the guidelines for the contracting of consultancy services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In October 1988 the Government endorsed a range of purchasing reforms. Those reforms included the issuing of guidelines, by the authority of the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) under finance regulation 42 on, amongst other things, best purchasing practices and techniques. The guidelines arising from the purchasing reforms included a guideline on the contracting for consultancy services. That was issued by the Department of Administrative Services in November 1990. That guideline outlines the required practices and responsibilities for planning, acquiring and managing consultancy services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The time gap of three years and two months between the reforms announced by the Government in the area of purchasing until the Tax Office's compliance with them in December 1991 is a very concerning finding of the National Audit Office. Why on earth was a delay of that nature incurred? It is very important in terms of government purchasing practices generally&mdash;this applies perhaps even more so than in other areas of government purchasing&mdash;that there be seen to be transparency in the relationship between government and its suppliers. That applies particularly in the area of consultants, where we have seen so many examples over recent years of members of the public sector and members of government departments resigning on a Friday and starting work as a consultant on the Monday, often employed as a consultant by the very organisations from which they have resigned just the week before. I am not suggesting that that has happened to any considerable extent in the Taxation Office. That is not clear from the Audit Office report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Transparency in the Government's use of consultants is of primary importance. The fact that there was a three-year delay between the issuing of these reforms by the Government and their recognition and adoption by the Australian Taxation Office is extraordinary and disturbing. When there is not transparency, there is always the opportunity for corruption, or for the less than efficient use of taxpayers' funds. If there is not open competition in the advertising for consultants and the appointment of consultants, there is obviously scope for government money to be spent in a less efficient way than it should be spent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the key recommendations of the Audit Office is that the Australian Taxation Office, where practicable, follow competitive selection procedures for the engagement of consultancy services as outlined in the necessary directives, and that where this is not practicable the reasons and authority for not doing so should be properly documented. It was a matter of necessity that the Tax Office apparently agreed with that recommendation. It is a matter that we will be watching very closely to ensure that it follows the recommendation of the Audit Office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other aspect that concerns me&mdash;I would assume it would concern every taxpayer, particularly those taxpayers who have been subject to increasing vigilance by the Tax Office and the Taxation Commissioner in recent years&mdash;is that many taxpayers have been hounded and harassed by the Tax Office for the mildest of misdemeanours, if any, and in many cases for unconscious omissions or transgressions as a result of filling in the tax forms. The taxpayers of Australia have been hounded progressively over recent years, as has been discussed here many times, and often apparently in an unfair way. To find that the Tax Office, whilst pursuing that purity of approach in relation to taxpayers, has itself, in such an important area, for whatever reason, neglected to adopt the principles, procedures and reforms laid down by the Australian Government in relation to the engagement of consultants, smacks of hypocrisy and massive double standards. The Tax Office stands condemned for its failure in this area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Report No. 31 of the Auditor-General concerning the Australian Taxation Office is very timely in that it, along with the series of reports concerning the Australian Taxation Office, coincides with the inquiry being conducted by the Public Accounts Committee into the Australian Taxation Office. We have also had the opportunity of questioning the Australian Taxation Office during Estimates hearings, where we saw massive evidence that that Office has set one standard for taxpayers and left its own standards or its own housekeeping in the most appalling disorder. Indeed, Mr Boucher has gone on record as saying that many small businesses in particular fail to keep adequate records. In the Estimates Committee hearings we saw that the Australian Taxation Office itself had fallen far short of the mark in relation to anything like adequate record keeping.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In dealing with consultancies, this particular report draws two important matters to our attention. The first is the manner in which the Australian Taxation Office has gone about adhering to procurement guideline No. 13, issued in November 1990, and the second is the manner in which it adhered subsequently to the Commissioner's own directives, subject to that guideline, as to how the Taxation Office is to behave in the selection and employment of consultants. As my colleague Senator Short has outlined, adherence has been lacking. He drew particular attention to the fact that every year the Taxation Office&mdash;along with all government departments and agencies&mdash;is required to publish a list of the consultants it has employed, the tasks involved and how much they were paid. The worrying thing here is that, as the Auditor-General points out, only $5m worth of consultancy has been reported while $8m was in fact spent in the relevant period. Again, this is a blatant lack of proper record keeping. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, it draws attention to the fact that the way in which the Government has gone about procuring goods and services since the change in the method of procurement, as set out by DAS, has led to a most unsatisfactory situation. We have seen more and more large contracts let where there has been no tender process and where one could say, perhaps unfairly in some cases, that there has been the selection of somebody's four first best friends or two first best friends&mdash;two people who cannot compete&mdash;and confidence in the method of procurement has been left wanting. Page 5 of the Auditor-General's report states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The overriding objective of the reforms&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>reforms brought about in the way procurement was to take place&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">is to obtain value for money through the process of open and effective competition.</PARA>
<PARA>The problem with that concept is that it seems to be honoured more often in the breach than in the observance. Again and again we are seeing examples through committees of scrutiny where those necessary adjuncts, the process of open and effective competition, really seem not to have been relevant to the choice in the way a contract has been let. In relation to this report, the Australian Tax Office's annual report showed that, of 325 consultancies, 81 per cent had been engaged without either a selective process or being advertised publicly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had the most extraordinary example in the hearings of Estimates Committee A dealing with DITAC, the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce, where a contract to the value of $169,000 was awarded to one Mr Paul Batchelor, a former director of the Westmex Corporation, who did not even write a report in return for that $169,000. The Deputy Secretary to the Department, Dr Bell, regarded the contract as a shoe leather contract where there was no anticipation of a so-called glossy report being furnished at all. That was Dr Bell's testimony to the Estimates hearing. Subsequently I received further answers from the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce that said that Mr Batchelor had, in fact, prepared a conceptual paper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is very interesting, but for $169,000 I think the taxpayer is entitled to expect more than a conceptual paper for a contract which was first described by Dr Bell as a shoe leather contract. Indeed, the result of that was that the same Mr Batchelor was made a director of a company on which the Secretary to the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce and the Chairman of the AIDC sit and was meant to administer that $1 billion fund which never eventuated. What curious machinations are going on in our method of procurement!  I hold the Ministers responsible in these areas. The public servants are overseen under our system by the Ministers. They make the policy and they are responsible for ensuring that there is proper administration within their own departments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here we see in this Taxation Office report reams of evidence that the Taxation Office simply has not been complying with either the Government's requirements as to the way in which consultancies are administered or the internal directions of the Commissioner himself. What does that tell us? It tells us at the end of the day that the administration of the Department seems to have been largely left to its own purview and that the ministerial oversighting is itself lacking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have the curious examples of the way in which the Taxation Office chooses to exercise its powers against prominent individuals. One is with regard to the current unelected Prime Minister, Mr Keating, when he failed to lodge his tax return. All he got was a letter saying, `Tut, tut. Naughty boy. Please pop it in'. It is a bit like Senator Richardson. He forgets to declare that he was a director of a certain company when he is obliged to. It is selective morality, if you like. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, in relation to Mr Phillip Smiles, who had a disagreement with the Commissioner of Taxation over the question of apportionment, which is a fairly common argument that the Commissioner has with other taxpayers, the Commissioner has chosen to prosecute Mr Smiles under the Crimes Act as distinct from the Tax Administration Act, which would be the normal way to proceed where a fine would ensue. The blatantly political way which has been chosen&mdash;to go under the Crimes Act and therefore imperil his seat in the Parliament&mdash;can only be seen to be what it is. It has been seen to be selectively moral in that it allows Mr Keating to get off scot-free, yet Mr Smiles is to be put into jeopardy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those are the only two examples we have on the record. Here we have the Auditor-General telling us in a series of reports, both these reports No. 30 and No. 31, that the manner in which the Taxation Office is conducting its own affairs is far from satisfactory. Indeed, going back to the Estimates hearings, we heard evidence from one Mr Butterfield, who was responsible for beginning an inquiry into the Taxation Office to see who had breached section 16 of the taxation legislation, which requires secrecy. When he was required to carry out an inquiry as to where that leaking of information had come from, he reported to the Estimates Committee that he had been advised that it was not the Tax Office and, therefore, he thought he was absolved, like Pontius Pilate, of any responsibility. But then he went on to tell us that he did not even bother to read the report. Here was a department that had a report, locked it up in a safe and nobody read it. That department thought it was absolved of all responsibility. It is not good enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is better, I suppose, than the example of the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce where, for $169,000, no report was even written. We were told subsequently&mdash;this is the curious shoe leather contract&mdash;that there were just a few odds and sods of papers. One does get a sense of great disquiet. It has always been said that there is no room in the public sector for corrupt behaviour, yet we heard, again in Estimates hearings, from the Tax Office that 35 tax officers were subject to fraud prosecutions. There is plenty of scope in an area where there is $8 billion worth of procurement annually. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say it again: the responsibility must sheet back to the Ministers responsible. We must start asking the questions. If the administration of these departments is so bad and so sloppy, the Minister's head is the one that has to be asked for. More and more we will be looking very specifically at the way in which Ministers are oversighting their departments and taking responsibility for what is going on. They are sworn in as members of executive government to take that responsibility; they are paid in accordance with that responsibility; they answer here in Question Time, often in a facetious manner, without conveying information. Nonetheless, at the end of the day it is they who are responsible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this case it is the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) who is responsible. It is the Treasurer who must be held accountable for the appalling state that the Tax Office's own records are apparently in.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government recognises that nuclear science and technology can be used in many ways which are beneficial to Australia. It was specifically to encourage the safe, peaceful and beneficial use of nuclear science and technology that the Government, in 1987, legislated to revise the charter and change the name of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That legislation established the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (Ansto). Its principal functions are to undertake research and development in relation to nuclear science and technology, the use of isotopic techniques and nuclear radiation for medicine, science, industry, commerce and agriculture, and the production and use of radioisotopes. Also, Ansto is required to encourage and facilitate the application and utilisation of the results of such research and development.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Radioactive Materials and Waste</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ansto has conditioned, stored and managed radioactive materials and wastes for many years both on its own account and on behalf of other parties. However, this activity was recently challenged when the Sutherland Shire Council took action in the NSW Land and Environment Court. It sought, inter alia, to restrain Ansto from transferring to the Lucas Heights Research Laboratories (LHRL) 17 cubic metres of radioactive waste from the St Marys site of Australian Defence Industries (ADI), and to require Ansto to remove from LHRL some 2,000 cubic metres of radioactively contaminated soil from the former CSIRO site at Fishermans Bend, Victoria. These wastes were to be stored at LHRL pending the construction of a national repository for radioactive wastes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The issue before the Court was whether the storage was in accordance with the provisions of the NSW Environmental Planning and Assessment Act. Safety was conceded as not being an issue. The judge accepted that LHRL is presently the safest site in Australia for the storage of such material.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In his decision on 5 February 1992, Mr Justice Cripps found in favour of the Council. His ruling, inter alia, restrained Ansto from transferring the ADI wastes to LHRL and ordered Ansto to remove the CSIRO wastes within three years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One effect of these orders is to prevent Ansto providing certain services essential for public health and safety.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These include, for example, bringing to LHRL for repair packages containing radioactive substances which have been damaged in handling at airports. Such services are obviously in the public interest. In the circumstances, the Government has decided that Ansto's powers in this area must be placed beyond doubt.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments accord Ansto the function of conditioning, managing and storing radioactive materials and waste from its own activities or from companies in which it has a controlling interest. The function extends to other radioactive substances from persons who are specified in regulations, thereby allowing Parliamentary scrutiny where such cases arise.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments respect the order of the NSW Land and Environment Court that Ansto must remove the CSIRO waste from Lucas Heights by 5 February 1995. In addition, the ADI waste cannot be moved to LHRL except by specific regulation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The judgment of the NSW Land and Environment Court has focused attention more sharply on the need for a permanent repository for Australia's low level radioactive wastes. My colleague, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, has been actively seeking the co-operation of the State and Territory Governments in locating areas for investigation to identify a suitable site.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has ordered a full investigation of the technical, legal and other issues concerning the conditioning, management and interim storage of the ADI and CSIRO wastes. A report will be prepared by December 1992 identifying all practicable options. These actions clearly demonstrate that the Government has no intention of allowing the Lucas Heights Research Laboratories to become, de facto, a national radioactive waste repository.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Commercial Activities</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government decided some time ago that public research institutions such as Ansto should be encouraged to become more commercial in their orientation and activities. Ansto has made good progress in this direction. The proportion of non-Budget revenue in its total revenue reached 30 per cent in the 1990-91 financial year&mdash;two years ahead of schedule.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the Ansto Act constrains the extent to which Ansto can make further progress. The Act may not be sufficiently specific, for example, to provide for Ansto's development and operation of its Business and Technology Park.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These amendments will ensure that Ansto has a statement of functions which permits it to carry out fully the Government's intentions regarding the commercialisation of its activities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Immunity from certain State and Territory Laws</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The degree to which Ansto, a Commonwealth instrumentality situated in the State of New South Wales, is legally bound by NSW laws is a complex issue. The policy of successive Commonwealth Governments is that such instrumentalities are to operate consistently with all State laws where there is no existing, parallel, Commonwealth law and where those laws do not directly conflict with the existing Ansto Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, advice has been received from the Attorney-General's Department that the Ansto Act does not provide that Ansto is a Commonwealth agent or emanation. Ansto may, therefore, be fully subject to the laws of the State of New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth has never intended that Ansto should be fully subject to State laws. Indeed, this situation is unacceptable as it may impair Ansto's ability to carry out its functions properly and may even be prejudicial to safety.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accordingly, Ansto is to be provided with immunity from certain classes of State and Territory laws. Similar clauses are included in the legislation which established ADI and the Civil Aviation Authority. On the advice of the Attorney-General's Department, the proposed amendment is to apply retrospectively.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Once again, the amendment respects the judgment of the NSW Land and Environment Court in that it contains a clause excluding the CSIRO waste from immunity after 4 February 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nuclear Safety Bureau</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Ansto Act established a Nuclear Safety Bureau which is responsible to the Minister for monitoring and reviewing the safety of any nuclear plant operated by the Organisation. The Ansto Board appoints the staff of the Bureau and may assign it other functions to perform.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In practice, the NSB has operated with complete independence of Ansto's management. However, the structure of the Act means that the independence of the NSB is open to question. The Government has decided, therefore, to amend the Act to ensure that the NSB is independent of Ansto de jure as well as de facto.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new NSB will have the principal functions of monitoring and reviewing the safety of any nuclear plant owned or operated by Ansto, and of providing technical advice to the Commonwealth on the safety of nuclear plant and related matters. It will be funded directly by Parliamentary appropriation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Administrative Matters</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These Sections of the Bill tidy up a number of administrative matters. They deal with matters such as employment conditions for the Executive Director of Ansto, and the setting of a realistic maximum monetary level&mdash;$1,000,000&mdash;for contracts which Ansto can enter without Ministerial approval.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Financial Implications</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments have only minor financial implications. Additional costs in the order of $150,000 annually will be incurred on an on-going basis to cover added administration costs associated with separating the NSB from Ansto.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the Bill to Honourable Senators and I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government is proposing this Bill in response to a report of the Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities dated November last year and called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Use Immunity Provisions in the Corporations Law and the Australian Securities Commission</EMPHASIS>. The Committee also reported on the rights of witnesses before investigations and hearings initiated by the Australian Securities Commission and the use which may be made of the evidence, both oral and documentary, gathered at such hearings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its report the Committee noted that in hearings under both the Australian Securities Commission law and the corporations law, the right to silence is removed. Section 597 (12) of the Corporations Act provides as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A person is not excused from answering a question. . . on the ground that the answer might tend to incriminate him or her but, where the person claims, before answering the question, that the answer might tend to incriminate him or her, neither the answer, nor any information, document or other thing obtained as a direct or indirect consequence of the person giving the answer, is admissible in evidence against the person in criminal proceedings. . . </PARA>
<PARA>Section 68(3) of the Australian Securities Commission Act provides as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Neither the statement, or the fact that the person has signed the record or produced the book, as the case may be, nor, in the case of the making of a </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">statement or the signing of a record, any information, document or other thing obtained as a direct or indirect consequence of the person making the statement or signing the record, as the case may be, is admissible in evidence against the person in:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)a criminal proceeding; or</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)a proceeding for the imposition of a penalty;. . . </PARA>
<PARA>The indemnification provided by making the oral evidence&mdash;and in the case of section 68(3) of the ASC law the signing of the record and the production of a document&mdash;inadmissible in criminal proceedings is described as a use immunity. The person is also indemnified against the use of evidence gained indirectly from leads provided by answers to questions or documents produced to the investigators. This is what is described as derivative use immunity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ASC and the Director of Public Prosecutions claim that this places an insurmountable obstacle in the way of successful criminal prosecutions. This is because, in the interests of preserving the assets of a company, or otherwise minimising the loss resulting from mismanagement or fraud, the ASC will seek to act quickly through civil actions in the first instance. The ASC is concerned that, by using its powers to compel evidence in order to seek civil remedies, it will be prevented from obtaining admissible evidence which could be used in subsequent criminal prosecutions. The ASC and the DPP provided to the Committee a number of cases where they had moved down the track of a broad investigation and had then come across instances where future potential criminal proceedings may be in order. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ASC and the DPP have recommended to the Committee that both the use immunity and the derivative use immunity be removed from the corporations law and the ASC law, which is effectively a return to the provisions of the old Companies Code. The main arguments that have been put in favour of such abolition are, first, that to remove the derivative use immunity would not set a precedent; secondly, that public opinion would support the abolition of a derivative use immunity;  and, thirdly, that derivative use immunity is anathema to the ASC's regulatory function. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main arguments against abolition put to the Committee are, first, that the current legislation corresponds to the protection offered by the common law privilege against self-incrimination and that the privilege is a fundamental right which should not be withdrawn. Secondly, it is said that the ASC is exaggerating the difficulties it faces as a result of the immunities and that to increase its powers may encourage unfair investigative techniques. Thirdly, there is the argument that the ASC is misreading its role by placing undue emphasis on the pursuit of criminal prosecutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The common law privilege against self-incrimination is an ancient one. It has long been established as a principle that individuals who are facing criminal prosecution enjoy the right to remain silent. It extends to direct incrimination and indirect incrimination. When the privilege is set aside, as it is in the corporations law and the Australian Securities Commission law, it is because the legislature has made an assessment that the public interest to have access to information outweighs the private right of the individual to refuse to answer questions. There is usually a restriction on the uses to which that information can be put. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the end the majority of the Committee came to the view that effective regulation of the corporate sector may include legislative provisions which vary the established common law rights available to the ordinary citizen. It has accepted the evidence of the ASC that the immunity applying to the production of documents and the derivative immunity applying to oral evidence curtail the ASC's investigatory powers to an extent that seriously limits its capacity to discharge the responsibilities placed upon it by the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It recommended that section 597 (12) of the Corporations Act and section 68(3) of the ASC law be amended to remove the derivative use immunity provisions, and that section 68(3) also be amended to remove the use immunity with regard to the fact that a person has produced a document. The Committee also recommended that these amendments lapse after five years, unless their application is confirmed by the Parliament within that period. That is what we call a sunset clause. The Committee's final recommendation was that both laws be amended to clarify that neither the use immunity nor the derivative use immunity is available to corporations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to note that the Committee's views were not unanimous. There is a dissenting report to which I put my name and which was prepared by my colleague on the other side of the chamber Senator Cooney, and by my colleague in the other place Mr Frank Ford. The minority report prefers the view that the limitation of the indemnity to answers given&mdash;and then only so long as they do not relate to the identification of documents&mdash;puts the rights of individuals too much at risk. We, the dissenters, concluded that the law treats the right to silence as a matter of extremely high principle. The protection it provides against the power of the state should not be diminished, except in accordance with the principle of comparable standing, and a principle of that quality has not been advanced in this instance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has proposed this Bill to implement the recommendations of the majority of the Committee. It purports to abolish derivative use immunity under the ASC and corporations legislation on the grounds that such abolition would enhance the ability to secure convictions under the corporations law. It also abolishes use immunity for the production of books. This means that the fact books were produced can be used as incriminating evidence in criminal trials. The coalition takes the view that a distinction can be drawn between making statements to regulatory authorities and producing documents. We agree that there is no strong reason for the retention of the use immunity in relation to the production of documents. It is difficult to imagine that the ability to lead evidence that the accused produced certain documents will lead to abuse. Once such evidence is led, then the documents can speak for themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition also argues that the privilege against self-incrimination should be treated as a personal privilege and should not be available to bodies corporate. We support the provision in clause 8 of this Bill which makes this clear. However, for the reasons canvassed in the Committee's minority report and also covered in considerable depth by the shadow Minister for corporate law reform and consumer affairs in the other place, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), the coalition does not support that part of the Bill which abolishes derivative use immunity in relation to non-voluntary, self-incriminating statements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Briefly, the reasons for this are as follows:  firstly, it has not been shown that derivative use immunity has prevented any prosecution. Indeed, in the evidence that the ASC and the DPP put before the Committee, they cited a number of cases, but in none of those cases could it be specifically shown that derivative use immunity had prevented any prosecution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the privilege against self-incrimination is an ancient one and should not be lightly diminished. Again, this was referred to in the report. The Committee gave it long and hard deliberation, as I am sure my colleague Senator Lewis will refer to later in this debate. On the evidence to the Committee, in my view&mdash;I am supported by the coalition&mdash;circumstances have not been made out to abolish this ancient privilege against self-incrimination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, the abolition would increase the powers of the Australian Securities Commission, which already has greater power than the police in the investigation of offences. The privilege against self-incrimination can be claimed by a person who is being questioned by the police about a criminal offence, but not when he or she is being questioned by investigators of the Australian Securities Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lastly, the notorious offenders of the 1980s will not be affected, as they will be prosecuted&mdash;if at all&mdash;under the legislation which was then in force. I will return to that matter a little later because I know it is of specific concern to my colleague Senator Spindler. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was recognised by the Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities in its report that use immunity and derivative use immunity are essential complements to the removal of access to the privilege by legislation, and thus we should be especially wary of further eroding this privilege. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is obviously a need to strike a balance between the Australian Securities Commission's desire to secure convictions and the ancient privilege of self-incrimination. In the present circumstances the coalition has come to the view that the privilege against self-incrimination is far more important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I foreshadow that I will be moving amendments on behalf of the Opposition to remove those provisions abolishing the derivative use immunity. In the event that our amendments are not going to receive the necessary support&mdash;and I am led to believe by Senator Spindler that they will not&mdash;we will vote against the Bill at the second reading. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were some other matters which I wanted to bring to the attention of the Senate in relation to the report of the Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities, which specifically, I thought, would be of interest to Senator Spindler, who I know has almost an unhealthy blood lust for trying to get the corporate crooks of the 1980s put behind bars. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Some of those people are probably my constituents in Western Australia. One of the arguments of the ASC, the DPP and, in the end, the majority of the Committee which Senator Lewis, Senator Spindler and I have the pleasure of being on was this argument of the public interest outweighing the rights of the individual when it comes to the privilege against self-incrimination. The public interest is the argument that we have to deal with. As we have said many times in this debate, we have to create a balance with the public interest, create some integrity in our securities markets, create public confidence in our corporations and securities environment and, on the other hand, protect the privileges and rights&mdash;and very fundamental rights, in my view&mdash;of the individual.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In some evidence that was provided by Mr Santow, I think it was, to the Committee, he made a specific point in relation to the immunity which is provided at royal commissions versus the immunity that is provided under the ASC investigations. Mr Santow said, referring to the Sorby case:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe Sorby's case, which really was dealing with royal commissions, is necessarily apposite in this context. Royal commissions are not ASC investigations. They are designed in the public interest to find out the facts about a matter . . . I do not think it flows automatically from the fact that the High Court said that should not be used in criminal proceedings that the same public interest issues are at stake when the ASC. . . gets information under compulsion.</PARA>
<PARA>I put it to the Senate, and particularly to Senator Spindler, that it is very hard to argue, on the one hand, that the public interest is preserved by taking away people's rights in relation to evidence before the ASC and, on the other hand, to claim that there is some higher public interest in relation to the proceedings of a royal commission. That is a point that perhaps Senator Spindler should consider. I do not deny that there should be a balance&mdash;I know Mr Santow's evidence was quite convincing for the Committee; I am sure that it influenced Senator Spindler&mdash;but he is really using the public interest on the one hand to support his argument and on the other hand to knock it down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point I want to raise in relation to the blood lust for putting in gaol corporate offenders from the 1980s and what that actually will achieve is the difference that we draw between the privilege that a blue collar criminal or even a capital criminal&mdash;a murderer or a rapist&mdash;receives in front of a court compared with a corporate criminal, a white collar criminal. There will be no equality for this privilege if we pass this Bill because the rapists, the murderers&mdash;the sorts of people who are going around needlessly bashing up people in the streets of Los Angeles at the moment&mdash;will receive a greater privilege than those people who are suspected of conducting a corporate crime. I have a quotation here to support my view. It comes from the Law Society of New South Wales. Mr Ehrlich, who also gave evidence before our Committee, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . equality before the law demands that crime of whatever nature, whether so-called `blue collar' or `white collar' should be subject to the application of egalitarian principles and procedures of investigation and prosecution and to the like preservation of the freedom of the individual from possible abuse of power in seeking to protect the public interest.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that is a very important principle. It is the principle supported by Senator Cooney as a minority reporter and supported by the Opposition in relation to this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Santow, on the opposite side of the ledger, made a point in relation to the Guinness case in the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom has some very intrusive investigation powers and does not offer the people whom it is investigating any immunities from use of derivative evidence. Of the Guinness case, Mr Santow said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . what it brought home to people&mdash;and it is affecting corporate behaviour&mdash;is that it is not just a matter of putting the money back; people actually went to gaol. People like you and me in blue suits and nice shirts went to gaol.</PARA>
<PARA>I was not there on that day, but I am sure that Senator Spindler had a big smile on his face when Mr Santow said that. Senator Spindler probably said, `This is my kind of guy'. That reflects the blood lust. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It brings us to the issue of the difference between civil remedies in relation to corporate law and criminal remedies. One of the policy aspects that the Senate and the Parliament should be dealing with is to what extent we expect the Australian Securities Commission to be a police force, to be a sort of corporate gestapo, going on fishing expeditions, looking into companies and trying to get criminal prosecutions. The Commission should be going about its business seeking civil remedies where possible, ensuring that there is a fair and open environment for corporate practices, that there is an ethical basis and that there is a very clear understanding in both the corporate world itself and the community at large of what is expected of directors, managing directors and corporations. There should also be a clear understanding of the remedies when they cross the line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last point I move to concerns the consequences of our action here today. One of the biggest advantages of having an immunity&mdash;of being able to compel evidence on the one hand, but being able to offset that reduction in the privilege against self-incrimination on the other&mdash;is that we can get much greater cooperation from the witnesses that we are investigating. If the witness knows that whatever he says cannot be used in evidence in criminal prosecutions, one would naturally expect that that witness would be far more cooperative with the investigation, and the longer term aims and objectives of the Australian Securities Commission would, of course, be enhanced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Ehrlich, again from the Law Institute of Victoria, made this point better than I am able to when, commenting upon what happens if the immunities are removed, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Such a position would lead to a situation in which the corporate regulatory mechanism would discourage witnesses from providing frank and full disclosure where the witness might be subject to criminal sanction. This would grossly undermine the objective of corporate regulation in getting to the bottom of corporate transactions so as to enable shareholders and creditors to use the information obtained in civil actions for damages or other civil remedies.</PARA>
<PARA>That makes the point very well about the role of the Australian Securities Commission. Should it be a sort of corporate Gestapo trying to lock up blue-suited, nice-shirted business people who ran amuck in the 1980s? Or should it be trying to create a corporate environment, seeking civil remedies and looking after the interests of the shareholders as opposed to, I guess, the natural blood lust that comes from wanting to lock up some of these corporate transgressors from the 1980s?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, from a political point of view&mdash;and I would not even impute these motives to Senator Spindler or to the Attorney-General, Michael Duffy&mdash;having a few corporate crooks from the 1980s put behind bars would show the people of Australia that the move from the old cooperative scheme to the new centralised Australian Securities Commission scheme has been a success. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regardless of all the other issues that people like Senator Spindler, myself and the members of the Joint Statutory Committee have been exposed to over the last few months during which our Committee has been in existence; and regardless of all the complicated issues relating to getting the corporate framework right in Australia&mdash;directors' duties, insolvencies and all the other issues that we are contending with&mdash;the success or failure of this new scheme in the mind of the public and in the politics of Australia will, of course, have been achieved with a couple of lynchings. I think that is really part of the political motivation behind what is being done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by again referring to Henry Bosch, the former head of the National Companies and Securities Commission, who addressed a National Institute of Accountants lunch, on Friday I think it was, in Adelaide. Mr Bosch was soliloquising about what will happen in Australia when the next boom comes&mdash;and we all look forward to that arriving. He was worried, having seen what happened in the 1980s and having seen its aftermath&mdash;and I am reading Mr Bosch's mind at the moment, which I am sure a lot of people tried to do in the 1980s&mdash;that, with all the new regulatory framework, with the Australian Securities Commission and all its resources, the secret to getting it right in Australia is ensuring that there is a responsibility felt throughout the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Bosch made the point that, for every corporate transgressor or high flier who appears in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> every day or on the front page of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> playing tennis, flying on jets or driving in Rolls Royces, many of whom were Western Australians, there are thousands and thousands of people in the professions&mdash;lawyers, accountants and auditors&mdash;who followed in their trail. He was appealing to the members of his audience to ensure that their house is in order and to ensure that they felt the sense of their role in rebuilding the corporate climate and the commercial climate in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, without their cooperation and without the belief in the ethics and the efficacy of all of the players in the corporate world, it does not matter how many millions of dollars we give to the Australian Securities Commission, it does not matter how hard nosed the head of the Australian Securities Commission is&mdash;be it a Henry Bosch, a Tony Hartnell or whoever replaces Tony Hartnell&mdash;we will not achieve the results that we all desire across both sides of this Parliament in rebuilding the integrity in Australia's commercial sector and security sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Bosch said something which did not refer to the point I am making, but I shall use some licence here. When talking about the next boom, or the next period of rapid corporate activity, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There would be a need for new knowledge, skills and greater flexibility but there would be temptations to cut corners and to compromise principles in the fight for survival.</PARA>
<PARA>The coalition sees that getting rid of the privilege&mdash;getting rid of the derivative use immunity, and the use immunity as contained in the use immunity provisions of this legislation&mdash;is compromising a very important principle for what I see as a relatively short term political objective. Therefore, the Opposition will be moving the amendments I have foreshadowed. In the event that those amendments are not supported&mdash;and I still hold out hope that Senator Spindler has been convinced by my wise words, but in the event that he does not and the Senate does not support those amendments&mdash;we will be opposing this at the second reading. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the Corporations Legislation (Evidence) Amendment Bill 1992. The purpose of this Bill is to remove certain immunities available to witnesses under section 68 of the Australian Securities Commission Act 1989 and section 597 of the Corporations Act 1989. Investigations under the Corporations Act are conducted before a court at the request of the ASC, and investigations under the ASC Act are conducted by the ASC itself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under common law it is a well established principle that the prosecution must prove guilt and that the accused cannot be forced to provide information which incriminates him or her. This immunity against self-incrimination is expressly excluded by the Corporations and the Australian Securities Commission legislation. There are a number of reasons for that. One of those reasons is that the immediate victim, the company, is a legal construct, and there often is no human victim with direct and immediate knowledge of the circumstances involved. As a result, the prosecution is compelled to rely on the perpetrator for evidence of the misdeed. A second reason is that very frequently the complexity of the documentary evidence means that it needs to be explained by the person who knows it or who, indeed, has generated it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The need for this legislation now before the Senate arises from the fact that both the ASC and the Director of Public Prosecutions&mdash;the agencies responsible respectively for investigating and prosecuting corporate fraud&mdash;have been experiencing serious problems in bringing effective prosecutions. Far from exhibiting blood lust, as my colleague Senator Campbell is trying to impute to me, I believe that respect for the law is based on the fact that people cannot flout it and get away with it. I rather fear that the position that Senator Campbell adopts might in some way be coloured by the fact that, as he says, some of the targets of that legislation are amongst his constituents.

I know that this debate is taking place in a relatively friendly atmosphere, but Senator Spindler has not only imputed but specifically implied that I have taken the position that I have on this Bill because a number of my constituents happen to be corporate high-fliers in Western Australia. That is a grave imputation. I think Senator Spindler should withdraw.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I assure Senator Campbell that what I said was not intended to be an imputation on his character in any way whatsoever. In fact, what I did was repeat some of his own words. I believe that Senator Campbell has no grounds for complaint.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I was saying, we cannot allow laws which are designed to protect investors&mdash;many of them people who have placed their life savings at risk&mdash;to be thrown to the wolves, as it were, without ensuring that we have legislation in place which can ensure that these people, as a deterrent, are brought to justice. Of course, the main concern that we have is to protect those people. We are looking not only at the past and the misdeeds perpetrated by our corporate cowboys in the roaring eighties in Australia, misdeeds which rival anything that happened elsewhere in the world, but also to the future to ensure that people can entrust their savings to financial institutions, to corporations, without being scared, every day and every night, that they will lose their life savings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is perhaps another very simple point that should be made in rebutting some of the things which Senator Campbell has said, and that is simply that justice must be done and must be seen to be done. Our society cannot function if we allow people to flout not only the laws of the country but also the rules of simple, ethical behaviour. Where people clearly demonstrate that they are not capable of following simple, ethical rules of behaviour, the law must step in. We must ensure that the law is enforced. Otherwise it becomes a joke.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The need for this legislation arises from the fact that both the ASC and the Director of Public Prosecutions&mdash;the agencies responsible for investigating and prosecuting corporate fraud&mdash;have been experiencing serious problems in their work. The immunities available to witnesses under section 68 of the ASC Act and section 597 of the Corporations Act have the combined effect of precluding the use of certain evidence against a person in criminal proceedings and proceedings for the imposition of a penalty. Such evidence includes a person's self-incriminatory oral statements, the signing of a record and the production of a book; for instance, a diary. This is described as use immunity. It also includes any information, document or other thing obtained as a result of such statements or actions. This is described as derivative use immunity. Section 68 of the ASC Act currently provides for use immunity and derivative use immunity with respect to oral statements, signing of records and the production of a book. Section 597 of the Corporations Act currently provides for use immunity with respect to oral statements and derivative use immunity with respect to oral statements, signing of records and the production of a book. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An example of derivative use immunity will occur where a person who has produced financial records of a company refuses to answer, under examination, questions as to whether he or she authorised journal entries in the financial records and whether he or she signed certain correspondence, and, indeed, any other matters arising out of that correspondence or those books. The immunity claimed in these circumstances is one for non-disclosure of evidence derived from records already properly admitted into evidence. Both the ASC and the DPP have made submissions before the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities, of which Senator Cooney, Senator Campbell and I are all members. They outlined the problems associated with derivative use immunity, as in the above example that I have cited. The ASC has submitted evidence that the immunity applying to the production of documents was, indeed, curtailing quite severely its investigatory powers and its ability to obtain evidence leading to successful prosecutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In November 1991, the Joint Committee released its report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Use Immunity Provisions of the Corporations Law and the Australian Securities Commission Law</EMPHASIS>. The report recommended that section 597 of the Corporations Act and section 68 of the ASC Act be amended to remove the derivative use immunity provisions and that section 68 of the ASC Act also be amended to remove the use immunity with regard to the fact that a person has produced a book, for instance, a diary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the Joint Committee recommended that the Corporations Act and the ASC Act be amended to ensure that neither the use immunity nor derivative use immunity be available to corporations and that the proposed amendments lapse after five years unless the Parliament confirms their application within that period. This Bill adopts the recommendations of the Joint Committee with the exception of the recommendation that there be a five-year sunset clause on the amendments. I will return to this point later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main ground of opposition to the recommendations of the Joint Committee is that the current legislation corresponds to the protection offered by the common law privilege against self-incrimination in Australia and that the privilege is a fundamental right which should not be withdrawn. This is the central argument in the dissenting report by Senator Barney Cooney and Mr Frank Ford, which is now supported by Senator Ian Campbell. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats are mindful of the strength of the arguments contained in the dissenting report and are extremely concerned that no inroads should be permitted on the rights of citizens before a court. However, in this case, it is wrong to say that the privilege against self-incrimination is being withdrawn. Use immunity remains in full force for oral statements and signing of records under the ASC Act and for oral statements under the Corporations Act. It will not be available in the case of information, including the contents of a book, derived from other evidence obtained legally under valid investigation processes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a substantial volume of evidence in this area which shows that investigators in the corporate law area find grave difficulties in situations such as where a person who has produced financial records of a company refuses to answer under examination questions as to whether he or she signed certain correspondence. The need to protect small investors and their savings conflicts with the present right of corporate officials to refuse such answers. As Senator Campbell quite rightly said, we need to strike a balance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One major difficulty is clearly that a person under investigation might deliberately introduce information on matters which may be relatively unrelated but for which he or she may want to claim immunity later on. I do not believe that we can countenance legislation which provides that loophole to people who have designs on flouting the law as it stands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On balance, the Australian Democrats believe that our corporate world does need cleaning up and that we must protect the rights and interests of people who entrust their savings to entrepreneurs and financial institutions. In doing so, we must be conscious of the antics of our corporate cowboys in the 1980s who have diverted millions of dollars of savings entrusted to their care and who have used every trick in the book, including the use of derivative use and use immunities, to keep their ill-gotten gains and to try to escape liability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments to be made by this Bill are as follows: to remove the derivative use immunity and use immunity in respect of the production of a book currently available to a person under section 68 of the ASC Act 1989; and to remove the derivative use immunity in respect of the making of all statements and the signing of records. As a result, the privilege against self-incrimination will only apply to the use immunity currently available in relation to oral statements and the signing of records. The privilege will be available only to natural persons since corporations are specifically excluded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the amendments seek to remove the derivative use immunity currently available to a person under section 597 of the Corporations Act 1989. As a result, the privilege against self-incrimination will apply only to the use immunity currently available in relation to oral statements. The privilege will be available only to natural persons. Once again, corporations are specifically excluded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said before, the Democrats are very mindful of the conflicting principles involved and will be moving an amendment to ensure that the operation of this legislation is reviewed within five years of its commencement. There is currently no provision in the legislation for a review to check whether these provisions will turn out to be an excessive infringement of the common law privilege against self-incrimination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Joint Committee proposed a five-year sunset clause which the Government rejected on practical grounds&mdash;namely, that serious problems could arise in the prosecution of matters which may have been under investigation for some time and which may still be in process when the five-year limit approaches. The Government gave an undertaking that the operation of the amendments is to be reviewed within five years. The Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) gave a personal commitment to hold an interim review after 12 months. However, I and the Democrats as a party believe that this is an extremely important matter. Clearly, it is being decided on a balance of conflicting principles. We believe that it is incumbent upon us to have a provision in the legislation to ensure that this review is carried out within the five-year period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously there is concern about a review of these amendments taking place. The proposal put forward by the Democrats would be an effective alternative in light of all the surrounding circumstances. The proposed amendment requires the Minister to cause a person who, in his opinion, is suitably qualified and appropriate to conduct a review into the operation of the amendments within a five-year period and to cause copies of the review to be laid before each House of the Parliament within 15 sitting days of receiving the review. Subject to this amendment, the Australian Democrats will be supporting this legislation for the reasons I have outlined. </PARA>

Indeed, if I took that position, I would have the support of such eminent judges as His Honour Mr Justice Ken Marks of the Supreme Court of Victoria. In a very learned article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Law Institute Journal</EMPHASIS> of April 1984, he said the following:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>that is, the common law&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what should have happened and what should be the practice, save that a suspect should be only subject to adverse inference from silence if he has been given a choice to answer questions in the presence of an independent observer. A suspect should be entitled to ensure that what he says is accurately recorded and to require an environment which maximises his ability to do himself justice by what he says.</PARA>
<PARA>The modern manifestation of what His Honour says there is the videoing of interviews with the police. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to be able to say that I have been convinced by His Honour Mr Justice Marks, but I have not been. Mr Justice Marks, learned as he is, is not right in what he has advocated there. I prefer the arguments of the then Director of Public Prosecutions of Victoria, Mr John Coldrey, who in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Anglo-American Law Review</EMPHASIS> of 1991 at page 51 wrote an article entitled, `The Right to Silence: Should it be Curtailed or Abolished?'. He clearly said that it should not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, I agree with the sentiments of Mr Justice Vincent of the Supreme Court of Victoria. Mr John Coldrey has now become Mr Justice Coldrey of the Supreme Court, having joined Mr Justice Vincent on that eminent bench. Mr Justice Vincent and Mr Justice Coldrey take the same approach. I confess that I find their approach compelling. In supporting this Bill as it becomes law, I have to go back to the fact that I am a member of a party which takes a particular approach on this and, having put my view in the proper forums in that party, I shall certainly support what it does. After all, that is how I came to be here. So that will be my approach on this occasion. I found the comments of Senator Campbell quite compelling. I also take into account what Senator Spindler has said. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As has been said by both speakers before me, the issue is one of balance. The matter is well put by Mr Justice Stephen and Mr Justice Aickin of the High Court in the case of Bunning v Cross. Their decision was handed down in Sydney on 14 June 1978 but, as Senator Campbell will be interested to know, the case was heard in Perth on 14 September 1977. They said this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the one hand there is the public need to bring to conviction those who commit criminal offences. On the other hand is the public interest in the protection of the individual from unlawful and unfair treatment. Convictions obtained by the aid of unlawful or unfair acts may be obtained at too high a price.</PARA>
<PARA>The fact that there is criminality in the corporate world is beside the point. There is criminality no matter where we look. Even in that state which should be the state of greatest bliss, matrimony&mdash;and in my case it is the state of greatest bliss&mdash;there is often some sort of dislocation between the partners. Domestic assaults take place and at times spill over into murder. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that there is criminality in marriage does not mean that we should take away the rights of everybody who commits such a crime. In fact, we do not. When a husband kills a wife or a wife kills a husband, or when they do damage to each other, those people have all the rights that the common law gives. They have the right not to incriminate themselves and the right of immunity against the use of whatever statements they make. As a consequence, they have the right of immunity against anything that is derived from the use of their statements. We tread on unhappy ground when we start curtailing those rights.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Each case has to be looked at on its merits. I think Senator Lewis will agree that some very eminent people agree that corporate law ought to be changed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The pursuit of truth is very important, just as the pursuit of justice is very important. As Mr Justice Stephen and Mr Justice Aickin of the High Court said in the passage I have quoted, justice is a matter of balance. I have a statement made in 1846 by Vice-Chancellor Sir J. L. Knight Bruce which puts it very well. This case did not involve crime but involved civil proceedings. One of the parties to the case wanted to gain some information. The Vice-Chancellor said that he would not allow it because there really had to be a balance. He made the following statement, which I think is a good one:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The discovery and vindication and establishment of truth are main purposes certainly of the existence of Courts of Justice; still, for the obtaining of these objects, which, however valuable and important, cannot be usefully pursued without moderation, cannot be either usefully or creditably pursued unfairly or gained by unfair means, not every channel is or ought to be open to them. The practical inefficacy of torture is not, I suppose, the most weighty objection to that mode of examination, nor probably would the purpose of the mere disclosure of truth have been otherwise than advanced by a refusal on the part of the Lord Chancellor in 1815 to act against the solicitor, who, in the case between Lord Cholmondeley and Lord Clinton, had acted or proposed to act in the manner which Lord Eldon thought it right to prohibit. Truth, like all other good things, may be loved unwisely&mdash;may be pursued too keenly&mdash;may cost too much. And surely the meanness and the mischief of prying into a man's confidential consultations with his legal adviser, the general evil of infusing reserve and dissimulation, uneasiness, and suspicion and fear, into those communications which must take place, and which, unless in a condition of perfect security, must take place uselessly or worse, are too great a price to pay for truth itself.</PARA>
<PARA>I point that out on the basis that simply to say that we want to curb crime, or simply to say that we want to curb truth, does not justify all and every means that might be available to obtain those two great qualities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am anxious to hear what Senator Lewis has to say about this, but before I sit down I will raise another matter which is incidental to the issue of corporate law. It is very important to ensure the integrity of the corporate sector and to look at the corporate sector closely in circumstances where the move is towards privatisation. The privatisation of industries and services is done through the corporate structure. Indeed, one of the things that worries me about the whole issue of privatisation is that it is to be effected through the corporate structure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A person who is on the board of a company owes an obligation&mdash;and properly so&mdash;to the shareholders of that company. That means that the duty is to the shareholders and to the good of the company, which may end up being entirely different from an obligation to act in the public interest.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we go down the path of privatisation, we have to look very carefully at the obligations of directors of companies&mdash;indeed, the people who run companies. As I say, their obligation does not lie with the general public, but with the shareholders. It is on that basis that companies go offshore or close down factories that do not seem to be viable or which, when closed down, add to the profit of a company. Those are the sorts of considerations directors take into account according to the Corporations Act. Indeed, if they do not take those proper proceedings, directors can be held civilly or even criminally liable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One area that has been overlooked in this privatisation debate is how privatisation can be done effectively through the corporate structure. Indeed, that is the only structure through which it can effectively be done. As debate goes on in this chamber, if we are to go down the path of privatisation, we really do have to look at the provisions in the corporations legislation to see whether directors can have a wider regard for the public. It is hard to see how they can, because it is really for the Government to decide what is for the public good and what is in the interests of the electors. Politicians&mdash;Ministers, senators and members of Parliament&mdash;are elected to do that and it seems a bit hard to impose those obligations on the corporate sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, to take up the point that Senator Spindler was making, it would be proper to ensure that there is integrity in the corporate world when so much more is placed into that area by way of providing services and products for the people of Australia. There is a great argument in favour of not going down the path of privatisation and corporatisation without real consideration of the whole issue.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Cooney does me an honour. I wish to speak to this matter because I am in a somewhat similar difficulty to that of Senator Cooney, in that he should be supporting our amendment and I should be opposing our amendment. However, the way the situation is, I might simply adopt Senator Cooney's remarks in relation to that matter, and no doubt he will stay with his Party and I will stay with my Party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Corporations Legislation (Evidence) Amendment Bill 1992 appears to arise out of a report of the Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities published in November last year entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Use Immunity Provisions in the Corporations Law and the Australian Securities Commission Law</EMPHASIS>. I say that it appears to arise out of that report because the Government was about to introduce this legislation in any event. The Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) had this legislation in mind and the report perhaps just brought it forward. He may have even delayed bringing the legislation forward because he knew that the report was imminent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support much of what Senator Cooney said. He summarised it very well in his summary at the end of his dissenting report, on page 35 of the Committee's report. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The law treats the right to silence, as a matter of high principle. The protection it provides against the power of the State should not be diminished in our view, except in accordance with a principle of comparable standing.</PARA>
<PARA>He then went on to say that in his view a principle of that quality has not been advanced in this instance. Although I agree with much of what Senator Cooney had to say, I certainly cannot agree with him dissenting from the views of my very good friend Mr Justice Marks, whom I used to brief in Warrnambool&mdash;unfortunately too many years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I get to the substance of the legislation, as Deputy Chairman of this Committee I would like to mention  the people who made submissions to the Committee and, in particular, those people who gave evidence before the Committee. Their names are listed on pages 37 and 38 of the report. I would like to thank those people, because their submissions were certainly worth while and their evidence was most interesting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first thing to note about this Bill is that it uses strange words, which even I have difficulty with. It talks about `use immunity' and `derivative use immunity'. That is jargon of the first order. It is all about the common law right to remain silent being overcome by legislation, and then, the immunity arising from that right having been overcome, a qualification in the legislation in some way or other was thought to, and perhaps did, protect witnesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's amendments will remove from the Act all reference to the production of a book. As a result, no privilege against self-incrimination shall apply to the production of a book by a witness. The amendments also exempt a body corporate from the effects of the section. In subsection 68(3) reference to the production of a book is removed. The derivative use immunity is removed&mdash;that is, immunity arising down the line. Reference to any information, document or other thing obtained as a direct or indirect consequence of the person making the statement or signing the record is deleted. Thus, the immunity under subsection 68(3) as amended applies only to the making of a statement or the signing of a record. The amendment being moved by the coalition would restore the original wording, leaving out only the reference to a book&mdash;that is, the full immunity and derivative immunity would apply to statements and the signing of the record. In subsection 597(12) the Government's amendments restrict immunity to the answers to questions. No derivative immunity is provided, and the Opposition's amendments would retain the existing wording of subsection 597(12). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill and this report raised a very fine line for the Committee and for this Parliament. That is made clear by the fact that we have people on both sides of the chamber dissenting from the report and people from both sides of the chamber supporting the report. In effect, at hearings conducted by the Australian Securities Commission the right to silence has been removed. The Australian Securities Commission was saying that the fact that the sections provided an indemnity to the persons against the use of the evidence gained indirectly from `leads' provided by the answers to questions or documents produced to the investigators, went so far that the Australian Securities Commission was hamstrung in its prosecutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All members of the Committee were very unhappy that no prosecution had been brought forward for the High Court to make a ruling on that matter. In effect, until such time as the High Court gets around to making a ruling on the matter, there is, was and continues to be some doubt as to what the effect of this immunity really is. The Securities Commission and the DPP both argued that should any prosecution of a person so compelled arise, the prosecutor must prove that the evidence being advanced was not gained directly or indirectly from the answers or documents obtained where the privilege against self-incrimination was claimed by the person being examined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was very strongly denied by a witness who impressed me enormously: Mr Ehrlich. I refer to paragraph 3.5.3. of the report, in which his argument is set out. He argues that the derivative evidence is only inadmissible if it was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . obtained as a direct or indirect consequence of the person [witness] making the statement. Thus, all the ASC would need to show, if objection were made . . . was that its normal procedure was to issue notices to produce books in respect of all relevant documentation and that the documentation would . . . have been obtained by the ASC even if it had not been referred to by the witness during examination.</PARA>
<PARA>On the other hand, Mr Santow, another witness who impressed me very much, argued that the whole of the corporation law was based on a fiction in that the law enabled a corporation to be established, and, having enabled such a body to be created, obviously by way of rules and regulations, the rules and regulations should not enable it have, in effect, the personal privilege which one grants to a human being. In  referring to the Guinness case in the United Kingdom, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . what it brought home to people&mdash;and it is affecting corporate behaviour&mdash;is that it is not just a matter of putting the money back; people actually went to gaol. People like you and me in blue suits and nice shirts went to gaol.</PARA>
<PARA>His view was that the penalties ought to apply to corporations because they are established under a fiction and that they should not be able to escape because of the right to silence which we have granted people for centuries under our system of law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, there is considerable doubt about all of this. I argued very strongly in the Committee along the same lines as Senator Cooney, but in the end I supported the Committee majority for a number of reasons. The first is that the Committee agreed to monitor the use by the ASC of its investigatory powers. I draw the Senate's attention to the powers of the parliamentary Committee under the Australian Securities Commission Act 1989 because this Committee has the power to inquire into and report on the activities of the Commission, or the panel, or matters connected with such activities to which, in the parliamentary Committee's opinion, the Parliament's attention should be directed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, the first and, I think, one of the most significant things that weighed heavily with me was that the Committee itself can inquire into anything connected with these matters. It is not dependent upon a resolution of either House&mdash;although that is required if either House resolves to conduct such an investigation. It is not dependent upon the recommendation of the Minister, the Executive Government, the Attorney-General or anyone else. If the Committee wants to inquire into a matter, it can do so. That means that, if a witness is unhappy about the treatment which he or she or his or her company has received at the hands of the ASC, that person can make a complaint to the Committee and the Committee could investigate it, if it wished, regardless of the attitude of the Executive Government and the ASC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, as set out in the report, the Committee has agreed to monitor these investigatory processes. I think there is much merit in the fact that the parliamentary Committee is, in effect, a minder of the minder&mdash;the minder of the ASC. It should be a fundamental activity of this Committee, with routine investigations being done regularly&mdash;something to which the Committee has, in effect, agreed&mdash;and if any member of the public wished to complain, the Committee could receive the complaint and, if it wished to, investigate the matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, I was heavily persuaded by the concern that this matter must be dealt with quickly. There is no appeal to the High Court in the pipeline and we really cannot wait for years and years. The problem is so acute that it must be dealt with straight away. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final paragraph&mdash;which, I think, was put in the Committee's report at my request&mdash;is of great importance. It recommends an inquiry into whether the activities of the ASC should be limited to the civil jurisdiction. I have little doubt that the solution to this problem lies in taking that course&mdash;that is, that the ASC should be able to act with all of these wide-ranging powers in the civil jurisdiction. It should be able to step in straight away, as soon as there is some fear that a company has acted improperly, appoint a receiver or whatever it has to do, seize the assets, and make sure that creditors and shareholders are protected against the criminal machinations of corporate officers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The present problem is that the ASC, because it has been continually concerned with the criminal prosecution of such people, is unable to act quickly in the civil jurisdiction. Parliament must look at this matter. The Executive Government and shadow Ministry ought to be looking at the possibility of providing the ASC with access to the civil jurisdiction and allowing the public prosecutor to pursue criminal matters through the normal Commonwealth and State police forces, or through whatever system is deemed appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I return to my earlier point that there is a very fine line. I found great difficulty at the time of preparing the report in deciding whether I should support the majority view or the dissenting report. Ultimately&mdash;and one of the things that weighed with me was that I was the Deputy Chairman of the Committee at the time of the report&mdash;I came down in favour of the majority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like Senator Cooney, I have put these arguments to my Party and my Party has decided to put forward the amendment that Senator Campbell will be moving in due course. All I can say is: who am I to judge whether I am right or my Party is right? I accept the judgment of my peers in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the debate today, and with all due respect to Senator Spindler, he put his case in support of this legislation as though the amendment that we are moving today would protect future investors. I have my doubts about that. How one protects future investors from crooks, I do not know. What one does is prosecute the crooks. As Mr Santow said in his evidence, if one or two of them can be sent to gaol, that may make the others sit up and take notice. However, the truth of the matter is that there will always be crooks trying to find some way around or through the law&mdash;committing offences that rob investors and their own shareholders; defrauding people. This legislation will not protect the victims. It may assist with the conviction of some people in the future but, unfortunately, the protection of investors is difficult to ensure. In the last 20 years decency seems to have fallen by the wayside. While there have always been crooks, in the last decade it seems as though the financial crooks of this country have become uncontrollable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Cooney made reference to the problems involved in corporatisation. While I heard his remarks and I accept and agree with much of what he was saying, I draw his attention to what his Government has done in relation to corporatisation. The Government has taken a large number of Government instrumentalities out of the control of the Parliament and given them a degree of independence. Yet who are the shareholders who might control those corporate bodies?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is one of my great concerns with our large public companies that the shareholders really should be represented by the directors. In many cases they are represented by the directors and many of those directors do a good job. But, from time to time, one wonders when companies make bad decisions. Let me give an example. Look at what the banks did during the 1980s. They were in such enormous competition with each other and they were so determined to ensure that the new banks which had come in from overseas would not get a foothold in Australia that they were frequently lending enormous sums of money to companies on the basis of some sort of an undertaking. They were not even examining the companies' full statements of assets, liabilities and other commitments. On the basis of some sort of undertaking by a director of a company, or a resolution of a company, a bank would lend it enormous sums of money. One is aware of a situation where an enormous sum of money was lent on a Sunday morning as a result of a telephone call. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Who was protecting the rights of the shareholders in those matters? Where were the other public companies, in particular the life assurance companies which have enormous investments in these public companies? What were they saying to the directors of those public companies? Very little, unfortunately, it appears. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a problem for public companies. I say to Senator Cooney that his Party has, in my view, set up a situation for which some poor Minister will end up carrying the can at some stage down the track. I do not know when it will be: five, 10, 15 years time. But in due course, somewhere down the track, unless my Party manages to totally privatise those corporations that the Government has established, one can bet there will be major problems because the only shareholder in a lot of those organisations is the Commonwealth of Australia, in effect, the Executive Government. So the directors of those corporations and the Minister will be able to do deals. There will be no responsibility to this Parliament. Senators will not hear about it until the whole thing explodes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, from time to time it may very well appear that the executive officers of that corporate body owned by the Commonwealth may get themselves into some sort of difficulty as a result of which they may not tell the Minister the full truth. They may report to the Minister in a very clever way whereby they will be able to say, `Oh, yes. We told you that, Minister. If you read on page 85, paragraph 7(vi), there is one sentence which in effect implies that we had borrowed more than we should have borrowed' or something along those lines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to the Labor Party&mdash;and I say to Senator Cooney in particular&mdash;that this Government has established this situation. It has even gone further; some of those bodies, such as the Commonwealth Bank, have a small public interest and an enormous Commonwealth interest. If ever there are possibilities of problems, that must surely be the prime example. I say to the Government that it went half way because of the difficulties of finding finance. But it has taken these bodies out of the control of the Parliament and, in effect, placed them in the hands of corporate officers whose responsibility will be to no more than one Minister. That Minister will have, in effect, a responsibility to the Cabinet, and the Cabinet, ultimately, to the Party. It is too remote in my view and fraught with difficulty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raise that with Senator Cooney only because he, in the course of his remarks in relation to this Bill, made reference to the corporation problems and the problems of directors. That, I say again, is another matter which the Senate ought to be considering; that is, directors have enormous responsibilities now. Some of them, as we are seeing for example with Compass Airlines, may be extraordinarily difficult. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> There is one group of people associated with companies which may not suffer those difficulties. I am referring to consultants. If it is possible for a person to become a consultant to a company, then it may very well be that that consultant can avoid the responsibilities and obligations that would come from being the directors of the company. For all we know, that person may in fact, as a consultant, be the one who is controlling what that company is doing. One can imagine a situation where, in effect, men of straw are appointed as the directors of the company and the real controller is appointed simply as a consultant to the company and he uses the men of straw to achieve a particular end. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The law on this matter is getting fatter and fatter yet there will always be opportunities for fraud and, unfortunately, there will always be people who will take advantage of those opportunities. </PARA>

The shadow Minister for corporate law reform and consumer affairs, Mr Peter Costello, and I have discussed this matter, my Party has debated it, and at the end of the day my Party has decided to take this action.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, I should like briefly to talk about what Senator Spindler said in relation to Senator Lewis's consideration of this matter. Senator Spindler would probably know better than I that Senator Lewis contributed to the debate at great length in the Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities, and moved that Committee from a position which was clearly supporting the Government towards more middle ground. </PARA>

<PARA>As foreshadowed in the second reading speech, the Australian Democrats are moving an amendment to ensure that a public review of this legislation is held within a five-year period. It will be useful to advert to the matters that we seek to have this review address. One of them is to assess how much and in what ways the amended provisions have helped in the enforcement of national scheme laws, and how much and in what ways the amended provisions have helped the ASC in making investigations and gathering information. The extent, if any, to which persons to whom the amended provisions have applied has been unjustifiably prejudiced because of the enactment of sections 4, 7 and 8 of this Act. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is one amendment relating to clause 43 which was put to the Committee, which was not accepted by the Committee and which the Democrats would like to put to this Committee of the Whole. Clause 43 deals with the rehabilitation of mine sites. It seeks to insert after section 124BB of the principal Act the following subsection:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1A) A reference in this section to the restoration of a site includes a reference to the partial restoration of the site (even if the taxpayer had no intention of completing the restoration).</PARA>
<PARA>The effect of this amendment is to allow tax deductibility for partial restoration of a mine site. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Oxford</EMPHASIS> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">English</EMPHASIS> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Dictionary</EMPHASIS> defines `restore' as `bring back or attempt to bring back to the original state'. The use of the term `restoration' in clause 43 is a misuse of the English language. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>The taxation process should be used as an instrument of social policy. That is a point we have made very often in the past. The Government has claimed on a number of occasions that it is committed to ecologically sustainable development. The taxation system is, as I have said on many occasions, a way in which the externalities in much of our economic process can be written into the costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many costs in the processes of using resources&mdash;costs in relation to environmental damage and the pollution which results both from the mining and from the use of those resources further down the track. Every single economist says that we need to internalise those externalities if, indeed, we are going to get to what the Opposition fondly calls a level playing field. Only in that way will we have costs properly represented in the economic system with people making judgments founded on the proper costs. This Government amendment to clause 31 seeks to allow 100 per cent tax deductibility for partial restoration, whatever that means. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mining is a major industry in Australia. That has long been the case and will continue to be the case into the foreseeable future. The Australian mining industry is a world leader in a number of areas and is very competitive internationally. Mining&mdash;and here I include quarrying&mdash;is a special industry. It involves a unique right. It involves the right to extract natural minerals from the earth, minerals which are owned in common by all citizens of Australia. The right to mine is the granting of an exclusive right to a particular person to the use for the time being of those resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats argue that the granting of these rights must be balanced by an obligation on the part of the extractor to rehabilitate the mine site. Given our historical constitutional arrangements, most onshore mining is conducted under the administration of State governments. Thus, it is those State governments which impose the conditions on the exploitation of our minerals and also prescribe the rehabilitation which must be undertaken in exchange for the right to undertake the mining operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As is usual under our archaic system, there are myriad differing rules and regulations which obtain in the various States. Some States require full rehabilitation as a matter of law. Some simply rely on ad hoc licence conditions. When I was in Western Australia recently looking at sandmining operations, I was rather shocked to find that the requirement under the State law there was merely the restoration of at least 10 per cent of the species and areas that have undergone sandmining. The area might look rehabilitated, but to any trained botanist it is grossly deficient in species that were there before. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats support the concept of compulsory mine site rehabilitation. This does not mean that there may not be some circumstances when it is appropriate to rehabilitate the site into a public recreation area, as has already occurred in some areas such as Penrith Lakes in Sydney, instead of back to its original state. To help to ensure that the mine site is fully rehabilitated, we must have a system of taxation incentives which maximise the benefits to those who maximise the rehabilitation. Clause 43 proposes that all rehabilitation expenditure be fully deductible, even where there is no intention to fully restore the mine site. This is a deliberate move by the Government to undermine&mdash;and no pun is intended here&mdash;sustainable development. As such, the Democrats oppose the clause. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Committee hearing last Friday, which Senator Kernot could not attend because of her duties on the Aboriginal Reconciliation Council, the Tax Office put the view that this amendment is not necessary; it changes nothing. If that is the case, why are we wasting taxpayers' money in bringing the amendment before the Parliament? Certainly the industry, at whose behest this amendment was drafted, was concerned enough to convince the Government to proceed with the amendment. The actual wording of the original provisions of section 124BA(1) of the Assessment Act states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A deduction is allowable in respect of rehabilitation-related activities as defined.</PARA>
<PARA>Section 124BB(1) states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A reference in this Division to a rehabilitation-related activity in relation to a taxpayer is a reference to the restoration of a site on which the taxpayer conducted extractive activities to, or to a reasonable approximation of, the pre-mining condition of the site.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is absolutely no doubt that the current law only applies to restoration; there is no specific reference to partial restoration. In addition, the reference to `a reasonable approximation of the pre-mining condition' is clearly an indication of the fact that a deduction is not allowed for a partial restoration as the law now stands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats acknowledge the comments of Senator Watson at page 46 of the transcript of the Committee hearing who said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Opposition will not be supporting that Democrat amendment because at all times the Opposition has pushed for the recognition of a partial restoration. We acknowledge that in the original amendments which provided for rehabilitation provisions, there was some doubt about the deductibility in circumstances of a partial restoration.</PARA>
<PARA>At least the Opposition is being honest in its position here. It is not acting like the Government and claiming that the amendment does not do anything. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under common usage, we do not restore&mdash;and I am coming back to the Oxford definition here&mdash;a piece of furniture if we partially fix it; it is only restored if it is completely restored. Similarly, if a mine has a 200-foot tailings dump, it is not restored if only half the tailings are removed. What we need is a system of taxation incentives which tend to maximise the amount of environmental restoration our industries undertake, and minimise the amount of environmental damage that they cause. That is a sine qua non of ecologically sustainable development. This proposal means that full deductibility is granted whether a superb rehabilitation is undertaken or whether an inadequate procedure is settled for. This Government amendment can do nothing other than deter full mine site rehabilitation and, therefore, the Democrats will insist on our amendment. </PARA>

We stand by our original position which is stated in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration of Friday, 1 May. I would like to point out to the honourable senator from the Democrats, Senator Coulter, that this amendment could result in situations which are quite unjust. It could work unfairly in respect of a partial restoration regime in situations where a company spent, say, $100,000 but, according to the Democrats' amendment, I understand could only be entitled to $50,000 where that partial restoration represented only 50 per cent of the potential 100 per cent restoration.</PARA></TALK.START>

I believe that the Australian Democrats' case could have been supported had they provided a comprehensive definition of what they refer to as `restoration'. Senator Coulter gave an example of where only 50 per cent of the tailings were removed. How would the Democrats cover a situation where 50 per cent of the tailings had been left and they were covered by special grasses, trees, et cetera? I feel that that would cause a whole host of subjective problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the Senate should be very careful about using the Income Tax Assessment Act as an instrument of social policy. As an instrument of social policy in terms of ensuring that people who have a higher income pay a higher rate of tax, yes, I think that is reasonable. Once we start going out into other areas of social justice, human resource management or environmental matters and using the Act to enforce them, the Act would become even more incomprehensible than it now is. I submit to the Senate that perhaps the practice of previous governments in trying to do too much with the Income Tax Assessment Act in this area has caused problems in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take this opportunity to congratulate the Australian mining industry on responding magnificently with respect to rehabilitation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to follow on from what I said during the second reading debate on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1991 and also to take up the remarks of Senator Coulter. Senator Coulter's main argument, if I understand it correctly, is not to allow depreciation for partial restoration. I do not think there are too many in this chamber who have practical mining experience, and I happen to have some of that experience. I know that it is the Australian Democrats' ongoing agenda to close all mining, but I will ignore that for now.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JI4">Senator PANIZZA</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Bell should know that rehabilitation starts even before mining does. I refer to gold mining, the area in which I have experience. There is a corporate tax on gold, so one has to allow for depreciation. If one expends so much on rehabilitation in one year, surely one should be able to claim 100 per cent. As I said, rehabilitation starts even before mining begins. If one is doing an open cut pit and wants to rehabilitate slime dumps or mullock dumps, one clears the site, removes the trees and puts them aside, and also one removes the topsoil and puts it aside.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Coulter argues that there should only be  100 per cent rehabilitation when the job has been done. In that case there cannot be ongoing rehabilitation, and it must be ongoing. When one starts building mullock dumps one has to start putting the topsoil on when the first bench is completed. It is no good doing six, seven or eight benches which reach 100 or 150 metres into the sky. How would one put topsoil on that? One starts when one finishes the first bench; one starts to pour it over the sides. When one does the next bench, one pours over some more, and so on. Because topsoil has been put on the mullock dumps, the last bench is virtually the finished job. How can Senator Coulter tell me that we cannot have ongoing depreciation for ongoing work? If that is the case, it is patently unfair with respect to the taxation regime and as a practical consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Coulter said that we should remove mullock dumps and also get the area back to the pre-mining condition. Senator Coulter was referring to sand mining, which might be different from gold mining. What would we do with the mullock dumps from gold mining? We can put the material back in the pit, but by the time that is done no open gold mine in Australia would be profitable. What is more, the mining laws in Western Australia say that we cannot refill pits or shafts. If we drop the lease, we have to give someone the chance to access the work that we have done. I am sure that those laws are still contained in the mining legislation of Western Australia. We have to leave access for someone else if we decide to give the lease away. If Senator Coulter meant that those dumps were to go back into the pit, his suggestion contravenes the mining laws of Western Australia. If he wants the mullock dumps to go back into the pit, it will put any gold mine, unless it is a fantastically rich one, out of the running altogether. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a matter of commonsense, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>if we want to ensure that rehabilitation is ongoing and that a company does not finish a mine off by leaving a big hole or a big dump and then walking away from it, there are provisions in the mining Act of Western Australia for a percentage of the amount represented by the gold we extract to be spent on rehabilitation. If that process is left right to the end, it cannot be done properly. If there is not 100 per cent tax deductibility, there is no encouragement to undertake that work. I would like Senator Coulter and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan) to take note of what I have said on this topic. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Usually, as we certainly find in South Australia, the law sets certain requirements in relation to restoration. Clearly, restoration in the terms of this clause would mean 100 per cent restoration with respect to those requirements; yet this Bill seeks to give tax deductibility when only partial restoration of the site has been carried out, even if the taxpayer has no intention of completing the restoration. It seems to the Australian Democrats that, on the one hand, that is encouraging people not to complete the task that they are or should be charged with and, on the other hand, providing them with encouragement to not proceed with the work to full restoration according to the requirement. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TF4">Senator COULTER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will elaborate. To use Senator Watson's example, if full restoration costs $100,000 and $100,000 is spent, $100,000 can be claimed as a tax deduction. On the other hand, if only $50,000 is spent and the site is half restored, again that full $50,000 can be claimed as a tax deduction. We are arguing that a much lesser incentive should be put in here for that expenditure as an encouragement to fully restore the site to back up the requirements which are often in place, and evidently are not in place in Tasmania, under State law.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government does not support this amendment. To some extent, the reasons were outlined in the Committee. I was not able to attend the Committee on this occasion. However, I thank Senator Button and the Committee for its deliberations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make three points. I do not want to take much of the Committee's time. The reason we have legislation committees is so these issues can be argued elsewhere. Firstly, we are dealing with not a mining Bill but a tax Bill. If people want to require compulsory rehabilitation, the place to do that is in the mining Acts in the various States, not in the tax Bill. In fact, the tax Bill cannot do it. Even if we wished to do it, the tax Bill cannot do it; it is not possible. That is the first point. Whichever version of the clause&mdash;that is, the existing clause or the amended clause&mdash;were to be the law of the land, neither would require compulsory 100 per cent rehabilitation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are talking here about the circumstances in which deductibility should be available for mine site rehabilitation. It has been said, and it remains the Government's view, that the existing clause allows claims on partial rehabilitation. But there was doubt and some uncertainty about that. It remains our view that that was the better interpretation of the Act as it stands, but to make it clear, we have proposed this amendment which, it is now agreed, does make that situation unequivocal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a public good that work should be expended to rehabilitate mine sites. We want companies to do that. To the extent that they spend money so rehabilitating, it should be tax deductible. It is very unusual for expenditure conducted in the normal course of running a business not to be deductible. It would be an extraordinary situation if, amongst all the expenditures that companies might have, we were to isolate partial rehabilitation as something which is not deductible. Companies can do all sorts of other things of which people may or may not approve, but those expenses are incurred in the normal course of running their businesses, so they are tax deductible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is proposed that one expenditure which is socially desirable, but perhaps not as socially desirable as some other expenditure&mdash;that is, 100 per cent rehabilitation&mdash;be plucked out of the normal course of business expenditure and made an exception. It is true that, in the distant past, rehabilitation was not deemed to be deductible for reasons about which we do not now need to worry. We are saying that this is expenditure which businesses are, and should be, now required to conduct and that therefore it should be deductible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second points relates a little to what Senator Panizza was saying. I thought there was a lot of validity in some of his points. I will express it differently, but it is consistent with the point he was making. It is quite likely that there will be circumstances at the end of a financial year when it is not possible objectively to establish whether the expenditure on rehabilitation is part of a 100 per cent rehabilitation because the process is only half finished. There has been expenditure in the financial year on mine site rehabilitation, but the process is unfinished. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is that total or partial rehabilitation? Does the claim have to be put off until the work is finished to prove retrospectively that the expenditure was justifiable? Can the expense be claimed this year on the basis of the assertion that it is a complying expenditure with the money then having to be paid back in subsequent years because it is not deemed to be a full restoration? It will not work. I have to say that at the moment the proposed clause is better this way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point I reiterate is that the amendment does not achieve its objective anyway because it is the prevailing view that, even if the existing clause were to remain, partial restoration would still be deductible. The essential point is that we do not want to have this as a proxy for the mining Act. I do not take quite as purist a view as Senator Watson, who says that we should not be using this for social policy purposes. I understand his argument; it is an orthodox argument of many people. People who are used to hearing me debate tax Bills will know that I do not take such a purist view. In some instances, I am prepared to support the use of not just the income tax laws but also the sales tax laws to achieve social and environmental objectives. So it is not that, as a matter of fundamental principle, that is a hurdle over which I am not prepared to jump sometimes. But it certainly is not and cannot be a proxy for proper State legislation with regard to mine site rehabilitation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to take any more of the Committee's time. The argument has been pretty well rehearsed. I note that it was essentially conducted in the Committee in preparatory mode. It has been done here again today. I do not have anything to add. We will not be supporting the amendment. </PARA>

So much of the sloppy work that comes through in terms of what appears to be administration of government policy has to be sheeted home to the Minister. It is the Minister who is paid to be responsible. It is up to him to ensure that things are done properly. I am afraid that the situation is getting worse. Ministers will have to be accountable for poor legislation. In this case we have both the senior Minister in this place, the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology, Senator Button, and the junior Minister, the Minister for Small Business, Construction and Customs, Mr Beddall, in the other place. All I can say is that if either of them can be proud of the way in which this legislation has been presented and dealt with, they are not up to being called Ministers of the Crown. </PARA>

There are still outstanding concerns with regard to precisely how people are to maintain the right to manual access to the COMPILE system, as distinct from the electronic system. I have had at least one case brought to my attention concerning the pernickety attitude of Customs with regard to forms that have to be used, which has meant that it is refusing to make refunds.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I intend to move that the Committee report progress. That might sound like a very peremptory move at this stage but, while we are dealing with the substance of this amendment at one level, we are also dealing with a situation in which, as I understand it, there is to be a court hearing on Thursday. While the court hearing does not go to the substance of whether 37 of the detainees who have been held in custody for some considerable time are or are not refugees, nonetheless, the people involved have a case before the courts which goes to the matter of whether they should be held in custody or released.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to the Australian Democrats that to proceed at this stage and to cut off that line of appeal, while that matter is before the courts, is far more peremptory than the action I am taking here in foreshadowing a motion that the Committee report progress. I believe that this matter should be held over and considered after the passage of a bit more time. There are many people out in the community who have not had an opportunity to look at this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While on balance I would come down in favour of the legislation, I concede that it is a very finely balanced judgment. To pass this legislation at this time, in the very hasty manner in which it has been brought forward, is, I think, unsatisfactory for those very many people in the community who are affected by it; more particularly, in relation to those 37 people, each of whom will have reasons&mdash;probably quite separate reasons&mdash;to have gone to court to seek their release from custody and their release into the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A characteristic of this Parliament should be not to seek to pass laws to cover up for mistakes which the Government has made. As for the actual hearings in relation to the status of these people, whether refugees or not, my understanding is that there was a flaw in the proceedings by which these people were being dealt with. That was corrected in the sense that the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) has instructed the appeals committee to go back and review the procedures and to consider the appeals in the correct manner. Perhaps that in itself has led to some delay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To attempt to correct that situation by passing hasty legislation through this Parliament, and to close off a legitimate source of appeal which exists within the law as it is, seems to us to be quite unconscionable. It is for those reasons that we very strongly suggest to the Committee that it should not proceed with this legislation tonight but should allow a great deal more time to pass&mdash;at least until the next sitting period&mdash;so that those both within the Parliament and outside have an opportunity to look at it. </PARA>

In this case we have 37 people who have an appeal before the court. The matter is to be heard on Thursday and to proceed at this time, to change the law at this time, when those people have already lodged their appeals is without conscience. I believe that, for that reason, we should not proceed at this time. We should hold this matter over and consider it later in the next sitting period to allow a reasonable period of time for those both within and outside the Parliament to have a look to see just exactly what this legislation does and, in the meantime, not cut off that legitimate court action by those 37 people. It is for that reason I urge most strongly that the Senate not proceed at this time. Accordingly, I have foreshadowed a motion to report progress.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Temporary Chairman. I think that is an eminently desirable procedure and I thank you for putting the Committee right. I would support the foreshadowed motion; that is, that we report progress. I am not debating that necessarily at the moment. What I wish to say to the Committee is, I believe, extremely important. It is this: when the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs gave a briefing to my office about these amendments, it did not mention in any shape or form the fact that there was a case pending before Mr Justice O'Loughlin of the Federal Court in Melbourne at 9.15 a.m. this coming Thursday&mdash;that is, the day after tomorrow. The Department did not indicate to me or to my staff that this was a major reason for these amendments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Department and the Minister are going to be up-front on these particular matters, they should have told me; they should have told my staff. This particular aspect of this measure is very disconcerting indeed. There is a case pending before Mr Justice O'Loughlin of the Federal Court in Melbourne at 9.15 a.m. this Thursday. This measure says something to Mr Justice O'Loughlin in terms the likes of which I have not seen in any other measure that has come before us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 54N(2) on page 3 of the Bill states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that subsection even applies to a designated person who was held in a place described in paragraph 11(a). . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is an extraordinary inclusion of the word `even'. It is telling the judge, `Let us make it perfectly clear to you that you cannot hear this case further'. That is extraordinary, because this is a question of the right of a person or a group of persons to liberty under the rule of law. Litigation is pending, and the Minister is a party to that case. Parliament is being used in this circumstance to bolster the Minister's case. I do not think that is fair or reasonable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cases that I referred to are in the names of refugees. The cases are the Lyieng and Others case, the Chueng Lim case and the 22 Cambodians. Some of these people have been in isolated detention since November 1989. The action is being taken to seek to have the applicants cared for or looked after by certain groups, including the Catholic church, the Anglican church, the Uniting church and the St Vincent de Paul Society, on whose recognisance these persons would be released. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not a question of whether they are refugees;  their status will be determined in another way. These people have been in isolation and have an application before the Federal Court. They deserve to have their application considered. It will not cost the Government. In fact, it will save the Government. It costs over $200 a day for each of these persons to be kept in detention. As I understand it, these charity groups would be picking up a substantial part of that tab. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The implications of these amendments are quite startling. There is a denial of due process and the rule of law. The question has been raised of the arbitrary nature of the proposed further detentions. There is a question as to whether it is contrary to the Constitution, and indeed there is a real question as to whether this measure is being undertaken in unconscionable haste. In addition, there is the one I mentioned before, the suppression of the real intent, which is to interfere in the case which is pending before the Federal Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us remember the Torres Strait Islander case in 1982 which dealt with property rights. That case involved Torres Strait Islanders, and a Minister of the Queensland Government was also a party to that case. In 1985 the Minister put through the Queensland Cabinet a proposal to introduce a Bill into the Queensland Parliament called the Queensland Coastal Islands Declaratory Act. The purpose of that Act was the same as is intended by Mr Hand under this legislation. It was to  defeat the litigation that was pending in the High Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of the judges described that measure, which is identical to this measure, as draconian. We are talking about draconian measures here. We are talking about measures that are a denial of due process and the rule of law. We are also talking about measures which, I believe, would not be countenanced by the international legal community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a report in my hand which was prepared by the Acting Secretary of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission as a result of the Acting Secretary's visit to the refugee camps at Darwin and Port Hedland. If the Minister has not as yet tabled that report, I am prepared to table it in the Parliament tonight because I think it is relevant to this matter. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission raises several issues in its report. I will deal with just a couple of them. Paragraph 5 of the report talks about broader issues arising from conditions observed at Port Hedland. Bear in mind that 23 of the applicants, I think, have been held for some considerable time. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Remoteness, isolation and long term detention. As has been noted, many aspects of the conditions and facilities at Port Hedland were particularly good. The detainees generally spoke favourably of the staff. The basic standard of accommodation is good and there are encouraging plans providing more vocational classes and cultural activities.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most of the problems that have been identified have their basis in the very fact of detention&mdash;its long term nature and the lack of provisions for any alternative. This exacerbates the problems that have given rise to human rights concerns throughout this report and leads me to question the need for extended detention in any such centre, in particular, in an isolated location. Moreover, such detention itself raises human rights issues directly.</PARA>
<PARA>The report talks about the Convention on the Status of Refugees. It also talks about the question of religion. It raises the issue of whether the activities that are being oversighted by the Department are in accord with article 9 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and article 31 (1) of the Convention on the Status of Refugees and, so far as religion is concerned, article 18 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the Committee is faced with a most onerous task tonight. The only other comparable situation for the Government's current action relating to detainees is that which was taken during World War II. That was under emergency and wartime powers when the foreign nationals were thought to threaten the security of the nation. Nobody would suggest that the security of the nation is threatened, least of all until Thursday morning when the matter comes before the courts. I would have thought that it is reasonable for the Committee to consider that question and to support the proposal that the Committee report progress. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government strenuously opposes the manoeuvre that the Australian Democrats are attempting this evening with the assistance of Senator Harradine. I do not know what has driven this. I must admit that when I was listening to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">PM</EMPHASIS> tonight, I thought to myself that a proposal which was destined for plain sailing through the Senate tonight probably would be more anxiously debated than we had anticipated. I felt that Senator Coulter, driven by concern about his Party's performance in the polls, might want to create a new persona, a new image, for himself&mdash;and what better issue, especially when the ABC and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">PM</EMPHASIS> have had something to say about it?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have before us tonight is not a new issue. At any time over the last two years anyone could have argued what Senator Coulter, Senator Spindler and Senator Harradine have argued tonight. At any time into the future, anyone could argue the same point. At any time during those last two years, one could have found a person claiming refugee status in custody in Australia. Senator Coulter could come in here and argue that that person's rights would be affected by any attempt by government to legislate to cover this area. So I do not accept that it is a new issue, and I do not accept that the timing is inappropriate. As I say, no time is a good time. No time for the last two years has been a good time. No time into the foreseeable future will be a good time in terms of the criteria set by Senator Coulter and Senator Spindler. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are talking about and trying to embody in legislation here is the old, long held principle&mdash;one that governments of both persuasions have pursued and one that governments of both persuasions have held as a pivotal part of immigration policy&mdash;that anyone who enters Australia in an unauthorised way is held in custody until their case is determined. It is not a new principle; it is an old one. We are attempting here tonight to have Parliament assert that principle in legislation. That is what we are on about. That was made very clear by the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) today in the House of Representatives. </PARA>

If we had moved this two years and one day ago, he could have come in and said, `No, it's the wrong time; a person's rights are being affected'. The way the system is going at the moment, Senator Coulter could come into the chamber in five years time and make the same assertion. The Government is determined, as has been spelt out very clearly by the Minister, to ensure that there is an orderly assessment of claims, an orderly process, which does not prejudice or gazump those with legitimate claims.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does this legislation affect? It needs to be made clear that the legislation and the points that honourable senators have raised do not affect the definition of one's status&mdash;whether one is a refugee or not. That is the most basic question when one is trying to determine whether a person can or cannot stay in Australia. It is the definition of `refugee' and the processing of claims for refugee status which are vitally important. This legislation affects whether those persons who are making those claims stay in custody or are allowed to roam free through the Australian community. It has been a long-held principle that they stay in custody. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation also does not affect the application of the international covenant as it may be interpreted by Australian courts. The international covenant defines `refugee' and `refugee status' and the legislation does not affect the application of the international covenant in Australian law. It would be interpreted in the way that it would otherwise be interpreted by the Australian court process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are trying to put the issue of whether a person does or does not stay in custody beyond doubt. This has been a problem and it has been acknowledged broadly in the community as being a problem. I feel sorry for anyone in the position of having to make decisions here. On the one hand, we get the sorts of interventions that we have had tonight and, on the other hand, we get claims that the Government is being too soft. The Government needs to put in place a process which is fair, which recognises legitimate refugee status and which recognises legitimate processes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to put in place a process which has claims considered expeditiously. We need to put into that process some incentive for those claims to be raised, to be progressed, to be heard and to be determined. That is why the Government will not support this deferral motion tonight. The reasons for this deferral motion, had they been raised at any time in recent years and were they to be raised in the future, would be as relevant as they are tonight. No time is a good time to raise this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In closing, I refer to the draft report of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission. That draft report is one to which the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs has responded. There are some major disagreements in terms of the underlying principles which have driven the Human Rights Commissioner. I am informed that there are some major disagreements in terms of facts that the Commission asserts and the Department disputes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be premature to make that report public when there are such matters in dispute. Not only would it be premature, but it would also pre-empt the process totally. It would put the Human Rights Commission in an extremely difficult position because it would be politicised. A draft report is not a final report; there is a process that has to be gone through. That process is there to ensure that any mistakes in facts&mdash;any problems that can be ironed out&mdash;are ironed out and that, at the end of the day, a sustainable report comes out of the process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If that draft report is tabled tonight, it will be very difficult for the Human Rights Commission to come down later in the process with a re-assessed report, given the degree of public debate and the degree of dissension which would immediately and directly emanate from a premature releasing of a draft report. I would not be keen to see that report tabled tonight. However, I am keen to ensure that that process, as has been provided by law, continues down the course that this Parliament has determined and that, at the end of the day, we can get a final report that is sustainable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think I need to speak much longer. We need to get through this legislation as expeditiously as possible. I reiterate that there is no good reason for deferring the legislation tonight. In fact, there are many good reasons why we should embody in legislation what governments in this country have believed for a long time and what is imperative in order to have a process which can work, and that is the principle that if persons enter Australia in an unauthorised way, then they stay in custody until their status is determined. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to ask ourselves to what extent delaying the debate will alter the merits of the legislation. On the admission of Senator Harradine, delaying the debate will not alter the merits of the discussion whatsoever. Senator Harradine is now very well informed. There is no doubt that initially he was not. It is a matter of some concern that, as it appears on the face of it, there was clearly an attempt to divert him from some matters of fact which happen to be very germane to the issue. </PARA>

We have to look here at a concept that does not come up enough in our discussions about immigration: what is in Australia's best interests? We have here a clash of some very deeply held principles.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have heard that the legislation conflicts with some particular principles. When there is a clash of principles, one has to establish how that conflict will be resolved. We have a basic right to our own integrity as a nation. We have a right to our, if you like, self-determination. Let us recognise that one of the problems in this matter arises out of a very simple issue&mdash;that is, the totally spurious distinction between persons who are arrested before disembarking from a boat and persons who arrive by boat, enter undetected and are then arrested. That really goes to the heart of the sorts of problems we face. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It appears to me that the Government is totally right in adopting the sort of procedure it adopts in tax cases. If it sees a similar situation, it says, `Righto, we will chop that off as of now'. In many instances, it takes far too long to get the legislation right. This legislation certainly was not right originally. I can see no problems, neither in principle nor in terms of Australia's best interests, with proceeding to resolve this matter with the sort of informed debate that clearly can take place now. As I understand it, no-one is suggesting that a debate dealing with the merits of the legislation now would not be informed or effective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The complaint is that the result of having a debate now would impinge on the human rights of a particular group of people who somehow are more significant than other groups of people who, no matter what time it was done, would have their rights `impinged on'.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister representing the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus) really proved our case because he said that the Government could have acted at any time in the past. If it was so important to ensure that people who have entered Australia without a visa or without any entry permit and who are not Australian citizens should be kept in custody, then why did the Government not act weeks ago, months ago, years ago? The point at issue in this debate is that this legislation is being rushed through tonight and gazetted tomorrow, when there is a court case in progress in which judgment is likely to be given on Thursday. That is the whole point. All the other points are really irrelevant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The AAP report tonight states that Minister Hand told the House of Representatives that it is crucial that people who come to Australia without prior approval not be released into the community. He said:</PARA>

We have not made much progress yet. I am trying to get a bit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I understood the gravamen of Senator Baume's remarks&mdash;he can correct me if I am wrong&mdash;it was that debating or not debating this matter now would not alter the merit of the legislation but would alter the impact. I happen to agree with that comment to the extent that it would alter the impact. I believe also it could alter people's perception of the merit of the legislation. How long has the Committee had this matter in its hands? It has had this in its hands for 50 minutes. I will guarantee that three-quarters&mdash;if not, say, 90 per cent&mdash;of honourable senators have not even seen this document that we are talking about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This goes to the point made by Senator Baume that whether we debate the matter now or later, it will alter people's perception of its merit. It will not alter the merit of the legislation, but it will certainly alter people's perception of the merit of the legislation. Ninety per cent of honourable senators do not even know what we are now debating. We are debating matters of enormous significance to the fundamental human rights of individuals. We are about to set precedents which are most disconcerting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That brings me to the matter of the impact of the proposed legislation. Senator Baume asked whether these people who have applications before the Federal Court are in some way more significant than others? My response to that is, `Yes, they are, by virtue of the fact that they have applications before the Federal Court'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, Mr Hand, is opposing the applications. I ask Senator Bolkus, as the Minister representing Minister Hand in this chamber, whether the Government feels that the applications made by these people will be successful? It must feel that that will be the case or it would not be bringing in this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, even one of them. Senator Baume referred to tax cases. The Parliament can make alterations to the tax laws, but if a tax case is on foot before the court, what happens then? Is it suggested that the new legislation would have some retrospective effect on the rights of a particular person? This is a similar situation in that a case is before the court. Applications have been made for release from detention. Presumably, it is argued that they are in detention illegally. It might be said by the Government that this legislation will not have an entirely retrospective effect; that once the Governor-General signs the Bill, it will have the prospective effect of retaining those persons in custody from that date. The fact remains that those people have not had their day in court and are entitled to it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now ask the Minister representing Minister Hand&mdash;I ask him this because he is a lawyer&mdash;whether he knows about the Torres Strait Islander case?  Does he know the difference between that case and the measures taken by the Queensland Government on that occasion to defeat litigation over property rights&mdash;which measures, by the way, were described as draconian by a number of High Court Judges&mdash;and this current legislation, which is trying to do exactly the same thing?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of this legislation, as has now been admitted by the Government, is to defeat the litigation that is pending in the Federal Court. That litigation, I remind the Committee, is not about property rights; it is about the rights to liberty under the rule of law. I ask the Minister to show me how the two actions&mdash;that is, the action of the Queensland Government in 1985 and the action of this Federal Government in 1992&mdash;are in any way different. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN (Senator Crowley)</EMPHASIS>&mdash;As we are in the committee stage addressing an amendment brought back from the House of Representatives, confining your remarks to that would be in order. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SN5">Senator CHAMARETTE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am quite happy to do that. I just sought your clarification, Madam Temporary Chairman. I want to thank you for allowing me to speak to this. I particularly want to support Senator Harradine in his remarks regarding the amendment. I believe that this Migration Amendment Bill has been put together in extreme haste. It is hard to escape the notion that it is deliberately aimed at heading off the Federal Court hearing due on Thursday, 7 May at which application will be made for the people who are presently in detention in Port Hedland to be released from custody. The Bill seems to be aimed specifically at these Cambodian people who are currently seeking to have the Federal Court hear their case for release. The date of catchment for the Bill of 20 November 1989 was presumably the best guess that the Government made as to when these people arrived in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Harradine said this Bill may well have merit. I have already said that I was concerned about it and prepared to speak against it in any case. However, I strongly support the idea that if the Bill is rushed through at the committee stage&mdash;is rushed instead of being delayed and given due consideration at greater length and at another time&mdash;the perception of the merit of the Bill will be severely damaged in the eyes of the general public. I quote from a letter that I received today which illustrates just that point. It is addressed from the Moderator of the Synod of the Western Australian Uniting Church. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On behalf of the Uniting Church in the West Australian Synod, I would like to convey to you our deep concern and opposition to the proposed legislation to be introduced into Parliament tonight. We believe that closing the legal avenue under which the court could release the boat people while their refugee applications are being processed, is a backward step. Our position, along with other member churches of the Australian Council of Churches is to deplore the continued detention of individuals for two years or more.</PARA>
<PARA>Here I would like to intrude that the Anglican archbishop of Perth, in his Easter Sunday sermon, specifically spoke as to the plight of these people in the north of Western Australia. The plea in the letter goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clearly there needs to be an urgent re-evaluation of the current policy and legislation concerning detention. We believe that the prohibited non-entrant category of asylum seeker should be abolished, and so remove the statutory fiction which deems these persons not to have entered Australia. Why should the Indo-Chinese asylum seekers experience a harsher regime of treatment than other asylum seekers?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This illustrates the deep concern in the community regarding the way this Bill is being propelled through both the House of Representatives and this chamber at such a rate that it really casts the due consideration of the Senate in a bad light.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been listening quite intently to the speakers in tonight's debate. I listened to Senator Harradine, as I generally do. I listened to Senator Coulter, to whom I generally do not listen. I listened to Senator Chamarette, and I read that same letter in my office only 10 minutes ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us get around to what Senator Coulter had to say in the first place. He said we should wait seven days because we have 22 people in custody in Port Hedland waiting for their case to come before the court. I would go along with that approach; it is a reasonable approach to take. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I unreservedly supported Senator Harradine on the 0055 matter because one has to draw the line somewhere. I am not a prude or anything like that, but one has to draw the line somewhere. The approach of Senator Coulter is to wait seven days. We can wait seven days, but what happens if another boat turns up in another seven days?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been something in the news lately that there is another boat on the way down from Indonesia. Maybe we will have a repeat&mdash;hopefully we will not&mdash;of the search that went on in the north west of WA last Christmas when 45, 46 or 56 people&mdash;whatever the figure was&mdash;walked across all that harsh country and, through good fortune, were all saved. Maybe something like that will happen on our doorstep again. If we give in and allow another seven days, there could be a boat in contact with Australia anyhow, because I believe someone is making some money out of dropping off these refugees. In another seven days we could be landed with another 22 refugees, and so it goes on. Just as I supported Senator Harradine on the 0055 matter because we had to set standards somewhere, I am afraid a standard has to be set now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia, and Australia alone, controls its shorelines and who comes in&mdash;and who goes out in certain cases, too. What is more, we should make no apology to anyone in the rest of the world for controlling our own shorelines. Time and time again we have debated and questioned Ministers on the other side in Question Time about apologising to Asia or apologising to anyone. If we delay or change the legislation again because we are worried about what other countries might think of us, we are doing exactly the same thing&mdash;apologising to other countries for setting our own laws. That is something I will certainly not be part of. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation should be passed immediately because far too many people have become involved in this debate on the refugees, whether they be in Port Hedland or Darwin, without knowing the full facts. There are a lot of do-gooders amongst them. I am not decrying the letter that Senator Chamarette read out. I suppose it is the job of those people to work on behalf of those refugees. But they are not the only ones; there have been others around Australia, from as far from Port Hedland as Sydney, who have had a lot to say on this matter. I wish that lot would have a lot more to say on fixing the legislation properly so we can control our shorelines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I feel sympathy for any refugee, especially from Cambodia. But I believe that refugee status should be asked for in the first country one lands in. The 22 refugees at Port Hedland and those 57 or so who ended up in the Kimberleys last Christmas came via Indonesia. That is my bet anyhow. I think they should have asked for asylum in Indonesia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is a far better place in which to seek asylum with its open shores and good conditions. If these people are genuine refugees, I will be the first to welcome them. However, I believe that the courts should process it in an orderly fashion. If they are refugees, then Australia will take them, but if they are not they should be put on the next plane back. It is time we got on to this immediately. </PARA>

Honourable senators may remember that in this chamber some two years ago I put through a motion of reconciliation for those who were locked up during the time that Italy was part of the war.

Why is the Government using such a heavy approach to this group?  After all, it made special provision for a great number of Chinese students after the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989 and has special entry provision for people from Sri Lanka. Why is the Government seeking to make conditions more punitive and more distressing for people who have left their home country with nothing or next to nothing, often in fear of their lives, than it does for people who come on a visitor's visa and choose to overstay and then apply for residency?

<PARA>I would like to ask the Minister about this clause. It is somewhat strange to have a descriptive reason given in a piece of legislation like this, but, leaving that aside, the definition of `designated person' further down under clause 54K is given as:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like the Minister to explain in some detail why he thinks it is necessary that these designated persons, as so narrowly defined, should be kept in custody. There would be a lot of other people who would come into Australia in various ways who have not presented a visa and have not been granted an entry permit because they would not have a designation. I am a little puzzled; if there is a need for these people to be kept separate, why is the definition of them so narrow? Surely all those people who come broadly within the category of (b) and (c) in clause 54K should be kept separate. Is this simply another flaw in this very hastily drawn up set of amendments?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When people are struggling for something to say in a debate they always come up with a line that something is hasty and flawed. We have heard it so often that it does not really make sense. I am sure that Senator Coulter really understands; I am sure he is having a lend of us. By the smile on his face, I can see that he is.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unauthorised entrants into Australia are kept in custody from when they are apprehended until their claims are processed. The Government has made it very clear, as has the Minister in particular, that this legislation deals with one category of unauthorised entrants. They are those people who have arrived in Australia, as one can see in the definition of `designated person', on a boat after 19 November 1989. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of those unauthorised entrants, as is the principle of the amendments to the legislation&mdash;I am sure Senator Coulter knows about it because we have spent the last hour and a half debating that particular point&mdash;the legislation provides for custody until their cases are determined in accordance with the law, which reflects international definitions of `refugee'. Like every other unauthorised entrant into this country, these people will be treated in a way that the law so provides and that is, until their cases are determined, they will be kept in custody. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was smiling, but I was smiling at the inability of the Minister to grasp the logic of what I was saying. The subclauses in clause 54K are separated by the conjunction `and'. Every condition in subclauses (a), (b), (c) and so on has to be satisfied to fit the definition of a designated person. It is only those designated persons who, according to clause 54J, shall be kept in custody. In other words, it is restricted to those people who have arrived by boat between those particular dates who fulfil the requirement for clause 54J.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask again: why is this so narrowly drawn? If those people, who in every other respect are in Australia without a visa or an entry permit, should be kept separate&mdash;and I presume that they should be if clause 54J means anything at all&mdash;why is it so narrowly drawn? It is just a simple point of logic. That is why I was smiling. </PARA>

The Minister does not want me to table what the Human Rights Commission says about it. I will accede to his request, but I know and he knows that considerable stress and distress have been caused as a result of the long detention of some of these people. I am asking whether that definition of `custody' could include the Minister approving the offer made by those charitable organisations and religious bodies to house and be responsible for the persons until their refugee status has been determined. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be making only a small contribution to tonight's debate on the amendment that has come from the other place. It was my intention to make a more substantial submission in support of the action by the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) in bringing this legislation before the House. This is crucial legislation. It does not only impact on 27 people; it has an impact on the whole of Australia's refugee program. In the past couple of years that refugee program has been abused and brought into disrepute by the actions of a number of individuals&mdash;not only those detained in custody. A number of people&mdash;some with goodwill and others, I would suggest, with different motives&mdash;have sought to abuse the privilege of refugee status that Australia, as a nation state, can give to people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As has been mentioned on a number of occasions, some people have been interned in holding camps in Australia for a considerable length of time. It is not the fault of the Government, the Minister or the Department that those people have been confined for so long. Indeed, in some cases, it is the fault of the individual; in some cases it is the fault of the legal advisers that those people have engaged. They were not properly advised and sought to abuse the circumstances in which they found themselves by remaining in Australia&mdash;albeit in some form of custody&mdash;in the hope that at some later time they could mount the argument that, because they had been in Australia so long, they should be granted refugee status or some other form of permanent residency and so be allowed to stay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every time a concession is made on a matter of immigration policy&mdash;and this happens in other areas of government administration&mdash;abuses occur. In this particular area we have seen a number of abuses. There are not only 27 people in custody at the present time; there are over 450 people&mdash;illegal entrants to this country&mdash;in custody. I believe that if they are given refugee status by whatever means&mdash;be it through the courts or by some other means&mdash;the floodgates will open and many more boats will appear on the northern and western shores of this country carrying people who believe they have a claim for refugee status. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a very serious problem that must be addressed now. If it is not addressed now, it will be much more difficult to address when there are 4,500 people in detention, or when there are 45,000, because it is not unreasonable to suspect that the number might grow tenfold. It is an almighty dilemma that the Government is facing, and I believe that the Minister is acting quite properly in this matter. He is also acting under a fair degree of pressure. Earlier this year he admitted publicly in a very candid statement that he had been taken for a dill by some people. It is not too often that a Minister of the Crown is quite as frank and honest as that. He certainly was frank with the Australian community and I believe that the Australian community appreciated that frankness because it too is concerned about any potential problem that might be down the line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been suggested in some of the submissions made here tonight that this amendment is interfering with these people's rights to make an appeal following an application for refugee status. It does not interfere at all with any of their legal rights. Their applications through the Federal Court can proceed this Thursday, next Thursday or whenever the Court so determines. That application for appeal against an administrative decision of the Department can and, indeed, will proceed at the will of the Court. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government, indeed the Department, has done all in its power since the first boat arrived some nearly three years ago now to ensure that those people are given the benefit of both natural justice and the various international conventions to which we are signatories.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Steps have been taken to cover those people who have remained in the country and not lodged applications. I believe that if the Government had not taken the action which the Parliament has been asked to take much harsher measures would have been pressed upon the Government later this year when the review conditions applying to illegal and unauthorised entrants into this country will be again looked at. Indeed, we could end up with much harsher measures than perhaps those which are in the minds of the people who are giving consideration to that at the moment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In response to Senator Chamarette, I answered her question just before she asked it. In response to Senator Spindler, I refer him to provisions in the amendments before the committee that ensure the continuation of provisions of the Australian Constitution, for instance, as it would be interpreted. To that extent there are matters before the High Court at the moment, which Senator Spindler would know about, that go to the question of whether international covenants are written into the Constitution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, Senator Spindler read out one part of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. I am sure that if the total covenant were before the Committee we would see that there are qualifications to it as there are in all of these covenants. Those qualifications ensure that countries do have the capacity to make laws for the protection of their national interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator McKiernan said a few minutes ago, here we are concerned about the protection not only of Australia's national interest but also of our immigration program. For instance, when making this interpretation one has to take account of the fact that developed countries have seen a 700 per cent increase in asylum claims over the last decade; that Australia, because of its geographical and regional environment, is particularly vulnerable to boat arrivals; and that, while our obligations to refugees are very clear, the asylum route is being increasingly abused. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That, of course, is not to say that there are no legitimate refugees; we accept that there are.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition has not dealt in substance with this Bill yet. I should like to place on record our position on this amendment to Migration Amendment Bill (No. 4) of 1991. We believe that this amendment is a necessary amendment to that Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Senate is aware, presently there are some 389 boat people in detention around Australia under the current provisions of the Migration Act and another vessel carrying 10 people is expected to arrive in Australia soon. Under the current provisions of the Migration Act, it is possible that the courts can release these people into the community. It is our very strong view that this should not be possible. Thirty-seven detainees are in the process of challenging the rejection of their claims and will be in court from 7 May to argue for their release from custody. This legislation provides&mdash;as an interim measure only&mdash;new custody arrangements which will deny courts the power to release boat people into the community. This legislation would have to be passed through the Senate today to enable it to receive the Governor-General's assent before the court case to release the 37 detainees begins. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People who arrive in Australia illegally are held in custody pending the determination of any claims they may make for refugee status. Current detainees are in section 88 custody which pertains to those who have been arrested at sea in territorial waters and brought ashore by Australian authorities as prohibited immigrants, or in section 92 custody which pertains to those who landed as illegal entrants. This distinction between persons who are arrested before disembarking from a boat and persons who arrive by boat and enter undetected is a major weakness of the Act and is the subject of challenge by a further three detainees who arrived on the last boat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, the simple distinction is whether or not they are prohibited entrants or illegal entrants. These are the people we are discussing. Are they prohibited or illegal? Neither category of entrant has proper title to the term `Australian resident'. This matter should be looked at in terms of equity and fairness. They have jumped the queue and are either prohibited or illegal entrants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 7 May, 37 section 88 detainees will challenge the rejection of their claims and ask to be released from custody. The new legislation is proposed to guarantee continued custody by providing a common custody regime for all boat people, whether they are in section 88 or section 92 custody. This will apply to all arrivals after 28 November 1989 and before 1 November 1992. The legislation will provide for a period of nine months detention for all current detainees to commence when the proposed legislation receives royal assent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the legislation for any future arrival a period of nine months detention is to commence on the date that an application for refugee status or other claim is submitted to immigration officials. Current provisions require a claim to be submitted within two months of arrival. If no submission is received within that period, the Act provides for the removal of that person from Australia. Future arrivals will be subject to immediate custody under the new provisions when they arrive in Australia and the nine months will not commence until they lodge an application. The nine-month `clock' will stop when it is necessary to obtain information or expert evidence to properly process a claim, or where a claim is subject to litigation. In effect, this can lead to exceptionally long detention periods, particularly if a case is taken through all levels of appeal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new legislation will provide to the extent possible that a court cannot release persons who are in custody under the new arrangements. An appeal to the High Court on habeas corpus will be unlikely to succeed, since the custody arrangements are legal. However, it does not interfere with the High Court's original jurisdiction. The legislation will provide for the removal of detainees whose claims to remain in Australia are rejected and allow them to continue to be held in custody pending the finalisation of removal arrangements. We must recognise that this legislation is very tough and will not be unchallenged by a variety of interest groups, including the law councils, the Refugee Council and civil liberty groups. However, it is necessary, fair and equitable to the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be noted, too, that it is intended only as an interim measure to deal with a particular issue. The Minister intends to introduce comprehensive new entry removal and custody provisions into the Migration Act in the Budget session and hopes to have them in place by the expiry of this legislation on 1 November 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a strong need for these interim measures and subsequent revision of the Migration Act. The current powers in the Act to arrest and detain persons without authority to enter or remain in Australia are cumbersome, outdated and in places silent on important issues such as re-arrest. A major weakness is the spurious distinction between persons who are arrested before disembarking from a boat and persons who arrive by boat and enter undetected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I mentioned earlier, the former are prohibited entrants under section 88 and the latter are illegal entrants under section 92. This distinction affected the detention of the people who arrived on the last boat, that is, the 56 PRC nationals, as under section 92 each had to be the subject of a separate court order. There are three people in the group presently challenging the continuation of their custody who allege that they had entered Australia and, therefore, were improperly held under section 88. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this legislation is not passed, the possibility that all detainees could be released into the community exposes Australia to the risk of a much larger influx of people. If these people were classed as refugees, they would be admitted&mdash;and Senator Chamarette can put her bottom jaw back into position. Our obligations to offer protection to genuine refugees as defined by the United Nations Convention and protocols is not affected by this legislation. It is designed to prevent abuse. Because of the strict provisions for legal migration in our migration program, migrants are increasingly trying to enter through the narrow window left open to grant asylum to political refugees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Developed countries have seen a 700 per cent increase in asylum claims over the last decade. Australia itself has witnessed an increase from 500 claims a year a few years ago to over 23,000. Although having no land borders and thus not subject to the enormous pressures being placed on borders in western Europe, Australia's geography and regional environment make it particularly vulnerable to boat arrivals. The journey from Asia involves only a fortnight's sailing and little serious danger. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once released into the community, location and removal are extremely difficult and, I might add, very costly to the Australian taxpayer. Where boat arrivals are motivated not by fear of persecution but by a simple desire to migrate, release from custody achieves de facto migration and sends a signal to others planning to follow the same route. This is an essential element of our determination to support this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, this Bill has been moved as an amendment to the Migration Amendment Bill (No. 4). We took the view that that Bill should have a second reading amendment in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That, while not denying the Bill a second reading, the Opposition deplores the Government's failure to reconstruct the immigration program to more accurately reflect the current needs of the national economy and to deliver a program that is in the long term interests of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>There is no doubt, however, that this amendment is in the best interests of the Australian people. For that reason, the Opposition supports it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to pursue the question that I asked the Minister when I last spoke and, in particular, to point out that both the Minister and Senator Baume were actually pre-empting the decision-making process. They were both talking about people who were not bona fide refugees. We are talking about a process before a court that determines the status of that person. The Minister suggested that I did not quote enough of the particular section in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. I am pleased to oblige him and to continue. It says:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Anyone who has been the victim of unlawful arrest or detention shall have an enforceable right to compensation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will answer that question very briefly. In regard to the passage Senator Spindler read out to the Senate, the question asked is whether the detention of someone is lawful. What that means is whether it is authorised by the law. There is a whole framework of laws in Australia, and in many other countries as well, to determine in what circumstances a person can be kept in detention. As I have said from the start of this debate, one of those circumstances in Australia is that any person who is an unauthorised entrant is held in custody until his or her case is settled.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To that extent, I assert that `lawful' is defined as to whether it is in or outside the law. There is no inconsistency between what we are doing here and what is done quite often, not only in immigration areas but elsewhere, in providing for circumstances in which people are kept in detention. So there is no conflict. I think Senator Spindler has probably come at this question from three or four angles. If he keeps on trying, we will come up with the same answer. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to ask the Minister virtually the same question from a different perspective. This perspective was introduced by Senator McKiernan, who suggested to us that the whole of Australia's refugee program hinged upon this very amendment. As Senator McKiernan is not interested enough in the whole of Australia's refugee program to remain to see how it is resolved, I would like to take up the question that he proposed. If, as the Minister said in answer to Senator Coulter's question, the purpose of this legislation is to deal with this narrow designation of people, what principle can be transferred to the whole of Australia's refugee program?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By this designation and singling out, surely the consideration of the status of these people is, as Senator Spindler said, pre-emptive of the consideration that will be given to the matter in the very near future by the court. If it is that narrow and if it is that tightly defined to one designated group, how can it be a matter of principle which can be transferred to the whole of Australia's immigration program? What principle underlies this in respect of the laws to be applied to people who arrive in future or to people other than those who are detained in this particular situation?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Baume a moment ago indicated that if we were to allow these people who have arrived by boat or by any other means to come into Australia without their being kept in custody, this would open the floodgates. That may well be the case. However, he then went on to make the non sequitur that any of those people who came in and applied for refugee status would be granted it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As everyone knows, there is a quota which applies to refugees. Clearly, those people would have to fit in with a quota. This bears on another point that Senator Baume made in relation to the size of the immigration program. The Australian Democrats disagree most markedly with Senator Baume in relation to those people who may or may not come in. We agree with him in relation to fairness and equity that with respect to those who would apply to come in it is important that we do not have queue jumping. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, having said that, I return to the question which I have asked the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) and which he has not answered. If all of those things are so valid, surely all the people who come into this country who fulfil section 54K(b) and 54K(c) should be kept in custody. Why then is the word `and' linking the (a), (b) and (c)? The whole amendment is narrowly drawn. It seems to me that it smacks incredibly of racism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is attempting to target a particular group of people, but the arguments that it is bringing forward are applied far more broadly. If this is not a racially targeted amendment, surely the Government should take the opportunity to look at this more closely and not wait until November or December. After all, November may not come for this Government, and it may not have the opportunity to put in place the sorts of things that it is hoping to do. Why does the Government not take the opportunity now to withdraw this amendment and draw it up properly so that it does not have this overtone of racial discrimination?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of these 37 people may win the case on Thursday&mdash;not with respect to refugee status but with respect to their being released from custody into the general Australian community.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, I return to the question which I asked the Minister and which he has not answered. The question is, why is this drawn so narrowly?

As has been said right around the chamber, none of us want to see persons using the refugee system to queue jump.

That would be a far more humane situation for those people pending the determination of their status. That is what we are talking about here, not the matters that the Minister raised just a moment ago. That is why I asked the question about section 11 of the principal Act and proposed section 54J of the Bill containing the definition of `custody'. The Minister's answer was that it was not possible to take that alternative action. I think that is unfortunate.

<PARA>We all know of the Luo Hai Ling case. As the Committee would know, she is one of the Chinese people who landed here in about December. She is about 15 weeks pregnant. Is this legislation designed to say that the unborn child is a designated person? If it is, let us look at what happens to that designated person. According to proposed section 54K, if that designated person's status as a refugee is not upheld and the unborn child is born in Australia, that child is to be deported as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Senate of the one child per family policy in China. In this particular case, that policy would apply so as to impose serious penalties on that child if it were deported. I understand that the mother is prepared to accept the definition of whatever status is applied to her, but she wants to have the child in Australia. If it were her desire&mdash;I am not sure whether it is&mdash;to have the child adopted in Australia, does that mean that that could not be done? Does that mean that under this legislation that child would have to be deported from Australia?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst I am on that subject, I want some answers from the Minister in relation to the Luo Hai Ling case. I think it is important for the Committee to hear from the Minister. It is the first time we have been given the opportunity to hear the Minister respond to some of the questions that have been raised about the Luo Hai Ling case. The one child per family policy in China involves inherent violations of human rights and it includes coerced abortions and sterilisations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is very alarming. I think the Committee should understand what we are doing here. That is a most alarming situation. The Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) has indicated that, for example, in the Luo Hai Ling case, a case of a pregnant woman, if the application for refugee status by Mrs Luo is rejected and she has had her child in Australia that child, being a designated child, must also be removed as soon as practicable after the decision has been made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer the Committee again to the fact that under the one-child per family policy in China there is a real likelihood of that child not being able to obtain registration as an authorised child in China. As those people who are aware of the Chinese situation know, the penalties which those unauthorised children carry throughout their lives are quite stark. It is something that we ought to consider here tonight in terms of what we are doing. We are not giving the Minister any discretion at all in the matter. It might well be, as I indicated, that the mother wishes to have the child adopted out. Under this provision before us tonight we are not giving the Minister any discretion at all. That is very disconcerting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should like to get some clarification of what the Government understands to be the situation in China with its one child per family policy. If the Government does not know what the situation is, I have a recently published 83-page document quoting Chinese sources and derived from Chinese official publications, newspaper articles and radio broadcasts, which shows in no uncertain terms that in particular provinces in China the one child per family policy involves gross violations of human rights through coerced abortions and sterilisations. Might I say, for anyone who has ears to hear and who may have been foolish enough to suggest that it merely means the withholding of privileges from families with more than one child, that is not the situation. The situation in many of the provinces is far worse. It is a coercive measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the withholding of privileges, if any trade unionist were to think on the fact that withholding privileges meant not only that the individual parents could have their wages cut in half but also that the work units themselves would be penalised, I am sure that trade unionist would rethink whether that involved a violation of workers' rights as well as human rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I would remind the Committee that we are in a very serious situation here. At least there should be an amendment which would give the Minister some sort of discretion instead of locking him in as this particular regulation does. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the point on which Senator Harradine finished, I said that the Minister has no discretion once a person is categorised as not being a refugee. Senator Harradine should keep in mind that the Minister at all times has a discretion to determine whether a person is a refugee or not. It is just that once the determination is made that a person is not a refugee, there is automatic departure from the country. The Minister does have the ultimate discretion in terms of determining whether a person is a refugee and Senator Harradine should keep that in mind when making his point. </PARA>

I would like the Minister to clarify whether the people who will be materially affected by the passing of this legislation are actually in the process of applying for refugee status.

<PARA>That is pretty extraordinary language. I cannot recall&mdash;and I wonder how many people in the Committee can recall&mdash;legislation which contains the word `even'. It is really saying to Judge O'Loughlin on Thursday morning, `Listen, judge, you can do what you like, but this even applies to you. Even if you order the release of these people from custody, it will be no good because they will still be designated persons and are required to be detained, notwithstanding what you say'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I feel deeply concerned, as does Senator Harradine, about the clause. Proposed new section 54S is slightly different but has the same import. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A court is not to order the release from custody of a designated person.</PARA>
<PARA>I reiterate the deep concerns of people who have been connected with the individuals who are under consideration here. As has been acknowledged, they are going through due process in relation to their application for refugee status. They are going before a court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of church agencies have lodged affidavits with Peter Rose and Colin MacDonald, the two lawyers representing the Sydney and Port Hedland Cambodian refugees, stating that they are prepared for these refugees to be released into their care and charge in a manner which will not allow these people to `melt into the background' and become illegal immigrants. The argument for this Bill attempts to paint the picture that every applicant for refugee status or every illegal immigrant will be released into custody. I want to assure people that this simply is not the case. Such releases are at a judge's discretion and are certainly not automatic. However, clause 54S actually prevents the judge from exerting that due discretion in each case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Government wants to argue that putting people into custody serves the national interest, in my view it should leave such decisions to a judge who will have all the details of each case before the bench. It should definitely not use blanket legislation which cannot take into its ambit the due circumstances of individual cases. I ask the Minister: by what process does the Government decide what serves the national interest, particularly in relation to detaining in custody all those people who have an application under way for refugee status?</PARA>

I think most of the points I would raise now were raised in those answers. Proposed new section 54S is the primary objective of the legislation. Senator Chamarette can ask me more questions about it, but it is the primary objective of that legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can say two things about that objective. First, this is not soft legislation; and, secondly, the provisions that prevail here, as I have said consistently since 8 o'clock, ensure consistency between the boat people and others in that they are maintained in detention until their cases are processed and determined. That is the objective of the legislation. As has been made clear by Senator Baume, by Minister Hand and by other speakers tonight, the Government does not shy away from the fact that this legislation is tough.

It was vital apparently for the Democrats that the legislation last night had to be knocked out before the Caucus meeting.

However, we are not stalling in order for a backroom deal to be done. We have no hope that some negotiation is going to take place while we stall. We are debating because this is of vital concern to people within our own constituencies&mdash;people who have begged and pleaded with us to speak on behalf of Cambodian refugees whom they know personally and have visited for two years while they have been detained in custody. They have worked towards helping them to go through due process. They are people who believe that our country still offers justice and humanity in its consideration of the plight of refugees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We heard in Question Time today that we have just increased the peacekeeping forces to Cambodia. On the one hand, we have increased the United Nations peacekeeping forces, yet on the other hand we are depriving these people&mdash;people who have not queue-jumped and have not just hopped into a boat, as was said very flippantly earlier&mdash;people who have fled from that same country to which we are sending peacekeeping troops and about whose welfare we feel deeply concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that I would be falling short of my responsibilities to the people whom I represent in this place if I did not point out that they have a deep concern for the way in which the humane practice of our country is being misrepresented by this attempt to push through legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have here a response of the Australian Council of Churches to the dire situation of people who are detained in custody at Port Hedland. The executive committee of the Australian Council of Churches, which met on 7 April, received a report of what was happening and resolved to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . urge the Minister for Immigration to grant a 4 year Temporary Entry Permit to those asylum seekers not recognised as refugees who are currently in detention in Australia, including those in the Port Hedland Reception and Processing Centre.</PARA>
<PARA>I will not continue with this. I realise that the patience of honourable senators is waning. We are proceeding with what we are trying to say in a fight for justice and truth and to let the cry of a certain group of the Australian public be heard. That is why the debate has been drawing on. It has also been drawing on because I had a faith that when honourable senators could see some of the issues that were being raised by this legislation it would cause them to think, it would cause them to pause, before they took this Committee down a path which is retrograde and draconian. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to raise briefly the matter of the Australian air traffic control system contract, which has been a matter of great concern for the Senate ever since its inception. I am prompted to do that by the incredible evidence that has been put on the public record in the last two hearings of the Joint Committee on Public Works on 8 April and 27 April. I commend a reading of those <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansards </EMPHASIS>to all honourable senators. I think most people reading the evidence given <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>would come to the conclusion that what we are witnessing here is probably the abuse of the public interest by a public monopoly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Public Works Committee was set up under an Act of this Parliament to look at the expenditure of funds beyond a certain level for public works. Essentially, what the Public Works Committee was looking into here was a request by the Civil Aviation Authority to provide it with a blank cheque for up to $50m to build two building complexes&mdash;one in Brisbane and one in Melbourne. The CAA gave very little justification for this and virtually no detail. The matter of accountability in this contract is of great parliamentary concern and it is a matter of great concern to the Senate and to the Public Works Committee. It goes right to the heart of public administration as we know it in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To put this matter in context, I will very briefly give an account of the air traffic control systems that exist in this country. They basically consist of a series of radar stations and the linking of ground stations to those radar stations so that information on air traffic can be provided. We have two very run-down facilities at Brisbane and Sydney, as is well referenced by the press accounts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The facilities at Perth, Adelaide and Melbourne were replaced in the recent past by the ATCARDS program, and we have had adequate publicity about the failures of the tender and of Thomson-CSF to fulfil the contract in an efficient and professional way. Since the ATCARDS program we have had the RASPP program with Cairns, Coolangatta, Mount Gellibrand and Mount Macedon. Part of that program is still in train. Again, we have had performance problems with the contractor who again was Thomson. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The RADREP proposal had been put forward to replace the facilities in both Brisbane and Sydney. That had gone to tender when the Civil Aviation Authority appointed a new Chief Executive Officer, Mr Baldwin from New Zealand. He came in, threw the program out and instituted the TAAATS which is the program we are talking about now. This matter was analysed in part in the Public Works Committee hearings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In essence, Mr Baldwin instituted a new program for Australia without any cost analysis, without any design development or anything to justify the system. He just said, `We are going to have this' and proceeded to go through the selection process to bring this about. I do not wish to waste the time of the Senate by going through the shortcomings of the approach in selecting the type of management system proposed for air traffic control, nor by commenting on the difficulties of the hands off, turnkey approach which is also an inherent part of the system that is being proposed in this case. I again advise honourable senators to read their <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansards</EMPHASIS> for the details of this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now deal briefly with the concerns we have had with the program. My initial concern was when, in May 1991, only six companies were invited to tender and no Australian companies were allowed to tender for the system. This was an arrogant, unwarranted and indefensible assumption by the CAA that no company in Australia could do it. Only a month before, in April 1991, the Government had signed the tender for the JON program&mdash;Jindalee over-the-horizon radar. The tender cost was $1,053m at April 1991 prices&mdash;something like four or five times the cost of the civil aviation program. It was a high risk program; there is much original and creative research in it. But the Department of Defence which was letting the contract had no inhibitions at all about allowing Australian companies to tender. It is a matter of record that two Australian companies&mdash;AWA and Telecom&mdash;were the finalists and the tender was awarded to Telecom. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question I ask the Senate is: how can we grow as a nation if we do not treat our Australian companies as equals in the area of commercial contracts like this? The tender process that we have developed will sort out the inadequacies of those companies, but it is absolutely outrageous that Australian companies can be debarred from tendering for something like this relatively simple CAA contract. That was my primary concern, which was shared by most of the members of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second concern that was raised in the Senate was when, in late March 1992, it was announced that Thomson was the preferred tenderer. The concern was about the very low Australian industry participation that goes with the Thomson bid, and it flew in the face of established government policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, it is a matter of public record that there was a bitter row with Senator Button, Mr Beazley and Senator Bolkus, Ministers who represented the three departments, who were outraged with the way the contract had been given to Thomson, in the face of higher Australian industry involvement by other companies. The Government is not using a crude argument. It must be understood that it is not a simple argument saying:  we want so and so to win this contract so that Australian companies can have a share on one occasion to fulfil this contract. It is a very sophisticated argument and it is aimed at developing Australian industry, not under one contract but for long term participation in world markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at Thomson's record&mdash;I will leave aside its technical inadequacies and deal with those in a few minutes&mdash;we will see that it has contributed nothing to the body corporate of Australia in the work it has done. It has moved through with its contracts like a plague of locusts, leaving nothing behind. It has not honoured the offset agreements that it entered into in the past. On one occasion, I am advised, it had to be forgiven by the Government because it had not fulfilled one of its offset obligations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not an Australian company. It is only a shell company of a French company. Adding insult to injury in this case, there was a $50m civil works program for these buildings which the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works inquired into. Apparently Thomson proposes to do that with a company called Beca, which is a New Zealand company. It is a shell company with no Australian substance to it at all. The final insult to injury is that it will use Beca, if it finally gets the contract, to satisfy offset requirements of the New Zealand Government for a New Zealand contract. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other finalist was Hughes, which has a very good record of Australian industry participation. It has written over $1 billion worth of work in Australia in the past 10 years. Not only has it entered into offset agreements and honoured every one of them, but also it is proposing to have a partnership agreement with its Australian associates&mdash;BHP, AWA and the Bassett group&mdash;to go on and tender for worldwide contracts. As I say, the record of Hughes has been absolutely exemplary in fulfilling its offset requirements in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">AWA was one of the companies associated with it. AWA has developed a voice switching apparatus for the air traffic control system. It has been a high cost, high value R&amp;D program. It is a quite good switch. AWA is looking for worldwide markets for this. I am advised that at the present time reports are coming back from Austrade in our embassy in Beijing that the Chinese Government, which is one of AWA's targets for buying this voice switching gear, is concerned that it did not win the contract on this occasion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very difficult for a company to market its products abroad if its own country has no confidence in it. AWA at present is tendering for somewhere in excess of $120m worth of aerospace equipment around the world. It has had a very heavy censure placed on it by not being selected with Hughes on this contract. While we cannot accept that in isolation as justification for the awarding of a contract, it is one of the things that has to be considered. Of course, that is why Senator Button, Senator Bolkus and Mr Beazley were so furious about what happened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major concern that the Senate has with the latest CAA contract gets to accountability. This Parliament does have to account for the expenditure of public funds. Of course, that is the concern of the Public Works Committee hearings. I stress that this is not a party political matter. If honourable senators read the report, listen to the comments in the chamber and read the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> records of the inquiries of the Public Works Committee, they will see that this has unanimous support across the Committee. There is no division along party lines in questioning the CAA.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> However, there is a real concern about this matter of parliamentary accountability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must say that in Australia we do have a system of assessing tender documents and selecting equipment in a way that is transparent and allows accountability to take place. We might end up with the wrong decision on some occasions, but there is never any criticism that somewhere or other malpractice has taken place along the way. I am at a loss to understand why the Civil Aviation Authority has on this occasion adopted the practices of a Third World country or a totalitarian regime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I return to the beginning of this matter. In May 1991 six companies were invited to tender. Mr Baldwin said that he knew who to invite, and he invited six companies. In the end only four responded. That raises serious questions about Mr Baldwin's knowledge and judgment of the industry. From there we moved to the selection process. As I said earlier, we have a set procedure for this. Following a series of public notices, we move through various stages until we come to a final decision. On this occasion the procedure set by Senator Bolkus's Department, the Department of Administrative Services&mdash;the calling of tenders&mdash;was not followed. The reason given by Mr Baldwin was that all this was far too complex&mdash;it could not be done in this case; one could not simply write a specification and go to tender through the normal practices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do call tenders on some very complex things and some very high cost equipment in this country. The tender procedures are flexible enough to allow that to be done. At the end of the day it is rubbish to say that an air traffic control system cannot be tendered for through the accepted Australian procedures. An air traffic control system collects data in one sphere and processes it in another. There are no real unknowns in that. There are certainly a few difficulties in putting the thing together. Some companies such as Thomson-CSF never seem to get it right anywhere in the world. Most major companies such as Siemens Plessey, Hughes and Raytheon can. It is quite possible to write a specific tender for this situation. Without a tender it is very hard to fairly judge the competitive claims of people who are tendering to supply the system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The assessment has to be fair not only to satisfy the principal requirement, which is to establish that the interests of the Australian taxpayer have been met, but also to satisfy the companies themselves. On a contract like this they would spend somewhere between $600,000 and $700,000 in preparing a tender. They are entitled to a professional assessment of their bid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my time in parliament we faced contracts for Defence that go right to the limit of technology, including the new tactical fighter when the FA-18 was bought, the Collins submarines and the Anzac ships. They involved billions of dollars, as against millions of dollars in this case. They are highly technical, on the fringe of technology. In all of them tender documents and stages were prepared and followed. There was never any suspicion that any malpractice took place anywhere along the line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of the assessment process in this instance, five assessment groups were set up. They were pretty broadly based. They had 25 air traffic controllers spread across the five groups, 25 engineers and technical people. They looked at the operational requirements, the technical side of it, the civil works, the finance, life cycle costs and project management. They made their assessment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first company to miss out was Siemens Plessey, which in some ways was the front runner. It had a proven system off the shelf and was probably the cheapest. It was removed on the specious grounds, which I went through in this chamber some while ago, of having a high risk program for its flight data processing. That left Hughes, IBM and Thomson in the deal. The five evaluation groups that I have referred to all selected Hughes on every count. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In November 1991 Hughes, IBM and Thomson were asked by letter for their final bid. Traditionally, when a company gets a request for a final bid on a contract, that is the end. It is the final price, the deal is over and everything is considered on that point. Hughes and IBM proceeded on the basis that this was the end. They made their bid, to be told, to their surprise, by Mr Baldwin&mdash;or his mouthpiece, Dr Edwards&mdash;on 20 December 1991 that the selection system had now changed and a decision would be made in March 1992. At this time Hughes was clearly ahead. The evaluation teams had all selected it. Its price was somewhere around $90m less and it was 11 months quicker to fulfil its contract. Despite all that, the CAA claimed that it was all too close to judge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The CAA sought time through deferment so that the goalposts could be changed and the bids could be altered by Thomson to make them competitive with Hughes. One of the things that the CAA did was to go to Hughes and say, `Look, your contract time is unacceptable to us; you must extend it by six months on the completion stage and by a further five months on the test and transition stage', which Hughes did. That made Hughes the same as Thomson. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next thing was that it said it required performance guarantees, and that added $12m to the Hughes' price. Surprise, surprise! The Thomson price came down $15m, although there were higher costs involved in providing the guarantees. I will not go through the allegations of the changes to the ROI rules that are instanced in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansards</EMPHASIS> of the Public Works Committee except that they provide an insight into the looseness of the management practices followed by the CAA at the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another of the significant points made in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansards</EMPHASIS> of the Public Works Committee is a very serious allegation as to the integrity of security of information held by the CAA. The allegations are made there that Thomson was aware continually of whatever Hughes' position was as a competing tenderer. While that was not resolved, there are enough questions raised there that demand an answer in due course. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reasons for the preferment given by the CAA were that Hughes essentially was a much higher risk and that Thomson had delivered more air traffic control systems around the world. The CAA did claim that the Australian industry participation was the same; a claim that was rejected very strenuously by DITAC later when it came out and said that Hughes was at least 20 per cent better. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first general observation I make is that Thomson-CSF does not have an international reputation for quality in the air traffic control field. In fact, there is an organisation of authorities that has been formed around the world who are users of Thomson equipment and who are so dissatisfied with the performance of that equipment that they are wanting to band together. They have had a history of failures with the ATCARDS, the RASPP and other programs not only in Australia but also in countries like Belgium, Denmark, Finland and Czechoslovakia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The claim that Hughes is a high risk company is not supported by fact. It does have a much better system of coping with flight data processing as well as the radar data processing than Thomson. The importance of that is that something like 10 per cent of Australia's air space will be covered by radar and 90 per cent will be not covered, and that 90 per cent which is not covered is the flight data processing which comes from flight plans. It has to be integrated into the display system and the presentation, and that requires a very sophisticated software program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Thomson system, based on a European system, is basically using radar data processing from radar sensors, and the integration problems there are quite formidable. I do not wish tonight to go through the arguments about the program being written in ADA as opposed to the Jovial language that some of the Hughes programs are written in beyond saying that the software component in the data processing is only about one per cent of the contract and Hughes gave guarantees that they would be fully in ADA by that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has emerged from all of this is that we have a totally unacceptable selection system; a system, I would say, that on any reading of the Public Works Committee <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansards</EMPHASIS> is totally unacceptable and discredited. What happened was that there was clearly no selection pathway before it started. Quite clearly, both the goalposts and the finishing post were moved through the contract. People who criticised Thomson were removed. People who supported Thomson&mdash;namely, Baldwin and Edwards&mdash;became the people who did it all, who made the selection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to look at what people say about this. The Civil Air Organisation&mdash;the air traffic controllers&mdash;withdrew from the selection process. I would like to read from one of its letters given to the Public Works Committee. In a letter of 29 February to Mr Baldwin, it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is with deep regret that I advise the CAA of the withdrawal of Civil Air from the evaluation of the TAAATS project tenders. The reason for withdrawal is because of the lack of fairness demonstrated by CAA management in this process.</PARA>
<PARA>I suspect that the word `fairness' is selected because, in the jargon that we used in clinics when writing up patients' records, it is not actionable. I wonder whether the Civil Air operators really mean that the system is not honest when they talk about `fairness'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were protests to the Public Works Committee about the selection process from the Royal Australian Institute of Architects, the Metal and Engineering Workers Union, the Association of Professional Engineers and Scientists of Australia, from Siemens Plessey and from Hughes itself. In the light of all that criticism, we have to seriously consider whether the selection process that took place was adequate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So much for the procedures; what about the price of the contract? The best information I have is that the initial bid from Hughes was $190m and that from Thomson $280m. When it came down to the November 1991 bid, Hughes lowered its bid to $140m and Thomson came down to $185m. In March 1992, when the selection was made, I estimate that the Hughes bid was around $150m and the Thomson bid was around $160m to $165m. There was always a very significant price difference between the two bids. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I refer to one very important point, and that is the place of the board of the Civil Aviation Authority. It is very clear that the whole program was driven by Mr Baldwin, the Chief Executive Officer, and that all the advice that went to the board of the Civil Aviation Authority was filtered through Mr Baldwin's hands. This Parliament needs to see the reports made by the five evaluation committees back in November 1991, which all favoured Hughes, and compare them with the advice that was given to the board by Mr Baldwin at the same time. We need to see how well informed the board was. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The directors of the Civil Aviation Authority must recognise that they bear a very serious responsibility. Directors' duties certainly are onerous these days but their obligations&mdash;even though they are in a government business enterprise&mdash;are exactly the same as those of the executives of any other commercial company. It might be that in the past they have worked in a low-key way, free from controversy, but the commercial law of Australia applies to them as it applies to the directors of any other company. They must protect their shareholders' interests; they have a fiduciary duty. It seems that they have failed to exercise the care and caution which is incumbent on them to satisfy themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The board of the Civil Aviation Authority is not endowed with any inherent technical expertise. Apparently, it accepted Mr Baldwin's advice without ever seeking any independent assessment of it. Two audits were performed, but they were performed at the direction of Mr Baldwin. There was no independent assessment of the advice that was given them. My advice to the directors of the Civil Aviation Authority is that not only are they in precisely the same position as directors of any other commercial company, they should also take very careful note of what is now happening to the directors of Compass. In that case there was a very powerful individual advising a board&mdash;of which he was a member&mdash;and the board members failed to seek independent advice. The risk for the CAA board members is far greater than for the directors of Compass because the liability of the Compass directors, in financial terms, will be considerably less than the liability that the directors of the Civil Aviation Authority are exposed to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have taken an interest in many tenders since I have been in this place, and I have never seen a selection process conducted like this one. I say to my colleagues that I do not like what I see here. I do not see why the Parliament and the people of Australia should tolerate such a process for one moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On many occasions I have been aware that there are disappointments at the outcome of tenders. On occasions I have raised my concerns about the outcome of a selection process, but I have never before heard any criticism of the integrity of a selection process that the Commonwealth entered into, let alone any allegations of corruption. I am now hearing allegations of corruption throughout the aviation industry and in the wider community as to the way this tender was handled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know whether those allegations are true. I have an open mind on the issue, but it is intolerable that the Parliament should find itself in this position when it is accountable at the end of the day for the funds involved. The question before the Parliament, which it must address, is that there should now be full accountability by the board of the Civil Aviation Authority, with detailed documentation as to how every stage of this tender process was handled and how the decision was arrived at. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday, prior to the point at which Senator Newman sought to have motion 829 relating to the 50th anniversary of the battle of the Coral Sea standing in her name declared formal, she kindly brought it to my notice. This presented me with the dilemma of being a lone senator who could oppose the motion being taken as formal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say `dilemma' because I found the sentiments and assumptions within the motion antithetical not only to my views but also, more importantly, to the concerns of the voters whom I represent in this place. Nevertheless, I felt that it would be discourteous and disrespectful to the majority view of this Senate to place myself at odds with it. I choose to retain the option of opposing the majority view on matters which cause me a much greater level of disagreement or disquiet than the matter raised by Senator Newman. However, I feel the need to express my qualifications regarding Senator Newman's motion from the point of view of the Greens and the many members of the peace and social justice movements within the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many people feel that the fiftieth anniversary of the Battle of the Coral Sea is not simply a memorial to the tragic and wasteful loss of human lives, but is an opportunity of glorifying war and the promotion of military power to control and suppress, rather than the power of mediation, negotiation and diplomacy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fiftieth anniversary of the Battle of the Coral Sea should be used as a time of sober reflection on the futility of war. When we look back, yes, we can say that Australia's well-being was served and, yes, we can say that many firm personal relationships were forged. But we also have to look at the overall consequences. Thousands of lives were lost; extraordinary damage was done which cost millions of dollars; and now, 50 years on, the world situation is such that anything which looks remotely like a glorification of war can be regarded only as obscene. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The US Congress paid tribute to the US-Australia relationship, and we would welcome such a tribute if, and only if, the US Congress recognises that the relationship is one of equals in which neither party can call the shots; a relationship in which one party does not have to slavishly follow the other, whether it be in matters cultural, economic or military. I concur with the reservations about the equality of the relationship expressed in Senator Spindler's notice of motion 841. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The US Congress recognised the ANZUS treaty, and we would want to say that the treaty, particularly in recent years, has been the means by which the US and, to some extent, our own country has sought to bully New Zealand, the third party to the treaty, into acting against what it sees as its own best interest. This is not the behaviour of a friend or genuine ally. The New Zealand decision against nuclear warships was translated into a boycott of the entire defence relationship, including intelligence exchange. Allies do not make or break relations according to differences which are stated in mature and rational terms. Is this the sort of treaty and friendship that we want to honour and promote; one in which the powerful members bully the less powerful; a friendship based on military expediency?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We would also want to say that the extraordinary degree of cooperation noted in Senator Newman's motion did not apparently extend to the US informing the Australian public of the use of the joint bases in Australia to monitor Scud missile firings during the Gulf war, in spite of the Hawke Government's utmost readiness to support the US in its initiative in that conflict. Indeed, as Mr Ted Lindsay pointed out in the House of Representatives last week, the degree of information available, even to Australian parliamentarians, about the nature of the joint defence facilities is less than that available to the American public. Indeed, Mr Lindsay pointed out that the briefing offered to members of the subcommittee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, FADT, was an unclassified one and that material readily available to the public in the US was not made available to members of the subcommittee. So much for the extraordinarily close friendship which Senator Newman's motion claims we share with the US!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is one aspect of Senator Newman's motion which would have our support, and that is the portion which calls upon the US Congress to implement its trading policies so that Australian farmers are not disadvantaged. It is a strange friendship where one party actively undermines the well-being of the other while claiming not to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, let us entertain adult equal relationships with governments throughout the world which demonstrate integrity and respect and, within that, can handle a diversity of views rather than forming them-and-us relationships which buy or placate allies on the basis of military strength. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday I gave notice of a motion concerning the retirement of Mr Jim Bell, AM, who this Friday retires as Chairman of the Australian Jockey Club after nine years at the helm. During the years that Jim has been Chairman I have come to know him well and on many occasions I have partaken of his hospitality&mdash;and I did so last Saturday. I have also had occasion to meet with him in my role as Deputy Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Animal Welfare. As honourable senators would be aware, the Senate undertook an inquiry into the racing industry and the AJC was represented at those hearings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Jim Bell's interest in racing and racehorses goes back a long way. He started his active interest in racing in the south of the State and was a member of the South East Racing Association which controls racing in this area. He was involved on that committee from 1968 to 1977 and, for most of that time, was also Chairman of the Goulburn Race Club. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was first elected to the AJC committee in 1977, became Vice-Chairman in 1980 and Chairman in 1983. During the time of his chairmanship he has also been Chairman of the Australian Conference of Principal Racing Clubs at biannual meetings at Sydney, alternating with the VRC Chairman. The Australian Conference of Principal Racing Clubs is the controlling body of racing in Australia&mdash;an industry which, by any measure, is a significant contributor to the economy. I believe it is the third largest industry in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Anyone who has been to Randwick racecourse cannot help but be impressed by its magnificence. It is truly Royal Randwick and on a spring or autumn day there is nothing quite so splendid as that racecourse. Jim Bell's contribution as Chairman has clearly been evident in the number of improvements made to Randwick and to racing over the years. The increase in drug testing and the effectiveness of it through the new facilities at Randwick is one such indicator, as is the new $30m grandstand which was opened in February this year by Her Majesty the Queen&mdash;which definitely made the racecourse Royal Randwick. I looked over that grandstand last Saturday with Mr Tony Allport, a member of the committee, and Mr Bill Rutledge, and no doubt the Australian Jockey Club in Sydney has made sure that the ordinary punter who goes to the races to enjoy a day out and see the magnificent horses racing can do it in a comfort which is now even greater than the comfort experienced by the members of the AJC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the equine swimming pool at the Randwick racecourse has been completed. That is another achievement for Jim Bell. He has also been a great supporter of the stewards that control racing, and I know they respect him greatly. The Chairman of the Stipendiary Stewards, John Schreck, and the Chief Veterinary Surgeon, Craig Suann, have both been fully supported by Mr Bell in his endeavours to make racing in New South Wales and Australia better than anywhere else in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having been involved in the Goulburn Race Club for so many years, Jim is concerned about the financial problems facing country race clubs. Over the years he has been a great visitor to country clubs and I know that quite often he has visited the show course of the north in northern New South Wales&mdash;my home race club of Quirindi. In addition, he has visited other race clubs such as the Tamworth race club where a turnover of $1m is commonplace. Last year on a cup day that club recorded a turnover of $2.3m. Many race clubs in Australia now have big prize money. In fact, 18 races in country New South Wales have prize money of $100,000 or more. This year the AJC decided that there was a need for some form of rationalisation of country racing. Of course, that is a fairly sensitive subject for country clubs and the NIMBY principle always abounds. The choice at hand is a reduction in the number of clubs, a reduction in the number of tracks, a reduction in the number of race days or a reallocation of funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, Jim Bell has provided the impetus for the rationalisation of country racing. He has been Chairman since 1983. At that time revenue from racing was $1.2 billion. Total racing revenue is now $3.1 billion, and galloping contributes something like $2.6 billion to the coffers of the TAB. Of course, a lot of that goes back into racing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that the rationalisation of country racing is a matter that concerns Jim Bell because, like me, he is a great supporter of racing in country areas. He is also a great horse owner, having owned a number of good horses including the 1979 Melbourne Cup third placegetter, Red Nose. I am sure that now he is retiring from the onerous position of Chairman he will be able to enjoy his racing more actively as an owner and a punter. He might even spend some time in New York, where he has been made a member of the New York Jockey Club&mdash;the first Australian to receive that prestigious honour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As he is a family man with grandchildren, he may prefer to partake of the hospitality of Royal Randwick or the local racing clubs around this area, which I know he enjoys a great deal. But I am quite sure he will be able to spend more time with his grandchildren and his family. I know his daughter has been of great assistance to him during his years as Chairman, as Jim's wife died at the time he became Chairman. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I salute him for the work he has done for racing in New South Wales. I am quite sure that the Senate joins with me in saying,`Well done, Jim'. We wish you well in your retirement. </PARA>
