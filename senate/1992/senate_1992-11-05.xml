<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent the Leader of the Opposition from moving a motion relating to the conduct of the Business of the Senate, namely, a motion to give precedence over all other business to a motion relating to the proposed censure of the Prime Minister.</PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) yesterday, in his usual style of gutter politics, referred to this place, to the Australian Senate, as `unrepresentative swill'. This is not an unprecedented performance by the Prime Minister. This is his usual style. In doing so, he degrades this institution and he degrades the office of Prime Minister. The only recourse we have at the moment to such foul action of the Prime Minister is to move a censure motion in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ultimately, the Australian people will have the matter in their hands, hopefully sooner rather than later, and what they will do is throw out this Prime Minister because they are sick and tired of this gutter style of politics. What they want from their representatives is debate on the issues, debate on the important things that are facing Australia, debate on the one million Australians who are out of work, and debate on what can be done in the form of a program that can give them an opportunity for the future, to provide work for them, to provide opportunities for their families and a future for their children. That is what the Australian people are interested in. They are sick and tired of this Prime Minister simply wanting instead to divert the matter by personal abuse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this place we are sick and tired of his seeking to drag down the Senate as well. That is why it is urgent this morning that we take up this issue and that we pursue it in this place. I said that it was not unprecedented. It happens continually. I will give the Senate a few examples of what the Prime Minister has said over the years, referring to individuals, with the protection of the other place. He refers to them as `harlots', `sleazebags', `frauds', `cheats, cheats, cheats', `blackguards', `pigs', `mugs', `clowns',`brain-damaged', `loopy crims', `stupid, foul-mouthed grubs'. This is the Prime Minister of Australia speaking&mdash;the Prime Minister of Australia, who should be looked up to and respected by the Australian people. Yet he drags down the office to that level and he drags us down by doing it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Something has to be done about it. As I said, all we can do in this place is protest in the strongest possible form that is open to us, and that is through censure. That is why we come in here this morning at the first opportunity to seek to suspend Standing Orders in order that we can move a censure motion against him, in order that the Senate can put on the record that it regards his performance and his behaviour as intolerable, that he should improve his performance, get out of the gutter, debate the issues that are important to Australia, behave in the way that an Australian Prime Minister ought to behave. Alternatively he ought to get out, he ought to resign, he ought to acknowledge that he is an embarrassment to Australia and an embarrassment to the Australian people. That is why it is important that this matter be debated this morning, and that is why I move for the suspension of Standing Orders. </PARA>

If anyone else wants to speak on it they are welcome, but I assume that after a few brief comments people might wish to get on with the substantive motion. The reason I wanted to hear Senator Hill speak on why we should suspend the Standing Orders was to hear him say what I expected, which is that the people of Australia want the Parliament to deal with the important issues that are causing them concern.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We will support the motion for the suspension of the Standing Orders. We believe that this is an important matter, that it is not, as Senator McMullan indicated a moment ago, the Senate being precious about its own standing. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is bringing into disrepute both the Parliament itself and the high office of the Prime Minister. It is about time this sort of thing is put a stop to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister is also factually wrong. This is a far more representative chamber. One need only look at the way the legislation in many cases is hammered through the House of Representatives on numbers and in this place is dealt with properly and appropriately and quite extensively amended. It is important to defend the very important role of the Senate. I draw attention to the words of Dr Hewson this morning. The Senate was described by Dr Hewson as a brake on the excesses of the Labor Government. I would hope that he would also accept that the Senate may act as a brake on the excesses of any future coalition government, should that happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an important matter. We should get on with the substantive motion, which we are yet to hear from Senator Hill.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and the Senate</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) upholds the valuable role of the Senate in providing checks and balances on executive government, as a result of the consistent decision of Australian voters that no party should have absolute control of the chamber; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) observes that the proportional representation system under which Senators are elected makes the composition of this chamber more representative of the will of the Australian people than is the House of Representatives.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not oppose the suspension of Standing Orders. It is unfortunate that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has made certain references to the word `swill'. I think the last time the word `swill' was used in the House of Representatives was when Mr Jim Killen said of a particular member of the House of Representatives, `The honourable member is not fit to carry swill to the pigs'. He was asked to withdraw that statement, and he did. He said, `The honourable member is fit to carry swill to the pigs'.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate censures the Prime Minister for degrading the office of Prime Minister and the institution of Parliament in his contemptuous abuse of the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA>As I was saying some time ago, this denigration of the institution, this practice of public abuse by this Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has got to stop. The only action that we can take in this place properly to register our protest is censure. Ultimately, as I said, the people of Australia will have their opportunity, and I have no doubt at all that when they have that opportunity they will throw this man out of office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They will throw him out of office not only because he has failed the Australian people in his economic plan&mdash;his plan, his model, has resulted in one million Australians being out of work, causing so much misery and hardship in this country&mdash;but because of his personal style. They are sick and tired of this style of personal abuse. Whenever he is in trouble politically, the answer is to abuse someone, preferably to abuse somebody else, and then preferably to abuse the institution. The Australian people are constantly saying that they will not tolerate that behaviour any longer, that they want something better, and they are entitled to something better from the Prime Minister of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They want to look up to and respect the Prime Minister of Australia. They want to be able to respect these institutions. They want to be able to respect the democratic process in this country. That is why they are tired of the Prime Minister dragging down the Parliament, the institutions, to his gutter level of politics. That is why, in addition to his failure, his economic failure and the suffering and hardship he has brought to so many Australians, they will toss him out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A few minutes ago I was giving you some examples, Mr President, of his contemptuous behaviour in this way, because it is important to note that this is one of so many occasions on which he has behaved in a way of uttering such personal abuse. Mr President, I will not repeat the ones I mentioned a while ago, but I will give you a few more out of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. This is what he says under the protection of Parliament as he seeks to drag this institution down to his level. He has referred to individuals as `scumbags', `scum', `sucker', `thugs', `dimwits', `a swill', `a pigsty'&mdash;that seems somewhat opportune&mdash;`Liberal muck', `vile constituency', `fools and incompetents', `perfumed gigolos', `thugs of Australian politics', `constitutional vandals', `insane stupidities', `liars', `ghouls', et cetera. `Criminals', he says, within the protection of Parliament, of individuals on the other side of the chamber.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that there are important matters facing this nation. I have said it and I will say it again. We are pleased to say that on this side of the chamber we have put down a comprehensive plan, perhaps the most comprehensive plan from any Opposition in Australia's history, to get this country back on its feet again and to give Australians an opportunity for the future. We want to debate that plan. We want to debate Fightback. It is a constructive effort by an alternative government to put the detail on the table in order that policy debate can take place and the people of Australia can then make their choice on policy issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what the parliamentary process should be all about. That is our responsibility and that is a responsibility that we have met. What should the Prime Minister be doing? He should be putting on the table his alternative for the next three years in government. But is he going to do that? He certainly should do it, having regard to the fact that so many Australians are out of work and suffering at the moment. But is he prepared to do that? No. What is his answer? His answer is simply to attack and abuse. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He said that. Of course, he went on to qualify the statement, recognising immediately what he had said, to say that what he meant was that the Prime Minister goes on the offensive more often than any in Australia's history. In actual fact, he probably got it right both times, because he is the most offensive Prime Minister in Australia's history and he goes on the offensive more often than any others because he has not got a plan. He does not offer Australia any decent future. All he can offer as an alternative to Fightback is personal abuse, and we got it again when he referred to the Senate as `swill', pigs feed&mdash;that is his level of gutter politics. That is where he wishes to drag us and we are not prepared to do so. We will stand up and fight against it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What was it all about yesterday? It was about the conspiracy between the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) and the former Victorian Government to keep from the Australian people the fact that the Victorian Government had breached the Loan Council guidelines. That is what it was all about&mdash;ministerial accountability. We have a responsibility to do something about that, and we have done so. We have set up a committee that will investigate that apparent abuse, and it will go further. It will make recommendations to improve the system in the future. Again, that is us acting responsibly within our role. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the Prime Minister's response to that? Rather than say that he will cooperate with the parliamentary process, recognising that democracy and ministerial responsibility are integral parts of the system of which we are all so proud, his answer is to say, `My Minister will not attend, and furthermore he won't attend before a chamber that is unrepresentative swill, unrepresentative pig food'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is appalling behaviour. It is not good enough and it has to end. The Australian people will bring it to an end. This behaviour reflects the Prime Minister's background, his faction. We have heard before that his own people refer to his faction as thugs. That might be the way they operate within the New South Wales Right, but it is not the way the Australian people wish to see the Prime Minister behave in the parliamentary process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We gave him a couple of hours yesterday. We thought that perhaps for once he would be prepared to go back into the House of Representatives and say, `I apologise'. But was he prepared to do that? Of course not, because you never apologise. No doubt his answer today will be to come out and pile more abuse on top of that abuse. It seems to be the only way the Prime Minister knows how to carry on the business of politics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we have moved this motion of censure today. We have done so because the Australian people are sick of it, and we have a responsibility to register their protest in this way. We move it not so much out of anger but out of a genuine desire to lift the standing of this place and to enable the Australian people again to say that they are proud of their institutions and proud of the way in which we go about our fairly difficult task, if I might say so. They want to hear debate, they want to hear the issues argued out, but they do not want to continually hear this personal abuse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps, just perhaps, out of this debate today the Prime Minister might change, but I doubt it. Over the years, personal abuse has been his constant practice. It is his mark. It is the way in which he engages in the business of politics: do not debate the issues; do not debate the substantive matters; do not concern yourself with a million Australians out of work; each time these policy issues are raised, respond  to them with personal abuse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have moved this motion of censure today because the behaviour of the Prime Minister has been appalling. He has degraded the institution of Parliament, he has degraded the office of Prime Minister, and I trust that the Senate will support the motion and censure him, as it should. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the motion to censure the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). When I receive the appropriate words, I will be seeking to amend the motion to add the first two parts of the motion I foreshadowed earlier. The Australian Democrats believe very strongly that the Prime Minister has not only on this occasion but also on many other occasions, as Senator Hill has said, degraded the office of Prime Minister, which is one the people of Australia have a right to look up to and respect. He has also degraded the whole process of parliamentary democracy in degrading with those offensive remarks the role of the Senate, which, under our Constitution, is clearly integral to the democratic functioning of the Parliament.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Patterson has just interjected, `Hear, hear!' I think all fair minded senators will recognise that time and again legislation is simply slammed through the House of Representatives. It is a number crunching exercise. Legislation often comes up here ill prepared and requiring extensive debate and amendment. If people look into the record, they will find that time after time the Senate is doing the only work that properly represents the democratic functioning of Parliament. That is not being done in the House of Representatives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the Prime Minister's statement on the unrepresentative nature of the Senate, I simply point to the figures in the 1990 election, in which the Australian Democrats received roughly one vote in eight from the Australian people. Consequently, if the House of Representatives had been a representative chamber, we should have had roughly 18 seats in the House of Representatives. But it is not a representative chamber and we finished with no seats, simply because of the way those votes were distributed across Australia. I contrast that with the National Party, which received approximately two-thirds the number of votes of the Australian Democrats and yet finished up with 14 seats in the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet, when one looks at the Senate, one will see that after the 1990 election we finished with eight senators in a House of 76. The Senate, in that respect, truly represents the spread of opinion among the Australian public. That is precisely what a representative chamber should do. Building on that, one sees again that this is the chamber, and precisely because over the last decade neither of the old parties have had the ability simply to slam through legislation on the numbers, in which proper parliamentary debates have occurred and extensive amendments and extensive improvements have been made to legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite clear, as others have said, that the Prime Minister and many of his colleagues, and indeed some in this chamber on the Labor side, are on the record as saying that they would like to dispense with the Senate. That would be an extremely dangerous, hazardous and very retrograde step. If any chamber were to be extinguished, surely it should be the House of Representatives or, conversely, if we are going to move to a unicameral system of parliament, then we should adopt a multi-member electorate and a proportional representation system for the House of Representatives so that it becomes a representative chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition, Dr Hewson, is clearly on record as wanting not to abolish the Senate but simply to control the Senate. Again, one would find that under such a system one would have legislation slammed through on the numbers, and one would abolish the Senate in terms of its proper review function, its debating function. As I indicated a moment ago, Dr Hewson said of the Senate just yesterday that it is an important chamber as it acts as a brake on the excesses of Labor governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I simply draw everybody's attention to the desirability of having a proper review of all legislation, irrespective of the party in power, so that we avoid the excesses of Executive government, whether it is a Labor government, a coalition government or any other government. In a democracy&mdash;and I am sure all fair minded senators in this chamber will agree&mdash;it is appropriate that a representative chamber carries out that review function. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The substantive issue over which this has arisen, that is, the Senate inquiry into the functioning of the Loan Council, is a classic case in which the functioning of the Loan Council, in this case under a Federal Labor government and a Labor government in Victoria, may well have&mdash;and I make no judgment&mdash;done certain things which need close scrutiny.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate is a very valuable House of review, and I think that has been demonstrated over the last decade. Is it suggested that any of us are so pure and so clean that the temptations of the exercise of executive power are not such that parties and people can be corrupted and, therefore, are in no need of that democratic review process? To argue that is simply to agree with the Prime Minister that the Senate should be abolished. We do not defend that position. We strongly defend the role of the Senate and point very strongly to the fact that the Senate has really come into its own since the Democrats have had the balance of power&mdash;since, in the last 10 years, legislation has been reviewed by a parliament in which neither of the old parties have had the power simply to slam through anything that they want, just on the numbers alone. </PARA>

Former Senator Peter Baume described himself as being so wet that if he were wrung out he would drip, but he was one person who, on several occasions to my knowledge, crossed the floor. Many honourable senators here will remember his closing speech in which he said that in his last few years in the Senate, the Senate had really begun to function in the very important way in which it was intended to function&mdash;as a House of review.

What he complains about this morning is that the Australian people are sick and tired of this language used by the Prime Minister. But the truth slips out all the time. Senator Hill cannot speak on behalf of the Australian people on this issue. He speaks on behalf of himself and Opposition senators here. They are sick and tired of it. That is the point. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Macdonald is getting on to a good point. We will deal with that in a minute. The fact of the matter is that the real objection is sensitive Liberal Party politicians who cannot stand the heat in the kitchen and get very excited about all these issues. All the things that Senator Hill objects to were said about members of parliament. He says, `We are sick and tired of it. The Australian people with whom we identify'&mdash;with an extraordinarily low poll approval&mdash;`are sick and tired of it too'. Let us look at Senator Hill's press release. Senator Hill went out yesterday and said that `swill' is defined in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Collins Dictionary </EMPHASIS>in such and such a way, and he invited senators to read the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Collins Dictionary </EMPHASIS>definition of what the word `swill' means. This is the rub, the word `swill'. He said in his press release that there are numerous interpretations of the word `swill' as defined in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Collins Dictionary.</EMPHASIS> Some of them he finds offensive&mdash;undoubtedly, because of the way he has gone on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How did Senator Hill's press release conclude? It concluded that Mr Keating had demeaned the office of Prime Minister and shown contempt for Parliament, so he should resign. After all these years in opposition, the point that the Opposition has finally got to is that the only way that it can get rid of the Government is to get people to resign. Senator Macdonald interjects every day, saying that I should resign. Mr Dawkins is supposed to resign. Mr Keating is supposed to resign. Everybody is supposed to resign to make way for this lacklustre lot on the Opposition benches, who assume that if everybody on the Government's side resigns they will move into government. That is the latest tactic of the Opposition, to say that everybody ought to resign. That is the easy way into government; the rest is being found a bit too hard. The Prime Minister has used words about Liberal politicians, as I said, that they do not particularly like. Because of that, everybody on the Government's side, including the Prime Minister, should resign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very important to make a distinction between words used about Liberal politicians and words used about the people of Australia. Let us have a look at that, at words used about the people of Australia. Let us look at what Dr Hewson, the Leader of the Opposition, says about people who live in rented homes. He says that in any street it is always easy to tell the rented houses. They are the ones where the lawn is not mowed, the plants are not watered and the fences are not fixed. That is Dr Hewson on people, on Australians, who have to rent their homes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We may listen to Dr Hewson on other issues. BHP and Ford he calls companies mollycoddled by government. That was said about Mr Prescott, the chief executive of BHP. Dr Hewson's comment on the Catholic Welfare Commission was that it consisted of whingeing, carping critics. What does he say about people who do not have children? People who do not have children are reprehensible, in the view of Dr Hewson. People who do not drive cars are reprehensible, in the view of Dr Hewson, the Leader of the Opposition. Australians are lazy. People on welfare are lazy. </PARA>

His nose is really out of joint about that, and he says that all Australians object to that. I think a lot of them love it. Senator Hill is speaking from the base of a party in opposition which can muster about 41 per cent of popular approval in this country, in most severe economic circumstances which they do not talk about. The Australian people are rightly concerned about those issues. Senator Hill mentioned it for a minute this morning. But what is the big issue in Senator Hill's mind? Not the economy.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support very strongly Senator Hill's motion of censure of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating):</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate censures the Prime Minister for degrading the office of Prime Minister and the institution of Parliament in his contemptuous abuse of the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA>I have sat and listened, as have my colleagues, for the last half hour waiting for the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button), the third most senior Minister in this Government, to defend the Prime Minister. Not one word of defence did we hear. I do not think I have ever heard a more pathetic, out of touch, sad response&mdash;obviously with no heart in it&mdash;by any Minister in this chamber in the time that I have been in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When this debate started and, indeed, for the first 45 minutes of this debate, who on the Government side was here to listen to the debate in defence of the Prime Minister? There were four members of the Government; four senators were here. One of them was the Deputy President, Senator Colston, who I think was here in his capacity as Deputy President waiting to take the chair. One was Senator Foreman, who I think is here in his capacity as the Deputy Whip. One was Senator Cooney, who has a great penchant for sitting and snoozing here in the Senate waiting to make his profound and often worthwhile statements. That left one other, namely, Senator Button, who was here because he had to get up and try to put a few words together at some stage later in the debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In effect, not one person from the Government side was here seriously listening to arguably the most important debate we have had in this chamber for a long time. Senator Schacht wanders in and wanders out, but he is obviously pretty irrelevant to this scheme of things. Sure, a few more senators turned up once the muster whips were drawn, but even now, I point out to you, Mr Acting Deputy President, we have six members of the Government here. Fewer than one-fifth of the Government senators are here to participate in or even listen to a debate that goes to the core of the institutions of this nation, the core of the institution of which they, I would have hoped, would have been proud members. But no, they are not here because, with their Prime Minister, they have been parties for years and years and decades to the progressive debasement of the institutions of this nation, through a range of Labor governments and Labor Speakers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that is the saddest part and the most important part of today's debate. As Senator Hill's motion states, what the Prime Minister did in his statements today and yesterday was to continue a long, progressive, continuous line of debasement of the institutions of this nation and to show the contempt and arrogance that he has for the basic fabric of this nation. He has been doing it right through his political career. He has accelerated it in the period since he became Prime Minister. I point out that he does not have a mandate from the Australian people to be Prime Minister. He was elected by his mates as a result of a long and sustained coup which culminated in the political assassination of the former Prime Minister. He is not there as Prime Minister because he was elected by the Australian people to be Prime Minister, and I can assure him that he never will be. He will never be elected by the people of this nation to be Prime Minister in his own right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Button, in his pathetic speech today, started off by drawing attention to the fact that Senator Hill happened not to have mentioned a couple of words in quoting one of the sentences that formed the basis for this censure debate today. It is quite understandable that Senator Hill omitted those words, but Senator Button pointed out that Senator Hill had omitted the Prime Minister's words that this was a political stunt, referring to the establishment of the Senate select committee to inquire into the Australian Loan Council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Do the Prime Minister or Senator Button really believe that it is a political stunt that the Senate is concerned about what is nothing less than a conspiracy between the Keating Government and the discredited former Labor Government in Victoria? Does he believe that it is a stunt that the Australian Government, the Federal Government, the Keating Government, has been involved in a cover-up in the form of deliberately misrepresenting and presenting misleading papers, documents and figures in the Budget, which is the premier economic document in the nation? Does he really believe that it is a stunt that the Senate wants to look at a series of events that have significantly eroded the confidence of the financial markets of this nation in the integrity, credibility, trust and confidence that those financial markets can place in the operations of government and those that they have elected to government?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Do the Prime Minister and Senator Button really believe that looking at those things constitutes political stunts? I think they probably do, because they are people who do not believe that integrity and credibility in government are necessary. They do not believe that a nation can function effectively, that the social fabric can survive, prosper and grow, only if the people of the nation feel that they have the trust and confidence of government and that they can put their trust and confidence in government. That is what this very important debate is all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister has expressed his hatred for the Senate through his actions over the years, particularly in the months since becoming Prime Minister, and in remarks such as those that he made yesterday in referring to one of the basic institutions of this nation, the Senate. I point out to the Prime Minister that, without the existence of that institution, there would never have been an Australian nation. It was only because there was agreement amongst the States to have a Senate that we had a federation in the first place, and he calls it an unrepresentative swill. That is because he has always hated it and the Labor Party has always hated it. For decades the Labor Party had in its platform the abolition of the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party&mdash;we should make no bones about it&mdash;hates the Senate. The reason why the Labor Party hates the Senate is that the Senate can provide and does provide the checks and balances to curb the excesses of executive power that have been the hallmark of every Labor government we have had in this nation. If we had not had the Senate and the Australian Parliament, the excesses, the abuses, the wrongdoings, the total destruction of confidence in Australia that occurred under the Whitlam Government with the Khemlani affair would have continued. This nation would have been in the gravest danger of disintegrating. Here we have, in recent days, found again a situation where the government of the day&mdash;the Labor government of the day&mdash;has been shown simply to be incapable of managing money, incapable of being trusted with the nation's till. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet the Prime Minister wants to prevent the Senate, the only institution that can look at these matters and the broader issues of the whole functioning of financial institutions in Australia, from examining properly the most important public financial institution in Australia, the Australian Loan Council. The Senate would examine that Council with a view to improving it in the future, with a view to exposing the excesses of the past and the wrongdoings of the past so that we can get some trust and integrity restored to those institutions and can have confidence once again in our basic institutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Button defended yesterday the Prime Minister's right to prevent that. Indeed, he supported the Prime Minister's view that the Senate was an unrepresentative chamber. If the Senate is an unrepresentative chamber, I wonder what Senator Button is doing in this place. What are all his colleagues on the other side of this chamber doing here if they believe that they are unrepresentative of the Australian people? I thought this chamber was democratically elected. I thought it was as democratic and as representative a chamber as any chamber in any parliament in Australia. I do not know of one in the Western world that is more representative or more democratic than this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What absolute nonsense the Prime Minister is talking when he claims that we are unrepresentative. What absolute incredulity one has for the support by the Leader of the Government in the Senate for the Prime Minister, when he says that the chamber in which Senator Button is the Leader of the Government is unrepresentative. How on earth can Senator Button in any conscience stand here and remain in the Senate as the Leader of the Government if he believes that it is unrepresentative?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the other things the Prime Minister said yesterday in his debasing of the institution of the Parliament was that he would forbid any Minister in the House of Representatives to appear before a Senate committee of any kind while he was Prime Minister. He almost went into loop the loops over it. He almost had a heart attack about it. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would forbid him going to the Senate to account to this unrepresentative swill over there . . . There will be no House of Representatives Minister appearing before a Senate committee of any kind while ever I am Prime Minister, I can assure you.</PARA>
<PARA>There is no better example than that of the continuing arrogance and contempt of the Prime Minister for the institution of the Parliament. It also demonstrates an overweening ignorance of the simple procedures and processes of this Parliament, of which he has been a member for almost a quarter of a century. If he had the first idea or first knowledge of the procedures of the Senate, he would know that it is not his prerogative to determine whether a Minister of the House of Representatives appears before the Senate or not. It is all laid down very clearly in the Standing Orders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A committee of the Senate can invite any Minister to appear before a committee of the Senate. If a Minister in the House of Representatives refuses the invitation to appear, then under the Standing Orders of the Senate&mdash;standing order 178&mdash;the Senate can, by a message, request the permission of the House of Representatives for that Minister to appear. It is then a decision for the House of Representatives as to whether that Minister appears. It has nothing at all to do with the Prime Minister as Prime Minister; it is a matter for the democratic institution of the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday, once again, the Prime Minister allowed that overweening arrogance to subsume the facts of the situation. Indeed, he did not do his homework very well, because there have been two Ministers of his own Government since he has been Prime Minister who have appeared before committees involving senators. Minister Baldwin appeared before the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training on 6 March of this year; Minister Free appeared before the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology in May of this year; and there have been Ministers in other years who have appeared as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real reason why the Prime Minister mouthed the words that he did yesterday&mdash;his hatred and abuse, his denigration and debasing of the Senate&mdash;is that he fears the Senate. He did that because the Senate happens to have a mind of its own; because it is not prepared to be cowed by the bully boy, kneecapping threats and actions of a power drunk, foul-mouthed Prime Minister&mdash;a Prime Minister who throughout his whole political career has used threat and invective as his front line, a Prime Minister who has never been endorsed as Prime Minister by the electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He fears the Senate because he wants to hide the Loan Council conspiracy between his Government and the former, discredited Victorian Government. He wants to continue to indulge in a cover-up because the basic problem with Labor is, as I said before, that it cannot be trusted with money and it does not want to have public exposure of that in any shape or form, even by the most democratically elected institutions and representative institutions of this nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister abuses his power, he overstates it and he is the best exponent that we have had in our political history, I believe, of gutter politics. Prime Minister Keating is surely the last man in Australia qualified to talk of others as swill. I do not know of any other politicians who, in their common, everyday parlance, when referring to political opponents, use such words as `sleazebags', `frauds', `cheats', `thugs', `brain damaged', `scumbags'. He is the man who uses those words. He is the man who is wanting to pass judgment on us and on this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accountability is the cornerstone of the democratic and parliamentary process. This Prime Minister does not believe in accountability. He does not believe in normal democratic processes. He thinks he can say, `This is the way it will be' and that that is the end of it. The records of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> and elsewhere are replete with some of his more arrogant statements. Only the day before yesterday he said in the House of Representatives:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You don't boss us around, pal; you get what we want to give you.</PARA>
<PARA>In 1988, when he was the Treasurer, he made the incredible statement that Question Time is a `courtesy extended to the House by the executive branch of government'. What Mr Keating has got absolutely inverted is the truth of the relationship between the Executive and the Parliament in this nation. The whole basis of parliamentary democracy is that the Parliament is the premier institution in this nation and that the Executive Government, whilst separate, is an integral part of the parliamentary process. That the House is dictated to by the `courtesy' extended to it by the executive branch of government is an absolutely incredible statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple truth is that the Prime Minister wants to get rid of the Senate. That would make life so much easier for him. That is why he is continuing to debase and denigrate the role of the Senate and of honourable senators of his own Party. It is typical of the actions he has taken throughout his political career. It demonstrates the arrogant contempt he has shown for Australian institutions&mdash;not just the Parliament but also the Constitution and some of our basic symbols, the Australian flag in particular&mdash;over the course of his prime ministership. They are excesses. They are debasements of the institutions of this nation and of the basic fabric of this nation. The Australian Parliament and the Australian people surely can no longer allow this arrogance and this contemptuous abuse of process to continue. For those reasons, the Opposition has moved the motion. It deserves the very strong support of the Senate because I believe it has the total support of the Australian people. </PARA>

Go and tell Ray Gregg of General Motors-Holden's in South Australia that he is part of the welfare mentality. They will give Senator Chapman a big drop-kick right out of the State.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the pet hates, of course, of the Liberal Party is actually the organisations that represent the poor in the community. Listen to what Dr Hewson said about ACOSS. He actually said it to ACOSS at its congress, and I must say that I give him credit that he said it to their face; but it is still an astonishing remark. I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By concentrating on expanding and improving the provision of welfare, in one sense at least, ACOSS is just reinforcing the Biblical reminder that the poor are always with us.</PARA>
<PARA>That is an astonishingly insensitive remark about how he thinks the poor ought to be dealt with in Australia. On the same occasion he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If ACOSS was dedicated solely to tackling poverty and not, in addition, to boosting the welfare sector, this (the Opposition's reform package)&mdash;surely&mdash;would be a rather appealing package.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If ACOSS was examining the real issues rather than reacting in a conditioned knee-jerk fashion, the Coalition would seem like the best friend the poor are likely to have in this country.</PARA>
<PARA>It is a laughable comment. Finally, there are his comments to the Western Australian Liberal Party Annual State Convention. I have to say to Senator Chapman that the Western Australian Liberal Party Annual State Convention in July 1992 probably was the most appropriate branch of the Liberal Party to speak to. It is the most right wing in Australia, as a result of Senator Crichton-Browne's branch-stacking, arm-twisting, ballot-counting efforts. So one can speak roughly about the welfare lobby to the Western Australian branch. This is what he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You can go through the welfare industry&mdash;the same. You've got your mates, you've got your professional lobbyists; the professional basket weavers; the massive community that has been built up in the welfare bureaucracy&mdash;most of them are the winners.</PARA>
<PARA>I bet he got a big round of applause from Noel Crichton-Browne's right wing mates at the Western Australian State Conference. Then about the Australian Catholic Social Welfare Commission, on 11 June 1991, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unfortunately, the bit of their report I've read it was a bit of carping, whingeing, negative assessment of a proposal in isolation whereas you have really got to look at that proposal in the context of the present system, the present system is a lousy system, most people agree with that. . .</PARA>
<PARA>When the Catholic Social Welfare Commission did not agree with that, he described it as carping, whingeing and negative. That is a pretty astonishing comment to make about one of the longest serving community groups dealing with welfare in Australia. He spoke about the ethnic community, about multiculturalism.

<PARA>I did not see Senator Reid jumping up to ask Dr Hewson to withdraw that reflection on people living in Canberra&mdash;only about 300,000 people. So Dr Hewson has bagged all of Canberra. We then get to a couple of astonishing remarks he made about renters in Australia. On 31 August, addressing the Australian building industry, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In any street, of course, it's always easy to tell the rented houses. They're the ones where the lawn isn't mowed, the plants aren't watered and the fences aren't fixed.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what he thinks about the 30 per cent of Australians who live in rented homes&mdash;an astonishing remark. He said about nurses:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the health system the queues are getting longer and longer every day and look after the health bureaucracy and suddenly powerful nurses union leaders and so on, they're all part of the club if you like, but the rest are excluded.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And the one thing that's struck me as I've gone around Australia quite consciously almost every day that Parliament isn't sitting, what has struck me most is that average Australians feel like we're outsiders in our own country.</PARA>
<PARA>He is the one who is the outsider, bagging every other Australian. He has called all Australians lazy. In one of the most insensitive remarks he has ever made, trying to be funny&mdash;Dr Hewson has a very warped sense of humour, but I did not hear anybody in the Opposition complaining about this remark&mdash;he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Go back to Whitlam. What was his greatest contribution to Australia? AIDS&mdash;Acquired Income Dependency Syndrome.</PARA>
<PARA>One of the great tragedies in international health is the AIDS plague, yet all we get out of Dr Hewson is a remark that this has to be related back to Gough Whitlam. I must say that I would not have thought those people who have, unfortunately, been afflicted with AIDS would have laughed much at having their illness&mdash;which is ultimately going to cost them their lives&mdash;made into a political joke. Where did he say that? Again it was at Senator Noel Crichton-Browne's Liberal Party convention on 25 July 1992. I must say for you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that Senator Crichton-Browne really scored a big hit at that convention with a speech from John Hewson. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every time he goes to speak to a Liberal Party convention, the Leader of the Opposition ends up putting his foot in it. I read out the quote from the WA convention. I have here a report of what he said recently to the New South Wales State convention:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Hewson told the NSW Liberal conference on Saturday that Mr Carr could not compete with the new NSW Premier, Mr Fahey, who was a popular "knock-about sort of bloke".</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"You've got to be suspicious of a guy that doesn't drive and doesn't like kids and things like that," Dr Hewson said.</PARA>
<PARA>There was such an outcry in the community about that personal remark against Mr Carr, the New South Wales Leader of the Opposition, that Dr Hewson had to make some sort of apology. As I understand it, the apology, made in a radio interview in Adelaide, was that he himself and his wife were also trying to have children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Australian politics, at any level, one should not be drawn down into talking about the personal details of one's family, even if one is trying to recover from a gaffe used to attack somebody else. Dr Hewson is quite willing, off the cuff, to smear somebody, to say that somebody is unAustralian or not a fit human being because he does not like children, or cannot have children, and does not drive a car. It was an astonishing comment to make. I did not hear anybody opposite in this place say, `That really is a dreadful personal reflection on another member of the Australian community who is in public life'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can compare that with what Mr Keating said about the Senate yesterday. He did not attack anybody personally. He made a comment about what he thinks of the Australian Senate. It was a political comment about an institution. People may disagree with it, they may dislike it, but he was not attacking anybody personally. In my view, he has very good reason, if he wants it, to attack any number of individuals in this chamber for their recent performances. Senator Bishop turns Estimate committees and public hearings of standing committees of the Parliament into a joke, a charade, to seek publicity. That is all her performances are about. Then in this chamber we have Senator Bishop and others smearing and using innuendo about the Australian Ambassador to the United Nations, hour after hour, not waiting for a proper inquiry to be conducted. All of that smearing goes on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are the sorts of things that bring the Senate into disrepute. The privileges of this chamber are being used to smear individuals, and people such as Senator Bishop in the Opposition are the greatest smearers. I notice that Senator Bishop has been given one of the three Opposition positions on the select committee to inquire into the Loan Council. The reason for that, which is all around the gallery, is that this will be a triumph. Senator Bishop can pound the table, stand up and shout, denigrate public servants and abuse them. Unfortunately, Senator Bishop believes that shouting and screaming as a publicity stunt are substitutes for intellect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My old grandfather, who grew up on a farm in Victoria, used to say about people who did not have much intelligence that, if their brains were maggots, they could not get themselves flyblown. I think that really does apply to Senator Bishop in this case, because all she does is use stunts to substitute for intelligence and intellect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, let me talk about quotes. As I said before, to my recollection, apart from the time when I was called Senator Short, I have never objected or sought withdrawal when I have been attacked in this place. When Mr Chaney was Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, I was called a thug, an apparatchik, a standover merchant. I did not seek withdrawal of his remarks when, in one debate, he accused me of having no standards. I did not even object in this place or make a statement when Dr Hewson said, on 4 June 1992, in the House of Representatives, talking about my role in the pay television debate:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have no better example of that than the way the pay television decision was taken. This was described in graphic detail by Senator `Shat' or Schacht. I am never quite sure how you say that but I will say Schacht because `Shat' is not very nice.</PARA>
<PARA>That is in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. When I was asked by journalists the next day how I responded to that remark and whether I was upset, I just ignored it. If the Leader of the Opposition of Australia can make comments only in a scatological way, if that is the level of his humour, he is certainly not fit to be Prime Minister or even Leader of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the Leader of the Opposition those people have. All he can do is make a joke, as he has of other people's names and about mine. I did not object. Other people will make a judgment about his quality when the best he can do in a political comment is to try to mispronounce another politician's name. I accept the fact that I have inherited a difficult family name from five generations ago. I accept the fact that it can easily be mispronounced, but I think I have been around long enough in the Parliament that even Dr Hewson may have been able to know how to pronounce it properly.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to conclude with Senator Short's remarks about a House of review and the establishment of the Senate. The House of review lasted all of about three years until the party system was established in Australia by about 1903. After that, this place has voted not as a States House but as a party House, even more so in many ways than the House of Representatives because we all get elected on party tickets. If people do not get endorsed on the party ticket they do not get elected, unless they end up like a senator here in the previous Parliament who, by a fluke of the PR system, got 1.5 per cent of the preference vote and everyone else's preferences.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Prime Minister is genuine and wants to get rid of the Senate, then I challenge him to hold a referendum at the same time as the next election and to put the two questions together: `Do you want me to continue to be your Prime Minister?' and `Do you want a Senate?'. I challenge the Prime Minister to do that; I challenge him to put his money where his mouth is. Not only will the Prime Minister get kicked out of office, but the Australian people will want their Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We ought to look at what brought on this debate, because it is very important. There is no doubt that the previous Victorian Government tried to circumvent the Loan Council. It tried to borrow over $1 billion more than its global limit. When the National Party Government in Queensland was quite open about it and said to the Prime Minister `We want to borrow more money to increase the State's assets and so forth', it was told in 1988 that legislation would be invoked against it. It was written into the Loan Bill that any money it borrowed in excess of its global limits would be taken off its grants; that went into a Bill. No-one argued against that. In fact, I believe it received the support of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now we find that, in exactly the same circumstances, when the Labor Party Government circumvents its global limits and borrows over those limits, the Treasurer at the time does not even reprimand it&mdash;or, if he did, he did it very privately and it was never brought to the attention of this Parliament. That is what this Senate is all about. I will read into <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> something that Senator Gareth Evans said in 1982:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The job of the parliamentary committee confronting the Executive is not to become an alternative government, but rather it is to probe, enlighten, deter and squeeze to make it as difficult as possible for ministerial and administrative misbehaviour, neglect or maladministration to be pushed under the carpet and to create a political environment in which even the most thick-skinned Minister or official will feel the heat.</PARA>
<PARA>That is Senator Evans's quote. Odgers says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Senate's committee system is a major development in the strengthening of the Australian parliamentary system of Government. In particular, the committee system furthers the effectiveness of the Senate's role as a House of review.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No modern legislature can discharge its functions fully and effectively without the assistance of committees.</PARA>
<PARA>They are comments from one of the Government's leading frontbenchers, a very senior Minister, and from Odgers, who is considered an authority on Parliament. When we use that parliamentary system of committees, we are accused of getting into political stunts. There is no political stunt about this. Obviously, the Senate is going ahead with this Committee. Already on this side we have put forward our nominations for the Committee, and it is going to try to unravel why, on the one hand, in 1988 the government of the day reprimanded the National Party Government and, on the other hand, in 1992 the same Government, with the Prime Minister at the helm, condoned the abuse of going over the global limits. </PARA>

There is a considerable difference, I believe, between the `pig-swill' term about which the outrage is fulminating and the `unrepresentative' accusation that the Prime Minister has levelled at the Senate. I am very much less concerned by the abuse he has levelled against the Senate, as he is wont to do and has done on many occasions. I believe that it does not reflect on the Senate;  it reflects on the person that makes that sort of remark.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a matter of regret that our Prime Minister, the leader of the Australian Government, sees fit to allow debate in the Australian Parliament to descend to such levels. He should lead the way, as indeed should the Leader of the Opposition, to talk on issues and to debate issues such as the one million unemployed and the current tariff policy of the Government and the Opposition, which is aiding and abetting further increases in unemployment. I would like to address my remarks more to the `unrepresentative' content than the `pig-swill' which, as I said, reflects on the Prime Minister rather than on the senators in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has already been stated quite clearly by Senator Coulter that quite obviously this chamber is much more representative of electors than the House of Representatives. I shall not repeat the figures. I would rather address the consequences&mdash;what happens when, in a two-chamber situation, we do not have a second chamber that can act as a check on government, that can act as a House of review. We currently have that situation in Victoria, where Mr Kennett, of all people, now has control of both Houses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps understandably, the people of Victoria wanted to punish the previous Labor Government for some of its mismanagement. But in their haste, I believe, they have disregarded the danger that lies in handing to the executive government of the day total power over both Houses. As a result, we have the sorts of things that have happened in the first 30 days of the Kennett Government, which I believe will come back to haunt that Government and the community as a whole. They will be a salutary reminder of the position at Federal level and the need for the Senate, as a House of review, and yes, the need for the Democrats in that House of review, to actually provide a check on the executive government of the day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the record of the Kennett Government. Perhaps its latest action, although it has received relatively little publicity, is one of its most reprehensible. It strikes at the very root of development of just government in this country. I refer to the abolition of the Victorian Law Reform Commission, a body that has consistently provided substantial and valuable reports on how the law in this country, particularly in Victoria, should be reformed. I wonder whether it is a coincidence that one of the principles that were being pursued by Mr Kelly, the Chairman of the Law Reform Commission, was reform of the legal profession itself. He was pointing out that the profession, as it is currently organised, serves its own more than it serves the community. Some of the reforms that were going to be instituted, which were recommended by the Victorian Law Reform Commission, went a long way towards breaking the position of privilege that the legal profession, over the decades, has been able to wangle unto itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is more, of course. We have the notorious provisions of the Kennett Government abolishing penalty rates and leave loadings right across the board. I wish to put on record that the Democrats are prepared to concede that there may be a case in some industries, in some areas, to review penalty provisions and to review leave loadings. There may be very good reasons why some of these awards should be amended to reduce or even exclude them. In particular, I put forward the view that holiday loadings could well be abolished for people who earn incomes well above average weekly earnings. But I take strong objection, on both humanitarian and social grounds as well as on economic grounds, to abolishing leave loadings for people on average weekly earnings or below. We all know that those people are essentially on the breadline, only just making ends meet, cannot take their children on a holiday because they have still got to meet their commitments&mdash;commitments to pay mortgage interest, the school fees, or whatever else they have. They are really not in a position to take their families on holidays. I believe they should have that opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Government had said `Let's review holiday pay loadings above average weekly earnings', the Australian Democrats would have lent a sympathetic ear and looked at each case, in each award. But we find leave loadings being abolished across the whole field, across the whole range of awards. What will happen, of course, is that we will have reduced travel; we will have reduced holiday expenditure; the tourism industry in Victoria will suffer; and economic recovery will be put off by yet another year or more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me also address the industrial relations legislation in general terms, and in particular penalty rates. Again, there may well be industries&mdash;and the hospitality industry is possibly one of those&mdash;where penalty rates should be reviewed, where we should look at the effect they have not only on the people working in that particular industry but also on the economy as a whole. There may be a case to review them. </PARA>

It is simply that when both Houses of the Parliament are controlled by the one party, the people of that State or the people who are governed by that government are in grave danger of not having proper review.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. I shall develop the point a little further. We do see, of course, the actions of the Kennett Government. Quite appallingly, combined with all the cuts it is visiting upon people who are on low wages&mdash;people who are struggling to make ends meet&mdash;it has seen fit to increase ministerial salaries by amounts ranging from $8,000 to $21,000. I am not sure about the latter figure, but it does not matter. The very action&mdash;the very arrogance, the disregard for the social well-being of the community it is now charged to represent&mdash;of voting that for themselves within days of coming into government is absolutely breathtaking in its arrogance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that that too will be visited on that Government, as I suspect it will on the Opposition, which is trying to put itself into the same position as Mr Kennett is in now in Victoria. We have on record, in a very informed article by Mr David O'Reilly in a recent issue of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS>, stated quite clearly and documented, that it is the aim of Dr Hewson to obtain control of both Houses. Clearly, he would love to be in the position Mr Kennett is in now. I suspect that, even if Dr Hewson manages to get into government, he will still, unfortunately, have to face a Senate where the position of the Australian Democrats will be confirmed by the electorate at the next election. I am sure that people in the community, when they look at how they are going to vote and how they may differentiate in their vote between the lower House and the Senate, will look at who will be able to make sure that they will not be subjected to a 15 per cent consumption tax on everything they buy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite clear that the Australian Labor Party, if it is not in government, will not have sufficient numbers to make sure that the Senate stops that sort of regressive tax, which will hit poor people more than anyone else. So it will have to be the Democrats. It is quite clear that people in the community will have to decide, if they want to make sure that they are not going to be subjected to that additional tax or that additional load at a time of recession, when they are struggling to make ends meet, that the Australian Democrats should retain their position of holding the balance of power in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In closing, I would like to advert briefly to some of the similarities between the program Mr Kennett is initiating in Victoria at the moment and the Fightback package that Dr Hewson has elevated to the status of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bible</EMPHASIS> in his bid for total control over both Houses of Parliament. Since we were talking before about access to the legal system and about the abolition of the Victorian Law Reform Commission, which I believe is a barbaric act, let me refer briefly to one or two of the points that are on public record in Fightback as to how the Opposition is going to pay for some of the goodies, or the abolition of some taxes, which it holds out for Australian industry generally and which, I submit, are not going to go anywhere near making us a more competitive nation in world trade terms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things the Opposition is saying it will abolish or reduce is legal aid. Legal aid, which provides for people who cannot normally afford to pay the exorbitant fees that many of our lawyers charge, is going to be reduced by $10m. We now have a situation where some 50 per cent of applications for legal aid are rejected&mdash;some of those for relevance but most because funds are inadequate. The criteria being used have been progressively tightened. What we have in Fightback is a further reduction of $10m. Where are we going? Are we going to reject 60 per cent or 70 per cent of applications for legal aid? Are we going to leave people unrepresented?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not where it stops. If Fightback is ever implemented, we will be coming into a regime where greed will be elevated to the new religion. It will be the new incentive to work. It is quite clear that, when you set people against each other, when you have a community where people fight against each other, you increase family breakdown and you increase crime. Only last year we heard that our prison population had risen by 10 per cent due to the recession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now hear that the Opposition parties do not wish to know what sort of consequences their policies would engender, so they suggest we abolish the Institute of Criminology. We do not want to hear what the causes of crime and the rising crime rates in our country are. We do not want to examine what we should do; we just get rid of things. We close our eyes and ears. In the same way, the Opposition parties voted against my attempt to establish a Senate inquiry into tariffs and industry development. They said that people did not want to hear what sorts of effects the tariff regime&mdash;down to zero tariff, according to Dr Hewson&mdash;would have on our community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not where it ends. Foreign aid is going to be reduced over two years by $209m. I thought this was a reasonably civilised nation. I thought that, despite the recession, it was also a nation that was reasonably well off. Certainly it is compared with Somalia and other nations on the African continent and in other parts of the world where children are starving. I want to put on record that the Opposition's wish to reduce foreign aid by $209m is an act of sheer barbarism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not where it ends either. In Medicare we will have reductions in rebates and tightening up of bulkbilling of $213m.

Why do they not say that? The Senate has not been degraded. Words may have been used such as `insulted' or a `reflection upon it' but the Senate has not been degraded. It still has as much capacity, as much strength, as it had yesterday; it is still as powerful; it still has as much respect in the community as it had before. Simply to say that it has been degraded is nonsense. What might have been said is perhaps that the Prime Minister should not have used the word, perhaps that he has `reflected upon' the Senate, perhaps that he has `insulted' the Senate, but how has he `degraded' it?

But&mdash;this is the point&mdash;in the Senate, again and again we have allowed a course of conduct to occur where there have been disruptions, challenges to the Chair and most abusive language across the chamber. We have allowed that conduct to continue; we have allowed that conduct to progress.

In any event, even if we do that, why do we allow this chamber to be disrupted again and again, abused again and again?

Indeed, if one chose, one would see that the learned writings from 1901 remain constant, are the definitive work on our Constitution and, indeed, were endorsed by Professor Geoffrey Sawyer as late as 1976. I think some of the quotes from Quick and Garran are very relevant to just how representative and how important the Senate is in our system of government, our system of constitutional democracy. I read from page 414 of Quick and Garran, the section dealing with the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Senate is one of the most conspicuous, and unquestionably the most important, of all the federal features of the Constitution, using the word federal in the sense of linking together and uniting a number of co-equal political communities under a common system of government.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the Senate is fundamental and integral to our system of government, which in turn has given us an unprecedented set of liberties and of protections for individual rights and which, quite frankly, makes us the oldest constitutional democracy in the world, when one counts universal suffrage and the participation of women. I am pretty proud of that. That makes Australia a pacesetter. We do not have to copy anybody. We led the way. Again, I will read from Quick and Garran:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The senators for a State are to be chosen by those of `The People of the State possessed of the qualifications prescribed. . . This provision marks a great advance in a democratic direction.</PARA>
<PARA>Then it goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The principle of popular election, on which the Senate of the Commonwealth is founded, is more in harmony with the progressive instincts and tendencies of the times than those according to which the Senate of the United States and the Senate of Canada are called into existence. In the Convention which drafted the Constitution of the Commonwealth not a single member was found in favour of a nominated Senate.</PARA>
<PARA>Right from the beginning, our founding fathers said that we were to be elected by and responsible to the people. We were at the cutting edge of making democracy more responsible. Indeed, in the judgment that came down in the ad bans legislation case the other day, when this Government in power tried to curtail the freedom of speech, the High Court said that representative and responsible government was, in fact, enshrined in our Constitution and our freedoms could not be taken away. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this chamber, in this House, we have on many occasions protected those freedoms. It was this chamber that stopped the Australia Card coming into existence. It is in this chamber that we scrutinise and make sure that there is no cosying up between Executive and bureaucracy such as we have seen occur in Western Australia. In that report brought down by the Western Australian commissioners into Western Australia Inc. we have seen them say that it only occurred because there was not sufficient scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our founding fathers said about this chamber that we were to have powers, we were to be based on a House that was to be powerful and we were to exercise those powers in a responsible way. But because we were to be representative of the people, that means that those powers we carry out are in fact for and on behalf of the people. Unrepresentative, Mr Prime Minister? I think not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the Prime Minister could well find that his appreciation of Australian nationhood, the Australian identity and the symbols of the Australian people would be understood by him if he perhaps undertook a course in study of this great Australian nation. Who else but an ill-informed man, a man who had not bothered to inform himself, would denigrate our Parliament in the way he has done? Who else would go to a foreign land and denigrate our flag? Who else would say, as he did the other day, that he had to lie to the Australian people by omitting the financial particulars of the State of Victoria's borrowings because otherwise he would upset the markets?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will refer now to a couple of points that were made earlier in the day by Senator Coulter. He said that he felt we should have reference in our motion to the fact that no single political party could have a majority within the Senate. I find those words are difficult to accede to for the following reason. Very simply, that would be circumscribing the right of the Australian people to elect whom they will. If the Australian people decide that they wish to elect senators who form a majority of one party, that is the will of the people. There is no way in the world that I could ever countenance a restriction on the will of the people to elect whom they will. I think that some of Senator Coulter's earlier remarks were intending to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will go back to Quick and Garran and go back to that point about `unrepresentative'. I think I have shown that our founding fathers very strongly set out to make sure that this chamber was truly representative of the people and was elected directly by the people, and that not one voice dissented from the concept that it should be truly democratically elected. Quick and Garran talks about the functions of this House. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As we have already seen, the functions of the Senate are of a double kind: first as a chamber of revision and review in matters of general legislation; and, secondly, as a chamber to represent the particular views, opinions, and interests of the States, in matters admittedly within the sphere of the federal authority but respecting which differences might arise, as well as for the purpose of resisting proposals not within the sphere of the federal authority. For the purpose of exercising powers such as these it was contended, with unanswerable force, that the Senate of the Commonwealth could and should be chosen by the process of popular election, and that there was no occasion to vest the choice in the State legislatures.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, our founding fathers said that, if we were truly to exercise the powers that were to be given to us in our Constitution, adopted by the people of Australia, we must be elected by the people of this country&mdash;by popular election. They are truly the foundations of democracy. I would say to the Prime Minister: is that unrepresentative? I would again ask him to reflect upon the history and the facts of the way our system of governance is put together. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at the sorts of issues we might discuss with regard to the States' particular concerns, we find that a very good example will be coming up soon. That is the way in which the Medicare money is to be paid to various State governments and the abuse of section 96 to contrive a socialisation of medicine in the way the current policy is desirous of doing. In other words, it is penalising States that have a larger percentage of self-insured people, to the benefit of those States that do not. It is attempting to reward States that encourage people not to self-insure. This is truly an abuse of the system. It is a question we will debate in this chamber because it is relevant to the quality, equal opportunity and rights of the people of New South Wales, in the case of my State, to have their voice heard, to be truly treated fairly by the Federal Government and not to have an abuse of the section 96 powers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Prime Minister decided that he could with impunity debase and degrade his own office by his own behaviour and, as well, try to bring into disrepute this institution of the Senate, all Australians should truly have been affronted. It is only our system of governance, it is only our respect for our institutions, that at the end of the day ensure that we remain a free nation. We have seen many examples of totalitarian states which purport to have a constitution but which give the people no freedom at all. It is the institutions that hold up and protect that precious commodity of democratic freedom. So, when we say that we are today censuring the Prime Minister for his behaviour, it is because we are upholding not only our Constitution but also the institutions that make it valid and that protect the rights of the people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a sad and sorry day when we see that we have a Prime Minister who is unable to appreciate the preciousness, the worth and the value of our having spent nearly 100 years exercising that freedom and making our laws in accordance with that. I will conclude with the words of Sir Henry Parkes, speaking in the Convention debates:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What I mean is an upper chamber, call it what you may, which shall have within itself the only conservatism possible in a democracy&mdash;the conservatism of maturity of judgment, of distinction of service, of length of experience, and weight of character&mdash;which are the only qualities we can expect to collect and bring into one body in a community young and inexperienced as Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>Young and inexperienced we may well have been then, but Sir Henry Parkes gave us a fine tradition to live up to, and I for one cannot bear the thought that we have a Prime Minister who wishes to bring it into disrepute. </PARA>

It is my understanding that the Senate wishes to continue with this, at least for some time, and that there will be no determination of the issue during the period 1 o'clock to 2 o'clock. </PARA>

Of course, what the Senate is used for by the Opposition is a forum for absolutely baseless smear and innuendo. It is done in the quest for power of the Opposition. There are a couple of senators in this chamber who have become expert at it. In Senator Bishop's case, she probably takes the cake.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is this chamber, and the committees of this chamber, that have been used for the shameless and baseless attack on Mr Boucher, without any opportunity at all for him to respond. It is typical of the sorts of attacks that have been launched by Opposition senators using this chamber as the vehicle. Of course, when there is any questioning at all&mdash;the slightest question&mdash;about the probity of those inquisitors, they run for cover. But there is no similar sensitivity to the rights of the defenceless public servants who come before committees, those who do not have the opportunity to protect their good names. That is what the Senate is all about and that is why, I assume, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has attacked the way this chamber operates. Of course, the processes of the Senate end up in a log-jam such as we have had this morning. This will be used as an excuse later in the year when the Government tries to see some of its legislative program enacted. There will be no suggestion at all that these sorts of techniques and this sort of strategy on the part of the Opposition will be responsible when the Government needs to get some of its legislative program through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the Prime Minister has said about the unrepresentativeness of this Senate is true. It is categorically true. If one looks at the number of electors in each State represented by 12 senators in this chamber, the State that I represent, New South Wales, has 3,837,326 enrolled electors represented by 12 senators. In the State of Tasmania&mdash;I will use your State, given that you are in the chair, Mr Acting Deputy President&mdash;there are 317,168 enrolled electors represented by 12 senators. The quota for the half-Senate election in 1990 in New South Wales was 476,878. In Tasmania it was 41,614. So your vote, Mr Acting Deputy President, was 12 times more valuable than my vote as an elector enrolled in New South Wales. If that is not unrepresentative I do not know what is. It is proof positive that this chamber is unrepresentative. I am not ashamed to say that I support the principle of one vote one value and that this chamber is totally unrepresentative. I would support any reforms to this chamber to see a more representative parliament established. I am more than happy to give my support to any member of the Government or the Prime Minister if that is their desire. </PARA>

Because he is aware that the Senate, in its legitimate role under the Constitution, has the ability to inquire into the loans affair and to inquire into why the Budget did not cite the correct figures as to how much this country is in debt, he lost his temper.

So this Senate is certainly a House of review and this is not a one-off occasion; it happens all the time.

No, it is not in its written document; Senator Evans said that they must get it out of that because it was not popular, but they would work from within and white-ant it.

We do, from time to time, behave like swine. We have, in the very recent past&mdash;and it is not, I might add, the first occasion&mdash;taken advantage of the very privileged position that we, as senators, are given by the people in our respective States and Territories. We have used and abused the privileges given to us in this place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An instance of that abuse occurred on the recent occasion when Mr Boucher was attacked by smear, by innuendo, by slander and by vilification in a chamber where he did not have the right to stand and counter the accusations and innuendo that were being directed at him. Some months previous to that, we saw one of the Australian ambassadors, Mr Butler, being attacked in the same disgraceful manner&mdash;a disgraceful manner it was indeed. That individual, that high ranking official of the Australian Government serving overseas, was not in a position to defend himself because we were taking advantage of the privilege of the position that we are given. </PARA>

But I do re-emphasise the point that from time to time we all can learn from the words of our opponents. Whilst we might fight in this place, nonetheless some sense came from the other side of the chamber. There has been quite a deal of nonsense and quite a deal of hypocrisy as well. It has been mentioned that the Labor Party is about abolishing the Senate. That particular policy was removed from the Labor Party platform quite some years ago. I had some support for that position, and from time to time, particularly when I am waiting in airports, I might still support that position. But usually one does not make comments like that until one is in one's last term in this place&mdash;and I do not believe that I am in that position as yet. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Ray is listening to me; I am glad he is. It is worth noting, though, how overgoverned this nation is. How many politicians have we got representing people? When one counts the number of people elected to serve in the national Parliament, and counts up all those people elected to serve in State parliaments&mdash;and we have one in each State and one in each Territory, most with upper Houses&mdash;and then add local government on top of that, is it any wonder the people of Australia do not have a high opinion of politicians? There are far too many of us. If there is something that parliaments of Australia could do now in getting together, it is to reduce the number of politicians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also heard, in short snippets of earlier contributions to this debate, mention of factions. I discovered in a newspaper today that there is yet another new faction in Australia. There are factions in the Labor Party, as Senator Kemp would know, because he watches them very closely, but we have found another one coming from Senator Kemp's State. The new faction in Senator Kemp's State is actually an Opposition faction. It was in the newspaper this morning, and it is called the trough faction. It does relate to the debate that we are talking about, because swill is pig food. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me get back to the substance of the motion, which relates to what the Prime Minister said yesterday. What the Prime Minister was trying to do was to shoot the messenger before the inquiry had been held. He wanted to denigrate the committee that has been appointed by the Senate to investigate the loans scandal, and he did it in a number of ways: firstly, by continuing to use what I would term unacceptable language; and, secondly, by his statement that he was not going to let the Treasurer of this country, John Dawkins, appear before the committee. That poses a couple of very important questions. First of all, is Mr Dawkins not big enough to stand up for himself and put his own case as to whether he appears or not? Secondly, in view of the position the Prime Minister has taken on this, what is he trying to hide? If there is nothing there, it is in the Prime Minister's interests to clear it up. It is in the interests of everybody to clear it up. But the position he adopted first of all was to say, `My little boy, Mr John Dawkins, will not appear'; and, secondly, he tried to denigrate the committee before it had even started its work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the process, he attacked the institution of this chamber. As I have said in this place before, I am a very strong supporter of this chamber. One must refer back to Federation. Without the Senate there would be no Federation of Australia. It would never have been formed. If State representation were changed along the lines suggested by Senator Faulkner, I suggest that that would be the end of the Federation of Australia. It would not hold together. The role the Senate plays is a very important aspect of having a federation or a nation of Australia. Of course, it would suit the Prime Minister not to have it. He comes from New South Wales. He is linked to the Right of the Labor Party in New South Wales. He would love to be in the dictatorial position to attack the States that have smaller populations, and he would do it. There is no question in my mind about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My State, Western Australia, has about 10 per cent of the population of Australia, yet it produces 25 per cent of this country's total primary product exports. Of course, that is what his attack is all about in the medium and longer term. In the short term it is about denigrating the structure this institution has put in place&mdash;a committee to examine precisely and exactly what has occurred and to get accurate evidence on the record of what has occurred in the blow-out of the Victorian loans affair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the Prime Minister has done is very consistent with what he has done in a number of other cases when he has been under pressure, when he has had a bad week or when he has had a bad time. I want to refer to a couple of those here, just to show that it is very consistent behaviour when he says these things off the top of his head, before he has his brain in gear. He should be brought to account for them. In this case, the Senate is in a position publicly to bring him to account through a censure motion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first thing I want to refer to is the announcement of the sale of Qantas. That is a very good example of how the Prime Minister acts off the cuff. He announced the sale of that on a Saturday after he had a very bad week in Parliament. It is interesting to note in terms of that announcement that half, if not more, of what he was selling was leased planes anyhow. Unfortunately, I have not had the time to get the precise figures on that. The other example in more recent times is the pay TV issue. Once again the Government had a particular position. The Prime Minister was going bad so he changed the agenda. He suddenly announced, off the top of his head, a totally different position. The Government has been on a bicycle going backwards ever since. This type of behaviour is very typical. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are pages and pages of the type of language that this Prime Minister uses. I have said in this place before and I will say again that this Prime Minister has presided in his 10 years over the worst slide into unemployment this nation has seen, the worst slide into underemployment that this nation has seen, the worst situation we have had in this nation as far as bankruptcies are concerned. It was reported today in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> that there were 324,700 married couples where either one or both partners were out of work&mdash;a 20 per cent increase on the previous year. The number of long term unemployed rose, from September 1991, from 219,300 to 326,300. As I have mentioned, this is the Prime Minister who has presided over the worst situation we have had in terms of underemployment. Further, once again under this Prime Minister and former Treasurer, in the last financial year we have seen bankruptcies increase another 25 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On top of that, one can say that there is no doubt that with this Prime Minister we have seen the introduction of the worst and foulest language that has ever come into the Parliament of Australia since it was formed, back in 1901. Those are the legacies that this Prime Minister is leaving this country. He has done it; it is not anybody else who has done it. It is interesting to note that the so-called defence by people who sit on the other side of this place has not been a defence of the Prime Minister. They have gone off at all sorts of tangents and tried to blame everybody else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just want to quote a few of these things so as to highlight the approach of the Prime Minister. I think it was Senator Schacht who said that we should not be whingers. He said words to the effect that he was not a whinger and he did not believe that the Prime Minister was a whinger. Let us have a look at this. Back on 26 May 1983 the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Deputy Speaker, can I get some protection from the drones on the back benches?</PARA>
<PARA>Let us look again:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Deputy Speaker, am I continually to be abused by the honourable member for Mitchell and the drone beside him, the honourable member for Braddon?</PARA>
<PARA>This Prime Minister who can dish it out can also whinge. We can go through pages and pages of it:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the honourable member to be a liar . . . the brain damaged Deputy Leader of the Opposition . . . the champion liar of 1982-83. </PARA>
<PARA>On 6 December 1983:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . in the middle of his vile insinuations.</PARA>
<PARA>We have also:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He lied his way out of that too.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on and on and on. He said on another occasion:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . sit with a criminal intellect . . . The honourable member is a half-baked crim . . . </PARA>
<PARA>On 5 March 1984 he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I will be ripping her to shreds . . . She can go and shoot her big mouth off . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is the Prime Minister we have of this country and the way that he has denigrated the institution of Parliament by the language that he uses. Once again, on 28 March 1984, we see:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Speaker, can I have some protection from the clowns on the front bench opposite?</PARA>
<PARA>This Prime Minister dishes it out and then, we are told, he does not whinge. He whinges and he whinges and he whinges, and he does these things under the protection of Parliament. Here is another quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are not interested in the views of painted, perfumed gigolos.</PARA>
<PARA>Then again:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They are cheats. As well as being incompetent, they are cheats.</PARA>
<PARA>One can go on and on. This is not the first time he has used the word `swill'. On 12 November 1985 he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A swill, a pigsty, and that was the limit of their capacity.</PARA>
<PARA>There are pages and pages of such quotes, but I want to conclude my remarks in this way: the Prime Minister does deserve to be censured for the denigration of this chamber and the institution. He also needs to be brought to account as to why he would want to say that the Treasurer himself is not capable of determining whether he appears before the Committee. In fact, if the Prime Minister really wished to clear up this particular situation which exists in Victoria, where there certainly appears on the surface to be a conspiracy to keep the accurate figures in terms of the Budget from the Australian people, and if he had nothing to hide, not only would he see that the Treasurer appeared before the particular Senate Committee but, I suggest, he would also be prepared to go before it himself and clear the matter up and get the accurate record put down in the public arena. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Very rarely have any of those in the Opposition here concentrated on the actual issue. Neither have some of the Democrats. Senator Spindler went off on his tariff debate. Senator Crane went off on the Qantas debate. They are all off on some favourite subject so that they can all get on the record. But really this is about the egos of the people in this chamber and their being hurt by a remark from the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What a bunch of pathetic wimps we are looking at! The Prime Minister can make one remark and everyone over there spits the dummy and gets upset. Some of them were shaking with rage yesterday. Boy, it must be easy to needle them. One of the reasons why they were shaking with rage is that this is basically no longer an adversarial chamber and those in the Opposition really have to confront difficult debates. Because of the anarchistic swamp in terms of legislation of this chamber, they generally do not get contested in debates because all on our side have to pull off so that we can get the legislation through. So whenever an adversarial situation comes up, what do those opposite do? They try to amend the Standing Orders to circumvent Question Time because they cannot stand the heat. They get up on spurious points of order time and time again because they cannot stand the heat of debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have listened to some very pious pieces of repetition today. They have all been trundled out. We even had Sir Henry Parkes, that old conservative, trundled out here today. It is the same old theme that we in the Labor Party have been listening to for 92 years; that is, that the Australian people cannot be trusted to elect a government and a conservative institution is needed as a brake on it. It was almost a wistful reference to the House of Lords from Senator Walters here today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have heard the same garbage, that this is a States House. Rubbish! It has not been a States House for 89 years. We have heard the argument that this is a House of review and a good thing. Rubbish! Those views are not held by those in opposition; they may be held by the Democrats and the minority groups here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have heard a view from Senator Faulkner that is not far wrong, that this has become a house of assassins where smear is just a by-word in the activities of senators. But I say it is none of those things: what this House has become is a house of total political opportunism. At least we on this side are willing to state where we are coming from in our approach to politics; it is a day-to-day issue based thing and occasionally we take a stance for political advantage. All one hears from the other side is total humbug where its members use ideological and policy proposals for their own personal aggrandisement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The interesting thing, of course, is that we have heard here how important it is that this is a House of review, yet Dr Hewson, a potential Prime Minister, has on several occasions stressed just how important it is for the coalition to win a majority in this place. Why is that? It is because the coalition does not want to be part of the sort of guerilla warfare tactics of delay and frustration that it has used against this Government. We have seen this hypocrisy every time the guillotine comes up here, when the same people who voted for it year in, year out under a Liberal Party majority now come in and oppose it on the principle that they will never do it. I put the challenge to the Opposition members last time a guillotine motion was moved that they should come around to my office and sign up to say that they would never, ever vote for it in a future coalition government. It must be hard to find my office because not one of them came around to sign up. So we all know that if they win government they will be moving a guillotine when the situation gets desperate on the legislative program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it is even more interesting to look at these proposals when one looks at Victoria. Is there any suggestion from the Kennett Government that it does not want a majority in the upper House? When proposals were put by the Labor Government to introduce proportional representation&mdash;the very system esteemed and espoused by honourable senators opposite, and they say it is a wonderful system&mdash;did they vote for it in Victoria? No. They used their upper House majority to knock over that particular legislation. So when they come in here and spout about proportional representation and houses of review, it is nothing more than smarmy hypocrisy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an interesting sidelight on that. I have sat in this chamber and listened to debates on legislation including retrospectivity. I have not only been told that it was politically wrong; I have been told by people on that side of politics that it is immoral. What about Mr Jeffrey Kennett's retrospective legislation abolishing holiday leave loadings? What about his retrospective legislation knocking off workers compensation cases going to the courts? Once they get a majority, not only does their political position change, but so do their morals. It is okay for retrospective legislation in Victoria; it is not okay for those who sit on the Opposition benches. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have also heard the usual quota of hypocrisy today about how people on the Liberal Party or coalition side have some sort of free will in this chamber. That has got to be the greatest joke in history. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How representative is this chamber? One thing that can be said about proportional representation is that it is an excellent way of distributing representation and an appalling way of distributing power. Senator Faulkner has been through the figures. This is not the most representative chamber we could have in this country by a variety of means of electoral process, and I think the Prime Minister is quite right when he describes this chamber as unrepresentative. Where one has to make the judgment is in how much more representative it could be, or indeed how much more unrepresentative it could be. That is the difficulty of judgment. But there is no need to censure the Prime Minister on his view of that. We are unrepresentative. It takes twelve times as many votes to elect a senator in New South Wales as it does for one in Tasmania and so on. So this is not necessarily a representative House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the actual issue that sparked all this off, about whether House of Representatives Ministers should be compelled to attend Senate committee hearings, in the end there will be no difference in that between a Labor government and a coalition government. Neither would contemplate it, nor should they. They are responsible to their house, as Senate Ministers are responsible to this House. There should be no obligation on a House, even though it does not have a majority of one party or another, is prone to political opportunism and is prone to setting up witch-hunts&mdash;one has only to look at the Murphy case for that&mdash;to say that a Minister could be compelled to attend. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a few other curious aspects about this which I might mention in conclusion. Firstly, there was the Reith press release that announced the three Liberal Party members to serve on this committee. It was apparently not chosen by the party room or anyone else. The shadow Treasurer has determined who the Senate representatives are. Of course, the committee was set up to have two coalition members and one National Party member. They have obviously been through the National Party ranks and have not found anyone with the talent or the application to be able to serve. So we now get the big cover-up from Senator Boswell. The Leader of the National Party, without the ability to have a front bench portfolio, without the ability to be trusted with any portfolio, actually signed a joint letter with Senator Hill to say who the three representatives are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We want to know who the National Party representative on the committee is. Is it Senator Short, is it Senator Alston or is it Senator Bishop? Which one will be the National Party representative on the joint Senate ticket in the next election? Who is the hidden rural hick amongst these three? Who, in fact, is the secret National Party supporter that Senator Boswell has nominated? To cover that up we get a joint letter, so we will never know. Maybe Senator Hill can inform us later on which is which. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude on this point. When people talk about the value of Senate committees, I say, `The jury is out'. Over the time I have been in it, the Senate has had some excellent committees. It has had a majority of good committees. I am a strong supporter, on the public record, of the Estimates committee process and of the standing committee process. But it is not perfect. We have so many committees in the Senate these days that the reports are being written less and less by senators, attendance is becoming poorer and poorer, and in some cases we are not even now in the position where it is the committee's secretary that writes the draft report. More and more there is a demand for consultants, especially in some of the joint committees, to come in and actually write the committee's reports. We are moving more to the American system than we should. The true value of Senate committees is when the senators themselves take the responsibility for the questioning, the writing of the report and the recommendations in the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before we get on our high horse too much about our pride in the Senate committee system, it should be recognised that by no means are the committees perfect and by no means can they not be improved. The one particular point of disgrace for this chamber is the use of the committees for character assassination. The question of Mr Boucher has been raised.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, I just heard an interesting speech from Senator Ray but it did not seem to be a defence of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). As a matter of interest, it did not seem to address the censure motion at all. It certainly was taken as an opportunity to get a few things off his chest in relation to Opposition senators on Senate committees but it did not seek to defend the Prime Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think what we have witnessed today in the debate is a clear difference across the chamber as to what is the appropriate standard of behaviour and conduct of a Prime Minister, a very different attitude between the parties as to the importance of the institution and the importance of behaving in a way in which the Australian people can have some pride, both in the office of Prime Minister by the Prime Minister's personal behaviour and in the institution of Parliament by the way in which we behave in the Parliament. When the Prime Minister abuses those positions of trust in the contemptuous way in which he did yesterday, it is appropriate, whether Senator Ray likes it or not, that the Senate censure him for doing so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Censure motions in the Senate are rare. The last  one  was  in  relation to Senator Richardson, which was carried. I cannot even remember the one before that. Certainly, in the other place, there are quite a lot. I can remember a censure motion in relation to Senator Tate a couple of years ago. Senator Ray should go back and check the records: censures in the Senate are relatively rare. They are rare from my perspective because censures are, in effect, the highest sanction that we have, and therefore we should not debase the currency. We should only censure when circumstances demand that it be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Prime Minister, under the protection of the other place, refers to senators, to the Senate, as `unrepresentative swill', unrepresentative pig food, in effect, then that is an appalling standard that requires response from this chamber; and it requires it in the proper way that is open to us, and that is censure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the motion to the Senate. I regret that really the Government offered no defence. What I would have liked its members to do, in effect, is come in and apologise for the conduct of their Prime Minister, but they were obviously not prepared to do that. I think that is disappointing, but I hope that the Senate will now record its censure of the Prime Minister and at least demonstrate to the Australian people that a majority in this place regard such conduct of an Australian Prime Minister as unsatisfactory. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to draw to the attention of the Senate the ridiculous actions by Mr Bob Brown, the Minister for Land Transport, over the F3 freeway which only served to highlight the embarrassment he must be feeling over his very curious handling of this issue. I would like to briefly remind honourable senators of the story of the F3 freeway, which heads north from Sydney and is supposed to form part of the national highway and link into the New England and the Pacific highways near Beresfield.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, the F3, which is 150 kilometres long, stops in the middle of a swamp eight kilometres short of its intended intersection. Instead of the dual carriageway of the northbound F3 connecting with the dual carriageway of the other northern highways, the plan at present is to feed the F3 into a single-lane road in a residential area called Lenaghans Drive. This means that the northbound traffic out of Sydney will be caught in a bottleneck as the freeway becomes a residential street with traffic lights and intersections. It also means that the safety of residents is endangered as traffic volumes increase dramatically; and this is in spite of Mr Brown's national road safety strategy, which he recently announced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Surely, running a dual carriageway into a residential single-lane road is creating a traffic nightmare, not a case of avoiding new traffic problems. It makes the whole intent of the Minister's road safety strategy a bit of a joke, certainly in the case of what is happening with the road system west of Newcastle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What makes it even more ridiculous is that the authorities already have figures that suggest that the current increase in traffic down Lenaghans Drive means that traffic volumes are already sufficient to warrant a dual carriageway. This is before the extensions of the F3 are fed into Lenaghans Drive, with the associated massive increase in traffic volume from that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This ridiculous plan led to a residents delegation from the Lenaghans Drive area coming to see me about what could be done. I immediately took up the matter, and I have tried to move Minister Brown out of first gear because of the urgent need to have completed a proper plan and timetable for the completion of the F3. I have made several speeches in this place on this matter of getting this freeway finished as quickly as possible. I have also issued several press releases on the issue and have had local television come out with me to see exactly the nature of the problem created by finishing an expressway in the middle of a swamp. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given all the actions on the F3, honourable senators can imagine my surprise when I read for the first time in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Newcastle Herald</EMPHASIS> two weeks ago that the Minister for Land Transport had invited all local parliamentarians from the Newcastle region to inspect the new extensions of the freeway. He was running a bus tour along it. I asked my staff where my invitation was. I had not received an invitation. When I contacted the Minister's office to point this out, I was told that I could not be offered an invitation because, if he invited me, he would have to invite all the other 11 New South Wales senators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, I am the only senator from the northern region and certainly the only one that has taken a keen interest in this F3 debacle. So the Minister's excuse was really rather pathetic. Given the snub, I then attempted to find out when and where the bus tour was to be held. Again, I was consistently denied this information from the Minister's office. But I managed finally to find out when and from where the bus was leaving. I went to the city hall to board the bus to have a look at the new extensions to the freeway which the Minister was so proudly displaying, despite the fact that it ends in a swamp and feeds into a residential area. However, the Minister decided to physically bar me from entering the bus, the passengers of which were all members of the ALP. Instead, he offered me a separate tour of the F3. I pointed out that this was a bit of a waste of money seeing there were 15 spare seats on the bus, but to no avail. The Minister would not relent. He stood in the doorway of the bus and drew himself up to his full height of five feet, and really looked like a Senator Button when he is very angry. He prevented me from actually boarding the bus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe I had every right to join in with Mr Brown's bus tour as a representative of the people of New South Wales, particularly to ensure that the $700m that has been spent on the F3 freeway&mdash;and it is Federal money&mdash;was spent properly. Mr Brown prevented this, I believe, because he was ashamed of the disgraceful situation where this freeway now ends in the middle of a swamp. The money that is spent on the F3 freeway is poorly spent unless it connects properly into the New England and Pacific Highways as part of the national roads system. Mr Brown should act immediately to ensure that the F3 is completed properly by avoiding Lenaghans Drive and joining the F3 directly into the other highways. This will avoid the safety hazard to residents that has been created, and will ensure that the transport links between Sydney and Brisbane are as efficient and as safe as possible. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The time remaining is not really enough for me to develop the topic that I wish to address. However, I shall take as much time as I possibly can. During the adjournment yesterday, Senator Kemp queried the status of the independent parliamentary inquiry into tariffs and industry development which I have initiated. This followed my tabling of the interim reports covering the first three public hearings that were carried out by the inquiry. I was grateful to the Senate for giving me leave to table those reports. Before I go further in my remarks, the queries raised by Senator Kemp addressed the origin of the inquiry and the status of the inquiry. In my tabling statement I addressed the history and the way in which the inquiry was established. I therefore seek the Senate's leave to table my tabling statement so that those facts can be on record.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0X4">Senator SPINDLER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. I think it is important, in view of the remarks made by Senator Kemp, to go back to the origin of the inquiry. Senator Kemp actually queried whether it was, in fact, a parliamentary inquiry and why it was necessary. I wish to put on record that the beginning of that inquiry actually occurred because I attempted to move a motion establishing a Senate inquiry into tariffs and industry development. The Opposition&mdash;Senator Kemp and his colleagues&mdash;supported the Government in rejecting it. In fact, the Opposition was very quick to reject it. It simply did not want to know about the damage that was being done in the community. So I decided it was important to have that inquiry anyway.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am well aware, as Senator Kemp pointed out, that as a result this inquiry has no formal status. But the only legal consequence is that I am not able to offer parliamentary privilege to witnesses appearing for the inquiry. When I was in utter frustration after the rejection of my motion, which sought to put on record over time the consequences of the current policy, of a rigid and inexorable step by step tariff reduction program, I went to the Clerk of the Senate, Mr Harry Evans, and I put to him whether, as a parliamentarian, I was entitled to establish such an inquiry and specifically whether I was entitled to use my normal parliamentary entitlements in terms of staff, communication facilities, premises and so on for such an inquiry. I was advised by the Clerk of the Senate that this was indeed so and that for a senator to inquire into an issue of public interest, such as this one no doubt was, was indeed part of the responsibility of a parliamentarian. Therefore, it is quite clear that this inquiry is, indeed, a parliamentary inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Kemp also raised the problem that some of the people appearing before us, or some of the people reading the report, might mistake the inquiry for a parliamentary inquiry that had been initiated by a resolution. So I am taking the precaution of advising, at the beginning of each public hearing, all those present, as well as people who have sought to give evidence, that this is an inquiry that was initiated as a result of the failure of the Opposition and the Government to support such an inquiry being established by the Senate. I can assure Senator Kemp that, in one sense, it pleases me that I can put on record the frustration that I feel, the failure on the part of the two major parties and the total lack of responsibility displayed by Senator Kemp towards his electorate in refusing people a forum in which they can put these matters on record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Addressing now the consequences of this action, it is rather sad that an inquiry of this nature must be carried out as I am doing. I believe it is a matter of great importance, looking at the continuing rise in unemployment that this community is facing. According to the evidence before the inquiry, as a direct result of reductions in tariffs, despite some of the figures that Senator Button, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, tabled yesterday, the message is coming through loud and clear. I think it is a great pity that Senator Kemp and his colleagues simply did not want to know what the consequences of their actions were. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am asked whether I intend to adopt a similar employment policy to that of the Opposition&mdash;or that policy as it is interpreted from time to time by the shadow spokesman on industrial relations, Mr Howard. There are a number of reasons why one would not adopt that policy. The first reason, of course, is that the Opposition is as confused about what the policy means as is the Australian electorate to whom it is directed. There is no consistency at all between what it actually says in the black letter of the policy and what Mr Howard says from time to time in his press releases trying to interpret it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Coming back to the question that I am asked, the actual policy that is being referred to says in the relevant part, `not less than the base hourly minimum rate'. What I have constantly complained about in this debate is that what is said of the policy is not consistent with what the policy itself says. There is misrepresentation about that. Indeed, Mr Howard in his press release today said, `the minimum hourly rate for the full adult employee'. What he declined to do was actually quote his own policy accurately. He did not include the word `base'. So, in his press release today, he has tried to reinterpret his policy.

Has the Minister's attention been drawn to the revelation that international banks have voted Australia as having the world's worst current account deficit prospects and that the shocking September balance of payments deficit of $1.5 billion was just a taste of things to come? In the light of this report and the current account deficit blow-out, will the Government have to slow the economy down again, thereby ruling out any reduction in unemployment, which now stands at an appalling 10.8 per cent and means that a million Australians are out of work?</PARA></TALK.START>

It fell from 4.1 per cent of GDP in 1990-91 to 3.1 per cent of GDP in 1991-92. Despite weak commodity prices&mdash;commodity prices being the backbone of this country's international export earnings until a year or two ago&mdash;and world trade growth, it was 24 per cent lower in 1991-92 than in 1990-91. The trend in export growth continues unabated. I recommend that Senator Ferguson take a look at some of the export growth figures because they are very encouraging.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fall of 10 1/2 per cent in the trade weighted index since April, and the lower inflation rate, will enhance our competitiveness, but that is a two-edged observation in terms of the current account. It is possible that the current account deficit may increase in response to a recovery in economic activity. I think we saw that in the August current account figures; we did not see it in the September figures; and we saw it a little more again in the October figures. Monthly figures vary, and it is impossible to draw any conclusions about those at this stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part of the deterioration in the trade account will flow from growth in business investment, which all adds up to productive potential. The current account deficit should stabilise relative to GDP in the mid-1990s, as the Government's policies to improve competitiveness bear fruit. That is something which we have said in the past and which we still believe in. It is totally supported by the figures I have given for the decline in the current account deficit as a percentage of GDP.</PARA>

A number of studies have been conducted on this question. In Australia it is estimated that the GST would require at least 700,000 small business people to become tax collectors for the government.

I would expect, therefore, for there to be a considerable degree of continuity between his policies and those of his predecessor. Throughout the whole campaign Governor Clinton has been fairly careful, I think, in his comments on trade policy. He has consistently claimed to be a free trader. We would not expect him to be hostage to the familiar list of Democrat protectionist special interest groups.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government has established a trust fund into which the profits of crime, stripped from those who have been convicted of serious Commonwealth offences, particularly the importing and trafficking of drugs into Australia, have been placed. At the moment, there is some $2m in that trust fund, and many tens of millions more are available to go into that trust fund should convictions be secured against those who, as I say, are accumulating vast profits from crime through trafficking in drugs principally.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the intention of the Government that 50 per cent of the moneys in that trust fund be paid to drug education and rehabilitation projects and that 50 per cent be paid for law enforcement. This morning I was able to make the first payment out of that fund to the Federal Police for the construction and setting up of an assessment centre for those who enter the protected witness program. This program is an extremely important one and allows for the secure, safe haven and refuge of those who are prepared to undertake very considerable personal risk to themselves and their families by promising to give evidence against those who are charged with serious crimes such as drug trafficking.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a very nice twist to the story of organised crime in Australia that the profits which those involved accumulate that would otherwise be available to fund further criminal activities or perhaps to be laundered in the economy will instead be confiscated from them and be used for drug rehabilitation and law enforcement purposes. In particular, to have the first payment made in relation to the protected witnesses program is extremely important. Over the last several years, 80 per cent of those cases where protected witnesses have appeared in relation to matters brought to the court after Federal Police investigations have resulted in successful trials where convictions have been recorded and an average of eight-year sentences awarded to the criminals concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the protected witness program is an integral part of this law enforcement effort against organised crime.

As a percentage of the annual wage cost in isolation it is about 1.3 per cent.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Victorian Government did not do what it could have done and taken its case&mdash;if it believed it had one&mdash;to the Industrial Relations Commission in the State, allowed those who opposed its views to be heard in argument and allowed an independent tribunal to make a judgment about whether justice, equity and the substantial merits of the case would apply in the views of the Victorian Government on annual leave loadings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not have any plans at all to cut out in that manner annual leave loadings, or in any other manner, for that reason. Why do we not have such plans? One of the reasons is that the annual leave loading allows mum, dad and the kids to have a holiday at Christmas time. It allows people whose wages would be lower, because they are on the base rate of their award when they are on annual leave than the rate they normally receive at work, to make up the difference and to have a holiday. All those caravan park owners and small chalet owners who rely on internal tourism for their business, all those small business people, would suffer as well. It would be a crippling blow for them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also true that annual leave loading is a feature of many other countries in the world. It is not exclusive to Australia. Indeed, the level of annual leave loading in Australia is low by international standards. Let me name some of the countries that have annual leave loadings of some sort or another: Belgium, Denmark, Greece, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal and Sweden. Of that list we are the second lowest, and the second lowest by a long streak.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am generally aware of the response by the Federal Government to the recent strategy concerning violence against women in our community. Only late last week, the Prime Minister indicated that any society which tolerated acts of violence against women&mdash;whether by way of general physical assault, or particularly sexual assault&mdash;was a society which needed proper reforming, particularly of the underlying cultural values which allowed that to occur. I think this mostly occurred on the day of or on the eve of the `Reclaim the Night' marches, principally by women but in some cases supported by men. The need to demonstrate to Australian society that women had a perfect right to walk our streets, particularly at night, without fear of being molested or sexually assaulted was made very clear.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Federal Government certainly supports that and has been very welcoming of the national strategy put forward by the National Committee on Violence Against Women. That had several elements, and one that I know will be of interest to Senator Reynolds and</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Crowley is the strategy which speaks of the need to educate lawyers and judges, amongst others, about the changing community attitudes concerning this matter. Whilst, of course, that could not affect the question of the guilt or innocence of a person being tried, it should lead to a proper appreciation of the sentencing and the corrections which ought to be visited on a person who is convicted of such violence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have mentioned many times in this chamber the need for the euphemism `domestic violence' to be shed in favour of the true recognition that one is speaking of criminal violence in the home. Of course, home should be a refuge from violence, but it is often a place where women and children either experience violence or have their minds and values formed by observation of violence against another member of the household.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst I am aware that the Federal Government provides much money for women's refuges&mdash;I think there are over 260 refuges throughout Australia&mdash;and has other programs, I am not at the moment well acquainted with the meeting which Senator Reynolds referred to as a joint meeting of Commonwealth and State Ministers. I am quite sure that they would share the sentiment of the Federal Government and its response to the national strategy concerning violence against women.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is obviously very important that a proper balance be struck in terms of what Senator Bjelke-Petersen calls care of patients in hostels. If they are in hostels the better term would be residents, or people who are not so frail or ill that they are required to be upgraded and assessed as being proper for nursing home care and attention. Nevertheless, in relation to those who are receiving the security and the safe haven of a hostel as elderly people within our community, it is important that the care they receive is not diminished by an undue emphasis on the need to provide proper records as to the care that is being provided at taxpayers' expense. That is the other factor that has to be brought into the balance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that many hundreds of millions of dollars are spent in recurrent and capital costs in support of these hostels.

I do not want to retrace the question that was raised in the urgency motion earlier because much more time than was justified was wasted on that this morning.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I rise to indicate that certainly in my view and, I am sure, in the view of most of my colleagues there has been no dereliction of duty whatsoever on your part in the way you have responded to the various issues that have arisen over the last day or so. There has been no failure to fulfil any obligation upon you as President of the Senate. Indeed, Senator Kemp spoke collectively of yourself and the Speaker as Presiding Officers, and there is no doubt that that is the primary and principal function that you have to discharge, that is, to act as the Presiding Officer in this chamber and to ensure that order is kept. I think it is a very wise and prudent course that, in order to ensure that you have the confidence of the chamber in discharging that principal role, you do not get involved in day to day political controversy, even if it does go to the role of the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the test of the propriety and prudence with which you have conducted yourself is to ask this question: what if the motion that was put by the Opposition and supported by the Democrats today had not been passed and you had gone out and made statements as President of the Senate in terms which were later embodied in that motion? We would have found a situation where the Senate chamber had voted against some expression that you might have made in those same terms. That illustrates how very wise and prudent you were not to enter into that controversy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable senators ought to reflect on this point: that the motion having been passed by the Senate, the President, as I understand it, has already very properly conveyed a message embodying that resolution of the Senate to the House of Representatives, I suppose to the Speaker of the House of Representatives. So the President, insofar as he has a duty and an obligation and insofar as those terms have been used, has indeed discharged that duty and fulfilled that obligation to the Senate chamber. I believe that that is his proper role. I am not sure whether you were in here for the vote on that, Mr President, but whatever your personal view on the matter of political controversy you have fulfilled your duty and obligation and conveyed the resolution of the Senate to the House of Representatives. That is what can be properly required of you by this chamber. I believe that you have done that and I believe that in so doing you have preserved the proper role of the Presiding Officer of this Senate chamber. </PARA>

Basically, what Senator Tate had to say would have some validity, Mr President, if you had not chosen to make this statement in the form you have so chosen. The point that has to be made is that when you accept the office of President part and parcel of accepting that office is the responsibility to uphold the dignity of the Senate without fear or favour. If one ever gets to the point of feeling that one cannot carry out that duty, then one should relinquish it. When we had the censure motion early in the day, a matter of tremendous importance to the Senate and to the Parliament as a whole&mdash;and as I pointed out earlier in the day, the Parliament is composed of the Queen, the Senate and House of Representatives together&mdash;you did not even bother to stay in the chair for the debate of that particular motion.

When we fall foul of the public, when we waste time, when we cannot organise our day in order to debate issues properly, when we cannot organise public inquiries to make sure that those inquiries, for example, are debated here productively and effect the work of the Executive, then that is a problem for the Senate. But it is a role for us to maintain. </PARA>

You have been as fair, I believe, as any President can be, given that you are a member of a political party. My view is well known: I think the two officers, the President and the Speaker of the House of Representatives, should not be members of political parties; they should resign from them when they take office and be protected against challenge. I believe that if that were the case, you would still be elected President because of the way you have handled yourself in this chamber and in that role.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">SEAFARERS REHABILITATION AND COMPENSATION BILL 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill introduces a new scheme of compensation and rehabilitation for seafarers who are injured in the course of their employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will replace the outdated and inadequate Seamen's Compensation Act 1911 with modern and comprehensive rehabilitation and compensation arrangements similar to those applicable to Commonwealth employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1987 the Government commissioned Professor Harold Luntz to conduct a review of the policy basis, and the operation, of the Seamen's Compensation Act 1911. The terms of reference of the review required Professor Luntz to consider the desirability of consistency between the seamen's compensation legislation and the proposals being developed at that time for the new Commonwealth employees workers compensation legislation. These proposals were subsequently enshrined in the Commonwealth Employees' Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988, or CERC Act for short.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Professor Luntz's review of seamen's compensation was tabled in Parliament in June 1988. Since that time, the Luntz review recommendations have been the subject of extensive consultations involving shipowners, the maritime unions and the ACTU.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The outcome of this process is a Bill which radically moves away from the outmoded compensation regime which the Seamen's Compensation Act provides. The new scheme will combine fair, earnings-related, benefits with comprehensive rehabilitation requirements and other measures aimed at getting injured employees restored to health and back to work as quickly as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also restores the former nexus with the workers compensation legislation applicable to Commonwealth employees. This is consistent with the unitary compensation structure applying across public and private sector employment in all the state and territory workers compensation schemes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a large and complex Bill with many essentially technical provisions. These are described in detail in the explanatory memorandum. It is appropriate, however, to draw the attention of the honourable senators to the main features of the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Liability and Insurance</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new arrangements will be based on individual employer liability. This acknowledges that the individual employers and their insurers already have the necessary infrastructure in place to manage such arrangements and that the imposition of a Government fund on such a small industry (with around 6,000 employees) would not be cost effective.  </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order that employers will be able to meet their liabilities, the Bill requires them to be insured with an insurer authorised under the Insurance Act 1973 or be indemnified by a protection and indemnity association which is a member of the international group of protection and indemnity associations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be a special industry-wide `safety net' fund to provide coverage for industry trainees and for temporarily unemployed seafarers while attending seafarers engagement centres in accordance with industry labour pooling arrangements. Both these categories of persons are employed by the industry as a whole, rather than by individual employers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The safety net fund will also be the `nominal insurer'. In other words, if the employer or the employer's insurer is unable to meet liabilities because of bankruptcy for example, the fund will meet those liabilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is provision for the industry-wide fund to be established in one of two ways&mdash;a fund operated by employers collectively as a corporate entity; or a fund operated by the administering authority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill provides for the Minister to approve a corporate body as the fund, provided it meets stipulated conditions. Industry employers have already established such a corporate entity. However, if the industry fund should ever fail to meet the stipulated conditions, the minister has the power to revoke the approval of the corporate body and declare the administering authority to have the functions, powers and obligations of the fund.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Benefits</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to the benefits which will be payable under this legislation. These benefits will be aligned with those currently payable to injured public sector workers covered by the CERC Act. Like the CERC Act, the benefits will be indexed annually in line with consumer price index movements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Incapacity</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the heart of the new scheme is the change from a system of fixed long-term benefits adjusted by regulation, to one of weekly benefits calculated on the basis of the individual employee's normal weekly earnings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Employees who are totally incapacitated for work will receive weekly benefits equal to normal weekly earnings for the first 45 weeks of that incapacity. Partially incapacitated employees will receive benefits to bring their wages up to normal weekly earnings during that period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After 45 weeks of incapacity, the basic rate of benefits applicable reduces to 75 per cent  of normal weekly earnings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rate of benefits payable to partially incapacitated employees who are able to work will be on a graduated scale. For these persons the combined total of compensation plus earnings will be between 75 per cent and 100 per cent of normal weekly earnings, depending on the number of hours that the employee actually works.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Weekly payments will not normally be paid beyond the age of 65.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Permanent Impairment</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to the weekly benefits for incapacity which I have just outlined, the Bill provides for the payment of lump sums for permanent impairment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the current Seamen's Compensation Act, lump sum payments are made on the basis of a table of maims. The range of maims compensated is exclusive and does not recognise the broad range of work-related injuries and diseases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This outdated and crude approach will be replaced with a much more comprehensive and fair method using the modern concepts already adopted in assessing permanent impairments for war veterans and injured commonwealth employees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Non-economic Loss</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conjunction with an assessment of permanent impairment there will be an assessment of related factors defined as non-economic loss. These factors include pain and suffering, loss of quality of life and shortened life expectancy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">Attendant Care and Household Services</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill makes provision for injured employees to receive financial assistance for the cost of any necessary household services and for necessary attendant care services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Death Benefits</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of an employee who has died as a result of a work-related injury or disease, there will be a lump sum benefit, which will be apportioned between the dependants. Additionally, dependent children will receive weekly benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Rehabilitation</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the most important feature of the new scheme&mdash;rehabilitation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Early and effective rehabilitation cuts the human and monetary costs of serious industrial injury by helping to repair the physical damage and, equally importantly, by overcoming the "compensation mentality" that can so easily overwhelm injured employees when left to their own devices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Comcare attributes a major part of its success in reducing its compensation costs to the similar rehabilitation arrangements applicable to Commonwealth employees under the CERC Act. Since the CERC Act came into operation in late 1988, the number of incapacity cases lasting more than four weeks has halved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill requires employers to arrange a rehabilitation assessment of any injured employee whose incapacity lasts, or is expected to last, 28 days. If that assessment concludes that a rehabilitation program is appropriate, the employer will be required to engage an approved program provider to develop and conduct an appropriate rehabilitation program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To encourage a positive attitude towards the program, the injured employee will be required to be fully consulted in the development of the program arrangements. However, if the employee refuses to undertake the program, there is provision for compensation benefits to be suspended.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill requires the employer to take all reasonable steps to provide suitable employment for an employee who has undertaken a rehabilitation program, or to assist the employee in finding alternative employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The employer will also be required to provide any necessary aids and appliances, or home, vehicle or workplace modifications to enable an injured employee to have as normal a life as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Reconsideration and Review Process</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill establishes a two stage process for reviewing cases in which an employer's determination of a claim is disputed by the employee or dependant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first stage requires the employer to reconsider its initial determination on request by the claimant. If the claimant is not satisfied with a reconsidered determination, the claimant may seek a review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill sets down special procedures for the first stage reconsideration process, requiring the employer to obtain the assistance of either a Comcare officer or an industry panel. The Comcare officer or industry panel, as the case may be, will provide the employer with an independent assessment of the merits of the claim. The claimant will also receive a copy of this assessment. The assessment will not be binding on either party but the process is expected to result in most cases being resolved quickly without recourse to the AAT.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The costs of the services of Comcare, or the alternative industry panel, will be met by the relevant employer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">Common Law Actions</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to common law actions for negligence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Common law negligence actions are counter-productive to the fundamental objective of helping injured employees rebuild their lives and return to employment as quickly as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accordingly, the new legislation, like the CERC Act, will restrict common law actions against an employer or fellow employee to non-economic losses and cap the amount of damages that a court may award.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, the employee will be required to make an irrevocable election that he or she intends to pursue a common law action before any lump sum compensation benefit for permanent impairment and non-economic loss has been paid. No lump sum compensation is payable once an election to pursue common law has been made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be no restriction on employees pursuing common law actions against third parties. Similarly, there will be no restrictions on dependants pursuing common law actions against the employer or fellow employee of a deceased employee, or against third parties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, in the event of an employee or dependant receiving damages, the employee or dependant will be required to pay the employer either the amount of compensation received or the amount of damages, whichever is less.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Seafarers Rehabilitation and Compensation Authority</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill establishes the Seafarers Rehabilitation and Compensation Authority. This authority will consist of six persons to be appointed by the Minister&mdash;an independent chairperson, a deputy chairperson and four part-time members representing the interests of industry parties. This structure will allow employees and employers to participate directly in the administration of the compensation and rehabilitation system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The primary functions of the Authority will be:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, this Bill will create a progressive compensation and rehabilitation system, comparable with other modern workers compensation arrangements in Australia. The measures will ensure injured seafarers are quickly and effectively rehabilitated.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth Superannuation Schemes Amendment Bill 1992 will amend a number of Acts under which superannuation benefits are payable to Commonwealth employees and office-holders and their spouses and children. The purpose of the amendments is to remove discrimination on the basis of marital status from certain provisions of the superannuation schemes. The removal of discrimination in superannuation on the grounds of sex and marital status has been identified in the National Agenda for Women as a priority area for Government action. Action has already been taken to review and limit the exemption in the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 for superannuation and to increase superannuation coverage for women.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth has for many years followed a policy of providing adequate superannuation coverage to its office-holders and employees. In more recent times, as the Government has taken steps to extend superannuation coverage in the broader community, we have been committed to that coverage being provided in a fair and non-discriminatory manner. The 1991 amendments to the Sex Discrimination Act will oblige private sector employers to limit sex and marital status discrimination in superannuation only to those limited superannuation practices which remain exempted from the Sex Discrimination Act. These amendments, consistent with the Government's commitment to the equitable provision of access to superannuation benefits, will ensure that Commonwealth superannuation is also in conformity with the Sex Discrimination Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation being amended is the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Act 1973, the Governor-General Act 1974, the Judges' Pensions Act 1968, the Parliamentary and Judicial Retiring Allowances Act 1973, the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Act 1948, the Superannuation Act 1922, and the Superannuation Act 1976.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These amendments will ensure that the Commonwealth's own legislative superannuation schemes are consistent with amendments which were made last year to the Sex Discrimination Act. Those amendments narrowed the previous exemption from the Sex Discrimination Act for superannuation so that most forms of discrimination on the basis of sex or marital status in superannuation will be unlawful, subject to a number of limited exemptions relating to particular superannuation practices. Those amendments come into effect two years from the date on which that legislation received Royal Assent, that is 25 June 1993, in order to permit the necessary changes to be made to superannuation schemes. This legislation amending the Commonwealth's own legislatively-based superannuation schemes will come into effect on the same date as those amendments&mdash;25 June 1993. It will apply to benefits payable as a result of the death of a person on or after that date, while the existing provisions of each of the legislative schemes will continue to apply to benefits which became payable as the result of the death of a person before that date.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable senators will note that the Superannuation Act 1990, which establishes the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme, is not being amended by this Bill. The detail of the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme is contained in a Trust Deed and Rules made under the Superannuation Act 1990. It is intended that the Trust Deed and Rules will be amended along the lines of the amendments made by this Bill to remove discrimination in the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme. Similarly, the Military Superannuation and Benefits Act 1991 is not being amended by this Bill. However, it is intended that the Trust Deed and Rules made under that Act will also be amended to remove marital status discrimination. It is anticipated that the amendments to both of those Trusts Deeds and Rules will be made prior to 25 June 1993, the date of effect of the changes to the Sex Discrimination Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislative superannuation provisions being amended by this Bill are those which provide for reversionary benefits to be paid to the surviving spouses, and in some cases children, of deceased superannuation scheme members or beneficiaries. Some of the schemes at present do not recognise de facto relationships for the purpose of entitlement to reversionary benefits, while others apply qualifying periods to de facto relationships which are not applied to legal marriages. Further, some of the schemes discriminate against ex-nuptial children in the allocation of benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes will result in some additional costs to Commonwealth superannuation schemes in some situations. These will chiefly be where, in future, de facto spouses of deceased scheme members or pensioners are able to establish the existence of a bona fide domestic relationship where that relationship does not meet the existing eligibility criteria for payment of reversionary benefits. However, the Department of Finance has advised that, because most schemes already recognise spouses, including de facto spouses where the relationship has existed for some years or where there is financial dependency, the additional costs would be very small. There is insufficient data on the incidence, rate of formation, duration of, or extent of financial dependency in de facto relationships among members of existing Commonwealth schemes to enable the additional cost or Budgetary effect to be estimated with any certainty. Any additional costs would be offset by social security and taxation clawbacks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments in this Bill will apply a standard and non-discriminatory approach to the assessment of eligibility of spouses for reversionary benefits and will remove the provisions which discriminate against ex-nuptial children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key criterion for eligibility of a surviving spouse to reversionary benefits under the amended legislation will be the existence of a permanent and bona fide domestic relationship. The Bill provides tests for establishing that such a relationship exists: either that the couple were living together as husband and wife for at least three years, or, where the couple were living together as husband and wife for a lesser period of time, that there is other evidence to establish that the relationship was a permanent and bona fide domestic relationship. The Bill provides a list of the types of evidence which may be considered, but will not restrict decision-makers to that list alone. The assessment will be made on the basis of all relevant evidence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Provision will continue to be made for the payment of reversionary benefits to persons who were legally married to but separated from the deceased superannuation scheme member or beneficiary at the time of death but were wholly or substantially dependent on that person. These persons will be deemed to be spouses for the purposes of the legislation although they will not have been in a permanent and bona fide domestic relationship at the time of death.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The non-discriminatory definition of spouse will mean that a person could have more than one `spouse' for the purpose of benefits entitlement, for example a separated legally married spouse and a current de facto spouse. Additional amendments will accordingly be made to some of the schemes to provide that in such cases benefits are to be allocated among the spouses having regard to their respective needs and, where relevant, the needs of eligible children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of the Superannuation Act 1922, it is already possible to recognise more than one spouse. However, there can be discrimination in the way in which benefits are divided in such circumstances. Accordingly the Superannuation Act 1922 will also be amended to provide that benefits are to be allocated among spouses having regard to their respective needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to the amendments dealing with the entitlement of spouses, some of the Acts are being amended in the provision for children of deceased superannuation scheme members or beneficiaries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Act will be amended to remove the necessity for ex-nuptial children of the superannuation scheme members to prove dependency. A child or ex-nuptial child of a spouse of a member, who does not come within the amended definition of child, will still be required to prove dependency at the date of death.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Judges' Pensions Act will be amended to provide that a pension will be payable in respect of a child of a Judge or retired Judge, a child who is wholly or substantially dependent on the Judge or retired Judge at the time of death, and a child who would, but for the death, have been dependent on the Judge or retired Judge. The amendment reduces the coverage of the current Act by excluding as possible beneficiaries the children of a spouse or former spouse of a Judge or retired Judge who have no dependent relationship with the Judge or retired Judge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The additional amendments to the Superannuation Act 1976 will improve equity in eligibility for children's benefits and will ensure that the classes of children eligible for benefits reflect the recognition of additional marital relationships.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The speeches read as follows</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this Bill is to implement a reform package for the Pipeline Authority (TPA) to enable it to achieve a more commercially orientated approach to its operations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In just over 20 years, natural gas has grown from a small base to become Australia's third most important energy source, accounting for 17 per cent of primary energy demand.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The recent supply/demand study by the Australian Gas Association (AGA) indicates that the Australian gas industry is now on another threshold of growth, not only as a major, reliable supplier to the domestic energy market, but as a major exporter of liquefied natural gas (or LNG) in the 90s and beyond.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The AGA study indicates market opportunities for natural gas are expected to grow strongly in the years ahead, with new market opportunities, including greater use in power generation, particularly co-generation, and in the transport sector.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia has already made an impressive entrance onto the world LNG stage. Exports from the North West Shelf project are forecast to grow to 7 million tonnes per annum by 1995. At these levels, the export value of LNG, oil and condensate from the North West Shelf could approach $3 billion per annum. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The project is already making a significant and sustained contribution to our balance of payments, and there are excellent prospects for further major expansions of the industry. Shell Australia, for example, has identified a $6-8 billion expansion opportunity for Australia's LNG industry over the next five years, based on growth in Asian markets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal Government strongly supports LNG exports, and as a major element in the National Gas Strategy, has assisted future growth of the industry through removal of volume controls on LNG exports. This move has been welcomed by the industry as a positive step to assist the development of LNG export opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Industry responses to the National Gas Strategy have been unanimous in supporting the Government's view that a truly national approach is needed to help develop our natural gas reserves fully. The promotion of free and fair interstate gas trade is one of the key points in the National Gas Strategy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I share the industry's belief that it is essential to free up markets to provide the incentive for future development of Australia's domestic and export gas industry. In particular, unrestricted interstate gas trade is essential for the exploration and the development of markets and related infrastructure. There can be no compromise on this point if we are to move towards an efficient national market in natural gas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The AGA Gas Supply and Demand Study reinforces the need to move towards a national gas market and provides a timely warning of the costs involved if parochial attitudes and self interest by the State and Territories prevent free and open interstate trade in gas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The AGA estimates that the cost to Australians of higher prices due to restricted interstate gas trade would, over the period to the year 2030, be in the range $1.5 to $4 billion in net present-value terms.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Producers are already seeking additional markets for gas from areas such as south west Queensland and the Amadeus Basin in the Northern Territory. These, and other reserves, are likely to remain under-developed unless State and Territory administrations lend their support to unrestricted gas trade.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An additional plank in the National Gas Strategy was reform of Government instrumentalities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's direct role in natural gas operations is restricted largely to its ownership of TPA. In turn, the Authority owns and operates the natural gas transmission pipeline that extends approximately 1,300 kilometres from Moomba in South Australia to Wilton, on the outskirts of Sydney. At Wilton, the natural gas is delivered to the Australian Gas Light Company (AGL) whose subsidiaries are responsible for gas reticulation throughout the Sydney, Wollongong and Newcastle regions. Lateral pipelines supply natural gas to regional markets, including the Cootamundra, Wagga-Wagga, Young, Junee, Canberra and Bathurst/Orange regions and soon, to the Riverina.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government announced in late 1989 that it would develop a reform package for TPA as part of the Government's wider agenda for micro-economic reform. In November 1991, as part of the National Gas Strategy, the Government reaffirmed its commitment to implement reform of TPA to make it more efficient and competitive.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the 1992 Budget, the Government announced the inclusion of the Moomba to Sydney gas pipeline system in its program of asset sales. The sale of the pipeline system is unlikely to be completed before the 1993/94 financial year at the earliest. This was recognised in the Budget Statement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In these circumstances, the Government believes that reform of TPA, including putting its commercially-based operations into a Government Business Enterprise style subsidiary, is essential and should not be delayed further. These reforms will enable the return on TPA's assets to be optimised in the lead up to the proposed sale.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reforms proposed in this legislation will enable TPA, through a subsidiary corporation, to compete on a more equal footing with other participants in Australia's natural gas industry and to be involved in a wider range of commercially based activities than its present Act allows.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reforms will provide the means for TPA to become a more effective operator in the gas sector and to take advantage of commercial opportunities as they arise. This approach will ensure optimal returns to the Government from TPA.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The central feature of the reform package is to provide for the creation of a subsidiary of TPA to undertake those operations of TPA that are based on a commercial rate of return. This will include the Canberra and Oberon laterals and the proposed Riverina pipeline extension to Griffith.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">TPA has contracts with AGL covering the carriage of gas through these pipelines. The Government has consulted with AGL on the proposed transfer of assets and has taken that company's concerns into account in the preparation of the legislation. There is no element in the reform proposals embodied in this legislation which would be prejudicial to AGL's existing contracts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed legislation requires the approval of the Minister for Resources before a subsidiary can be created. The Minister's approval will outline the reporting requirements whereby strategic Ministerial control will be exercised over the subsidiary consistent with the Guidelines for Government Business Enterprise Accountability.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">TPA has, in the past, been significantly constrained by its Act in the type of activities it can undertake. The current Act limits TPA to constructing, owning and operating pipelines within Australia. It cannot be involved in other activities, such as operating a pipeline it does not own and it has been limited to providing consultancy services within Australia&mdash;and then only after obtaining Ministerial approval.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new subsidiary will be able to undertake any of the activities related to the design, construction and acquisition of petroleum pipelines. In addition, the subsidiary will be able to operate and maintain pipelines throughout Australia and provide consultancy and transmission support services relating to petroleum pipeline construction, design and operation for clients in Australia and overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new subsidiary will be subject to taxation and will be required to make dividend payments. To all intents and purposes, it is designed to behave as a private company carrying out the business of a Government enterprise and be subject to corporate law and regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the subsidiary will operate as a commercial Government Business Enterprise, TPA will continue to operate the Moomba to Sydney mainline and the laterals to Lithgow and Wagga Wagga on the cost recovery basis determined by existing contracts between TPA and AGL.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reform package that has been developed is consistent with the Government's latest guidelines for Government Business Enterprise Accountability. These guidelines emphasise strategic Ministerial control over the enterprise, while enterprise Boards are responsible for development of business strategies and the handling of day-to-day management policies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With this in mind, Ministerial control over the subsidiary will be imposed by Ministerial oversight of the subsidiary's Strategic Corporate Plan, annual operating plans and financial targets. Any major changes to these plans, and other major issues and opportunities identified by the subsidiary's Board and management, will be reported promptly through the Authority to the Minister for Resources for consideration and action as appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The subsidiary will be required to provide, on an annual basis, a Strategic Corporate Plan covering a three year period for Ministerial consideration and response. Information on any material variations in the corporate plan, and any other changes in circumstances that would require disclosure under the Australian Stock Exchange or Australian Securities Commission rules, must be reported through TPA to the Minister immediately. In addition, the subsidiary will be required to provide more regular reports outlining progress towards meeting the Corporate Plan and any proposed changes to that Plan. The subsidiary will also be required to work to an Annual Operating Plan, including a financial target and dividend policy, approved in advance by the Minister for Resources in consultation with the Minister for Finance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As at present, TPA will be required to produce an Annual report which will be tabled in Parliament. This report will include coverage of the operations and performance of TPA's subsidiary, so there will continue to be full disclosure of TPA's pipeline operations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The assets to be transferred from TPA to the subsidiary are to be revalued prior to approval of the first corporate plan associated with the establishment of the subsidiary. Assets of the subsidiary and TPA will subsequently be revalued every three years in accordance with normal commercial practice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A key factor in establishing the appropriate capital base for the subsidiary is to enable it to borrow in the commercial market without Government guarantees and maintain an "A" credit rating. To achieve this aim, it may be necessary to transfer some retained earnings from TPA to the subsidiary along with the designated assets. The capital and financial resources provided by TPA to the subsidiary in exchange for share equity, plus the revenue earning capability of the Canberra and Griffith pipelines, should permit payment of dividends by the subsidiary to the Government (via TPA) at an early stage.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Subject to passage of this Bill and completion of the necessary legal formalities, the Government envisages the early reorganisation of TPA. The legal separation of TPA's commercial and non-commercial operations will facilitate assessment of the subsidiary's performance against the criteria outlined in its corporate plan. It will provide the correct commercial incentives for the management of the subsidiary and ensure the financial and operating results of each organisation are separate and transparent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed reforms highlight the need for TPA Board to include an appropriate mix of qualifications, abilities and business acumen. Given the greater requirement for financial and corporate expertise, it is proposed to expand TPA's Board by two new directors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill allows for TPA's Chief Executive Officer to be appointed by the Authority and be subject to dismissal by the Authority. TPA directors will also now be appointed by the Minister for Resources rather than the Governor General in Council, and be subject to dismissal on grounds which have been expanded to include on-going under performance. The Board of the subsidiary will be appointed by the Authority.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the reforms that I have outlined today have the potential to provide substantial benefits. They will provide a sound basis on which to improve the overall performance of TPA. The reforms will allow the management of TPA and its proposed subsidiary greater flexibility in their day to day operations on a range of issues that previously required Ministerial approval, while retaining adequate accountability under the Guidelines for Government Business Enterprise operations. This will enable TPA, through its subsidiary, to take advantage of a range of commercial opportunities that are emerging in Australia and overseas as a result of growing demand for natural gas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the Bill to honourable senators and present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">NATIONAL CRIME AUTHORITY AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Honourable Senators will recall that in November 1991 the Parliamentary Joint Committee (PJC) on the National Crime Authority (NCA) tabled its evaluation of the NCA in a Report entitled `Who is to Guard the Guards?'. The Report supported the continued existence and activities of the NCA, and made eleven recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's response to the PJC Report was tabled on 1 June 1992. The National Crime Authority Bill (No.2) 1992 amends the National Crime Authority Act 1984 in the manner foreshadowed in that response.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill establishes an office of Inspector-General of the NCA, endows it with appropriate functions and powers, and provides a mechanism for resolving disputes between the NCA and the PJC about access to sensitive information held by the NCA. It also makes some small but important corrections to existing provisions of the NCA Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The most significant change to the NCA Act introduced by these amendments is the new office of Inspector-General of the NCA. Clause 10 of the Bill will insert a new Part IIIA in the NCA Act to make provision for this office. The PJC Report proposed that the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security be given jurisdiction to investigate complaints against the NCA and its staff. Because the role of the Inspector-General in relation to the NCA will differ in some respects from the role of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, the Bill will establish a separate office of Inspector-General of the NCA under the NCA Act. However, the Government intends that the occupant of the office of Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security will be appointed as Inspector-General of the NCA also and, with this in mind, the new Part IIIA is based, as closely as practicable, on the relevant provisions of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security Act 1986.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One major difference between the role of the Inspector-General in relation to the NCA and in relation to the intelligence and security agencies will be that he will not have the broad monitoring function in relation to the NCA which he has in relation to intelligence and security matters. General monitoring of the work of the NCA remains the responsibility of the Commonwealth-State Inter-Governmental Committee (IGC) and of the PJC both of which are established under the NCA Act. A second major difference is that, in relation to the NCA, the Inspector-General will not investigate complaints which can be dealt with satisfactorily under existing complaints legislation or procedures applicable to a police force from which the subject of the complaint has been seconded to the NCA.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under new section 55AA, the recommendation to the Governor-General that a person be appointed Inspector-General may only be made after consultation with the IGC. The person so appointed will be able to hold the office in conjunction with another, and section 55AC will preserve the judicial status of a judge appointed to the office. The terms and conditions of the Inspector-General, as set out in Division 6 of the new Part IIIA, are compatible with those of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security. Under section 55AZE, where the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security is also appointed Inspector-General of the NCA, staff may be appointed to assist him in both capacities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The functions of the Inspector-General are set out in proposed new section 55AD. His principal function will be to investigate complaints about the actions of members or staff of the NCA, whether such complaints are made directly or are referred to him by a member of the IGC or by the PJC. Further, on request by the Minister, he will investigate whether NCA information to which access is sought by the PJC on the NCA is `sensitive information' as defined in the Bill, and will advise the Minister accordingly. Lastly, where the Minister so requests, the Inspector-General will monitor compliance by the NCA with directions or guidelines in relation to privacy issued by the Minister under section 18 of the NCA Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Division 2 of the new Part IIIA will provide for the receipt and investigation of complaints. It is proposed that the Inspector-General be obliged to investigate all complaints including those which may have arisen before the passage of this Bill. As is appropriate, however, discretions are built into section 55AG which will enable him not to inquire into complaints which, for instance, are frivolous or vexatious or where, having regard to all the circumstances, an inquiry or further inquiry is not warranted. The latter category would include past complaints which, in the view of the Inspector-General, have been dealt with satisfactorily by the informal means of investigation which have existed hitherto.  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Division 3 will deal with the conduct of inquiries. The Inspector-General will be required to inform the Minister and the Chairperson of the NCA before commencing an investigation. His inquiries will be conducted in private and will not be subject to formal procedural requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He will be entitled to compel production of information and documents and to make such use of the documents as may be needed for the purposes of the investigation. He will also be able to compel people to attend before him and give evidence on oath or affirmation, including evidence which they would otherwise be entitled by privilege, or obliged by law, to withhold. The Inspector-General will also have reasonable access to NCA premises for the purposes of an investigation, and special provision is made for the receipt of complaints from persons in custody.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There will be a two-stage reporting process, with a draft report given to the Chairperson of the NCA for comment before the final report is submitted to the Minister and the Chairperson. The report should include reasons and recommend any restitution considered appropriate for a complainant. The Inspector-General will be required to advise the complainant (and the IGC or the PJC, if they referred the complaint) of the outcome of the investigation, so far as this will not prejudice NCA security. The Chairperson of the NCA will be required to advise the Inspector-General of his action in response to each report. If dissatisfied with that response the Inspector-General will be entitled to discuss the matter with, and make a written report on it to, the Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Inspector-General will be required to provide an annual report to the Minister, commenting on the investigations he has conducted during the past year. The Minister will be required to table the report in each House as soon as practicable after receipt. Provision is made in clause 9 of the Bill for an amendment to section 55 under which the PJC would examine the Inspector-General's annual report. This is intended to provide a means by which the PJC may better inform itself in the performance of its principal function under that section&mdash;the monitoring and reviewing of the NCA's performance. The provision is not intended to suggest accountability on the part of the Inspector-General to the PJC.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second main aspect of the Bill is the provision of a mechanism for resolving disagreement over what is often termed `operational' or `sensitive' information. In its recent Report, the PJC sought clarification of its rights of access to information held by the NCA. Disputes about such information in the past have given rise to questions of Parliamentary privilege. As foreshadowed in its response to the PJC Report, the Government has decided to deal with this issue by providing, in a new subsection 55(2), that in the performance of its duties the PJC is entitled to require the Chairperson of the NCA to produce to it any document held by the NCA or to divulge or communicate to it any information held by or known to the NCA&mdash;except to the extent that it is or contains sensitive information. `Sensitive information' is defined in an amendment set out in clause 3 as information the disclosure of which might prejudice the safety or reputation of a person, the fair trial of a person who has been or may be charged with an offence, the effectiveness of an investigation by the NCA, or the operations of law enforcement agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where the PJC requests access to information and the Chairperson of the NCA refuses access on the ground that the information requested is `sensitive' as defined, the amendment to section 55 will allow the PJC to refer the request to the Minister administering the NCA Act for written resolution of the dispute. The Bill provides that the Minister may require the Inspector-General of the NCA to inquire into the matter, and the Inspector-General must do so in accordance with the inquiry provisions of the new Part IIIA of the NCA Act. When the Inspector-General has reported to the Minister, the Minister will have to decide whether or not the information is sensitive, and notify the Chairperson, the PJC and the Inspector-General of his decision. The Bill will also authorise the Minister to include reasons for the decision in the formal determination, where this can be done without disclosing sensitive information.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of the minor amendments included in the Bill, one affects section 29A of the NCA Act. This section only came into force in January this year and provides that NCA process issued under section 28 or 29 may include a notation prohibiting disclosure of any information relating to the process. This conflicts with the credit reporting provisions of the Privacy Act 1988, which require agencies to record any disclosures on an individual's credit information file and to ensure that an individual can obtain access to his or her file. Access by an individual to a credit reference file bearing a note of disclosure to the NCA could seriously jeopardise an NCA investigation. Accordingly, clause 7 of the Bill will amend section 29A of the NCA Act to provide that, where the Privacy Act would require that a note be made of a disclosure made in response to NCA process and that process includes a notation requiring secrecy, the requirement to record the disclosure is postponed until the effect of the notation expires. The Privacy Commissioner has indicated that this proposal is acceptable because of the particular circumstances. Disclosure is only temporarily prohibited and the policy underlying s.29A was thoroughly debated during its passage through Parliament last year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The other minor amendment affects section 12 of the Act. As indicated in its response to the PJC Report, the Government and members of the IGC have considered the position of subsections 12(4) and (5), which were criticised as unclear by the South Australian Supreme Court in the 1989 case of Carbone. Clause 9 of the Bill repeals those subsections.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In conclusion, I would like briefly to reiterate some of the general points made in the Government's statement tabled on 1 June. I believe the work of the NCA over the past eight years has by and large been very successful and that this reflects both the qualities of those who have worked in the NCA and the essential soundness of the legislative scheme into which Parliament put so much effort in 1983 and 1984. Nonetheless, there will continue to be a need for fine tuning of the legislation from time to time and I take this opportunity to thank the PJC again for the important contribution it has made to this process through its Report "Who is to Guard the Guards?".</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Government Response to the Report of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs in relation to "Mergers, Monopolies and Acquisitions&mdash;Adequacy of Existing Legislative Controls</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this document is to provide the Government's response to the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs entitled "Mergers, Monopolies and Acquisitions&mdash;Adequacy of Existing Legislative Controls". That report, completed on 19 December 1991, has frequently been referred to as the "Cooney Committee Report" in recognition of Senator Cooney's chairmanship of the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2. The Government has already announced publicly its decisions on several major issues, in view of the widespread interest in these issues. This response addresses the issues in more detail.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs prepared a report in 1989 on similar issues, entitled "Mergers, Takeovers and Monopolies: Profiting from Competition?", which has subsequently been commonly referred to as the "Griffiths Committee Report" similarly in recognition of the then chairmanship of the Committee by the Hon Mr Alan Griffiths MP. On 22 August 1991 the Government's response to that report was tabled. In so doing, it was noted that the Senate had referred substantially similar matters to its Standing Committee, and that the detail of the response would be reconsidered as necessary in the light of the views expressed by the Senate Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4. That reconsideration has now occurred. This response therefore presents the considered view of the Government on the wide range of matters considered by both Committees. The Government will now move to prepare and introduce into the Parliament for passage at an early date legislation to give effect to the changes affecting the merger test, penalty increases, unconscionable conduct and enforcement of undertakings and, in the case of other issues such as pre-merger notification and enhanced remedies, will prepare detailed legislative proposals for exposure and public comment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5. Both Committees reviewed the operation of the Trade Practices Act within the context of its present constitutional reach, and neither examined the present constitutional and statutory exclusions from the ambit of the Act. Extension of the Act to matters currently beyond its reach, whether by amendment of the present express exclusions contained within the Act or by some enabling mechanism agreed with State Governments, is a separate and distinct matter that is being addressed by Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6. The significance of trade practices laws in our economy is not something that needs to be emphasised&mdash;it is universally recognised. The work of both Committees has also had the important effect of widening the public debate on a number of very important and fundamental trade practices issues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">7. Before addressing the specific recommendations of the Cooney Committee Report, the Government thanks the members of both Committees and of all political persuasions whose hard work has now ensured that important issues under consideration have been widely debated and that those with an interest in them have had ample opportunity to air their views. Both Committees adopted novel approaches to soliciting views on matters within their terms of reference. The Griffiths Committee held a workshop attended by a large number of distinguished practitioners and other interested persons. The Cooney Committee held its hearings in a plenary debate style which ensured that the issues were fully explored. While the Government has not been moved to adopt every recommendation of each of the Committees, it has been greatly assisted in its deliberations not only by the Reports of each Committee but also by the submissions made to each Committee and by the transcripts of Committee hearings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">8. The Government's response to the specific recommendations of the Cooney Committee Report follows. As appropriate, references are made to the relevant recommendation of the Griffiths Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mergers and acquisitions: the appropriate test</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 1:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">9. The Cooney Committee recommended (by majority) that:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"section 50 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 be amended to prohibit mergers or acquisitions which would have the effect or likely effect of substantially lessening competition in a substantial market for goods [or] services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">10. By contrast, the Griffiths Committee recommended (again by majority) that the test set out in section 50 not be amended.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">11. The Government has decided to accept this recommendation of the Cooney Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">12. Section 50 currently prohibits, unless authorised on public benefit grounds, mergers or acquisitions which would enable a corporation "to dominate a [substantial] market for goods or services".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">13. The recommended amendment would introduce into section 50 phraseology used elsewhere in other provisions of Part IV of the Trade Practices Act dealing with conduct within existing market structures when it is necessary to show an anticompetitive effect as part of proving a contravention.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">14. A "substantial lessening of competition" test would subject to scrutiny more mergers and acquisitions than are currently caught by the existing test. Such would, however, remain capable of prior authorisation on public benefit grounds. The purpose therefore would be to provide the Commission with enhanced ability to satisfy itself that significant mergers and acquisitions were not likely to unjustifiably stand in the way of the benefits of a more competitive market place.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">15. Views expressed to the Committee on this issue were starkly divided and there is no clear answer which can be reached on the basis of empirical evidence. Nevertheless, the recommended change would place increased emphasis on the competitive process and is therefore consistent with the Government's philosophy and belief that competition is a key element in the successful attainment of micro-economic reform.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">16. The Cooney Committee sought to assess the success or otherwise of section 50 in achieving the aims set for it when it was first introduced. Prior to 1977, section 50 did contain a test of "substantial lessening of competition". In that year the then coalition Government introduced the present test. In so doing, its stated aim was to enable Australian businesses to compete more effectively on export markets. In testing the achievement of that aim, the Committee reviewed the results of a number of research studies. Its conclusion was that:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The Committee finds that the empirical evidence on the effects of mergers is conflicting and not conclusive. The economic evidence that mergers actually result in productive efficiencies remains equivocal. Nor is it clear that efficiencies, where they have occurred, have improved the international competitiveness of Australian films, or resulted in demonstrable benefits to consumers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">17. The Committee also noted that:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"There is a poor bank of available studies based on empirical research into the Australian economy. There is no work of which the Committee has been made aware which would compel it to come to a particular conclusion. However, there is material which provides it with significant help. The Competitive Advantage of Nations by Professor Michael Porter has been quoted already. Generally it was treated with considerable respect by those who made submissions to the Committee. The thrust of Professor Porter's work supports a change in section 50.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">18. In reaching its conclusions, the Committee examined a large number of mergers which the Trade Practices Commission claimed it had been unable to appropriately deal with under the present test. It noted that:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">". . . there is a substantial body of material before the Committee expressing concern about mergers and acquisitions such as that of The Herald and Weekly Times by News Limited, that of Berger and British Paints by ICI (Dulux), that of McPherson's Steel by Tubemakers, and the joining together of Coles and Myers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">19. While the Government believes that the analysis of these past mergers is to some extent indecisive, it is nevertheless concerned that there are some mergers of significance which might escape the present net but which should, in the public interest, be subjected to scrutiny.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">20. The Government notes that the case for change is not so compelling that contrary arguments are untenable. Its conclusion that this recommendation of the Committee should be accepted is formed on balance. The Government believes that this change is important, but, at the same time, it views it as a refinement of the present Act and not as a change which so fundamentally alters direction that it should be rejected. While some proponents of the change have argued that it would introduce undesirable uncertainty into the law, it is noted that the present law uses the same terminology in other contexts. Moreover, the Attorney-General has indicated to the Trade Practices Commission that he considers there is a need for it to revise and reissue its merger guidelines to provide the maximum possible information to business as to how the Commission will administer the changed test.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 2:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">21. The Committee recommended that:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">". . . to make clear the ambit of the new test, guidelines be incorporated in the Trade Practices Act 1974.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">22. The Government believes that there is good sense in including in the Trade Practices Act a non-exclusive list of factors to which the Commission, the Trade Practices Tribunal and the courts are to have regard when taking section 50 decisions. While such factors would not compel any particular conclusion in the individual case, they would nevertheless provide guidance to the public and to the Commission, the Tribunal and the courts in the formulation of their own views and would assist those making submissions to these bodies to ensure that they address relevant criteria.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">23. These guidelines would only relate to the threshold question of whether or not a particular transaction would have the requisite effect on competition. They would not inhibit the range of matters to which the Commission and the Tribunal can have regard in deciding an authorisation application. In this regard, the stated concern behind the original move to a dominance test, ie the desirability of enhancing the competitive position of Australian firms in overseas markets, can properly be argued in the authorisation context. While the Government believes that it would be undesirable to seek to codify the many and diverse elements which might be relevant to "public benefit" in any particular case, it nevertheless considers that there should be specific reference in the Act recognising as a public benefit matters going to export potential and the substitution of domestic products for imported goods.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 3:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">24. The Committee recommended that:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">". . . the guidelines should contain criteria including:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the level of concentration in the market;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the likely level of foreign competition in the market; </PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the availability of product substitutes;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">barriers to entry;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">whether one party to the merger is a failing firm;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the likelihood that the proposed merger would remove a vigorous and effective competitor;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the extent to which effective competition remains or would remain in the market;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">change and innovation in the market;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the ability to significantly increase prices following a merger; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">any other factors relevant to competition in a market.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">25. The Government accepts this recommendation in principle. It has elaborated on the Committee's suggestions so as to reflect the range of factors that will most commonly provide assistance to the courts, the Trade Practices Commission, the Trade Practices Tribunal and to private litigants in determining if there has been a substantial lessening of competition. The amending legislation will set out the following factors while making it clear that there may be others that are relevant:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) the actual and potential level of import competition in the relevant market;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) the height of barriers to entry;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) the level of concentration in the relevant market; (d) the degree of countervailing power;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(e) the ability of the merged firm to increase prices or profit margins significantly and sustainably;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(f) the extent to which acceptable substitutes for the products of the merged firm are available or likely to be available;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(g) the dynamic characteristics of the market, including growth, innovation and product differentiation;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(h) the likelihood the merger would result in the removal of a vigorous and effective competitor, and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i) the nature and extent of vertical integration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While it may well be thought that each of the above factors should already be considered in a proper application of the present test, there are real benefits, particularly when coupled with the move to a substantial lessening of competition test, in including such a listing of indicative factors to emphasise the focus of the test on competition.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 4:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">26. The Committee recommended that:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">" . . . where a proposed merger fails to meet the test including the guidelines the Trade Practices Commission should nevertheless have the power to authorise it when it is for the benefit of the public. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">27. The Government accepts this recommendation. Except for those limited examples of anti-competitive conduct which are declared by the Trade Practices Act to be `per se' unlawful (eg, </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">price-fixing agreements), it is a consistent principle of the Act that anti-competitive conduct should be capable of authorisation where the ensuing benefit to the public outweighs the detriment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Compulsory pre-merger notification</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendations 5 and 6:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">28. The Committee recommended that:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">" . . . it be obligatory for a notice to be given to the Trade Practices Commission where mergers or acquisitions of a substantial nature are proposed. What is a matter of a substantial nature should be defined in the Act. The matters of which notice is to be given should be limited so that undue burden is not cast on those who must comply</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and that:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">" . . . proposals for what the notice is to contain should be drawn up by the Attorney-General' s Department and released for public comment. The proposal should be drawn up on the basis that those seeking a merger or an acquisition should not have to comply with requirements that are too vague, onerous or vexatious.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">29. The Government accepts these recommendations in principle.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">30. In the Attorney-General's statement to the House of 22 August 1991 he announced that the Government had rejected the recommendation of the Griffiths Committee that a system of pre-merger notification should not be introduced. The Attorney-General said in an associated press release that the Government would move to amend the Trade Practices Act to include:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">" . . . an administratively simple pre-merger notification scheme designed to give the TPC adequate opportunity to examine mergers before they take place, while at the same time ensuring that the Trade Practices Act places minimum impediment in the way of business&mdash;this scheme will allow mergers to proceed prior to the grant of authorisation on the basis of enforceable undertakings given to the TPC, as an alternative to requiring authorisation prior to the merger . . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">31. The scheme to which the Attorney-General then referred is outlined in more detail at paragraph 4.34 of the Cooney Committee Report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">32. The Committee was concerned that this scheme should only be implemented if it can be developed so as to operate in a simple and non-intrusive way. The Government shares that concern.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">33. Accordingly, the Attorney-General's Department will develop draft legislative proposals for introduction and exposure for public comment as soon as possible. It is intended that the notification requirements will be simple, and the Government is concerned to avoid creating a notification "net" which is cast too widely or is too complex. At the same time, it is important that the Commission should receive timely advance notification of significant transactions. The preparation of these exposure proposals will not be undertaken until legislation to effect the other amendments outlined in this statement has been developed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mandatory authorisation and sensitive industries</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 7:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">34. The Committee recommended that:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">" . . . section 50 should remain legislation aimed at protecting competition generally. Where there are other than economic issues involved in industry structure or ownership, they may well be dealt with in specific legislation. For example, at the moment, there are issues arising in the banking and media industries which could be dealt with in terms of discrete legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">35. Other Committees of the Parliament have in recent times separately considered the treatment of mergers and acquisitions in two specific industries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">36. First, the Martin Committee recommended that the Treasurer, in exercising his powers under the Banking Act, should seek the advice of the Trade Practices Commission as to whether or not a proposed banking merger would substantially lessen competition. Implementation of that recommendation would not necessarily require legislative amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">37. Second, the Lee Committee recommended that, whatever the generally applicable section 50 test might be, mergers and acquisitions in the print media should be subject to prohibition unless authorised where they would have the effect of substantially lessening competition.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">38. The Government's decision to accept the recommendation of the Cooney Committee to revert to a substantial lessening of competition test for mergers is consistent with the recommendations of each of the Martin and Lee reports.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">39. The Government accepts the thrust of this recommendation of the Cooney Committee in the following senses:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">section 50 should remain a provision of general application; the test embodied in that provision should not be unduly influenced by the special needs of any particular industry; the Trade Practices Act should not contain any broad power to apply a special regime to mergers and acquisitions within particular industries which may be thought from time to time to be particularly "sensitive"; whether or not the Trade Practices Commission should have a role in the application of any special test to a particular industry should be decided on a case-by-case basis; where the issues to be decided involve an assessment of anti-competitive impact and a balancing of such against public benefit, a role for the Commission is prima facie applicable; and where the issues do not involve such an assessment and balancing, prima facie the Commission should not have a role.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Authorisation Processes</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 8:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">40. The Committee recommended that:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">" . . . parties proposing a merger should have the option of either approaching the Trade Practices Commission for authorisation, with a right of appeal to the Trade Practices Tribunal, or of approaching the Trade Practices Tribunal directly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">41. The Government has decided not to accept this recommendation. Under the present law, the Trade Practices Commission is the primary decision-maker and the Tribunal is the review body. This hierarchy has been established in the interests of the most efficient use of limited resources, the availability of merits review, and accountability to those most affected by decision-making.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">42. There seems to be little point in abandoning this two-tier mechanism. There is either merits review, or there is not. If proponents of a merger are to have the option of seeking a decision that is not appellable, they can currently put themselves in that position at present by themselves deciding not to appeal to the Tribunal from an unfavourable Commission decision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">43. Apart from these systemic issues, there would be practical difficulties in implementing the Committee's recommendation. The Tribunal would need to have resources made available to it in duplication of those already available to the Commission if it were truly to be able to undertake the primary decision-making role of the Commission. Alternatively, if it were to adopt only an adjudicative role as between two adversarial parties, the Commission could be put in the position of having to contest before the Tribunal a merger that it had not investigated and on which it had formed no view as to either the effect on competition or public benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 9:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">44. The Committee recommended that:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">" . . . strict time limits be imposed on the Trade Practices Commission and the Trade Practices Tribunal within which they are to determine authorisation applications or appeals. The Commission should continue to be required to determine applications within 45 days. Any appeal from a decision of the Commission to the Tribunal should be determined by the Tribunal within 45 days. Where the Tribunal is approached directly, it should be required to determine an application within 60 days.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">45. The Government is conscious that the new merger test will result in some increase in applications to the Commission for authorisation of a merger on public benefit grounds. It therefore wishes to ensure that decisions on authorisation applications are taken by the Commission, and on appeal by the Trade Practices Tribunal, in as short a time as is possible. The current 45 day time limit on the Commission will in most cases be reduced to 30 days, while the Tribunal will generally be expected to complete a review within 60 days unless it orders otherwise.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 10:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">46. The Committee recommended that adequate funding should be provided to the Commission and the Tribunal to enable implementation of Recommendations 8 and 9. The Government's belief is that both bodies are adequately resourced to meet their present workloads and that adequate procedures exist to allow supplementation of present resources to meet any increase in workload, including any increase in workload that may flow from the changes the Government is proposing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Misuse of market power: s.46</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 11:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">47. The Committee recommended that:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">" . . . section 46 be amended by adding a further subsection to provide that, although the Trade Practices Commission has the overall onus of proving breach of that section, when it has brought forward evidence which makes it as likely as not that one has occurred then one will be taken to have occurred unless the corporation in question shows otherwise.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">48. The Government has decided that it cannot accept this recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">49. It is apparent from the Committee's report that the Committee, having rejected (and correctly so in the view of the Government) suggestions that an "effects" test be included within section 46, was trying to find a way of assisting the Commission in the difficult task of proving intent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">50. But the proposal embodied in this recommendation (which was apparently not debated in the public hearings of the Committee) is, in the view of the Government, either self-contradictory and will not work or alternatively is ambiguous and should not be implemented.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">51. If the Commission is to retain "the overall onus of proving breach", then such shall remain to be done on the balance of probabilities and it will not have satisfied that onus if it is able to demonstrate only that a proscribed purpose is no more likely than an innocent purpose. Accordingly, if the respondent remains silent, the Commission will necessarily fail in its prosecution notwithstanding the temporary shifting of onus to the defendant.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">52. Alternatively, if the Committee intended that, in effect, the standard of proof for offences bearing potentially severe pecuniary penalties should be reduced from the balance of probabilities to "as likely as not", such a recommendation cannot be accepted. Where action is taken for an innocent purpose, an obligation to create contemporaneous proof that it is not undertaken for a proscribed purpose cannot effectively be imposed. In the absence of such an obligation and positive proof of proscribed purpose, the Commission's case would always be defeated by a mere denial of unlawfulness.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">53. Sub-section 46(7) of the Act, to which the Committee's report makes no reference, already contains a provision to facilitate the finding of a purpose contrary to section 46. This enables the proscribed purpose to be inferred from the conduct of the corporation or of any other person or from other relevant circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 12:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">54. The Committee recommended that:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">" . . . section 46 be amended to provide that where persons engage in conduct for the purpose of eliminating from or harming a class of persons in a market they shall be taken to be doing so in respect of a specified member of it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">55. The Government accepts this recommendation for the reasons set out in the Committee's report and in the submission to the Committee by the Attorney-General's Department.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 13:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">56. The Committee recommended that:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">" . . . serious and persistent misuse of market power be dealt with by increased monetary penalties [and that] divestiture not be made available as a remedy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">57. The Government accepts this recommendation. It notes that there is little if any evidence of serious and persistent breach of section 46. In any event the increases in the level of monetary penalties should be effective in discouraging serious and persistent misuse of market power in the future. The Government would be extremely averse to extending the present divestiture power (for breach of section 50) in the absence of that evidence, having regard to the serious limitations on that remedy detailed in the submission to the Committee made by the Attorney-General's Department.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unconscionable conduct</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendations 14 and 15:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">58. The Committee recommended that:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">" . . . section 52A of the Trade Practices Act be repealed . . . [and that] legislation be introduced giving the Trade Practices Commission the ability to bring proceedings on behalf of a person who has a right of action at common law arising from the unconscionable conduct of another . . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and that:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">" . . . appropriate funds be made available to the Trade Practices Commission to enable this to be done.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">59. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology (the `Beddall Committee') report recommended in 1990 that section 52A of the Act, which prohibits unconscionable conduct in consumer transactions, should be extended to small business transactions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">60. By contrast, the Griffiths Committee considered that if the Trade Practices Commission wished to pursue the proposal to extend s.52A, it needed to develop persuasive arguments to counter the concerns of the business community and legal profession.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">61. On 22 August 1991, the Attorney-General announced that the Government had decided to extend sub-section 52A(1), but not other provisions of section 52A, to all transactions in trade and commerce. Sub-section 52A(1) prohibits unconscionable conduct while other provisions of that section seek to define and expand on the meaning of that term. The intention behind that decision was to reflect in statute the Government's opprobrium of conduct meeting the description of "unconscionable" in the existing law; to impute the equitable meaning as it applied from time to time; to make available Trade Practices Act remedies; and to enable the Trade Practices Commission to undertake representative actions in appropriate cases.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">62. The Committee, in considering whether section 52A should be extended to commercial dealings, was influenced by the view that the section "may not have the ability to develop in the way the common law has".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">63. The Government believes that it is important both that the existing section 52A be retained to ensure that consumer rights are not diminished, and that a new provision be enacted in the Trade Practices Act prohibiting corporations from engaging in unconscionable conduct in trade and commerce. The Government considers that it should be possible to draft the new provision to meet the underlying concerns of the Committee quoted above.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">64. So far as funding is concerned, the Commission and the Department of Finance review from time to time the Commission's need for litigation resources on a case-by-case basis and there is no reason why that process should not be adequate in this instance. While this amendment could be one of importance, it is not expected that representative actions by the Commission would be frequent or regular.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Pecuniary penalties</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendations 16 and 17:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">65. The Committee recommended that:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">" . . . subsection 76(1) of the Trade Practices Act be amended to substantially increase penalties available to punish breaches of the provisions of Part IV of the Act . . . ";</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and that:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">" . . . subsection 79(1) . . . be amended to substantially increase the pecuniary penalties to punish breaches of the provisions of Part V of the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">66. The Griffiths Committee recommended that penalties be substantially increased for breach of sections 46 and 50.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">67. On 22 August 1991, the Attorney-General announced that the Government had decided to increase penalties for breaches of those sections to $10m for bodies corporate and $500,000 for individuals, and that the Government was still to consider the range of penalties which should be applicable to sections other than sections 46 and 50.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">68. In its submission to the Cooney Committee, the Attorney-General's Department argued for the following levels of penalty to be generally applicable: for Part IV: for bodies corporate&mdash;$10m; for individuals&mdash;$500,000; and for Part V: for bodies corporate&mdash;$200,000; for individuals&mdash;$40,000.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">69. The Government is committed to ensuring that the Trade Practices Act is enforced effectively. It takes the view that pecuniary penalties are a necessary component of that enforcement, and that they should be set at a sufficient deterrent and exemplary level appropriate to the nature of the offence involved. The present level has been widely recognised as quite insufficient, particularly in the light of the financial benefits that can be derived from conduct which is proscribed by the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">70. The Government has decided that the increase in penalties should not apply in relation to sections 45D and 45E: that is, the existing level of penalties will continue to apply to those provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">71. It is instructive to examine the history of the use of those provisions. In the more than 200 cases brought under sections 45D and 45E since their inception, a pecuniary penalty has never been sought in any case. Only the Trade Practices Commission or the Minister are able to take action for pecuniary penalties. The primary objective of both the Commission and the Minister should be the resolution of the underlying dispute rather than the imposition of a penalty.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">72. The history of the provisions, administered by Governments of both persuasions, clearly indicates that pecuniary penalties are not necessary for effective enforcement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">73. In almost all actions brought under these sections, the underlying dispute has been resolved by interim or final injunction, or by arbitration or negotiation brought about by the threat of litigation to seek injunctive relief. In a very few cases, damages have been awarded for breach of injunction; in other cases, costs of litigation have been awarded.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">74. It is clear then, that the effective operation of these sections does not depend upon the level of pecuniary penalties, and therefore there is no need to increase them for infringements of the sections.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">75. There has been some criticism by the Business Council of Australia and others of the proposed maximum $10 million pecuniary penalty for other Part IV provisions. The present levels of penalty for Part IV offences were introduced in 1974 and have not been updated by any Government since that time. Both the effects of inflation and community acceptance of the need for business to abide by the standards of conduct dictated by the Act warrant a substantial increase. So too does the level of penalties for comparable conduct in other countries, and this was specifically recognised by the Committee&mdash;for example, $10m in the United States and Canada, potentially considerably more in the European Economic Community, and $5m in New Zealand.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">76. On these bases, the Government has decided that the level it proposes is not inappropriate. It needs to be borne in mind that the maximum penalty is applicable only to the worst possible breach. That may be, for example, for a long-standing price fixing agreement which has netted the parties far more than the maximum possible penalty in artificially inflated profits at the expense of the Australian community generally. The courts will ensure that the penalty imposed in any particular case is no more than is appropriate to the severity of the particular offence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Private right to injunctive relief</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 18:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">77. The Committee recommended that:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">" . . . the private right to injunctive relief in relation to mergers not be reintroduced into the Trade Practices Act 1974.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">78. The Griffiths Committee had supported reintroduction of the right subject to it not being available to use by target companies or "white knights". On 22 August 1991 the Attorney-General announced that the Government was prepared to accept that recommendation subject to reconsideration in light of the report of the Cooney Committee. As noted, the Committee has now recommended against reintroduction of the right, because it was not convinced that the potential for abuse of the right could be adequately limited. On subsequent reconsideration, the Government has concluded that this is the better view and thus it has accepted this recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Enforceability of undertakings</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 19:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">79. The Committee recommended that:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">" . . . the Trade Practices Act be amended to provide remedies for breaches of undertakings made between the Trade Practices Commission and another person or persons.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">80. This recommendation accords with the conclusions of the Griffiths Committee and with the Attorney-General's announcement of the Government's decision in this regard on 22 August 1991. The Government accepts the recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other Remedies</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 20:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">81. The Committee recommended that:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">" . . . consideration be given by the Attorney-General to introducing a range of appropriate remedies for contraventions of Part IV of the Trade Practices Act 1974.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">82. In the Attorney-General's announcement of 22 August 1991, it was stated that the Government had agreed upon enhanced remedies for the Trade Practices Commission and private litigants. Further details of these proposals were set out in the submission of the Attorney-General's Department to the Committee. The Government accepts this recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Implementation of recommendations</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 21:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">83. The Committee recommended that:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">" . . . the details of any proposed amendments to the Act should be developed by the Attorney-General's Department following consultation with all relevant parties and released by way of Exposure Draft Bill for public comment. Public comment should occur over a reasonable time period of not less than three months.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">84. The Government is firmly committed to the development of laws in consultation with those affected by them, and particularly so in relation to business laws. It is thus supportive of this recommendation in principle. It will be adopted for those matters which have not already been the subject of discussion and debate as to the details&mdash;the  introduction of pre-merger notification and new and enhanced remedies. However, for the other matters of the merger test and the factors to apply in its application, enforcement of undertakings, unconscionable conduct, penalties and the minor amendment to section 46, the Government considers that the processes of the Griffiths Committee and the Cooney Committee, and associated consultations which the Attorney-General and his Department have had with relevant interests, make it now appropriate to move to final implementation.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator Aulich</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am writing to formally provide the Government's response to your Committee's report entitled `The John Curtin School of Medical Research', which was tabled in the Senate on 30 April 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are three matters in the Report that call for a Government response. These are the introduction of 5-year rolling appointments for non-tenured members of the School; the provision of funds for the School via the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services (HHCS); and having future committees of inquiry make explicit and public the procedures they intend to follow.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In response to the Committee's recommendation on the `introduction of 5-year rolling appointments for non-tenured members of the School', the Government is totally in support of such a mechanism to ensure the best researchers are employed by the School, and retained over a longer period than was the case in the past. This initiative will be taken up within the new arrangements agreed between HHCS and the Australian National University.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is proceeding with the transfer of funds from the Department of Employment, Education and Training to HHCS. The Government sees merit in the argument that there is advantage for the School being linked, through association with HHCS, to the mainstream Australian health and biomedical research networks. To this end, an agreement was signed between the ANU and HHCS on 12 May 1992. This agreement includes the establishment of a Liaison Committee to oversee the implementation of the arrangements agreed between the University and the Department and these arrangements will be monitored by the Government as they are progressively implemented. The agreement also provides for quinquennial reviews of the School which will be coordinated with the reviews of the other research schools. Such reviews will provide the JCSMR with the opportunity to confirm its standing in the research community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government accepts that it is desirable for committees of inquiry to make explicit and public the procedures they intend to follow. However, it believes that prescribing such procedures is not a practical option, as the circumstances of various inquiries differ. Committees should be free to decide the most effective way of conducting their inquiries having regard to their terms of reference, time constraints and resources.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government believes that the new arrangements for the JCSMR will be of benefit to the School and is looking forward to constructive relationships between HHCS, the ANU and the School which are aimed at further enhancing the School's scientific reputation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to comment on the Government's overdue response to the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training on the John Curtin School of Medical Research. This response is typical of the poor attitude that the Government has had towards this whole issue. As shown in the report, the Senate Committee looked at the actions of the Government with regard to the funding of the John Curtin School. The Government has taken funding as part of the Australian National University and placed it in the hands of the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services. In this way, the Government has the facility to directly influence the projects and research undertaken at the John Curtin School.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an outrageous action by the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe). It, in effect, circumvents the will of the Parliament. It is amputating a dynamic and integral part of the university. It is an invasion of the autonomy of the university. It has been done against the will of those involved at the John Curtin School, as indicated by their staff meetings on this issue. It has been done against the will of the Australian National University, as indicated by the resolutions on this issue by the ANU Council. It has been done against the will of two of the founding fathers of the University, Sir Mark Oliphant and Dr H.C. Coombs, both of whom have voiced vehement opposition to the actions of the Minister, and now the Minister also has this very chamber standing against him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the Senate Standing Committee handed down its report, the Senate has passed a private senator's Bill introduced by me requiring the Minister to return the funding of the JCSMR to DEET where it belongs. This Bill ensures the autonomy of the ANU and has overwhelming support from the Australian National University. The Government refuses, however, to bring this Bill on for debate in the other place, as it knows it is wrong and it knows it should never have interfered with the autonomy of the ANU in the first place. It is clear that the Minister must not be allowed to continue with this action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate Standing Committee looked at the basis on which the Minister had made his decisions to intervene so radically in the internal affairs of an autonomous university. The actions of the Minister were precipitated by the findings of the Stephen Committee. The Stephen Committee was established to look at the operations of the Institute of Advanced Studies within the ANU. The result was that Committee singled out the John Curtin School of Medical Research for considerable criticism and recommended the radical moves that the Minister has instituted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me quote from the report we presented to the Senate and to which the Government is responding today:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Senate Committee is unanimous in its concerns over shortcomings in the processes followed by the Stephen Committee during its review of the Institute insofar as this related to the John Curtin School. The Senate Committee considers that such shortcomings diminish the value of the decisions arrived at.</PARA>
<PARA>There is no doubt that the findings of the Stephen Committee can be seriously questioned. The process of collecting evidence, communicating with the School and consulting with the Australian National University left a lot to be desired. Bound by the evidence before it, the Senate Committee believed that the shortcomings of the Stephen Committee review process detracted from the validity of its conclusions and brings into question the actions predicated upon its findings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear from the evidence presented before the Senate Committee that the proposed funding changes have disadvantaged both the John Curtin School and the ANU. The Minister has failed to demonstrate any overriding benefit from this transfer. It is also clear that the autonomy of Australian universities in general is threatened by these new arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The JCSMR is unlike any other medical research institute funded through the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services. The difference with the John Curtin School is that it is an integral part of a university and not merely affiliated with one. The removal of funding from DEET sets a precedent for a situation where any faculty from any university could be removed from the purview of DEET and placed in the hands of other departments whose operations are viewed as being congruent with the subject matter of the faculty concerned. Clearly, this is an undesirable situation and cannot be tolerated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This response to the original report only addresses three of the issues that were originally raised by the Senate inquiry. Thankfully, the Government agrees with the Committee's recommendation on the introduction of five-year rolling appointments for non-tenured members of the JCSMR and I look forward to the prompt implementation of this recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report then goes on to advise that the Government is ignoring the report of the Senate Standing Committee and proceeding with the transfer of funding from DEET to the DHHCS anyway. This is simply a pig-headed attitude by the Government, and in particular the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services, Mr Baldwin, in the face of overwhelming opposition. The Government has the JCSMR against it. It has the ANU against it, including the founding fathers, Sir Mark Oliphant and Dr H.C. Coombs. It has the Senate Standing Committee against it and, with the passing of the ANU Amendment (Autonomy) Bill through this chamber, the Government has the Australian Senate against it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has also failed to address properly one of the key recommendations in the JCSMR report. Given the poor information gathering procedures of the Stephen Committee, and the way in which it changed its terms of reference over the period of the inquiry, the Senate Committee suggested that in future such inquiries make clear their intentions and make their information gathering procedures explicit and public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this response the Government accepts this suggestion, but misinterprets the Senate Committee by suggesting that the Committee wanted such procedures prescribed for all such inquiries. Clearly, this is nonsense and the Senate Committee at no stage suggested this. It is unfortunate that the Government has not properly considered this report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most desirable mechanism for the control and administration of the John Curtin School is through the ANU as it was originally established. This means that the funding must come through DEET. Given the findings of the Senate Committee, the Minister must reverse his decision and return the funding arrangements to DEET. The decision by the Minister has been based on poor information and it cannot be demonstrated that the Minister's actions will actually correct any problems that were identified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I urge the Government to properly consider this report of the Senate Standing Committee and bring the ANU Amendment (Autonomy) Bill on for debate in the other place and pass that legislation to return the funding of the JCSMR to the ANU where it rightfully belongs.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>I have moved this motion because I briefly want to refer to one experience that constituents of mine had with the Department. The Department answered questions at the Estimates Committee hearings recently as to when this report would be presented and referred specifically to the matters I had asked a colleague to raise as to the length of time it takes to get an age pension. The answer was 21, 28 or 56 days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although this may be the only case that has caused delay, I would emphasise that it has caused considerable distress to my constituents. They wrote to the Minister for Social Security (Dr Blewett) not because it will help them, but perhaps in the hope that some action can be taken to save others the distress they experienced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My constituents put in their application for the age pension prior to the man retiring, as they had been told they were entitled to do. The first thing they received was a letter saying that the woman was not eligible because her husband was in employment. That matter was cleared up. They went back to the Department when the man in question retired and had the papers copied. They were told that it would be about six weeks before the pension would become available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Subsequently they received a telephone call saying that their birth certificates were needed for proof of identity, even though the original form they had dealt with listed birth certificates as an option for proof of identity. When this form was lodged, such proof was not raised as a necessity. This caused some problems because they did not have ready access to their birth certificates and considerable delay was caused at this point. I hope that the new performance statements contained in this document will clear that matter up. People will then know precisely what they need when they apply for their pension and it is to be hoped that this sort of delay will not occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These people had been led to believe that they would be eligible for a full pension, but in fact got a half pension. That is not the aspect to which they refer, although they found it somewhat distressing. Certainly they find the position bemusing because they only have some insurance policies that will not mature for several years and a small amount of money in the bank. However, that matter can be followed up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It took them over three months to get any pension. This  was highly distressing at a time when they found that, having worked for many years and having had a regular income, they suddenly were not in receipt of income at all. They were in no way prepared for the sort of delay that occurred, nor did they have the expectation that this would happen. That is the reason why they have asked that their case be highlighted. It took four months before they received any pension. I will quote from their letter:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Trips to the Social Security office are no picnic. Each trip&mdash;and we had three&mdash;involved about one and a half hours, much of that standing either to be registered or at the counter being interviewed.</PARA>
<PARA>They go on to say in their letter to the Minister that during all their phone calls and interface with staff they felt that the staff appeared to know what they were doing and were always polite. However, they felt that the delays that they suffered should not have occurred and that the forms and information which are provided should be sufficiently clear in the first place so that this kind of delay will not happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is my hope that the performance standards which have now been put together by the Department will alleviate this problem. Even though the staff are knowledgeable and helpful, there is a certain level of stress involved in going to Social Security and embarking upon an application for something in a totally different environment from which that person has been involved in previously. There is a level of stress associated with that. When it then results in delays that really need not and should not occur, that is very unfortunate indeed. I hope these performance standards will mean that others in the future will not have the same experience as did my constituents. </PARA>

<PARA>It gives me a great deal of pleasure to be tabling the 319th report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Review of the Independent Auditor&mdash;watching the watchdog</EMPHASIS>. This is the first review by the Public Accounts Committee of the Independent Auditor to the Australian National Audit Office. Under the Audit Act 1901 the Independent Auditor is appointed by the Governor-General on the advice of the Minister for Finance to audit the work of the Australian National Audit Office specifically to examine the accounts, records, financial statements and efficiency of that office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Audit Office audits government departments and government business enterprises and agencies such as the National Rail Corporation&mdash;and I might add that the Senate has confirmed this particular duty&mdash;the Independent Auditor is truly the watcher of the watchdog and the watchdog, of course, is the Auditor General. The position thus forms an essential link in the accountability chain which, we believe, is an integral part of the Westminster style of government which is practised here in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The provision for the appointment of an Independent Auditor was introduced in 1979 by an amendment to the Audit Act. I remind the Senate that the first Independent Auditor was Mr Evan Duff Cameron, a partner of the then Peat Marwick Hungerfords accounting firm. He served until May 1988, having been reappointed on a three-yearly basis. The last occupant was Mr Michael John Sharpe, an audit partner of the firm Coopers &amp; Lybrand. He was appointed on 1 June 1988 for an initial term of three years, which was subsequently extended until this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take this opportunity of commending Mr Sharpe on his professionalism and experience. This was amply demonstrated by his review of the Australian National Audit Office.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Committee fully endorses the decision of the Minister for Finance and is confident that Mr Boymal will undertake his task in the best traditions of the profession, being both impartial and meticulous. The Committee notes that the new Independent Auditor has indicated that he will conduct efficiency audits of the Australian National Audit Office on a rotating basis, covering specific activities on alternate years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The role of the Independent Auditor was briefly reviewed by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts in its 1989 report of an inquiry into the Australian Audit Office appropriately called, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Auditor-General: ally of the people and Parliament</EMPHASIS>. In acknowledging the critical role of the Audit Office, the Committee believed that parliament's evaluation of the work of the Independent Auditor was appropriate in terms of reassuring the parliament, government agencies and the public that the Australian National Audit Office was performing in accordance with the highest professional accounting standards, and was being evaluated to meet such expectations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In June 1991 the Joint Committee of Public Accounts called for submissions as part of its review of the Office of the Independent Auditor. It subsequently received 16 submissions from Commonwealth Government departments, private accountants and State Auditors-General. Overseas contributions came from Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. The Committee subsequently took evidence at a public hearing in Canberra on 8 May 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee noted that it has been past practice for arrangements for the exercise of the powers and the performance of the function of the Independent Auditor to be documented by memorandum rather than by legislation or regulation. However, evidence received indicated that there was a preference for an increased role of the parliament in the appointment process and in interactions with the Independent Auditor. The Joint Committee of Public Accounts considers that there should be a more formal arrangement between the Independent Auditor and the parliament and has recommended that either an audit committee of parliament or the JCPA is consulted in the appointment of the Independent Auditor and in the formulation of relevant legislation. I may add that as part of that consultation, meetings took place between the Committee, the Department of Finance and the Australian National Audit Office today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recommendations have also been made to increase the formal contact between the Committee and the Independent Auditor. There is an advantage in bringing to the position a completely independent perspective and enabling a sound comparison to be drawn between the operations of public and private sector audit offices. The current practice of appointing the Independent Auditor from the private sector is endorsed by the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee has addressed the possibility of conflicts of interest by recommending that the Independent Auditor is precluded from other contracts with the Commonwealth Government. As well, the Committee recommends that secrecy provisions similar to those applying to the Auditor-General and staff of the Australian National Audit Office should prevail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee has made several other recommendations to be considered during the drafting of revised legislation. For example, the selection criteria should be broadened and specified in legislation, as well as provisions providing appropriate procedures for resignation and removal of the Independent Auditor. The requirements of the Audit Act should also be brought into line with the current auditing practices and standards in Australia. I believe this will be the case when the new Audit Act comes to fruition. While the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) is here, I urge the Government to expedite the procedure for these three new Acts of Parliament covering financial administration to be introduced to the Parliament as soon as possible. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Joint Committee on the National Capital, I present the first report of the Committee entitled, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Our bush capital&mdash;protecting and managing the national capital's open spaces</EMPHASIS>.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA>I remind the Senate as to why this is the first report of the Joint Committee on the National Capital. This is the Committee which replaced the joint parliamentary committee on the Australian Capital Territory, the name of which was changed to this name just a few months ago. It fits in more closely with the present role of the Committee now that the Australian Capital Territory has its own government. The responsibility of the Committee relates to those areas which have been retained by the Federal Parliament and, thus, the name, the Committee on the National Capital. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was our first inquiry&mdash;inquiring into the aspects of the national capital open space system. We are indebted to the assistance we had from Ms Ann Lyons Wright, Ms Lindy Smith and Mrs Marlene Lyons, the staff who assisted in putting the report together and running the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most Canberrans believe the open space system has been there for all time, and in fact it has. The name itself is of more recent origin, but many Canberrans think that it is a name that in fact has been there for many years. It reflects the view that not only Canberrans but also other visitors to the national capital have of the sort of place this is&mdash;the bush capital, as the report is called. From a tourism point of view, that is an important feature to retain. We have referred to this aspect in the report, where we say in the summary at the beginning:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee is committed to the continued existence of what most people believe is the essential character of the national capital, a bush capital where the open spaces will be protected as the population continues to grow.</PARA>
<PARA>There are some 40 recommendations, and I hope that they will be looked at most carefully. We recognise that a number of them involve the expenditure of money. We are not able to give precise costings because we do not have that information. I read again from the summary where we say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recognises that there are costs involved in the recommendations which we have made. They are made on the basis of what we believe is necessary to achieve the long term goals of protecting the values of the National Capital Open Space System. We recognise that they can only be implemented as funding becomes available.</PARA>
<PARA>We feel that it is important to have the recommendations set down so at least those administering the areas on behalf of the Commonwealth will know what we believe should happen. We also recognise that the Commonwealth retained unto itself many of those responsibilities, through the legislation that was passed in the Parliament, given by the Commonwealth to the National Capital Planning Authority and the former Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories to administer. So the Commonwealth, having retained responsibilities, has an obligation for funding in the areas for which it is now responsible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One matter that needs to be pointed out relates to the planning, management and administrative arrangements of the system because of complexities. There are two land managers. I read again from the report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">National land . . . is managed . . . by the NCPA on behalf of the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories . . . The remainder, Territory Land, is under the administrative responsibility of the Territory government . . .</PARA>
<PARA>There are also two plans. The national capital plan determines the general land use plan for the ACT and the specific planning policies for designated areas. The Territory plan covers all other areas of the ACT and must not be inconsistent with the national capital plan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has always been a bit like that in Canberra, but I think it is important, if this Territory is to flourish, that confusion between the ACT role and the national role be kept to an absolute minimum; that we do not drive people away because of the bureaucratic nightmare that they encounter when they attempt to do business in Canberra. The two Federal and ACT departments responsible at the present time are endeavouring to work well together. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a specific recommendation, No. 10 at paragraph 4.38, that I wish to highlight. I hope the confusion about the names that are used to identify the open space system will be resolved quite quickly. The Committee was concerned to find that the NCPA uses the term `National Capital Open Space System'. It is embodied in the national capital plan. But the ACT Department of Environment, Land and Planning uses the term `Metropolitan Open Space System. I read from the report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It seems that if the system were only a metropolitan system there would be no call on the Commonwealth for a funding contribution to its planning and management. It is because the system is national in character and fulfils Commonwealth policies expressed through the National Capital Plan that the Committee feels strongly that the Commonwealth should make a greater financial contribution.</PARA>
<PARA>We also urge that the using of two different names for similar areas be removed as quickly as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I shall not go through many of the worthwhile recommendations in the report in detail. Open spaces are important to Canberra and, I believe, to the nation in a number of ways. They are particularly important to various faculties of the education institutions in Canberra. Research is carried out in them and they are used by the faculties&mdash;the CSIRO, University of Canberra and the Australian National University. That is important: education as a part of our economy is a very important aspect of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many students come here from the regions and from overseas. A centre of excellence in education is very important to our economy. For that reason, of course, it is particularly disappointing to find that the CSIRO is moving part of its headquarters from the national capital to Melbourne. No good reason has been given, to my knowledge. I am disappointed that the Federal Minister has not told CSIRO that it should not occur. Popular rumour as to why it is happening is less than acceptable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The open space system is also important for tourism. It is an area which people enjoy when they come here. The recent research of the National Capital Planning Authority into people's attitude to Canberra clearly shows that people like to come here because it is the national capital. All those things which make it attractive as a tourist destination are very important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The area is used also for recreation. We refer to that recreational use to which the open spaces can be put in the report. We recognise that some recreational use has a down side of wear and tear. We also recognise that there is no point in keeping places nobody ever visits and sees; that recreational use is very important and should feature in the management of the areas that we are referring to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have dealt with the role of the rural lessees in Canberra. Rural leases have been a shrinking part of the Australian Capital Territory which, in many ways, is important. The rural nature of this area is significant and ought to be part of the heritage of the ACT. It was important rural land long before Canberra was built. It is very much a part of our history. I hope we will always have some rural leases here because of the buffer zone, for the delight that they are and for the purpose that they fulfil. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also refer to the impact on the open space system of feral animals and intrusive plants. We deal in chapter 7 with feral animals relative to the impact they have on the property of the rural lessees. We heard evidence from the lessees about the impact of feral animals. A suggestion was made to us that pigs were being brought into the ACT for the purpose of capturing or shooting them for sport. If there is any substance whatever to that, I hope it will be tracked down and dealt with very harshly indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Feral animals make an enormous mess of the whole place. I include cats; we have dealt with cats in this report. We have referred to feral and domestic animals in the open space system&mdash;specifically, cats, dogs, pigs, horses, rabbits, goats, foxes and other introduced species. There is really no point in spending large sums of money on the open space system unless a fair amount of attention is paid to the feral animals living in the open spaces. They are certainly very costly to those people with rural leases in the area. The rural lessees concentrate, as they have to, on keeping these feral animals away from their properties, but there is really no point in having an open space system unless the Government gives the keeping of feral animals out of the open spaces a very high priority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a reference in the report to the Burley Griffin-designed parts of Canberra being given World Heritage listing. We have not dealt with that in detail, but we have suggested that the Federal and ACT governments look at whether that would be beneficial to Australia. Other capitals are listed as World Heritage sites. We believe that the two governments which have responsibility for this area could look at that possibility. It may be very worthwhile indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One is aware of the lack of funding in the past few years. One only needs to go on a short walk from here around the Parliamentary Triangle to see how it has been allowed to run down in recent times. A great deal of work needs to be done if it is to maintain its status as the central part of the national capital. I believe that the Minister has starved the National Capital Planning Authority of funds for this work, which really comes into the category of maintenance. It is not in the best interests of the national capital from any point of view for this to be allowed to happen, because undoubtedly the costs in the end will be a great deal more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have indicated that we believe in a review of the fire brigade and voluntary fire brigade services. It is important that the volunteer contribution be recognised and preserved. We say in the report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee commends the idea of volunteer fire brigades to assist in the protection of the NCOSS, particularly in the urban fringe areas, and suggests that it be considered by the ACT Government in its review of the emergency services.</PARA>
<PARA>Many more things could be dealt with, and I hope that people will read the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was interesting to read the speech given by the Chief Minister of the ACT just recently in the 1992 Walter Burley Griffin lecture entitled, `Keeping Canberra Canberra'. She referred to the Griffin plan a number of times in her speech and indicated his desire that it have a well-developed public transport system. She indicated that it is a part of her Government's policy that there should be a well-developed public transport system.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Chief Minister also referred to the Griffin concept of variety in housing. Walter Burley Griffin specifically referred to variety in styles of housing and its benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Chief Minister referred to the urban village concept.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was disappointed to find that in her speech she did not take up the challenge of the urban village design that has been presented to the Government in relation to the central portion of the suburb of Gungahlin, which is presently under construction. It is a well-designed, well-thought-out plan that incorporates the use of a public transport system and a different style of housing. I thought that it would have been an occasion for the Chief Minister to have given some substance to her wish when she said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our government hopes to ameliorate this trend, to increase the range of house types and to provide opportunities for an "urban village" lifestyle.</PARA>
<PARA>I urge her to have a close look at that and not miss the opportunity to do something with a bit of imagination in the development of Gungahlin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also noticed that she seemed a little ambivalent about the relationship of the ACT Government with the Commonwealth Government when she said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From a Territory perspective the Commonwealth seems to have embraced the idea that self-government has relieved it of its responsibilities towards Canberra, beyond that which is required in the general run of relations between the Commonwealth and other partners.</PARA>
<PARA>For some unstated reason, she then went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current opposition have made it clear they want to retreat from even that role.</PARA>
<PARA>There is no evidence whatever to substantiate that aside. The Chief Minister challenged the Commonwealth Government to remain involved and to make its contribution. Later in her speech she was critical of that Government wanting to have a say in Canberra. So clearly there are areas where things still need to be worked out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, my view is that the open space system is a very important part of the Australian Capital Territory of the national capital. The Commonwealth has retained it unto itself and, having done so, cannot now walk away from the responsibility of maintaining it. Our report recognises that there is a vast difference in maintaining an open space system from the days when there were 60,000 or 80,000 people living in the Territory to now, where the population is approaching 300,000. The pressures on open space areas are quite different when a larger population is living on the edge of them. So the role of the National Capital Planning Authority and the other departments in looking after the open space system will be critical. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No-one expects that everything we have suggested in the report can be done in a year or two. But it is hoped that this will be used as a blueprint for how the open space system can be managed, that in time it will be in a better state than it is at present and that the areas we have referred to that still need to be identified and gazetted will be. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Our Bush Capital</EMPHASIS> sets out our views as a result of consulting widely with the departments and the community.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a pleasure to work on a committee that involves the national capital with someone of the calibre of Senator Reid, who obviously has a commitment to this city and its people. Senator Reid has a dedication, understanding and even a love for the city that is her home. It was very beneficial for me to be able to take advice from her in my limited deliberations on this report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Canberra is our national capital and is a very fine city. At times, it suffers a deal of what has been referred to as `Canberra bashing' by people who in many instances should know better. It is rather wrongly placed criticism at times. People confuse the government of our nation with the city of Canberra. In other words, people who live in other parts of Australia sometimes refer to Canberra in derogatory terms when they are really referring to the government of the nation which sits in Canberra at present. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can well appreciate why people around Australia rightly criticise this Government for the recession and the huge unemployment that it has brought us, but it is wrong to blame those problems on the city of Canberra and its people. I repeat that Canberra is a very fine city and is a national capital of which all Australians can be justly proud. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee said in its report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee is committed to the continued existence of what most people believe is the essential character of the national capital, a bush capital where the open spaces will be protected as the population continues to grow.</PARA>
<PARA>I certainly agree with that statement and sentiment. It is a very fine city and one that attracts an enormous amount of tourism and will continue to do so more and more in the years ahead. It is important that the Government should now be looking at things such as better transport facilities to this area. Even international airports should be considered in an attempt to enhance the tourist potential of this region, and in particular our national capital. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of recommendations in the report. However, because I was only a recent entrant I was not able to join the Committee in making its recommendations. When I was appointed, the Committee inquiry had virtually been completed and I did not have the benefit of hearing all the evidence and examining all the relevant documents. Some of the agreements are ones that all senators would agree with, while others require further consideration and investigation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just want to mention a couple of the recommendations. Senator Reid has referred to recommendation 10, which states: The NCPA and the ACT Planning Authority urgently clarify and resolve the inconsistencies with regard to definitions, the range of permitted land uses and the boundaries of open space between the National Capital Plan and the Draft Territory Plan and/or take measures to ensure this information in those documents is presented in a form which is readily understandable to the community.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a very important recommendation. We must ensure that there is certainty and that people who deal with the plans understand exactly what they say. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recommendation 11 relates to the appointment of a national capital open space advisory committee. Recommendation 12 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee could include, in addition to representatives from the NCPA and the ACT Department of Environment, Land and Planning. . . nature conservation groups; rural lessees&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>as Senator Reid mentioned, this is very important&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">professional groups such as the Institute of Landscape Architects, Royal Institute of Parks and Recreation; TESAL; Park Care groups; the scientific community; special interest groups. . . and recreational interests.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is important that that committee operate to assist and give advice to the board. The committee should be made operational as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recommendation 18 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A group of Friends of the National Capital Open Space System be established by the NCPA to involve the community in the planning and management of the NCOSS.</PARA>
<PARA>Again, it is important that we get the widest possible involvement in the open space system. I am sure Canberrans would very much welcome the opportunity to be involved in the planning and management of the national capital open space system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recommendation 19 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The issue of whether the ACT Land (Planning and Environment) Act 1991 applies to areas designated under the National Capital Plan as having the special characteristics of the National Capital be resolved as a matter of urgency.</PARA>
<PARA>Again, I think that is self-evident. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final recommendations of the report&mdash;recommendations 38, 39 and 40&mdash;refer to catchment management systems and catchment protection schemes. River catchment management systems and schemes and projects are needed right around Australia. In every part of Australia there is an urgent need for proper management and administration of catchment systems. In the past governments have given too little notice to this need. It is something that should receive greater attention. In the context of an increased Australian-wide interest in river catchment management, certainly the recommendations of this report, as they affect the national capital, should be looked at. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, as Senator Reid has mentioned, the Committee recognised that there are costs involved in implementing the recommendations of this report. But the recommendations are made on the basis of what the Committee believed was necessary to achieve the long term goals of protecting the values of the national capital open space system. The Committee wisely acknowledged that those recommendations can only be implemented as funding becomes available. That is an important and sensible qualification in the report, bearing in mind the difficulty governments currently have, particularly this Government, in funding anything at all. It is essential that priorities are looked at and that governments do not get involved in spending money that they do not have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should note for the record that the cover of the report is quite magnificent. It is a very fitting cover to the report on our bush capital. The report is an in-depth look at these issues. It certainly raises a lot of issues which will be of interest to Canberrans and all others who have the interests of the national capital at heart.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Ray for his very pleasant comment. I might respond by saying I was in a private, single compartment, and there would not have been room for Senator Ray and me in the one compartment. I would be so unkind as to say that I doubt whether he would have fitted in even by himself. However, I do want to make some more constructive comment on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Indian Pacific</EMPHASIS>.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a great concept and it is one of the great railways of the world. It traverses some very interesting country&mdash;country that is very specifically Australian. I thought the staff on it were trying their hardest to do the right thing. But I might say by way of helpful criticism that, not long before that, I had the opportunity of travelling overnight on one of the new Queensland trains. There is not much I can ever find to congratulate the current Queensland Government on, but I must in this instance say that it operates that new train that runs from Cairns to Brisbane in a very business-like, efficient and proper manner. The Queensland train was staffed by young people who were obviously trained in hospitality skills. Everything on that train from Cairns to Brisbane was done well. It was very good, high-class accommodation&mdash;and I say that without being snobbish, but it was just done very well. It was indeed a pleasure to travel on that train and a pleasure to be dealt with by the staff. The way they ran that particular train was quite magnificent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By contrast, while the people on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Indian Pacific</EMPHASIS> tried, it was just nowhere in the same class. I urge the people that operate that train to have a look at the Queensland operation because the people who operate the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Indian Pacific</EMPHASIS> could learn a lot from the operation of that Queensland train. The way the meals were done, the way all the meals were presented and the way the tourists and passengers were looked after was just so much better.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make these comments in the hope that the people involved might just have a look at that, because it is a magnificent train which traverses magnificent country. The train is a great asset for Australia but its operation just needs a little bit of finesse and shining up. I hope the people who operate it will have a look at that some time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I thank those honourable senators who have spoken on the Income Tax Assessment (Isolated Area Zone Extension) Amendment Bill, and the Australian Democrats for their promised support of the Bill. I brought in this private member's Bill because of an anomaly whereby zone A and zone B rebate allowances in isolated areas cease at the shoreline of Australia and its offshore islands. However, no area in between falls into zone A and zone B&mdash;namely, the man-made platforms that have been constructed in the last few years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I introduced this Bill on 1 April last year because of concerns that were expressed to me by taxpayers living in the remote areas of Western Australia on offshore platforms who were not able to get this rebate, unlike those who lived on the mainland. As Senator Watson pointed out a moment ago, I brought attention to this myself in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Tax News</EMPHASIS> this week in regard to a Z40 zone rebate case. The Tax Commissioner appealed to the AAT and the AAT held that an offshore natural gas platform worker was not a resident of zone A or zone B and was not entitled to the zone rebate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The AAT held that, for the platform to fall within zone A, it had to be either part of the Australian mainland or an island forming that part of Australia. The gas platform attached to the continental shelf, 135 kilometres offshore, was held not to be part of the mainland, nor could it be regarded as an island. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why I spoke to my Whip the other day&mdash;to see whether I could bring this matter on for debate. This Bill grants extra rebates, thereby going on the expenditure side of the accounts of the Government rather than the receipts side. However, the Government has never been slow in passing legislation for the extra collection of tax when the expenditure sites are not within the shoreline of Australia or the shoreline of offshore islands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Cases in point where special&mdash;I emphasise special&mdash;legislation has been passed include sales tax where there has been expenditure on equipment used in offshore areas that are not on offshore islands and the collection of fringe benefits tax where fringe benefit has been paid to workers working on those oil platforms, whether they work there one day, one month, six months or 12 months. Those same areas are covered by the resource rent tax under the Submerged Lands Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that living on a platform should be treated in the same way as being in Zone A or Zone B, whether people are living permanently or flying in and flying out. Of course, if one is flying in and flying out, as Senator McMullan might know, one has to make up the six-month minimum to qualify. I hope that the Government picks up this idea. It has been sitting on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> for six months. I thought that the Government might have taken up the idea and put it in a tax amendment Bill itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank the Democrats&mdash;who are not in the chamber at present&mdash;for their promised support. I also pay recognition to the chartered accountant in Western Australia who brought this matter to me to bring before the Senate in the form of a private member's Bill. Hopefully, we will see an amendment from the Government. Incidentally, that chartered accountant happens to be my oldest son, Francis John Panizza. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, I seek leave to make a few comments on the second reading. I assure you that, given that Senator Panizza has summed up, I will not attack him or be provocative, but I think it would be appropriate to put on the record the Government's position on the Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. The Income Tax Assessment (Isolated Area Zone Extension) Amendment Bill 1992 is, as I understand it, in the same terms as a Bill introduced by Mr Filing in the House of Representatives&mdash;which is just as well because it is that Bill which I have had a chance to look at, rather than the one with Senator Panizza's name on it. But I was assured that they are the same.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand the concern that both members are seeking to address, but the Government will not as such be supporting the legislation on this occasion. Nevertheless, there are some anomalies. I have had a look at some of the things that were said in the second reading speech on the Bill and I am not yet persuaded that we have a major anomaly with which to deal, but I accept the sense in which Senator Panizza spoke in summing up: that he was really seeking our taking this up in a subsequent amendment. I am prepared to continue to look at that. I do not want to give an assurance that we will. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have some concerns: for example, the circumstance where a worker is working in a remote area or on a ship passing through adjacent waters but whose ordinary place of residence is outside a remote area zone; for example, a person might have a place of residence in a capital city and be working on a rig. I acknowledge that this was some time ago, but the public inquiry into income tax zone allowances in 1981 specifically addressed the questions of ship crews, people in the fishing industry and oil rig workers, and it did not see a need to change the existing arrangements for these groups where workers had a place of residence outside a zone. There was not a need for a change for people whose principal place of residence was within an area which qualified for a zone allowance simply because they already had it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The inquiry observed that these workers normally received free messing and accommodation while on duty. Consequently, they are to a large extent cushioned from high costs associated with remote living while they are working. This is not normally the case when they are at their place of residence. Here they face the same cost structure as their neighbours, and they should receive the same tax zone benefit, if any, as their neighbours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our concern is that we have here people who, on the evidence available on the most recent review, do not face all those factors that apply to zone rebate application. They face some of them, I acknowledge, but not all. At this stage, we are not persuaded that the balance is such that the rebate need apply. There are some technical problems with the Bill. This does not seem to be the appropriate time to go into them. Senator Panizza is not pretending this is the be-all and end-all; it is simply a statement drawing to the Parliament's attention concerns about anomalies and seeking to have the Government take it up. If we were to do so, it would be for us to remedy the technical problems. I will not take up the Senate's time with that because people have been trying to cooperate in expediting the proceedings more recently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw attention to one problem we have which is the treatment of people working in the zone of cooperation with Indonesia in the Timor Gap. There is a problem there that this Bill does not cover and which would not be easy to deal with, but on the basis of consistency, we would need to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will not be supporting the Bill at this stage, but I indicate that we are prepared to look at any particular anomalies in the working of the present zone arrangements which either Mr Filing in the House of Representatives, or Senator Panizza here, has raised with us. I am not giving any undertakings about action to flow from it, but I understand the purpose of their initiative in this regard. Although the Government will not be voting for it, we will have a look at the issues that have been raised to consider whether it is appropriate for inclusion in a subsequent tax Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to say a few words on the Income Tax (Isolated Area Zone Extension) Amendment Bill 1992. It is perhaps my only chance to address some of Senator McMullan's concerns. I am asking for platform residents who are there for more than six months, people who live in the territorial waters off zone A, to be treated equally with those who are living on land in zone A. I think Senator McMullan accepted that, except that he said that those living on a platform have good living conditions and are not suffering any great hardships. By way of interjection, I tried to let him know&mdash;and he did not want to listen&mdash;that their conditions are no different from those at, say, Argyle Diamonds, where they fly in and fly out and have very good living conditions; and there are other places like that in the Pilbara and the iron ore mines. It is exactly the same type of situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to address the problem for those on the platforms who are living in just as much isolation. In fact, they can travel far less from the platforms. Being in that isolated area, they can travel only the length of the platform&mdash;otherwise they go over&mdash;whereas in those other northern towns they have a lot more freedom. That is the point which I would have liked Senator McMullan to have taken up. I reiterate that the Government has never been slow in passing legislation to pick up sales tax on expenditure, FBT and rent resource tax. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This report on the Christmas Island rebuilding program is very important because, as many honourable senators will know, Christmas Island is attached to the Northern Territory for voting purposes and is therefore part of the constituency that I represent in the Federal Parliament. The report has attracted considerable attention because it arises from a proposal by the Government to proceed with a rebuilding program on Christmas Island that will, in effect, over a long term period commit the Commonwealth to in excess of $130m worth of expenditure. On first looking at this, a lot of people immediately recoil and ask why there should be such a large expenditure for 1,300 people located in such a remote locality.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to recognise the historical importance of Christmas Island to Australia. This is canvassed in many places. In precis, Christmas Island was originally a colonial situation that was taken over by Australia as part of a partnership deal for the development of a phosphate mine on that particular island. The economy and the opportunities have changed over the years. The phosphate mine has waxed and waned in its fortunes. I am pleased to say that the mining activity on Christmas Island is currently in a period of very good rapport. This week I read the annual report of Phosphate Resources NL, the locally owned mining company on Christmas Island and was pleased to see many of the issues that have arisen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The community on Christmas Island comprises a number of expatriate Australians serving in the local administration, a number of Australian citizens who have taken up residency, and a number of foreign people who choose to live on Christmas Island and participate in the life and community that is there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other recent private sector economic development that has been canvassed for Christmas Island is the development of a casino. Again, the fortunes of the developer there, like the mining establishment, have waxed and waned. There have been some problems in the last year or so with the development program of the casino and its construction. I have asked a number of questions in this place and in the Estimates Committee which relate to the development of that casino. I am well aware that many of those questions have still not been answered by the Department of Territories, particularly as they relate to foreign police investigations surrounding the developers and a number of activities. I await those answers with interest because of the long term economic advantages that could flow to the island from a proper tourism development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This particular report deals with a proposal to expend $130m of Commonwealth funds on an infrastructure program for the island. Admittedly, much of the infrastructure on the island is in a deplorable condition and is very run down. A lot of that is to do with the fact that historically the island was essentially run as a mining community and a mining town. It is now accepted that if the permanent community is to be sustained at at least 1,300 people, there will need to be a massive improvement in the infrastructure on the island. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I appeared before the Public Works Committee following a visit to the island in May earlier this year. I expressed a number of concerns. I did not in any way seek to thwart the proper provision of services to people living in such a remote locality, but wished to question the very large commitment that will be required by the Commonwealth in financial terms. There will be a major necessity to ensure that the continued life of the mine is sustained, that tourism as an economic industry is developed and that we also recognise and underpin the important defence implications of maintaining Christmas Island in Australia's interests. In effect, it is our base in the Indian Ocean; indeed, it could be argued that it is an aircraft carrier for Australia in the Indian Ocean. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I called into question the commitment of funds. I am pleased to note the second recommendation of this report, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that prior to the final commitment to the total ten year rebuilding program there should be an assessment of the success of the initial funding program which may lead to changes in priorities and/or funding levels.</PARA>
<PARA>Given that reservation in the recommendations, I believe it is important that this project proceeds. I think the initial commitment for the first four or five years is in the order of $37m. That is still a very large and significant Commonwealth contribution to such a community. Since we are making a commitment to very long term needs, I feel there will need to be a review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I also flag for the attention of the Senate the role of Australian Construction Services. To date, that section of the Department of Administrative Services has carried out most of the initial assessment and initial planning for this major reconstruction program. I have been critical, as I am sure Minister Bolkus knows, of a lot of the activity of Australian Construction Services. But in a location such as this, Christmas Island in the Indian Ocean, I would not want to see ACS being given an exclusivity with respect to either the planning or construction phases of such an important project as this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe it is important that the private sector be involved and, as Christmas Island has such an important commercial link with Western Australia, I hope that many interests from Western Australia will take advantage of this particular program. Similarly, I hope that commercial interests from my own electorate, the Northern Territory, because of their close geographic proximity, will also seek to take advantage of the commercial opportunities that are there in providing such an important service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For that reason, I will be monitoring very carefully the continued involvement of Australian Construction Services in this project. I would argue that the involvement of ACS is probably not needed at all in this and that the services could be carried out either by contractors already on the island or by services that are available in the private sectors of Western Australia or the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Christmas Island, and indeed the neighbouring islands of Cocos (Keeling) Islands, are very important in the long term development and security interests of Australia. I hope that the Parliament will monitor very carefully these 18 recommendations of this particular report, that all of them get close and careful scrutiny over the next few years, and that the improvement of infrastructure proceeds at a very careful, planned and constructive pace. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I speak on this legislation on the Opposition's behalf. We have before us the Student Assistance Amendment Bill 1992 and the second reading speech of the Minister for Justice (Seantor Tate), which was incorporated into the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. I must say it was a brief and, I believe, quite cursory summary of what is involved in this Budget decision.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On behalf of the Opposition, I note that, however inadequate this Government is in the handling of education matters&mdash;and this Labor Government has built up a deplorable record on education matters&mdash;on this particular matter, because it is in large degree a response to the kind of flexibility for assisting students that the Opposition has called for for some time, we will not be opposing the Bill. The Opposition has a second reading amendment, and accordingly I move:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At end of motion, add ", but the Senate condemns the Government for its failure to adequately address the problems in the administration and targeting of student financial assistance to ensure that it is fair and accessible to all.".</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Student Assistance Amendment Bill puts in place a loans scheme which will enable what the Government calls the financial supplement. It enables those receivers of Austudy undertaking tertiary study to trade in a dollar of their grant to gain a $2 loan, which is technically $2 of financial assistance. Either that additional or enlarged assistance is then repayable directly with a 15 per cent discount in the first five years of what is called a contract period, or, if not repaid during that period, it is then repaid under the higher education contribution scheme mechanism, known popularly as HECS. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The kinds of tax debts that are accruing at the moment for the contribution towards tuition fees&mdash;some 20 per cent or thereabouts of a student's cost of tuition&mdash;are currently for many students a HECS liability which is to be subsequently paid back under a formula out of their graduate earnings when those students are employed. That same HECS formula will apply to this financial supplement that students will be able to receive should they choose. The commendable elements of this scheme are choice and flexibility. That is why the Government is at least to be commended for improving student assistance to incorporate these two elements which the Opposition has been urging for many years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Currently student assistance is met by $1.5 billion of the Commonwealth Budget each year. About $1.3 billion is for Austudy and another $190m is for the Abstudy scheme. This is about 19 per cent of the total Commonwealth outlays on education. The Commonwealth is providing a very substantial amount of money for student assistance. The taxpayers of Australia are providing $1.5 billion each year for the recipients of Austudy and Abstudy, the two student assistance schemes. This is meant to provide for the living costs of students and is, of course, in addition to the provision by the taxpayer of the lion's share, that is, 80 per cent of the cost of tuition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In regard to student assistance and the $1.5 billion which is spent each year, the Labor Government has an atrocious record of poor administration and poor targeting. Even though there has been a House of Representatives  inquiry that has brought deficiencies to the attention of the Government, and even though the Government has been forced to set up its own consultants to inquire into these matters, such as Dr Bruce Chapman, the Government has not responded adequately to even these inquiries. That is why I have moved this amendment to the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is not only condemned by the Parliament, but also by students around Australia as a result of their experience of its unfair, inadequate administration of student assistance schemes. In addition, of course, the Government is condemned for not having an answer with regard to the 50,000 students turned away from tertiary education each year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has given me no pleasure to come in here at least twice each year for the past 10 years and, on behalf of the Opposition, reiterate again and again the inadequacies of the Labor Government. I have said, and honourable senators present will understand&mdash;Senator Reid knows very well as do you, Mr Acting Deputy President&mdash;that the only remedy for the students of Australia and for education is a change of government and all the reforms and all the additional resources which have been clearly set out in the promises of the Liberal and National parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, it is some relief from this pattern of inadequacy and failure that we have this one refreshing decision of the present Labor Government, and that we see this legislation before us. As I say, it is commendable for its flexibility and the choice that it gives to students. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Typical of the criticism that I have just reiterated one more time here in the Senate is that which we in the Liberal and National parties have made with regard to the hardship of many families suffering in the rural recession. We have called again and again in this place for the rules regarding Austudy to be amended, so that we have adequate hardship provisions for assisting such families whose children are being denied access to education because of the way the rural recession has affected those students. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer in particular to families which are asset rich, but income poor&mdash;even income negative. Because an assets test for the Austudy program has been brought in by the Labor Government, such families, despite their dire circumstances, are being denied access to Austudy for their children. I remind the Senate that on 13 May last year I moved the following motion on behalf of the Opposition:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate calls on the Government to immediately introduce emergency educational assistance in the form of hardship provisions so that families excluded from AUSTUDY by the assets test, but whose income has collapsed in the rural</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">crisis, will not be forced to withdraw their children from education on financial grounds.</PARA>
<PARA>That motion was adopted in the Senate. Did it make any difference to the Government&mdash;a hard-hearted government; an inflexible government?  It did not make any difference. There is now no adequate hardship provision in the rules related to Austudy. I say again that the Liberal and National parties, on coming to government, will put that adequate hardship provision in place. We will exclude the operation of the assets test in circumstances that we have defined clearly with regard to families suffering in the rural crisis, and any other families in like circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only comprehensive answer to student assistance in this country will be that given by an incoming Liberal and National party government. We have undertaken&mdash;and I repeat the promise now&mdash;to have a complete review of Austudy and Abstudy arrangements so that they are fair and administratively sound. This review can begin only when we are elected to government. I look forward to the positive support of my Australian Democrat colleagues for that amendment when we come to the end of the second reading stage of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The House of Representatives committee inquiry led the Government to take only this one step to appoint Dr Bruce Chapman to produce a consultants report on matters that have been raised. He brought down a very commendable report, one which gave a great deal of support to the statements that I have been making here in the Senate over many years about the inadequacies in the present Labor Government's performance. Similarly, it very much reinforced the statements made by the spokesman of the Liberal and National parties in the House of Representatives, my colleague Dr David Kemp. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill before us is only one action that the Government has taken following Dr Chapman's report. In essence, the objectives of this Bill, set out in clause 6, will enable a larger resource to be available to tertiary students. They will be able, if they wish, to choose to forgo one dollar of grant to gain two dollars of loan to a maximum of $4,000 in any one year, on the basis that that money is available from a financial corporation yet to be announced by the Government. This money is off-Budget. It will not come in the immediate five years from the taxpayer; it will come from a financial institution, presumably a bank, to be announced in the next few weeks by the Government and under the contractual guidelines that are set out in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The money up to $4,000 available to students accrues, and if it is paid back within the first five years there will be a 15 per cent discount. To the extent that it is not repaid at the end of the five years, that debt will be taken over by the Commonwealth Government and become an actual bill to the taxpayer. That money will then be repayable by the student according to the HECS formula to which I have referred. There is a bill that will fall to the taxpayer in the intervening period, and that is the interest owing to that financial institution on monies that are advanced to students; and, of course, the 15 per cent discount is made up by the taxpayer. The Government estimates that in the next five years there will be savings to the Budget because, as is evident, for students to take up this option they must forgo some of the grants that otherwise would be paid to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A second group will be able to gain loans of up to $2,000, and that is those students who are currently denied Austudy or Abstudy but whose joint family income is less than $50,000. Students who are in every other respect eligible for Austudy, but who are denied Austudy only because their family incomes are beyond the threshold for the minimum payment but up to $50,000, can take up loans of up to $2,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, it is a question of opportunity and choice. As Dr Chapman clearly set out in his report, this gives very commendable flexibility to the Austudy scheme. In different cities there are different costs, different courses and different financial pressures. Students at different points in their university careers will have different pressures for gaining immediate financial support. Depending upon all those circumstances, in the judgment of the student himself or herself, they will be able to make flexible arrangements for additional financial support. As I have said, the Opposition commends the choice that this gives to students and the fact that it improves the targeting of the support in a non-bureaucratic way, on the basis of students themselves making the choice and assessing their own circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Underlying these advantages is the basic principle that higher education produces benefits both for the community and the individual and that there is a contribution for a student undertaking studies provided by the community and also by the individual. This Bill sets out a good balance. In fact, I urge my own incoming government, the Liberal-National party government, in the coming months, or this Government, in the event of its being able to do something about this in the next few weeks, to incorporate a more flexible use of the HECS currency, as I put it, into student assistance and enrolment opportunity for Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put it in a general way. Once upon a time we had the ability to enrol only upon the payment of cash. The currency used to gain access to a university place was cash. Then we had scholarships, which gave a second currency. Then we had a bureaucratic entitlement that one did not have to pay cash and did not need a scholarship but that if access was gained, mostly on merit, to a place&mdash;the number of places was limited&mdash;one could go ahead and enrol in the university. So we have a third currency in terms of access of Australians to higher education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A user pays element of 20 per cent was then introduced. That was to be an amount payable through the tax mechanism out of graduate earnings. That currency was a considerable gain in flexibility and in making possible a user pays element that would work. I commend the way in which that particular currency&mdash;HECS&mdash;has been applied to this loan scheme. I believe that it can be extended even more: for example, combined with up-front cash would be an ability for students to enrol in places beyond the present quotas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberal and National parties have a distinct policy coming into the forthcoming election: we will allow a university to enrol any students on whatever basis that university sees fit. We envisage the university requiring an appropriate fee for those enrolments. It is within the flexibility of government to determine that such students who are putting up large up-front payments for that tuition can also gain some access to HECS, and an appropriate and fair combination of those two currencies will enable students to gain access to the system. By passing in their initial year subjects that they undertake, they will then be able to gain access in the normal way to a Commonwealth scholarship for 80 per cent of their tuition costs and the user pays element of 20 per cent under HECS. That sort of flexibility in this Bill in the use of HECS can be extended in combination with the flexible and open-ended policy that the Liberal and National parties offer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Minister's second reading speech there is reference to the savings that will accrue as a result of this Bill. Budget savings are estimated to be $42m in 1992-93, rising to almost $115m in 1993-94 and $138m in 1994-95. That is for the reasons that I mentioned earlier. But we do not know what they will be in the financial years following. It is clear that there will be losses in five years time. I put a question to the Minister, which I hope will be answered in the summing up of this debate, as to what precisely those estimates will be for all financial years through to the end of this century. There is an indication of their effect on the Budget in the financial year 2002, but I want to know what the estimates are&mdash;surely they have been made&mdash;for the next 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, I ask the Minister to respond to these questions: what are the Government's detailed plans for the selection of the financial institution involved? What sort of competitive process has been involved? When will the outcome be known? I understand that it is a few weeks away, but I want to know precisely. In addition, what are the financial arrangements for the next 10 years? In the few minutes that remain, I want to make clearer the reasons why I have moved an amendment to the second reading condemning this Labor Government for its inadequacies in the&mdash;</PARA>

In these few minutes I will indicate, in great contrast to the inadequacies of the Labor Government, some of the reforms we have in mind. Austudy will increase by 6 per cent across the board on 1 October 1994. This is more than compensation for the tax reform package that is outlined in Fightback.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition will introduce a properly constructed hardship provision that will assist many rural families to overcome the present denial by the Labor Government of access to Austudy for them, even when they are in dire financial circumstances. We will increase the boarding allowance for students who are away from home and ensure that it is free of the Labor Government's asset test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also direct benefits for those students who may be earning some income from part time work. The tax threshold will be increased from the current $5,400 to $7,000. Many students with low incomes from part time work will be direct beneficiaries of that easing of the tax threshold. The petrol excise will be abolished. The saving of $11 a tankful when filling a car with petrol will be as much a gain to a student, who is saved from paying the excise on petrol for a car, as it will be to all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The abolition of the wholesale sales tax will be of direct benefit to those students and their families who are rightly investing in a computer, or software related to a computer, to assist them in their studies. The sales tax on computers will be abolished by a Liberal-National government, and students will find that they are better off. I should also point out that there will be eligibility for a tax credit for thousands of students who are paying some income tax but are not fully compensated by the change in the tax threshold. These tax credits are set out in great detail in the Fightback document. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should not overlook two general and very positive gains that will assist all students. Firstly, we will create jobs, jobs and more jobs.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to address the Student Assistance Amendment Bill 1992. I guess if one were to believe the words of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), this is the sort of nonsense that the Senate makes the order of the day. This is what the Prime Minister so astonishingly said on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> tonight. This Bill is an extremely important piece of legislation. The lives of thousands of Australia's students are affected not only through the primary provisions of the Bill but also through the regulations that will be enacted later on in the year which will once again substantially change the way that Austudy is administered.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill seeks to amend the Student Assistance Act 1973 to introduce a student loans scheme. It also seeks to amend the Data-matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Act 1990, the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 and the Taxation (Interest on Overpayments) Act 1983. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First, I would like to express my concern about the hasty way in which the Government has handled this legislation. After a controversial debate in the wider community this year, this Bill was rammed through the House of Representatives and has jumped to the top of the Senate agenda. Astonishingly, in addition to that, on Tuesday we were given a further five pages of amendments to this Bill. This suggests to me that the drafting of this legislation has been hasty in the extreme. Before the Bill has even been enacted, we are looking at a quite substantial amendment which, I am told, seeks simply to clarify and amplify the provisions of the legislation that is before us. However, I submit to the Government that perhaps it would have been preferable if it had got it right in the first place rather than simply presenting to us pages of amendments that we are asked to consider. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats do not support this legislation. From the outset we have made our opposition to a student loans scheme very clear. In fact, we have done so since the release of the Chapman report earlier this year. The implementation of a loans scheme would, in our view, further entrench user pays education in this country. It is my belief that in 20 years time we probably will not even have an Austudy student assistance scheme as, over time, governments of all colours will seek to wind back its provisions and the support that it gives. They will incrementally change a scheme which has served to support thousands of Australian students over the last decade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Instead of redressing the blatant inequities in Austudy, this scheme is what the Government is actually offering the struggling students of this country. Loans will be available to those students eligible for Austudy and Abstudy&mdash;those students who are, by definition, the hardest hit and the poorest in our community. Through the loans schemes, students can trade in in whole or in part their grant for double the amount in a loan form. Despite being a voluntary loan, many students will be forced by their economic circumstances to take out the double loan amount. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats have maintained their opposition to the introduction of a loans scheme for students since the release of the draft Chapman report, which was intended as an investigation into Austudy and which was to recommend ways to make the system more equitable and better targeted. Of course, we all know what happened to that process. Dr Chapman ended up by recommending in his final report a whole series of changes to Austudy that were acceptable to all sides of the debate. He did so in order to pull himself out of the political quagmire in which he had been placed by the Minister, Mr Baldwin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats have maintained their opposition to the introduction of a loans scheme for students. The Democrats maintain that loans are a disincentive to enter and to participate in further education. This affects students from lower socio-economic backgrounds and other traditionally disadvantaged groups, including women and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The loans debate is not a new one. The Liberals introduced the Student Assistance (Loans Guarantee and Subsidy) Bill in 1982. This legislation was repealed in 1985. The feature of that debate was that the Democrats did not stand alone in defence of an accessible and equitable public education system. They were joined by the Australian Labor Party, which upheld the belief that `Loans are a further extension of the discredited user pays principle; it is knowledge on hire purchase, and a tax on investment in people, in our most important national asset'. These were the words of Senator Colston, one of the many Labor senators who condemned the scheme at the time. There are many more Labor senators who would be ashamed of their backflip on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Zakharov, another current senator, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Loans as a basic means of financing study. . . are intrinsically inequitable and can have a deleterious social effect. They are inequitable as. . . they give an advantage to those who are already advantaged.</PARA>
<PARA>I could not agree more. Senator Zakharov continued to report student concerns that `any loans scheme could be the precursor to an attack on TEAS or even a precursor to the reintroduction of tertiary fees'. Of course, we already know that the Opposition plans to reintroduce a form of tertiary fees if it is elected after the next election. It will do so by allowing universities to charge fees to top up a student voucher system. How right she was. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Zakharov's anticipation of further attacks on the public system of higher education are well founded, given that her Party introduced tertiary fees in a new form&mdash;HECS&mdash;less than four years later. Today it represents the next stage for this Government towards the entrenchment of user pays education in this country. It is for this reason that the Democrats support the Opposition's second reading amendment. We are doing so not because we believe that the Liberals have the best interests of students in mind. It is because we agree that the Government should be condemned for its failure to address adequately the problems in student financial assistance and to ensure that assistance is fair and accessible to all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nor do we credit the Opposition with a fair education policy. Under <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> students would be subject to up-front full cost fees and severely narrowed Austudy eligibility, and important educational programs such as Aboriginal studies would be cut. There would be no joy for students under a coalition government, with threats of voluntary student unionism, HECS hikes and limited financial assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would, however, agree with the concerns that Senator Teague expressed in relation to the targeting of Austudy for rural students. It is well known that many rural families hit by the assets test would greatly benefit from having that test removed. This would allow their young people to participate more fully in education. I certainly hope that, if elected, the Opposition will implement that reform posthaste to assist rural families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I cannot understand why this Government has not seen that some real inequities have developed in rural Australia as a result of the assets test on the family farm. Therefore, support for rural students is welcomed by the Democrats. The terms of this support are couched in Senator Teague's second reading amendment and for that reason we will be supporting it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it is a pity that the Opposition's call for better targeting did not extend to supporting the Democrats' motion to exempt the family farm and small business assets from the parental assets test. The Government's failure to address student financial assistance is evidenced by a litany of regressive changes, even this year. Changes to Austudy regulations this year resulted in a hefty 20 per cent interest rate on the late repayment of Austudy overpayments. Students are now slugged with 20 per cent interest when they do not or cannot pay these overpayments which are often a result of administrative bungling or genuine error. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I pointed out in my motion to disallow the regulation, this impost is out of line with any market rate and even corresponding provisions in the Income Tax Assessment Act. Once again the Democrats stood in isolation on this issue as the Government and the Opposition combined forces to defeat this motion. This is an increasingly apparent aspect of higher education policy over the years. It is strikingly apparent today as the Liberals see no more wrong with this legislation than its name. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that the Government refuses to call a spade a spade is another sign of its unwillingness to face the realities of student financial assistance in Australia. The financial supplement is&mdash;and is so defined by the Bill&mdash;a loan. We cannot understand why the Government could not face up to the reality and actually call it a student loan in the legislation. Of course, this would have been politically too damaging for the Government which is already on the skids with the student movement around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those students who take up the loan enter into a legally binding contract with a financial institution, as the Government will not provide loans to students but, rather, will farm this out to a bank. This, we can see, is a privatised loan scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Within the first five years students are responsible for payments to the bank if they choose or can wait until the Government assumes the loan, where they will pay it back through the taxation system. All this time the loans are indexed to the CPI. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has gone to great pains to emphasise that these loans are interest free or have no real rate of interest, as in the case of the higher education contribution scheme or HECS. Depending on the rate of the CPI, students will accrue additional debt, which will add to their disadvantage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Studies have shown that the income contingent HECS style arrangement has adversely affected the participation of people from a number of low income and disadvantaged groups in higher education. Despite Government assurances that the HECS would not be increased above the level of the CPI, last year's Budget increased HECS by $144 per annum. What assurance can the Government give that the rate of repayments for loans will not likewise be increased?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In part 4B of the Bill the maximum living allowance under the Austudy regulations will be indexed to the CPI. This is a welcome but overdue measure. It is certainly a proposal for which the Democrats have argued for many years.

This supplement, in fact, is a loans scheme that allows students to trade in some or all of their Austudy and Abstudy grants for a loan twice the size, up to a limit of $4,000.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also introduces automatic indexation of Austudy and Abstudy in line with inflation. The Opposition will not be opposing this legislation as it moves towards the coalition's policies as outlined in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS>. In response to some of the points that Senator Sowada made, I would point out a few things about what is happening in this area of student finance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She really harked back to the good old days of the Whitlam Government which moved towards a system where education was free. Since the Hawke Government was elected, the Government has gradually backtracked more and more on that approach. The Australian Democrats really have to ask themselves why the Government did this. Here we have a supposedly socialist Government which under Whitlam brought in free tertiary education. Yet throughout the 1980s it found itself increasingly unable to maintain that sort of scheme. The basic reason for that was the harsh realities of Commonwealth budgeting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need a higher level of education in this country, in particular, university education; we have a small nation and education makes huge demands on its Budget. The only way that that sort of thing can be achieved is to bring in other ways of funding. To its credit, the Government over the years has gradually introduced some of these, although we believe it has not really gone far enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the Government's basic propositions in this Bill is that the people who benefit most from the education they receive should make some contribution towards it. The reality of HECS which is in place in this country is that the sort of contribution they make is really only about 20 per cent. The student obviously gains the greatest benefit from that sort of scheme. There is a public benefit and obviously we recognise that, with the public tax system paying about 80 per cent. But there is a real necessity, if we are to generate the number of places we want in this country, to create a situation where the people who benefit from it pay something towards it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The same sort of principle tends to apply with Austudy and Abstudy. We have a situation where students are not being forced to move onto a loans scheme; they can stay on Austudy and Abstudy. But if they want to provide a little better for themselves during their time of study, they can trade in $1 in grant for $2 in loan, up to $4,000. The effect of that is that they can support themselves at a higher standard of living during that time and they can pay the money back when they start earning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Through the HECS mechanism, which this Government introduced and which the Opposition supports, there is an arrangement in place where people can pay back&mdash;in a relatively painless way&mdash;the money they have received under a Government scheme. I am quite interested in some variations on that scheme. For example, the New Zealanders have introduced a scheme they call Studyright, where students are allowed to extend their loans and almost tailor-make the loans they want according to their needs, not only for fees but also for income support. It seems to me that that sort of direction is ideal because it gets back to what Senator Sowada was indicating earlier on: people, because of cost, should not be limited from the possibility of entering education. Providing students have the financial arrangements balanced in such a way that they can pay the money back easily, cost really should not deny anyone access to higher education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can look back to the time when the Whitlam Government brought in free education. There was an implied statement in what Senator Sowada said that the socioeconomic mix would change if we change these income arrangements. The Whitlam Government free education scheme for universities showed that there was no such change in the socioeconomic mix. I think it would be hard to prove in any way, or project in any way, that there will be a change in the socioeconomic mix if we move in the other direction, provided that we set the scheme up in such a way that people can pay it back easily, and that has been done through the HECS arrangements. The Opposition basically supports the broad direction of the Government in following the recommendations of the Chapman scheme in relation to funding for Austudy and Abstudy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I mentioned before, this Bill does go some way towards what we have proposed in the Fightback policy. It probably does not go far enough, but to the extent that the Government is amending the legislation to allow this breakthrough in funding, with the ability to transfer a grant to a loan on a two for one basis, we believe the Government is heading in the right direction. We do have a number of criticisms of the scheme broadly that the Government is still operating under Austudy and Abstudy. In particular, I draw the attention of the Senate to the Government's failure to take adequate action to target financial assistance available under the scheme or to recover overpayments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Presently, funding allocated to the Austudy and Abstudy program is very poorly targeted and is not available to help the students in the greatest need. It has been clear for some time that there are many students receiving Austudy who are not in great financial need. There are many other students in obvious financial need who are ineligible for aid because of the rules of the program. Many of these are students in rural areas who are excluded from assistance by the operations of the assets test. In addition, it is evident from the reports of the Auditor-General that substantial losses are occurring as a result of inadequate accounting practices and overpayments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only recently, DEET compliance surveys found that between 12 and 27 per cent of students were being overpaid. This is not acceptable and must be properly addressed. The Minister's poor attempt to collect only $7.2m through this Bill is disappointing, to say the least. The coalition accepts that the basic objective of student financial assistance should be that no student with the capacity and the will to continue his or her education should be prevented from doing so on financial grounds alone. Given this, it is clear that significant changes are required to Austudy and Abstudy. A number of these changes were announced in the Opposition's Fightback package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the worst rorts currently in use occurs when wealthy families arrange their finances so that they fall within the Austudy income tests. Through Fightback, we undertake to replace the definition of `income' as taxable income with the concept of total remuneration, which would also take into account fringe benefits and other income. Another rort occurs when parents sign a statutory declaration stating that they will no longer support their child, in order to make that child eligible for Austudy at the higher independent rate. This occurs, as do other rorts, under the exceptional circumstances provision of the Austudy regulations. This loophole will be removed under Fightback. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A significant efficiency in targeting the problem is the cost of administering large numbers of small payments which simply do not constitute the difference between a decision to pursue or not to pursue the education course. We have undertaken, when elected to Government, to eliminate payments of less than $30 per week as being inconsistent with the objectives of the Austudy scheme. It is interesting to note that the Government has moved to $20, so it is actually moving towards our policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to overpayment and fraud, we will implement much tighter benefit control procedures with the objective of saving approximately $80m. Since Fightback was launched, the Government has summoned up the courage to adopt several of the coalition's proposals, at least in part. The measures outlined in this Bill are an example of this. The scheme proposed allows students who are eligible for Austudy or Abstudy to trade in their allowances for a loan up to a total of double the allowance. It is repayable within five years and repayable through the tax system, the same way as HECS. Loans will be paid to the student fortnightly and loans will be available between $500 and $4,000. The loans will also be available to those students who would otherwise have qualified for the allowance, but for the parental income test, whose parent income is less than $50,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The loan scheme is based on the recommendations of the Chapman report. This report was presented in April this year and confirms the Opposition's criticism of the poor targeting of the Austudy scheme. Dr Chapman found that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there is little doubt that there is little sensitivity shown to the varied financial needs and circumstances of the potential clientele.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The essential challenge for reform is to improve the targeting so as to ensure that the right amount of assistance is delivered to those who most need it.</PARA>
<PARA>The Chapman report found that rorts did exist, including the manipulation of taxable income. The general thrust of the report was in line with the coalition's repeated criticism that student financial assistance has been poorly administered and inadequately targeted. These loans will improve the targeting of student financial assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has also followed the Fightback policy by including fringe benefits when assessing parental, spouse and personal income tests. This is not the only example. The Government has moved quickly to adopt our policy of increasing the real value of the boarding allowance for isolated children, though it has persisted with its determination to retain the asset test on the means tested portion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Budget, the Government acknowledged that there were savings to be made by redefining taxable income&mdash;including fringe benefits&mdash;and by establishing a minimum payment level, which it set at $20 a week. It even acknowledged that there were savings to be made by more effective actions in recovering overpayment, a matter which Minister Baldwin denied at the time when the Fightback package was released. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In assessing the amendments proposed by this legislation, it is significant that nothing whatever has been done by the Government to realistically open access to education for rural students who would be excluded from Austudy by the assets test. These students do not have access to the loan arrangements set up by the Government, despite the fact that the Chapman report suggested that they should. It is also significant that the Government has presented to the Senate 28 amendments to this Bill. It is really a re-run of some of the things that I saw when I first came into the Senate. I was absolutely amazed in my first few weeks here to be presented with the Education Export Bill, a Bill to which we eventually moved 28 substantive amendments. This was only an eight-page Bill. This was an appalling example of mismanagement of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that this legislation has already been amended so severely by the Government shows that it has been very hastily put together, and probably not thought out all that well. The amendments are probably the result initially of poor drafting. I believe that all Bills that come before this Parliament should be much more carefully considered. I am finding this more and more with legislation, as a member of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, and see it across a wide range of government departments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amended Bill and the further amendments that are proposed go some way towards addressing the problem of access and targeting of Austudy and Abstudy. As I have indicated, they really do not go far enough. Under Fightback, the coalition is committed to fully reviewing financial assistance when we get into government. We will create a much more efficient, accessible and fairer income support arrangement for students. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to begin my reply tonight by noting that student assistance has grown significantly over the past five years under this Government. In 1992-93, assistance to students under these schemes will total over $1.5 billion, an increase of over 10 per cent over last year. This does not include the funds available under the supplement introduced by the Student Assistance Amendment Bill 1992. This will add $143m, bringing the total of student assistance funds to $1.725 billion, or an increase of 20.7 per cent over those funds available to students in 1991-92. This growth in funding translates to an extra 52,000 students, a 10.3 per cent increase, which takes the total number of students receiving support to 564,000.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have mentioned, this Bill introduces the Austudy supplement, a loan facility which enables students to trade in up to $2,000 of their Austudy grant for a loan of $4,000, if they so choose. In addition to this change, the Government is also introducing a range of improvements to the Austudy grants scheme, a number of which have been asked for by the student body for some time. Key amongst these is the lowering of the age of independence. The Government is lowering the age of independence to 22 by 1995, with the age dropping to 24 in 1993 and 23 in 1994. Further, we are increasing the amount recipients can earn before their benefits are affected&mdash;from $5,000 to $6,000. Finally, we are also indexing Austudy grants in legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a significant number of improvements to the Austudy grants scheme associated with this Bill in addition to the introduction of the Austudy supplement. As well as all this, the Bill also makes student financial assistance available to students who do not presently receive Austudy because their parents' income may be just above the parental income test but still below $50,000 per annum. These students will be able to access up to $2,000 per annum through the Austudy supplement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An important feature of these loans is that no real rate of interest is charged on the loans, which are only indexed to maintain their real value. Further, no repayments at all are due for the first five years after this supplement is taken out. After this time, students only repay when their income reaches above average weekly earnings. At the 1993 level of average weekly earnings&mdash;$27,748&mdash;students only repay 2 per cent of their income, or a little over $10 a week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to some of the comments made during the debate. Senator Sowada made a number of comments about the desirability of institutional loans, as opposed to voluntary loans paid directly to students from the Commonwealth. The supplement provides a national framework of eligibility to ensure equitable and uniform access. The supplement is intended to extend the flexibility of the existing Austudy and Abstudy schemes and enhance the operation of the grants based scheme. It is fair to say that the introduction of the supplement has assisted in improving the grants scheme itself, quite apart from the additional funds made available to students through the supplement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, an institution-based approach could not guarantee this national access and uniformity of delivery. While this lack of uniformity is often held as a strength of institutional loans, the level of funds available to individual students would depend on how competent a student was at depicting their level of need to the institution concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the establishment of a scheme with the same level of funds as the supplement will provide to students being delivered through institutions would require comprehensive accounting requirements within the institutions and would not provide the consistent audit and financial machinery that the proposed arrangement would provide. However, the Government has provided funds for tertiary institutions to make emergency loans available to their students. But the additional funds available under the supplement should ensure that existing funds are less strained by student demand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come to the question of the amendment that Senator Sowada has indicated she would like to move to have the Student Assistance Act index the amount of income that students can earn before their Austudy is reduced. The issue boils down to whether the level of the threshold should be included in the Act or left to regulations, as at present. Many other features of the Austudy scheme are contained in the regulations. Senator Sowada does not seem to have a problem with that. In fact, the Government has increased the threshold much more rapidly than would have occurred under simple indexation. The latest Budget, for example, includes a 20 per cent increase in the threshold, well above any indexation increase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Sowada's amendment would therefore result in a lower level of personal income test threshold than that decided by the Government. Our legal advice is that her amendment would preclude any amendment to the regulations to make increases outside indexation. I am sure Senator Sowada does not have that as her primary intention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Sowada also went on to make a few other comments, basically claiming that the HEC scheme has been a major disadvantage to low income students and quoted surveys to that effect. I would appreciate it if she would send me those surveys. I would like to look at their methodology because I have had no anecdotal or other evidence to see that particular point backed up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> It is a constant refrain in this chamber&mdash;sometimes on my side&mdash;that all education should be free and that students are being indebted into the future. As I have already made clear, the indebtedness is by no means great, and people who have the privilege of being educated to the level at which they are should have no difficulty in repaying something to society. I also think of those people who do not go on to tertiary education, who work on the factory floor or elsewhere and wonder why they are the ones who have to pay the taxes to send everyone else to university. It is not as though we are asking for a large repayment either through HECS or through an income supplement, in which case one is doing it on a voluntary basis. In other words, it is not compulsory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Sowada also indicated that she is supporting the Liberal amendment; nothing surprises me in that. But the amount of times in this chamber that we are having the Democrats support Liberal amendments for entirely different reasons than those put forward by the Liberals is very passing strange indeed. The Democrats can always find a set of iconoclastic reasons to support a Liberal Party amendment whilst they attack the rationale behind the Liberal Party amendment. But anyway, it is no great loss. Second reading amendments are not worth the ink they are printed in, so I will not give the matter any more time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Teague asked for some additional information concerning the selection of financial institutions. On August 25 an advertisement was placed in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> seeking expressions of interest from financial institutions to provide lending facilities for the supplement. A letter was also sent to the chief executive officers of 36 financial institutions informing them as to seeking similar expressions of interest.

No public announcement can be made until after the form agreement with the financial institution is signed after late November. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One or two other matters have come up during the debate. Senator Sowada has complained about the amount of Government amendments. They really fall into three areas. One is the area of normal drafting corrections, which seem to be inevitable with legislation these days, but there are two other large areas. The first is bringing the social security amendments into this Bill rather than in a separate social security Bill. They can certainly have passage of the two chambers much earlier than if they were in a social security Bill. Therefore, I think it is justified that they be brought in here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second raft of amendments relates to matters raised by financial institutions. Those amendments are not necessary in the legal sense for the Bill, but they will make negotiations with the successful institution much quicker because they clarify matters that those institutions have raised. It was not essential that those amendments be in the Bill, but for the facilitation of those negotiations they will prove quite useful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I come to my final point. I agreed with a lot of the first part of Senator Tierney's speech. The second part was an unpaid advertisement for <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback! </EMPHASIS>in which the new in-word is `targeting'. I recall when we introduced the concept of targeting in the mid-1980s involving the assets test, et cetera, Senator Tierney's then leader, Mr Peacock, made the greatest song and dance about it ever.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not condemn Senator Tierney, because he was not here in the good old days of the troglodytes opposite who always opposed every element of targeting, every area of middle class welfare. Every time we targeted, all we got were squeals like stuck pigs from those opposite saying, `You can't do this and you can't do that'. I often wondered whether the then Opposition would ever be able to cut a Budget by $10m, let alone the $10 billion that it promised.

As for the Democrats, as always they are motivated by the twin driving forces of principle and political opportunism. Maybe in this case they coalesce; I doubt it very much. The big hint in Senator Sowada's speech was that she is trying to dig in as many of the students votes as possible. She is working on the old principle that it does not matter if one offends 90 per cent as long as one can get the 10 per cent.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have one question that follows on from my speech during the second reading debate. I thank the Minister for the answers he gave regarding the financial institution and the announcement that will occur in a few weeks. But there was one question I asked that was not answered and that concerns the estimates by the Government of the financial savings to the Budget in all of the next 10 financial years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his second reading speech the Minister made estimates for the first three financial years&mdash;in which there are escalating savings&mdash;and also with regard to 10 years away. He vaguely foreshadowed that there would be charges to the Budget as a result of this Bill five years hence. The precision with regard to those estimates has not been given. I am confident that those estimates have been made, and I ask that the Minister give those estimates now. That is the first matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second matter that Senator Ray might address concerns amendment No. 8. Essentially, amendment No. 8 of the 28 amendments before us gives a guarantee or safety net to the financial institution that protects the validity of the contract between the student and the participating corporation from the operation of other laws; that is, all laws applying in a State or Territory, whether Commonwealth or Territory laws. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can see the intention of that amendment and, indeed, amendment No. 8 replaces words that are already set out in these terms on page 9 of the Bill:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) The validity of a financial supplement contract is not affected by any other law (whether written or unwritten) in force in a State or Territory.</PARA>
<PARA>Amendment No. 8 is a strengthening of that expression in the original version of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just want to ask whether the Government is confident that there is not an unintended consequence in this amendment; that is, there may well be quite proper State and Commonwealth laws that would give safeguards to students or the banks which will be made invalid by this amendment. I am really asking the Minister whether the Government has addressed the full repercussions of this waiver of all other laws that might bear upon the matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the Opposition's part, we support the 28 amendments that the Government is moving. I only express surprise that this Bill was able to pass through the House of Representatives in the hands of the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin) and did not have these 28 amendments. These 28 amendments do meet requests for safeguards by the financial institutions involved. No doubt those were part of the negotiations in the last weeks. Amendment No. 28, which is in 16 parts, deals with the integration of this Bill with the Social Security Act. It is all admirable stuff, but I just express surprise that these matters were not addressed when the Bill was first before the House of Representatives. </PARA>

The figures projected to the year 2000 are based on assumptions far more than they are for the next three years. I think that before the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin) can provide that answer he must clear it, and he has not done that at this stage. The answer will be provided and the information on this subject will be sent to Senator Teague.

This matter was gone into with Parliamentary Counsel and the Attorney-General's Office. Essentially, it is to deal with students under the age of 18. That is what the amendment is targeted at. I do not think it is targeted at an exemption from all State laws per se, but at those related to under 18-year-olds. I think there will be provisions in State Acts that suggest that minors cannot be bound by certain contracts. I do not think there would be a large number of cases&mdash;there are few under 18-year-olds undertaking tertiary education; it would only have applied to me for about a month, I think&mdash;but it does apply to some people. That is what it is targeted at&mdash;making sure that provisions that protect under 18-year-olds are not in some way used to undermine this section. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister. I make the further passing remark that 10 years ago the Minister, Senator Ray, and I happened to be serving on a Senate standing committee on education and the arts. It was proposing a Fraser Government-initiated scheme to extend benefits for student assistance. It involved going to financial institutions and it was unanimously accepted by that Senate committee.

They are, as we have been told, of a technical nature and do, apparently, take into account the concerns of financial institutions.

It is surprising that within a fairly short space of time the Government has seen fit to present to the Parliament five pages of amendments which were not included in the Bill when the legislation passed through the House of Representatives.

However, I note that the Chapman report suggested that the personal income threshold be increased to $8,000. Nowhere in the Government's support for the Chapman report do we see any commitment to increase the personal income threshold to $8,000 as suggested by Chapman.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition will be supporting the Service and Execution of Process Bill and the Service and Execution of Process (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill. The service and execution of process is a fundamental part of our judicial system. The founding fathers of Federation recognised that State borders should not be barriers to justice. Therefore, the Commonwealth, pursuant to section 51 (xxiv) of the Constitution, has the power to make laws with respect to the service and execution of process. The obvious necessity for such laws in a federation of States of independent legal nature ensured that this was one of the first subjects of legislation after Federation in 1901.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of changes in Australian society in the past 90 years, particularly in terms of advances in transport and communications technology, it has long been apparent that the 1901 Act has become outdated in many ways. It is 10 years this month since the Acting Attorney-General at the time, my friend the Hon. N.A. Brown QC, referred the operation of the Service and Execution of Process Act to the Law Reform Commission for examination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commission reported in 1987, recommending the drafting of a new Act to include changes in the procedures for interstate service and execution process within the scope of the Act and in the procedures for the interstate enforcement of judgments. It was also recommended that the scope of the Act be broadened to enable interstate service and execution of the process of investigative and adjudicative tribunals. This latter change was implemented last year in the Service and Execution of Process Amendment Bill 1991, the passage of which was supported by the coalition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now, some five years after the Law Reform Commission's report, the Bills before us largely implement the report's recommendations. Their purpose is to repeal the existing service and execution of process arrangements in the Service and Execution of Process Act 1901 and to institute a new scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Service and Execution of Process (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 1992 provides for the repeal of the 1901 Act and also for the continued application of some sections of that Act. The Service and Execution of Process Bill 1992 is the more substantial of the two Bills. It replaces the 1901 Act as the principal piece of legislation dealing with the interstate service of legal process and the enforcement of court judgments and tribunal orders outside the State or Territory in which they are known. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It sets out new procedures relating to interstate service of processing civil and criminal proceedings; interstate service of subpoenas; interstate service of process of tribunals; interstate execution of warrants; and enforcement of fines imposed by courts of summary jurisdiction. It has been a long, tiring process. It was 10 years since the matter was referred to the Law Reform Commission and five years since we have got to this stage. Perhaps we are all a little tired of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 9 of the Bill sets out the procedures for service of a document on a company. The provisions are the same as those in section 220 of the corporations law. Clause 11 of the Bill deals with proof of service. It specifies the matters that have to be proved in order to prove service of a document, although any of the requirements may be dispensed with if the court or tribunal is satisfied that service was effected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 15 sets out the rules for service of initiating process in respect of civil proceedings, and clause 24 sets out the rules for criminal proceedings. Initiating process issued in one State may be served in another State. Service on an individual is to be effected in the same way as service of such process in the place of issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Combining with existing cross-vesting legislation, the provisions will enable cases to be determined in the most convenient venue. A person served with initiating process may apply to the court of issue for an order staying the proceedings. The court may grant such an order if it is satisfied that a court of another State is the appropriate court. Further provisions relate to the service of subpoenas, both generally and those addressed to people in prison. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part 4 of the Bill deals with service of process of tribunals. Division 4 of part 4, which relates to service of subpoenas in the performance of investigative functions, replicates the effect of the 1991 amendments to the Service and Execution of Process Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rules relating to initiating process and service of subpoenas are similar to those which will apply in respect of courts. A subpoena issued by a tribunal may only be served interstate with leave of the court of the State of issue. `Court' is defined to include a magistrate or judge who is a member of the tribunal which issued the subpoena. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition raised the question in relation to the 1991 amendments to the service and execution of process legislation, whether the Commonwealth has the power to legislate with respect to the service and execution of process of State tribunals. I understand that the Government has received advice from the Solicitor-General that these amendments are within constitutional power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clauses 81 to 90 of the Bill provide for the execution of warrants. A person who is named on a warrant may be apprehended in another State and must then be brought before a magistrate as soon as practicable. Unless the warrant is invalid, the magistrate must either remand the person on bail to appear in the place in which the warrant was issued, or order that they be taken in custody to that place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further provisions of the Bill relate to suppression orders. Under the present Act a magistrate does not have the power to make a suppression order. Under the new provisions a magistrate conducting a proceeding under clause 83 with respect to a person apprehended and brought before them under a warrant will have the power to order that a part of the proceeding or review held in public, or a finding publicly made, not be published or broadcast. For this provision to apply, the magistrate must be satisfied that publication or broadcast would give rise to a substantial risk of prejudice to the fair trial of a person; of death, injury or property loss to a witness; of prejudice to law enforcement or national security; of identification of the victim of a sexual offence; or of identification of a child in proceedings concerning his or her welfare; or where the child is the victim or the alleged offender. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pursuant to clause 97 a suppression order remains in force until revoked. It is arguable that this provision is not within the Commonwealth's power to make laws with respect to the service and execution of process, and is therefore not constitutional. This is because it purports to extend suppression orders beyond the service of process or extradition of a person into and beyond the conduct of the proceedings themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from the two points of constitutional argument that I have just mentioned, as I indicated at the outset, the coalition is supporting the passage of these Bills. We believe them to be a sensible, and indeed overdue, updating of the Commonwealth procedures for the service and execution of process. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are speaking this evening on the Service and Execution of Process Bill 1992 and the Service and Execution of Process (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 1992, which were introduced into the Senate on 10 September 1992. The purpose of the service and execution of process Bills is to replace the Service and Execution of Process Act 1901 as the principal piece of legislation dealing with the interstate service of legal process and the enforcement of court orders outside the State or Territory in which they are made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As pointed out by the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) in his second reading speech, the Service and Execution of Process Act is an important piece of legislation, as it was the eleventh enactment of this Federal Parliament way back in 1901. It shows the importance to which interstate service and execution of process should attach. The Australian Democrats are very mindful of this fact tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As one of the original enactments of this Parliament, it was a matter of course that in 1982 the Attorney-General gave the Australian Law Reform Commission a reference which required it to inquire into and report on the adequacy of the law relating to the service and execution throughout the Commonwealth of the civil and criminal process and the judgments of the courts of the States and Territories. The reference followed representations by the Attorneys-General of a number of States concerning certain deficiencies in the original Act, including the lack of provision in the original Act for the service and execution of process and decisions of State and Territory tribunals which are not courts but exercise adjudicative functions similar to them and the difficulties in the interstate service of information for minor criminal offences which do not require the attendance of the defendant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Law Reform Commission's report was tabled in Parliament in December 1987 and, due to numerous delays and minor technical problems, we finally have the Bill before us tonight. This Bill, by and large, adopts the major recommendations made by the Australian Law Reform Commission. Those recommendations include: first, the abolition of the rules requiring a connection between the cause of action and the State or Territory in which the proceedings are commenced; secondly, that the initiating process generally be served personally, but in the case of corporations it be possible to do so by electronic means, and in all cases facsimile copies of process be sufficient; thirdly, that service of subpoena be ineffective unless enough money is given or tendered to the person served to meet his or her expenses of complying with the subpoena; fourthly, if a challenge is made to a plaintiff's choice of venue, the court is to consider which is the most appropriate venue, having regard to certain matters, including the location of the parties, their likely witnesses and the subject matter of the proceedings; fifthly, provision for the interstate service of subpoenas and execution of warrants of State or Territory investigative tribunals; sixthly, the defences or objections to enforcement of a court order be litigated only in the State or Territory in which the order was given; and seventhly, that facsimile copies of process be allowed for the purpose of extradition proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I interpolate here that the use of facsimile copies becomes highly relevant with respect to the amendment that the Democrats will be wanting to move at the committee stage. The Australian Democrats welcome this modernised Bill, which contains some very useful initiatives to adequately meet the needs of the law as it relates to service and execution throughout the Commonwealth of the civil and criminal process and the judgments of the courts of the State and Territories. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is, however, one clause in this Bill which the Australian Democrats are concerned about. Clause 83(5), which is contained in part 5, division 1 of the Bill, deals with the procedure after apprehension of a person who has a warrant issued for his or her arrest. Clause 83(5) has the practical effect that, for whatever reason, if the warrant for the apprehension of a person is not produced at the initial appearance before a magistrate, a person may be remanded on bail or in custody for up to five days in order to allow the arresting officers time to produce the warrant. That, of course, is the reason that I drew particular attention to the use of facsimile copies and the electronic transmission of warrants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleague Senator Spindler alluded to this very point when, just over a year ago, this issue was debated in relation to an amendment to the Service and Execution of Process Bill 1991. The amendment at that time, which was moved by the Government and supported by the Opposition, was to remand a person on bail or in custody for up to seven days. As pointed out by Senator Spindler at that time, it was ludicrous for a person, through no fault of his or her own, to be kept in custody for up to seven days&mdash;and this is in an age when fax machines, which are specifically alluded to in this legislation, and other means of communication have been updated and are generally available to the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Spindler further argued that it was somewhat extraordinary that we should regard what is essentially a very important civil liberties issue in this way. At that time the Australian Democrats moved an amendment to reduce the seven day period to four days. This amendment was unfortunately not supported by either the Government or the Opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since this amendment was moved by the Australian Democrats, I understand that the Attorney-General's Department saw some force in Senator Spindler's arguments and has since acted upon them by reducing the time limit to five days in the Bill. However the Australian Democrats still do not find this five-day period an acceptable balance between on the one hand protecting civil liberties and on the other hand assisting the authorities in their pursuit to apprehend suspect criminals. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats will therefore be moving an amendment for a four-day period, which mirrors the amendment moved by Senator Spindler last year. Apart from this amendment, the Australian Democrats welcome this new legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I rise to thank the Opposition and the Australian Democrats for indicating their support for the Service and Execution of Process Bill, which is now before the chamber. Honourable senators are aware that this Bill is important insofar as it recognises yet again what this chamber has been called upon to recognise increasingly over the last several years&mdash;that Australia is one nation and that the old jurisdictional boundaries between the States and the Territories should not be regarded as so sacrosanct that they might impede or, in this case, frustrate the way in which the legal system, particularly the criminal justice system, needs to operate. Quite clearly, those who allegedly breach our criminal laws do not have regard for State boundaries as providing any particular impediment to their activity. The idea that they might gain some advantage by seeking sanctuary in another State will be combated by the sort of legislation that we have before us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As has been noted by Senator Hill, this Bill draws very largely on the Australian Law Reform Commission's report of some years ago. It has taken some time to bring this legislation to the Parliament. It is so important that we aid the effective operation of the courts, the police and the correctional authorities of the various States and Territories that I think the time taken to produce the legislation has been worth while. I think the unanimous support that this chamber will give to the legislation is a recognition of the excellent work that has been done by the Attorney-General's Department, in consultation with the States and the Territories. In some instances, some heed has been paid to the comments that have been made even by the Democrats in the formulation of the finer points of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill sets out an exclusive method for interstate service of process. It provides many safeguards. But also, as I say, it makes the system of serving documents very much more efficient. For example, solicitors will be able to use the one document for service anywhere in Australia, supplemented by an information notice as prescribed when service is interstate. There are also rules which will enable cases to be determined in the most convenient forum, rather than having to find some particular connection between the cause of action and the State in which proceedings are commenced. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 83, page 44, subclause (5), omit "5 days", substitute "4 days".</PARA>
<PARA>I draw the attention of the Committee to this particular clause because it deals with the procedure after apprehension. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As soon as practicable after being apprehended, the person is to be taken before a magistrate of the State in which the person was apprehended.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The warrant or a copy of the warrant must be produced to the magistrate if it is available.</PARA>
<PARA>Given that, as I indicated at the second reading stage, we now have these facsimile machines&mdash;a fact to which attention has also been drawn by the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate)&mdash;it should be possible to produce the warrant or a copy of that warrant very quickly, essentially anywhere in Australia, certainly anywhere a person would be in custody. The section goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the warrant or a copy of the warrant is not produced, the magistrate may:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) order that the person be released; or</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) adjourn the proceeding for such reasonable time as the magistrate specifies and remand the person on bail or in such custody as the magistrate specifies.</PARA>
<PARA>So we now have a situation in which a person has been apprehended, taken into custody, the warrant has not been produced and the magistrate can now remand that person in custody. The section then goes on to say that if the warrant or a copy of the warrant is not produced when the proceeding resumes, the magistrate may order that the person be released or may further keep that person in custody. The relevant section, of course, is subclause (5) which states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The total time of the adjournments referred to in paragraphs (3)(b) and (4)(b) must not exceed 5 days.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, in this time in which we have these facsimile machines and all these whiz-bang devices to get these documents around the country in very short order, in a matter of milliseconds, we are finding that a person who may indeed eventually prove to be quite innocent can be apprehended, taken into custody and kept in custody for a period of five days and then, presumably, if the warrant is not produced, can be released. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We find that, in this day and age, quite unacceptable. It is for that reason that we suggest a lesser period of four days, as I indicated earlier and as Senator Spindler indicated in a debate nearly a year ago. Even that, one could argue, is an excessive time to keep in custody a person who may yet prove to be innocent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, surely this type of thing could encourage those who are involved in the process of apprehension and holding people to be simply sloppy and lazy in acquiring the relevant warrant. Simply knowing that the person can be kept in custody for that period of five days, they could say, `It doesn't matter. We'll just keep the person in custody for another day or so'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, for that reason, it seems to encourage a certain sloppiness on the part of the authorities, which really is not warranted in this day and age when we have these facsimile devices. So I would urge the Committee to accept the amendment moved by the Australian Democrats to substitute a period of `5 days' for `4 days'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are considering clause 83 which, as Senator Coulter said and as the Committee of the Whole is well aware, deals with that very important matter of the apprehension of a person. It requires, of course, that a person be brought, as soon as practicable after the apprehension, before a magistrate in the State where the person is apprehended. Making a magistrate aware of the apprehension is just a first stage, and a most important one for the liberties of the subject.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the normal course, the warrant&mdash;or a copy of it&mdash;must be produced to the magistrate, and that would occur in most cases. The clause provides that if the warrant is not produced, the magistrate must either order that the person be released&mdash;so the magistrate always has that possibility&mdash;or adjourn the proceeding for a reasonable time and remand the person on bail or in custody. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This particular clause provides that that total time of that adjournment awaiting the production of the warrant, or a copy of it, must not exceed five days. Indeed, if at the end of that period the warrant is not produced, then the person must be released. So it is in the context of trying to deal with the very real possibility that Senator Coulter adverts to&mdash;that a person could, by sloppiness, as he put it, negligence or even some sort of malice, be kept in detention whilst this warrant was looked for for production before the magistrate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Originally, a seven-day upper limit was put in this particular provision. As Senator Coulter may know, that went before the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills, which had expressed concern about it in relation to a previous incarnation of that particular provision. As recently as 16 September, the Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills reported that it had received a response from the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) in relation to this matter. In that response, it says the Attorney-General agreed to consult with the States and Territories to see whether a shorter period&mdash;that is, seven days&mdash;might be practicable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That particular consultation did take place. I think that was because of an undertaking that I had given that that consultation should take place when the Senate was discussing a similar clause some time ago. On being consulted, I am informed that, of those States that responded, New South Wales favoured three to four days&mdash;three days being more than ample in the majority of cases&mdash;the Northern Territory spoke of difficulties if it was less than seven days; South Australia said that seven days was appropriate; and Queensland favoured five working days. In general, we thought that five days was a reasonable position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I am advised, the problem is not so much with getting a copy of the warrant. I must admit that I thought that that was the problem&mdash;in which case the facsimiles and the electronic transmissions should be able to deal with the matter in milliseconds. I am advised that the problem is not so much getting a copy of the warrant to the court in remote areas, but getting the arrested person to a magistrate in remote areas where there has been an adjournment and the magistrate has moved on, which is an interesting further point which I had not considered in relation to outback and remoter areas of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the period of five days seems to be an upper limit, which I believe is a good protection for the apprehended person and for the administration of justice. It is also interesting that the Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills, on which I believe Senator Coulter's distinguished colleague Senator Bell may sit, in reporting to the Senate on this particular Bill stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee is therefore pleased to note that in the Bill now before the Parliament a limit of 5 days is prescribed.</PARA>
<PARA>It seems that the Committee was satisfied enough with the five days. I agree that, if four or six days were chosen, perhaps it could be argued either way. But a limit of five days seems to be what came out as a reasonable result or conclusion from the consultations which were undertaken with the States and Territories. I believe the Committee of the whole should accept the results of that consultation. It appears to have been accepted by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee as a reasonable result. Therefore, the Government is looking for the support of the Committee of the Whole for the clause in the Bill and a rejection of the Democrats' proposal for a reduction to four days. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I find the explanation of the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) somewhat unconvincing. It seems as though the Government has been prepared to settle for an arithmetic mean of the figures between the various States but, on his own admission a moment ago, Senator Tate said that New South Wales had indicated a period of three to four days. Surely, if New South Wales indicated that three to four days were an acceptable period, it says something about either the adequacy of the availability of the faxed warrants or, as the Minister has indicated, the inadequacy of the provision of magistrates who are on circuit to actually pick up this matter. Are we to assume that the magisterial system in New South Wales is so much better than it is in the Northern Territory that the Northern Territory is opting for a much longer period?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that, under these circumstances, if one State can meet a shorter period, we should be arguing strongly that the other States should come into line. It is not just a matter of convenience here; it is a matter of civil liberties. People are being held in custody, without a warrant being produced, for a long period&mdash;for a day longer than necessary. I remain unconvinced by the use of an arithmetic mean rather than the more desirable acceptance of what clearly can be achieved in one State&mdash;the minimum period&mdash;as a period which should be therefore imposed on the other States so they pull their house into order. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think much more can be added to the argument. This is going to be as rare as hen's teeth. As Senator Coulter says, the fax will get the copy of the warrant to the magistrate on the day 99 times out of 100. Whilst New South Wales was, in the consultation, prepared to go for three or four days, it is interesting that it was the States with much larger outback, remote and rural areas which are served by magistrates on a less regular basis&mdash;this particular proposal led the Northern Territory to say that there were difficulties with less than seven days; South Australia seven days; and Queensland five working days&mdash;that went for an upper limit. We were not exactly looking for an arithmetic mean; we were trying to deal with what we were told were difficulties in States of that type with huge outback areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had not particularly given weight to that in the earlier discussion that we had about a year ago on these matters, but it does appear to be a concern. Nevertheless, we have to try to protect the civil liberties of the person who has been apprehended; that is why Government has reduced its original proposal of seven days to five days. As I say, the Scrutiny of Bills Committee seemed to find that that was a reasonable course of action, following from the consultations, so I still commend it to the Senate as a reasonable provision. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Amendment Bill 1992 removes the uncertainties about the enforcement of laws concerning the labelling of wine. In 1989, legislation to implement a wine labelling integrity program was carried with coalition support. The program was developed at industry request and required manufacturers to keep records to support labelling claims on the vintage, variety and region of origin of the wine. The records must be made available for audit upon request of the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation. The first inspections were in the Clare Valley of South Australia in 1990 and no breaches were detected.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, 200 audits have shown the following technical deficiencies which make enforcement of the legislation difficult. Firstly, while the Act requires that records be kept, there is no requirement that these records be accurate and complete. Secondly, the manufacturer must provide the records even if they are self-incriminating, but the manufacturer is then protected from prosecution should the records disclose false labelling. There is therefore doubt whether a successful prosecution concerning false labelling could be launched under the present Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill does four things. First, it makes it an offence to knowingly or recklessly fail to make and keep such records or make and keep false, misleading or incomplete records. Secondly, it amends the clause which requires a person to provide information to the Corporation on request, but indemnifies that person from prosecution where such information is furnished. The amendment removes the labelling integrity program provisions from section 42, but otherwise leaves the section unchanged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, it allows a person with reasonable excuse to refuse a request for the Corporation to provide their records. It would be a reasonable excuse if the records are self-incriminating. Where a person chooses with reasonable excuse not to provide the records, the Corporation must obtain a warrant to obtain the records. This will allow those records to be used to initiate the prosecution, thus achieving the original intention of the legislation. The Bill enables the Corporation to retain records for 60 days or, if a prosecution for a label offence is initiated within 60 days, until proceedings and appeals are ended. A person will be able to inspect or copy the records given to the Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fourthly, the Bill honours a commitment the Government made to the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills to enable a person to copy evidence seized by an inspector, and reduce the period of validity of an offence warrant from one month to a maximum of seven days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian wine industry is one of the great success stories of Australian industry at present. It does not matter whether one sees it as a primary industry, a manufacturing industry or one marketing a product. On behalf of the coalition parties in the other chamber, the shadow Minister for Primary Industry, Bruce Lloyd, has already congratulated everyone associated with this very great industry in this country because it epitomises growth and geographic and varietal diversity. I am pleased to be associated with this industry, as is my colleague the honourable member for Riverina, Mr Noel Hicks, whose electorate encompasses a large proportion of Australia's wine growing regions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only is production increasing, but also because of where it is located in many different areas of Australia it is providing some interesting developments and differences in variety and type of wine produced. The wine industry obviously has quality control as a high priority: hence this legislation. It is one of our best examples of value adding of a product. It is also one of the best examples of a growth industry for exports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a lesson for some other industries in relation to the organisation of the industry. In 1990, the Winemakers Federation of Australia came into being to bring together three different industry organisations. They now cover 95 per cent of production. As a result, the industry is now able to speak out on different issues of concern. The 1990-91 report of the Winemakers Federation of Australia, which highlights the damage being done to the industry by invisible taxes, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Taxation on domestic production bleeds into export costs as input items are inflated through a whole range of invisible taxes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The impact of these invisible taxes should not be underestimated and have been estimated as high as 30 per cent of all taxes.</PARA>
<PARA>In that report, the industry made the point that one of its major challenges for the future and its ability to grow and prosper is to tackle issues such as taxation that will affect our capacity to remain internationally competitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is where the coalition's Fightback policy comes in. In a number of discussions with the industry, it has been very positive in relation to the impact of Fightback. Input taxes are removed under Fightback. As the industry indicated, there are many taxes that are more or less hidden at present but they are there nevertheless. These taxes are removed under Fightback, which means that the industry can be more internationally competitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As production increases and the percentage of exports increases, that international competition requirement increases also, particularly where the Australian industry is competing against other countries which already have similar tax incentives. I think of New Zealand and France as two examples where, by having a GST or VAT system, those import taxes are removed. Of course, for exports, the GST or VAT is fully rebated and that is a very significant factor when one looks at the competitive situation of different countries and export markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present there are hidden export taxes on our wine, as there are on every other export from Australia. That has been calculated as equivalent to a 5 per cent export tax. Senator Button has been quoted where he has acknowledged that there is this export tax which has been calculated by Treasury at $1.8 billion per year. The French, the New Zealanders and others have this system, and where those inputs are rebated at the point of export have a considerable advantage over our wine exporters. That is one of the reasons why the industry is enthusiastic about <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS>&mdash;as, of course, are so many other individuals and industries throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year the industry exported $234m worth of wine, which is a 10-fold increase in six years. After something of a false start a few years ago, this export growth is very soundly based. It is anticipated that by the year 2000 the industry could be one of our major export earners, with $1 billion a year in export income for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the other important features of the industry is that it is value adding to an excellent degree and in a logical and natural way. In a recent article by Andrew Clark in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>, referring to developments in the industry in Europe, he made the point:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian wine export story is a successful grafting of old-fashioned business values with hi-tech.</PARA>
<PARA>He also said that Australian wine is achieving a real premium on the British market because while it has only 2.7 per cent in volume in that market, it has 12 per cent of wine costing more than $12.50 per bottle. The industry has a far better percentage in relation to the quality section of the market than the volume section, and that is what value adding is about. One can look at other markets where the Australian wine industry is increasing not only its volume of exports but also the value of those exports to an even greater degree. This comes back to the importance of quality control with value adding, brand marketing and responsibility for individual labels. That is why this legislation is being supported. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition parties support the legislation and wish the wine industry a very successful and expanding future, not just in Australia but as one of the major export industries for this country in the coming years. </PARA>

Today there is a report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS> which would probably make most South Australians fall over. It is a good news story about Wolf Blass reporting that wine sales will soar. I am delighted that at last the huge increase in exports of Australian wine to overseas markets has been acknowledged by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser,</EMPHASIS> but it ought be acknowledged by all Australians. The points that Senator Tambling has made, excluding his comments about the GST, which I will come to in a minute, need to be endorsed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of the time constraints confronting us and the attempt to pass this Bill tonight, I will not toil over all of those figures again. The growth of exports of Australian wine is quite remarkable. It is a fantastic turnaround from a few years ago when we were actually digging out vines. At present winemakers are concerned as to whether they will be able to meet the demands that they anticipate in the next few years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> What is most important, and why it is so opportune to speak under this legislation, is that Australia is marketing its wine as quality product. Even the bulk wines or the cask wines that Australia sells overseas leave most of the bulk competition for dead. So we are able to hold our heads high, whether we are talking about the cask wines or the particularly splendid labelled wines that leave our shores. We now have markets established in the United Kingdom, Sweden, the United States, New Zealand, Canada and Japan, and all of those set to grow. People cannot get enough of Australian wine. It is quite clear that there is a tremendous opportunity for increasing this market and even perhaps achieving the goal of $1 billion from exports of Australian wine by the year 2000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A few years ago, too, the then editor of the Adelaide <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS>, Piers Ackerman, was running a campaign in that paper to remove the stock valuation tax from wine which was particularly, he argued, offensive for the small boutique wineries. I suppose I got held personally responsible by Piers Ackerman for killing that campaign. I asked a question about it of Senator Peter Walsh, then a Minister in this place, and, as only he can, he gave a splendid and devastating answer. The money that would have been recouped was about $16m, a very small amount. I have had absolutely no request made to my office from the wine and brandy growers or producers in South Australia. When I rang them to ask whether I was right I was told, `You are, Senator. We are not concerned about the removal of the stock valuation tax; we are concerned about assistance for export marketing'. That is exactly what the Government has given them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have seen here with this growth in exports is the best example of assistance by government to an industry that has its own quality product&mdash;an industry which has got out there, sought those markets and won them. As Wolf Blass says, the challenge now is to keep the supplies coming, to keep the quality and to maintain and service those markets. But the industry said to me then, and it still does, that what it wants is further assistance of the sort that goes with export market development grants and the benefits that Austrade has been able to provide. I think those are very important. Indeed, what we have here is, as Senator Tambling says, the industry value adding, producing a splendid quality product that is being very much sought after overseas, and that being done with the assistance of government. That is the very best kind of combination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the one minute left to me, I want to take issue with Senator Tambling on the benefits of the GST to this industry. I understand Senator Tambling to be saying that under the GST all hidden taxes, as he calls them&mdash;they are not too hidden, really&mdash;will be removed and there will be a reduction in the costs for wine that is to be exported from Australia. But I would ask Senator Tambling: at what price?  The price is a 15 per cent GST on all the wine that is drunk in Australia by Australians. If Senator Tambling calls that fair, I think that is a very exciting argument to put. We also know that one of the industries that will be enormously hurt by that will be the tourist industry&mdash;yet another way in which this invidious, all-embracing, all-encompassing GST will not be of benefit to Australians at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Tambling's campaign on all the difficulties confronting this industry with the current taxes is hardly borne out by the figures. Under the present regime this industry, as he says, has gone from about 11 million litres or thereabouts in 1985-86 to 77.6 million litres worth $234m in 1991-92; they are the exports only. If we just consider that growth in exports under the current tax regime and if we see the enormous increase in the production of wine in this country and in its sales&mdash;although there was a slight dip in the domestic purchasing, domestic sales have now gone up again&mdash;it is hardly a good case to say that this industry is burdened by tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This industry is a glowing industry. It is an acknowledgment of the very best that Australia can do. It is not a sob story that we have here; it is a success story. If the current tax regime is so crippling, I think we would find a different story to tell in terms of production and sales. I just remind people of the benefits of this legislation because, as Senator Tambling has said, it will ensure the quality of Australian wine is maintained, and the truth in labelling will make that quality known. It is a story of success, a story to celebrate and not one to threaten with a GST. </PARA>

There are many Australians who are still misled by the labels on the products that they buy in the supermarkets&mdash;people who think they are buying Australian to assist our economy and to contribute to the welfare of this country but who are being deceived by the label and its inadequacies. I am pleased to note that our Australian Customs Service is doing something about that; it is taking a much more active and effective role in protecting Australian consumers from these deceptive labels. But we need more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased also that Senator Meg Lees, a Democrat senator for South Australia, has taken an initiative in bringing forward her own labelling scheme, to operate in some Foodland Supermarkets in South Australia, which assists consumers to make the decision to buy Australian. The success of Senator Lees's program easily demonstrates that if only we had the same sort of attitude towards other horticultural and food producing industries that we have towards the wine industry, if only we could replicate the sort of attitude that we have demonstrated here for the wine industry&mdash;and it is a good attitude, one that is demanded by Australian consumers&mdash;we might find that we would not be importing food products costing $2 billion into Australia each year&mdash;food products which, of course, can be produced in Australia and can produce jobs in Australia, and food products which, of course, Australians actually want. That has been demonstrated in those Foodland Supermarkets by Senator Meg Lees's program. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Vietnam is economically liberalising and has been in that process since 1986. That is something that we applaud. At present Australia's trade with Vietnam might still be reasonably modest, but it is an increasing trade and there are increasing investment opportunities for Australia in Vietnam. It is a relationship that has the potential to grow and broaden in the years ahead.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does seem to senators on this side of the chamber that the development of that relationship will be retarded by Vietnam's human rights performance. We would like to think that other nations that similarly abhor human rights abuses and comply with the international covenants to protect human rights would also be of the view that their future relations with Vietnam will suffer as a result of the current practices. We would hope that with concerted action the international community might be able to encourage improvement in that performance by Vietnam. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Acting Deputy President, you will be aware that earlier this year Australia became the first nation to reinstate a bilateral aid program with Vietnam. We were concerned that that seemed to have been done without any real effort&mdash;again with like-minded nations&mdash;to use the leverage to seek an improvement in the behaviour of Vietnam in relation to its own citizens. We have also been somewhat concerned that much of that program, as we understand it, will not benefit the poorest of Vietnam's people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It did seem to us to be an opportunity lost. Against the background of Australia now providing Vietnam with foreign aid and of an expanding trade relationship, unfortunately the position of that country on human rights does not seem to have significantly improved at all. For example, I refer to the Amnesty International reports of 1991 and the annual report of 1992. They bring to our attention the fact that there are still hundreds of political prisoners and prisoners of conscience imprisoned in Vietnam, and that long term political prisoners&mdash;that is, over five years&mdash;include writers, poets, journalists, Roman Catholic priests, Buddhist monks, professionals, business people, civil servants, politicians and former military personnel who are still detained in so-called re-education camps. It reminds us that there are tribal peoples of Vietnam who are still imprisoned. These reports also bring to us information on an increasing crackdown on intellectuals and also on critics of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amnesty's concerns, which seem to be largely supported by other organisations such as Asia Watch, are principally: the continuing detention without charge or trial of opponents or critics of the Government, including those detained for the peaceful expression of their political, religious and other beliefs; and also that political trials continue with restricted rights to defence, restrictions on the media, reports of torture and ill treatment, and death sentences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said that this information is supported by the recent reports I have read of Asia Watch which dealt with dissent and repression among human rights activists, writers and artists in Vietnam. Asia Watch has also raised the issue of continuing detention in re-education camps, where those detained perform hard labour under conditions of malnutrition, abuse and lack of medical care; the fact that these periods of detention are indefinitely renewable; and also the fact that these prisoners are deprived of basic documentation essential for the conduct of everyday life. Vietnamese people generally are subjected to police surveillance and restricted movement in some cases&mdash;in other words, the denial of normal civil rights and entitlements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I ask the Australian Government, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Evans) in particular, to do is to examine this list of detainees in Vietnam&mdash;so defined as prisoners of conscience&mdash;that I have had incorporated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> tonight, and come back to the Senate in the not-too-distant future and inform the Senate as to whether it is of the view that the list is correct. Also, it should inform the Senate of what action the Australian Government will take both on its own account and, as I said, in conjunction with like-minded nations, to apply greater pressure than is currently being applied to Vietnam to improve its performance in this important area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, we would argue that the Vietnamese Government particularly needs to institute reform by immediate and unconditional release of prisoners of conscience who are currently being detained; the immediate cessation of punishment of critics through detention without trial, and denial of basic civil rights; and the recognition, and protection in the law, of the rights of its citizens to peacefully express their views. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We would argue that that is the very minimum that should be sought of the Vietnamese Government. I hope that the Minister for Foreign Affairs will take this matter seriously, because I get the impression that the Australian Government is turning a blind eye to these abuses. I think it is out of fear that it might in some way prejudice the growing relationship of Vietnam with Australia. If that is so, that is a fundamentally wrong way in which to approach the expanding relationship. Once we demonstrate through our performance that these basic human rights are not of the importance that we tend to say they are, then we will not find that they are respected by places in the world that are seeking international recognition and support, such as Vietnam. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I say, I hope the Minister will take this request seriously and that when the Parliament returns, if it does return, in February&mdash;perhaps even before&mdash;he can give the Senate a full report of the Australian Government's assessment of the list that I have had incorporated, and what action the Australian Government has been prepared to undertake and, in fact, has undertaken, to apply greater pressure to Vietnam in this important area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 24 September at the Senate Estimates Committee B hearing I asked officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade the following question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What is your view about what is likely to happen to the high profile boat people whose applications for refugee status have recently been refused?  What is their likely fate when they return to China?</PARA>
<PARA>That appears on page 354 of the Estimates Committee <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. In response to that, Mr Irvine, a very senior officer in the Department, had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the last year or so and more recently, the Chinese Government has made a number of public statements to the effect that, if students who have stayed away in other countries were to return home, they would suffer no legal consequences. We have, in fact, encountered little evidence of an illegal deportee from China, having applied for refugee status in Australia, for example, and having returned to China, being subject to harsh treatment.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Acting Deputy President, my question related in that instance to the high profile boat people. You will recall that concern was being expressed by refugee organisations that certain of these people were going to be deported. In fact, that occurred on 23 October 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department chartered an RAAF aircraft and deported seven Chinese refugee applicants who had arrived in Australia by boat. On 29 October I issued a press statement in which I said that the Government was naive in accepting Chinese assurances. I said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Government would be proven foolish and gullible if claims that seven Chinese deportees had been jailed on their return were true. . . The Government had naively accepted the assurances of the Chinese Government that the deportees would not be punished as a result of their illegal departure from China. . . </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Acting Deputy President, you will recall that the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) had said that the Government was `satisfied with these assurances'. Those seven asylum-seekers, by the way, included a two-year-old child. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have it on very reliable authority that the seven have been imprisoned on their return to China. I am not absolutely certain today, 5 November, as to what is their fate, but I am most concerned about it. There is a growing number of people in Australia who are concerned about the Government accepting the assurances given by the PRC Government, and not monitoring the fate of those refugee applicants who have been forcefully deported. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At that same Estimates Committee hearing I asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What about Xing Jian Dong?</PARA>
<PARA>As the Senate knows, Xing was a Chinese student, and he also was forcibly deported on 14 August. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have in my hand a published copy of a letter in the handwriting of Xing Jian Dong which shows the reverse, what has happened to him. I knew that on his return he was put in the slammer for nine days. The Department, after my questioning of it, stated that that had occurred. The Department went on to say that he had gone home, and Mr Irvine stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He is at liberty at home, I am advised.</PARA>
<PARA>I asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At liberty at home. So is he under house arrest?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Irvine said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I do not believe so, but we will find out.</PARA>
<PARA>Estimates Committee B has received a response from the Department. The response was included in documentation tabled by the Chairman of the Committee. That response is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In discussions with our Consulate-General in Shanghai, Mr Xing said that he had been held at Guangzhou airport for nine days on his return to China while Chinese authorities investigated the circumstances surrounding his deportation. Mr Xing said that he had had no contact with the Public Security Bureau or other authorities since his return to Shanghai and had not been placed under house arrest in Shanghai. Mr Xing further confirmed that neither he nor his wife had suffered persecution or harassment from authorities since his return to Shanghai.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not know whether the Consulate-General's office in Shanghai is naive, but I would have thought one would need to be very careful were one a Chinese citizen in Shanghai in talking to persons from foreign governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The letter that has been sent to friends of Mr Xing in Australia tells a quite different story. I have the letter here and I will read an English translation of that letter. It is addressed to `All Australian Chinese Students Organizations'. He expresses his heartfelt thanks for their efforts on his behalf. He says he mourns deeply for the two students who died in the process of protesting forced deportation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the chamber that those two students were amongst those who sought to come down from Sydney to protest here about the deportation. Few honourable senators would have known that two of them were killed on the way down in their desperate attempts to make members of parliament aware of the plight of refugee applicants and their frustration and concern about the fate of those who are going to be deported. Mr Xing expressed in the first paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I mourn deeply for the two students who died in the process of protesting forced deportation. If the dead have some relatives in Shanghai, please give me addresses and I'll pay a visit to show my concern and to comfort them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I'm writing to you today to inform you of my situation after I returned to China in an effort to get your concern and help.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As for human rights, I was detained illegally for nine days upon my arrival by Guangzhou customs police. (Please forgive me for not providing details here). Then my aging mother and wife arrived in Guangzhou from Shanghai, paid the so-called "boarding fees" and got me released. Before my release, my passport and my flight ticket were confiscated. We went back to Shanghai by train for two days and one night. As a result, we all fell ill. The most important thing is that all my identification papers are gone (attached is my temporary ID, but it is already no longer valid). I really dare not to go to the Shanghai Security Bureau fearing this may cause further trouble. So I stay at home all day, seldom going out.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. Mr Acting Deputy President, I remind you of what Mr Xing says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The most important thing is that all my identification papers are gone . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Everyone knows what occurs in China, in the PRC, when all one's documentation has gone. If one has not got any documentation, one cannot obtain a job; one cannot move around the country; and one's movements are restricted. Of course, I asked the wrong question of the Department. Mr Irvine said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He is at liberty at home . . .</PARA>
<PARA>I said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At liberty at home. So is he under house arrest?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Irvine said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I do not believe so . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is not prevaricating, but it is not telling me the story that I wanted. If the Department knew the story, that this man's documentation had been taken, it was misleading, in my view, to say to me, `No, he is not under house arrest'. Whilst, strictly, that is true, the Department should have known what occurs to a person in the PRC who has no documentation at all. It is worse than being under house arrest. I come back to what the Department said to me. The Department said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the last year or so and more recently, the Chinese Government has made a number of public statements to the effect that, if students who have stayed away in other countries were to return home, they would suffer no legal consequences.</PARA>
<PARA>What is being put in gaol for nine days on return if it is not a legal consequence? I remind honourable senators that he was detained illegally, because under Chinese law a person can only be detained for 24 hours. What about the confiscation of the legal documentation of this individual? That is a legal consequence and harsh treatment indeed. Where are those seven boat people? Are they still in prison? Why have we not monitored what is occurring to the people that this nation forcibly deports to the PRC?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Are we going to accept at face value the PRC's statements&mdash;the statements from a government which started off by saying that nothing happened in Tiananmen Square? Are we going to continue to accept its assurances? This is a matter of great concern to a large number of people, particularly to the Chinese refugee applicants and those that have been given refugee status in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The day after the deportation of those seven refugee applicants a number of Chinese nationals who are members of the Chinese refugee self-rescue action group came down to Parliament to demonstrate peacefully. They are still outside making a peaceful demonstration and very few of us know about it. They have been outside on hunger strike since 24 October. I did not know about it; I only found out last night when I was walking along and I bumped into a group of Chinese and a well-known person in Canberra whom I know. It was only then that I was told the story. I went to their tent in the rain. It has been very cold there. These people are suffering, they are on hunger strike and they are expressing themselves in the interests of humanity and solidarity with their fellow human beings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that we have a great responsibility. This document was translated by Professor Han Shang Xiao, as will be seen when it is incorporated into <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. Professor Han has had a refugee application in for over two years and it still has not been processed. He is not the only one. What are people supposed to do&mdash;put their lives on hold for four, five or six years? That is inhumane. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More inhumane is the fact that we are sending people back to the PRC. We are forcibly deporting them without knowing their fate. Here are two examples. We know for sure in one case that the person has suffered harsh treatment. In the other case, I am reliably informed that the person was imprisoned upon return to China. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Acting Deputy President, you know how difficult it would be for Chinese refugee applicants to prove a well-founded fear of persecution. Where do they get their witnesses? But they certainly have a well-founded fear. I believe that any civilised country that is committed to the protection of individuals' human rights has a responsibility to make absolutely sure that the rights of these refugee applicants are preserved and that they are not subjected to harsh treatment if their applications do not succeed. </PARA>

My appeal to the Minister, to the Government and to us all, including myself&mdash;I did not know that they were there until last night&mdash;is to bear in mind that they are human beings. Though they do not know how to go about protesting, we ought at least to have regard to their plight and the plight of those for whom they are making such sacrifices. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak about the questionary which was circulated to the various political parties by the conservation groups prior to the 1990 election with respect to the environment and the sorts of promises and offers which were made by the various parties to organisations such as the Australian Conservation Foundation. This questionary was comprehensive in its coverage of environmental issues. Questions ranged from concerns over green issues such as biological diversity, national parks and wilderness areas, Antarctica, World Heritage and forestry to the so-called brown issues such as environment protection, the greenhouse effect and ozone depletion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of the 93 questions asked, 104 responses were received, as some questions had several parts. The ALP answered yes to 76 of those questions, or almost three-quarters of the survey. Further, the ALP gave a qualified yes to 17 questions, or 16 per cent of the survey. Eleven responses were listed as undecided. The ALP avoided answering no to any of the questions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looking back over this Government's term of office, it is obvious that the ALP deliberately bought the green vote at the last election, that it clearly had no intention of carrying out its promises and that the Australian public has been duped by such a cynical exercise. The ALP has fulfilled only 26 of its promises, or 25 per cent of the responses. The Government has defended its position on Antarctica and World Heritage areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that the Government has kept its word on the protection of Antarctica and on World Heritage nominations such as Kakadu, Fraser Island and Shark Bay; yet on the protection of World Heritage areas the Government has failed to act appropriately. When the Government was provided with information that past and present quarrying operations had indisputably damaged part of the Exit Cave karst system in the Tasmanian wilderness World Heritage area, the Government allowed quarrying operations to continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's record shows a sorry tale of broken promises. Nowhere is this more transparent at the moment than on the issue of threatened species protection. The ALP promised to promote the case for the Commonwealth to be given increased powers to make laws with respect to the protection of a species of flora or fauna from extinction. Indeed, the Government promised to use all the powers available to it under the Constitution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has failed miserably in this regard. The final draft of the Government's endangered species legislation is a pale shadow of the sort of legislation which is required to truly protect Australia's threatened species&mdash;the sort of legislation put forward in my private member's Bill, which was voted against during the last sitting fortnight by the Government and the coalition and which, if accepted, would have fulfilled the promise made by the Government at the time of the last election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many other matters on which the Government has failed to live up to its list of cynical promises. It has failed to make any advances to curb greenhouse gases&mdash;indeed, it has walked way from the original Toronto target of a 20 per cent reduction of greenhouse gases by the year 2005&mdash;even though an unprecedented consensus was achieved last year on this matter among the ESD working groups on measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Its commitment to the Toronto target was never anything more than a sop designed for domestic consumption and a hollow promise to appease environment groups. No action has been taken to significantly improve energy efficiencies and to substantially increase funding to renewable energies, even though technically Australia could rely in 30 years time on renewables to meet two-thirds of its energy demands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia used to take a strong leadership role in international negotiations on ozone depletion. We have now slipped behind and are likely to only endorse the UNEP policy position at the forthcoming review of the Montreal Protocol in November. Mr Acting Deputy President, I seek leave to table the document entitled `Environment: How the ALP failed'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On constitutional issues, the ALP promised to assume increased powers in relation to land, air and water quality standards and to use the trading corporations power to regulate companies that harm the environment. In practice, the Government has shunned a leadership role, even though the Australian people want the Commonwealth to assume such a role on environmental matters, as indicated in the recent ANOP survey of people's attitudes to the environment. Incidentally, that survey cost the Australian taxpayer a quarter of a million dollars through the Department of the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories (Mrs Kelly). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has also developed the so-called new federalism which constrains the Commonwealth from taking action until all the States have been consulted and at least two-thirds of the States have agreed. This is clearly an action which ensures that the lowest common denominator is achieved with respect to the environment. Australia needs strong and decisive Commonwealth government action to take the necessary steps to protect and conserve species and ecological systems&mdash;not a government prepared to engage in endless consultations while Rome burns with little or nothing to show for it at the end of the day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are now told that Mr Keating is due to release an environment statement around mid-December. No doubt this will contain another round of cynical promises to buy green votes, but this time I am sure that the Australian people will not be fooled. They know that there is only one national party with strong green credentials in Australia today and that is, of course, the Australian Democrats. I hope that this performance assessment will help to expose the green dishonesty engaged in by this present Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to comment on an answer given by Senator Cook today in the Senate to a dorothy dixer from one of his colleagues. In that answer Senator Cook made remarks about the coalition's Jobsback policy, which is engineered to do nothing more than improve the unemployment position in this country and to do it in a way whereby people will get an increase in real wages coming with an increase in productivity&mdash;</PARA></TALK.START>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator McMullan" NAMEID="5I4">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Ha, ha!</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KI4">Senator PARER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator McMullan laughs over there. He has had an accord that goes back some years. As a result of that accord, we have had a reduction in real wages and record unemployment. It is reprehensible that Australia, with the inherent wealth and unlimited opportunity that it has, should have so many people unemployed. That is the background of what Jobsback is about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, in his response, Senator Cook pointed out that under the Jobsback policy a person who went on a workplace agreement would receive the lowest level as spelt out in the award. There are none so blind or stupid as those who will not see. Senator Cook has slowly recognised what we are all about. Initially, he was saying that there was no bottom; that people would be attacked by unscrupulous employers. At least he has now got to the stage&mdash;although he is wrong&mdash;of saying that it will be the lowest level of the award. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me point out what the Jobsback policy is all about. It is a transition process. It throws out an inflexible system of industrial relations that over the years has caused massive unemployment. The problem in Australia&mdash;and I point this out very clearly&mdash;is not one of wage rates, per se; it is one of lack of productivity. If one looks at the wage rate in Australia today, one sees that it is approximately half the average wage rate of Japan. Japan has a highly productive work force, one which relates to its own place of employment. There is a recognition that the health, virility and success of those who work in a company depend on the success of that company and that, if there is a falling away of productivity in that company, the workers' own jobs could be at risk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the coalition's Jobsback policy, there will be a transition process and three groups of employees will emerge. Firstly, there will be those who, along with their employers, choose to remain within the award system&mdash;and they will be permitted to do that. Just as an aside, I can think of&mdash;but I had better not name them&mdash;those who will not move out of the system because they have an intransigent closed shop system. Secondly, there will be those who will agree with their employer to enter workplace agreements; and, thirdly, there will be those whose award entitlements will be converted to workplace agreements. This is not an attack on the trade union movement, although the trade union movement will be thrown into the same competitive field as everyone else in a world society that has become ultra-competitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I heard Senator Childs make a remark here the other day about the sorts of union operations in which he was involved 30 years ago, and his remark was quite correct. In those days there was no compulsory unionism, per se, if my recollection is correct. There were some closed shops, but very few, and unions did not have the power that that they have today&mdash;and I mean raw power and control over their own workers. Workers themselves today have very little power; in fact, they do not count for anything. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Going back to those three stages, the first one is simple: employees remain within the award system and retain their status quo. The second one is where employees voluntarily entering into workplace agreements are protected by the statutory minima as spelt out in the Jobsback program. These are minimum wage, annual leave, sick leave and maternity leave. In addition, they are guaranteed public holidays&mdash;and I point this out because, again, in answer to a question by one of his other colleagues, Senator Cook said that public holidays would go. Dealing with this issue, the Jobsback package indicates that:</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KI4">Senator PARER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, and it is up to them whether or not they work. I point out that in most cases the minima will be irrelevant&mdash;and this is something that honourable senators must bear in mind&mdash;since employees would not consent to enter into a workplace agreement which did not improve their existing wages and conditions. Senator McMullan shakes his head. Let me give him two very good examples of this in my own State of Queensland.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before the Labor Party was elected in Queensland, there were two organisations that entered into workplace agreements. The example I cite was a greenfields project, and it is a lot easier to do these things when one starts a greenfields project. One of the organisations was Power Brewing Co. Ltd. Workers had flexible working hours and they got rid of all the ridiculous work practices that applied at other breweries. I can give Senator McMullan one ridiculous work practice that I remember very well. If a truck pulled up at one of the other breweries to load beer and the truck driver needed a hand, if anyone who worked in that brewery put his or her hand on the truck, everyone was out the gate. If one went down to Power Brewing, one would find that, if the truck driver needed a hand, they would give him a hand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Employees were able to work flexible hours. Most of these employees had young families&mdash;and bear in mind the location of the Power Brewery; it is about halfway between Brisbane and the Gold Coast&mdash;and they lived somewhere within the environs of the Gold Coast. It suited them to start work early in the morning, get home when the children came home from school and take them to the beach, go fishing or do any other recreation that they wanted to do. The fascinating thing about the Powers Brewing case is that, while employees did not work any additional hours compared with the other breweries, they made something in the order of $10,000 a year more. That is a factual figure that can be checked if anyone wishes to check it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is worth going back a little and explaining how that agreement was put in place. There was no intent in the first place to have a workplace agreement. As a greenfields project, discussions were held not just with the workers on the site but with the actual union delegates on the site. An agreement was reached that suited them all very well. Things became unstuck when they were told by the Trades and Labour Council to go off to the appropriate union&mdash;I suppose it was the liquor trades; I am not sure which one it was&mdash;and get it approved. The people who did not work in the brewery&mdash;the third party group from the trade union movement&mdash;turned up on site. When it was suggested by the management that the delegates participate in the discussions, the union leaders from head office in Brisbane indicated that they would not engage in discussions with management in the presence of the union delegates. Out of that was spun the workplace agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The union delegates were advised that they were not welcome and that they had no role to play, and were thrown out. Of course, the delegates said, `Well, we don't need you either'. In the short interim phase before the Labor Party was elected in Queensland they were able to enter into a workplace agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much the same thing happened with Metway. Metway was able to gear its working hours to fit the customers and also to fit its own employees. I know that this is very strange for people in the Labor Party because they are used to entrenched power within the hierarchy of the union movement. No matter where one looks, one finds that anything that is agreed to at the workplace must get the blessing of the leaders of the union, who in fact do not work at the organisation at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other day I gave the example of Gazal enterprises on the Gold Coast. I will not go into detail on that again except to say that here again an agreement was reached between the owner of the enterprise, a Mr Gazal, and some 125 of his employees. Those employees could not realise the significance of their own importance. Ms Anna Booth from Melbourne turned up and told the employees of this little enterprise on the Gold Coast, `You cannot do this'. Many of us saw on the television screen the pitiful example of the employees of Gazal saying to Ms Booth, `Please go back to Melbourne. Leave us alone. All we want to do is go back to work'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without the flexibility that was agreed to by both the employer and the employees&mdash;incidentally, I understand that there was a great relationship between the two parties&mdash;the option was that Gazal enterprises would shut down and instead of producing textiles or whatever it would import. That is an indication of the sort of thing that we have seen go on in this country, not just over the past 10 years but over the past 10 to 20 years. I am not singling out a certain period. I am referring to an historical arrangement that has caused us in Australia to move away from the very thing that we all want&mdash;that is, value adding and producing goods that people want to buy rather than importing them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minimum wage is the minimum hourly rate applicable to an employee according to the relevant award classification. It is a series of minima. It is not what Senator Cook said&mdash;and he should know better. As I indicated earlier, I presume that Senator Cook does not want to see this happen. It is a case of none so blind as those who will not see. His whole background is such that, no matter what he might believe in his own heart, he must support the very organisation that he has been in all his life&mdash;that monolith, the trade union movement. He has an obligation to continue to support it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I could not help but notice, even in the remarks made tonight by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), that when a coalition government is elected in Australia the Labor Party will not oppose in the Senate the goods and services tax but will oppose the Jobsback program.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Coming, as I do, from north Queensland, I have a commitment to the people of that area and particularly to the people of north-west Queensland who currently are being fairly poorly represented by the honourable member for Kennedy, Mr Hulls. Because I have that commitment to the people of north-west Queensland, I want to correct some misrepresentations&mdash;I suppose that is the politest way of putting it&mdash;that Mr Hulls made tonight when speaking in the other chamber. I would not want the people of the north-west to be misled by anything that Mr Hulls might say&mdash;not that I think they would; I do not think too many people up there take too much notice of him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Hulls made a number of quite factually incorrect statements. First of all, he claimed that the Labor Party was the party of the bush and the party that rural Australia supports. That is just factually incorrect. If he looks at the figures he will see that the Liberal Party holds 24 rural and regional seats; the Labor Party 18 rural and regional seats; and the National Party 14. So the coalition between them hold something like 38 rural and regional seats compared with 18 held by the ALP. So it is just quite ridiculous to suggest that the ALP is the party of the bush. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Hulls made these remarks when he was speaking about the zone rebate during a debate on tax legislation. He did not mention in his contribution that for seven years under his Government, between 1985 and 1992, the zone rebate fell in real terms. That is the commitment of the ALP to the people of north-west Queensland. Each year the people of the remote parts of Australia look to see what the Labor Party is going to do; they look to see whether it is going to increase the zone rebate to a level that will at least keep it in line with inflation. But each year they have been forgotten. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was not so long ago that the former Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, backed away from increasing the zone rebate. He did so while he was in Charters Towers, which is in the electorate of the honourable member for Kennedy. I am glad that Senator McMullan is in the chamber because in June 1991 Senator McMullan, as Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, visited Mr Hulls's electorate and again ruled out any increase in the zone allowance. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">North West Star</EMPHASIS> of 12 June 1991 reported:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Neither a revision of the Sales Tax on freight nor an increase in the Zone Rebate are on the Federal Government agenda, according to Senator McMullan, Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was only after Fightback was released in November 1991 and a commitment was given for an increase in the zone rebate of at least 25 per cent that the ALP suddenly realised that it had not done anything for too long. In other words, it had continued deliberately to ignore the situation. It was a classic case of `me too' type politics. So it is quite ridiculous for the honourable member for Kennedy to take credit for the zone rebate decision of his Party; he should be thanking the Liberal and National parties for raising the issue and for making a commitment in Fightback. It was only when that commitment was made that the Government chose to follow along, as it has done with so many of the things in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS>, to try to catch up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Mr Hulls were interested in the people of north-west Queensland, he would be getting the Labor Party to have a look at and do something about the iniquitous fringe benefits tax on the basic necessities for workers in north-west Queensland. The fringe benefits tax means something to the fat cats in Melbourne or Sydney, I imagine, but to the workers of north-west Queensland it is a very iniquitous tax on the basic necessities. If Mr Hulls had some interest in those constituents, he would get his Government to have a look at it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Hulls did go on to say that the one thing his constituents did not want was a GST. He is quite wrong about that because the average family under the GST regime would be $30 to $40 a week better off, even after they have paid the GST. For that reason, all people in Australia would be quite silly if they did not support that scheme because, even after paying the GST, the average family is going to have $30 to $40 more in their pockets as a result of Fightback than at  present. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What Mr Hulls should have said was not that his constituents did not want the GST, but that they really did not want another three years under Mr Keating. He forgot to mention that even he was telling the media in north Queensland last year that he would find it impossible to sell Mr Keating in the bush. As I think Mr Hulls said, `You could not give him away'. He told the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">North West Star</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would have some difficulty selling Mr Keating and I've told him that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Hulls went on to try to illustrate the impact of a GST on people buying a loaf of bread in Burketown. Typical of the Labor scare campaign, he simply added 15 per cent on top of all existing prices; so he picked the price of bread in Burketown and added 15 per cent to that. He knows that is wrong and Senator McMullan knows that is wrong, but they continue to peddle that misinformation knowing that that is not right. When one removes seven existing taxes that impact upon that loaf of bread in Burketown, one goes right back to when the seed was first planted for the wheat that makes that bread. When one adds payroll tax, sales tax, petrol tax and training guarantee levies, one realises what an enormous impact there already is on that loaf of bread in Burketown from the taxes that this Government continues to put in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Hulls did not mention that under a coalition government seven taxes will be removed from that loaf of bread. Of course, that will make most things less expensive than they are now. Even with the addition of a GST, the average increase in cost of living for all Australians will be about 4 per cent. They are not my figures; we did some figures and arrived at 4.4 per cent. Senator McMullan and his Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) got the Treasury to check our figures. They came back and said, `You are wrong, it is not 4.4 per cent, it is only 3.6 per cent'. That is their figure, not ours. So whatever it is&mdash;3.6 or 4.4&mdash;it is about 4 per cent. But when one takes into account the compensations&mdash;the 30 per cent reduction in income tax, the 8 per cent increase in pensions, the doubling of family allowances, the fact that everyone will be able to fill up their car with fuel for about $10 to $12 less per tankful&mdash;one can understand how the average family will end up with $30 to $40 more in their pockets after Fightback than they currently do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Hulls is crying crocodile tears about the residents of Burketown because they pay 75c more now for a loaf of bread than people in Brisbane do. But has he ever wondered why they do that? It has a lot to do with the price of petrol and the cost of freight. But Mr Hulls did not bother to tell his constituents tonight that under the coalition petrol will be 26c a litre cheaper for trucks taking bread to Burketown. If he had told them that, they would have realised how people will be better off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further point to be made is that the graziers in north-west Queensland pay an enormous amount in fuel tax to get their cattle to the market. Figures have been prepared, which are pretty widely available now, which show that an average truckie would save at least $40,000 a year in operational costs, particularly up in those areas. The National Farmers Federation did a survey which showed that a grazier in the north-west of Queensland would have 22 per cent more disposable income in his pocket as a result of the Fightback package. These are all the people up in Mr Hulls's area who would benefit substantially from the Fightback package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that all the people in the Burketown area&mdash;or in any part of Mr Hulls's electorate&mdash;will pay some 30 per cent or a third less income tax will certainly mean they will be much better off. I do feel a little sorry for Mr Hulls. I quite like him; he is a likeable enough sort of person, particularly for a Melbourne lawyer. I feel sorry for him because he really is going to be the classic oncer. The Liberal Party candidate, Dave Cashmore, will win that seat from him and Mr Hulls will have to go back to law. Mr Hulls would be far better at law than demonstrating economic policy and the cost of living in his area. He either does not know the situation or deliberately misrepresents it. Although the hour is late, I thought it important to put those facts on the record, so that the people of north-west Queensland will have the true situation put before them when they wake up in the morning. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish tonight to make some comments on the question put by Senator Childs to Senator Cook in Question Time today and to refer to the Minister's answer. I do this because I am sick and tired of the misrepresentation which comes from those on the other side. Last night I corrected some comments made the day before by Senator Childs in the urgency debate, and I informed him that I intended to do so. Yet today he came in here and asked a question which clearly misrepresented the situation after the record had been put straight. I did inform him that I would be raising this matter tonight. Last night I said that Senator Childs had stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the difference between their classification rate and the lowest base rate in the award is significant. It would be financially devastating for them. This is not worker friendly; there is no way it can be. For example, the minimum award rate for a metal industry trades person would fall from $417.20 per week, including supplementary payments, to $284.80 per week with no supplementary payments.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what Senator Childs had to say. I then went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I want to make it quite clear that the minima, in fact, will be the classification rates. That is the position we had at the last election with our industrial relations policy. While there have been some changes in that policy, in this particular area there has been no change.</PARA>
<PARA>That is about as clear as one can state a policy position. I then went on to outline a significant amount of detail. Senator Parer has also outlined a significant amount of that detail tonight. I will not go over that again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the fact that last night I said I would give Senator Childs the benefit of the doubt that he misunderstood the policy and did not deliberately misrepresent it&mdash;I said that I did not give the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, or Mr Willis the same benefit of the doubt since they consistently misrepresented our policy positions&mdash;I have to withdraw my generosity of last night. I am sorry to have to do that, but Senator Childs had the opportunity to look at the situation and understand it. I do not believe that he is that thick up top that he could not understand what I said last night. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to refer to the question which Senator Childs asked today. I will not quote the whole question because it is on the record. Part of the question stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . John Howard, said that the minimum wage for workers on individual employment contracts under a coalition government would be based on their award classification rate?</PARA>
<PARA>This is as a result of an article that was in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>. He went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following this shift in policy by the Opposition, does the Government now intend to adopt a similar individual employment contract policy?</PARA>
<PARA>The first point I make is that there has been no shift. I made that quite clear last night. That is also borne out by an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Telegraph </EMPHASIS>on 25 October, five days after the release of our policy position, Jobsback, in Sydney. That position was spelt out and was clearly on the public record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a deliberate misrepresentation of our position. In fact, I would call it a misleading of the Senate because Senator Childs knew what the position was. It was perpetuated in the Minister's answer because the Minister knew as well. He would have been informed. It was a devious scheme to try to grab a little bit of television time to mislead the Australian population. It is because of the actions of people such as Senator Childs and Senator Cook that parliamentarians are held in such low regard. Eventually these things catch up with them. People find out that they have not been prepared to tell the truth. I quote part of Senator Cook's answer. Once again, I will not read the whole answer because it is on the record. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What the policy proposes is that, irrespective of the classification a worker or employee is on, they will go to the lowest rate in the award. That is what the policy says and that is why the Opposition is backtracking. That is why these points of order have been taken today to try to conceal that. It is clear in the policy and it is misrepresented in the press release.</PARA>
<PARA>The points I make about that are, first, that it is absolutely and totally wrong, as I pointed out in relation to the article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Telegraph </EMPHASIS>and, secondly, that we have not changed our position in that area of policy. There is no backtracking whatsoever. It is typical of the way this Minister answers questions. I can go through a whole litany of questions that I and other people have asked in this place relating to Robe River or the situation where we had to have three corrections to the payments made to the BLF in Western Australia. They are still not right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only do I find it very sad but also I think it quite disgraceful that this type of misrepresentation is deliberately put on the public record. Had one not raised this issue last night, one could say that maybe the Minister did not see the article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Telegraph</EMPHASIS>. He was aware of the fact that I had put the record straight last night. As I said in my opening comments, it is shameful for Senator Childs to ask a question like that when he knew the premise on which the question was being asked was wrong. He knew the record had been put straight last night. He was informed that the record would be put straight last night. That question was a deliberate set-up to mislead the Australian public who will be watching the television replay tonight. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Even though the hour is late, I feel obliged to respond to both the weightier contributions made early in the adjournment debate and the later ones. Senator Hill and Senator Harradine spoke at length about serious and sensitive matters to do with international relations. I indicate to both of them that it is not appropriate for me to start an off-the-cuff discourse on these two issues which they raised, but I will make sure that the issues which they raised are drawn to the attention of the respective departments and Ministers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Coulter set out to make a major speech about the Labor Party and the environment, but I think he made fairly clear that his real concern is that there might be some other green party emerging to undermine the position of his group. On this occasion, I do not think it was even his bete noir Senator Macdonald; I think it was Bob Brown lurking over his shoulder that was more relevant to the speech that was made.

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Fortunately, I will never have to worry about that. Senator Parer and Senator Crane made speeches trying to justify the unjustifiable. I do not intend to get into the debate; we have lots of opportunity for that. I simply make two points: first, the fundamental misunderstanding is that there is some belief that there is an equality of bargaining power between workers and their employers; secondly, the fundamental flaw is that a guarantee of an hourly rate is a guarantee of the wage. It means that every worker's income is guaranteed until they work an hour of overtime, an hour on the weekend, an hour of shift work or an hour, as Senator Parer made clear today, on a public holiday. Therefore, seven days a week, 52 weeks a year, shift workers would find themselves drastically disadvantaged by that proposal. As it is the right of a party to put it forward in a debate, it is our right to expose its shortcomings.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No. However, a comprehensive, independent survey of the health of employees of the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (or ANSTO; but, at the time, the Australian Atomic Energy Commission) was conducted by Professor D Ferguson of the School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine at the University of Sydney between 1974 and 1979. Many of these employees lived in the nearby communities. This survey revealed no adverse health consequences beyond those to be expected in any similar large industrial complex.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1991, the then Minister for Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, at the request of ANSTO, and in view of the time which had elapsed since the completion of the Ferguson report in 1979, raised with the Australian Ionising Radiation Advisory Council (AIRAC) the question of an epidemiological health survey of ANSTO staff and members of the public living near Lucas Heights. AIRAC responded to the Minister recently.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">AIRAC advised that on the basis of information provided by ANSTO and the NSW Radiation Advisory Council, they believed a survey was not warranted as the size of the population that would need to be included in an epidemiological study to produce statistically significant results is far greater than the population in the immediate vicinity of Lucas Heights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">AIRAC also advised that they are of the view that the reported doses are so low that they would need to be in error by several orders of magnitude to warrant any reconsideration as to whether any epidemiological study would be meaningful in detecting any enhanced incidence of serious illnesses as a result of the operations at the Lucas Heights Research Laboratories.</PARA>

These changes have been made to provide improved facilities to the user community. Two new mainframe computers have been installed, together with significant software upgrades, and there have been some periods of instability in the commercial applications as a result. Although the outages required for implementation of new hardware, systems and software are scheduled as far as possible in times which will cause least inconvenience to the commercial users, there have been occasions on which outages have occurred in peak times.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) According to information obtained from inquiries made by the Australian Embassy in Manila, Sisencio Gultano, a former union leader, was detained by the Philippine National Police on 5 July 1992 in Cagayan de Oro City in the Philippines. Mr Gultano was released without charges on 24 July 1992.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The Australian Embassy in Manila has made inquiries concerning the detention of Sisencio Gultano with the Philippine Department of Justice, the Philippine Commission on Human Rights, union organisations and the Philippine Alliance of Human Rights Advocates (PAHRA), a grouping of over one hundred human rights non-governmental organisations in the Philippines. According to PAHRA, on 7 July Mr Gultano told Task Force Detainees, a prominent human rights non-governmental organisation, that he did not require assistance. To date, Mr Gultano has not lodged any complaint concerning his detention with either the Department of Justice or the Commission on Human Rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) According to Philippine law the maximum period a person can be detained without a warrant is 36 hours. If a warrant is not issued in this period the arresting officer is liable under the penal code and the person detained has to be released immediately. The Australian Embassy in Manila has been instructed to inquire if a warrant was issued for Mr Gultano.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) While the Government has welcomed the significant gains made in the Philippines in the restoration of formal democratic institutions and freedoms following their prolonged suppression by the former Marcos Regime, the Government nevertheless has been concerned about persistent reports of human rights abuses perpetrated by the military, vigilante forces and left-wing insurgents. Accordingly, the Australian Government has maintained a regular dialogue with relevant Philippine authorities, raising individual cases as appropriate. It will continue to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to this dialogue, the Australian Government has pursued a strategy of encouraging the Philippine military and police to provide human rights training to their personnel. As part of this strategy, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade contributed $10,700 last year to fund a series of seminars equipping approximately 600 Philippine military and police trainers with the skills and the knowledge to teach human rights principles. The human rights seminars were the first time that the Philippine military had agreed to participate in such training. The seminars have drawn praise from representatives of the Ford Foundation and UNESCO in the Philippines. Moreover, there is evidence that the courses are genuinely appreciated and utilised by the Philippine military and police.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a follow-up to the training program, the Government allocated an additional $10,500 this year to the International Committee of the Red Cross to supply human rights texts to Philippine military and police schools, individual units and military and police trainers. These will serve as basic international humanitarian law texts for the schools. In the military and police units they will serve as a core library of human rights reference material. The four texts involved cover the essentials of the law of armed conflict, rules for behaviour in action, training programs in international humanitarian law and the basic rules of the Geneva Conventions and Hague Treaties as they relate to international standards of conduct and the protection of civilians in situations of armed conflict.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Government will continue to monitor closely the human rights situation in the Philippines, and will look to the Administration of President Fidel Ramos to sustain the gains made by the Aquino Administration in the area of human rights. We are encouraged in this regard to note that in the first months since his election President Ramos has pursued broad policies of national reconciliation.</PARA>

Due to the time that elapsed since closing date of tenders all suppliers of fixed height chairs which had been approved for ergonomic criteria by Worksafe Australia were invited to revalidate their offers.

Principals of companies were not subjected to checks. With the exception of Formway, (a New Zealand Company accepted for low volume middle management chairs) appropriate financial checks, including Dunn &amp; Bradstreet reports, were sought for all successful tenderers of adjustable chairs. The reports revealed a sound financial base for all successful tenderers. A financial check on Formway was not conducted because this New Zealand company was added to the panel later as a supplier of low volume middle management chairs. In view of the fact that the company has been established in New Zealand for many years, supplying high quality chairs, it was considered that the information provided with the tender response, together with inspections and discussions at the company's Sydney manufacturing facility, was sufficient for consideration. It was anticipated that only low volumes of middle management chairs would be purchased by the Commonwealth and hence any financial risk to the Commonwealth would be minimal.</PARA>
