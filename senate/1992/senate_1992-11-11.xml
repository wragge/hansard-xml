<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>As honourable senators would be aware, the Government is committed to the ratification of International Labour Organisation (ILO) Conventions which are suitable for Australian conditions. Ratification of appropriate ILO Conventions is desirable because:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">it supports and strengthens domestic policy and program initiatives;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">it confirms and maintains Australia's adherence to international labour standards, with consequent benefits for workers and employers;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">it lends credibility and authority to our international standing on labour, social and broader human relations matters;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">it underlines our support for the ILO; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">it promotes higher labour standards in the Asian and Pacific region. </PARA>
<PARA>So far the Australian Government has ratified 51 ILO Conventions. In May 1991 the Government established an Interdepartmental Task Force to review some 75 unratified Conventions with a view to determining their suitability for ratification and increasing the number of Conventions ratified by Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>The amendments set out in this Bill arise from that initiative. </PARA>
<PARA>As a general rule Australia does not ratify a Convention until law and practice in all relevant jurisdictions complies with the requirements of the Convention. The Bill proposes amendments to the Migration Act 1958 and the Navigation Act 1912 which will bring Australian law into conformity with a further two Conventions, No. 108, Seafarers' Identity Documents, 1958 and No. 73, Medical Examination (Seafarers) 1946. The proposed amendments will also enable further progress to be made towards achieving compliance with Convention No. 147, Merchant Shipping (Minimum Standards), 1976. </PARA>
<PARA>Peak employer and union bodies, through the National Labour Consultative Council, have endorsed the suitability of Convention Nos 73, 108 and 147 to Australian conditions and the desirability of their ratification. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Amendments to the Migration Act 1958</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>Amendments to the Migration Act are contained in Part 2 of the Bill and are designed to bring Australian law into compliance with the requirements of Convention No. 108, Seafarers' Identity Documents, 1958. </PARA>
<PARA>This Convention has been examined by the ILO Conventions Task Force, in conjunction with the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, and has been classified as a suitable Convention for ratification by Australia. The Convention is one that is solely within the competence of the Commonwealth Government and does not require any action by the States and Territories to achieve compliance with its provisions. </PARA>
<PARA>Convention No. 108 deals with the issue and recognition of seafarers' identity documents by the appropriate authority in each country. It also specifies that the documents shall remain in the seafarer's possession at all times.</PARA>
<PARA>The existing provisions of the Migration Act comply with the terms of the Convention in relation to the issue and recognition of seafarers' identity documents. However, the Act currently specifies that a seafarer's identity document is to be held by the master of the vessel or the officer in charge of a resources or sea installation. </PARA>
<PARA>The amendments to the Act are designed to bring Australian law into full compliance with the Convention by providing that a seafarer's identity document is to remain in his/her possession at all times. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Amendments to the Navigation Act 1912</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>Amendments to the Navigation Act 1912 are contained in Part 3 of the Bill. They are intended to facilitate the ratification of ILO Convention No. 73, Medical Examination (Seafarers), 1946 and to establish substantial equivalence with Article 5 of Convention No. 68, Food and Catering (Ships Crews), 1946. </PARA>
<PARA>Convention No. 73 applies to sea-going ships and provides that seafarers shall not be employed on a vessel to which the Convention applies unless each seafarer holds a certificate attesting to his/her fitness for the work at sea for which that person is employed. </PARA>
<PARA>Most sea-going ships in Australian waters are engaged in inter-state or overseas voyages. They thereby come within Commonwealth jurisdiction and are covered by the provisions of the Navigation Act. A small number of sea-going ships, however, fall within the jurisdiction of a State or Territory. </PARA>
<PARA>The proposed amendment, which has been developed in consultation with the States and the Northern Territory, will enable regulations and orders to be made under the Navigation Act to give effect to the Convention in respect of all sea-going ships in Australian waters. The Bill provides that such orders and regulations will not, however, apply to the extent that any existing or future law of a State or the Northern Territory gives effect to the Convention. </PARA>
<PARA>The second of the proposed amendments to the Navigation Act will amend sections 117 and 118 to enable Australia to establish substantial equivalence with Article 5 of Convention No. 68, Food and Catering (Ships Crews), 1946. This is required if Australia is to ratify Convention No. 147, Merchant Shipping (Minimum Standards), 1976. Convention No. 147 is the principal ILO Convention dealing with maritime labour matters. </PARA>
<PARA>Convention No. 147, amongst other things, provides that compliance or substantial equivalence must be established with the Conventions or Articles of Conventions specified in the Appendix to that Convention. Article 5 of Convention No. 68 is specified in that Appendix. </PARA>
<PARA>The proposed amendments will ensure that a ship is carrying water of suitable quantity and quality and also food of suitable quality, quantity, nutritive value and variety for the crew of a vessel. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">HEALTH INSURANCE (QUALITY ASSURANCE CONFIDENTIALITY) AMENDMENT BILL 1992</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is generally accepted that health care consumers can suffer adverse outcomes from health services. Some of these are known and accepted risks of procedures and treatments, even when these procedures and treatments are expertly performed. However, sometimes adverse patient outcomes are attributable to poor quality of patient care.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While little direct data on the incidence or causes of adverse patient outcomes are available in Australia, United States data suggest that approximately four per cent of all hospital admissions result in avoidable adverse outcomes not associated with the patient's original condition. Four per cent of all hospital admissions in Australia could translate into approximately 170,000 patients per year with avoidable adverse outcomes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Effective quality assurance is an important way of reducing the incidence of adverse patient outcomes. It is a positive approach to the reduction of adverse patient outcomes. It can be achieved by providing funds for initiatives and studies which identify problem areas, by encouraging activities to address such problems, and by providing appropriate legislative protection for quality assurance activities so that health professionals feel able to participate. The Government has provided some seminal funding for quality assurance activities in this year's Budget. This legislation seeks to provide the statutory protective framework for quality assurance activities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Quality Assurance Activities</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Quality assurance embraces a wide range of activities. These include: hospital based peer review processes, such as clinical audits into surgical mortality rates; academic studies into the incidence or causes of adverse patient outcomes; peer committees to counsel or assist other practitioners who are having difficulties which may lead to adverse patient outcomes; and the performance evaluation of individual health care professionals for the purpose of determining the clinical privileges of that professional.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is widespread support amongst medical practitioners and consumers for open, positive and voluntary participation in such activities to prevent adverse patient outcomes and raise the quality of health care delivery. In terms of outcome, quality assurance activities are the embodiment of the phrase prevention is better than cure".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the past these activities have been inhibited by the fear of health professionals that information generated by quality assurance activities may be used by patients in personal injury litigation. In addition, there is a fear held by health care professionals who participate in any peer review activities which can affect another practitioner's practising rights, that that colleague may sue the participants if they are dissatisfied with the outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A number of States and Territories have introduced legislation to address these concerns and this Bill is based on current legislation in New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory. However, the existing States and Territory legislation will not prevent actions under Commonwealth legislation or in courts exercising Federal jurisdiction to subpoena material created solely for the purpose of quality assurance activities. This Bill also provides protection for national projects and studies which are undertaken by the Medical Colleges or other professional associations across all or a number of States and Territories.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill will promote the undertaking of a range of quality assurance activities by providing statutory protection in the form of confidentiality of quality assurance information and immunity to quality assurance activities and committees which are declared by the Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government recognises that conferring confidentiality and immunity on the activities of a particular group of professionals has the capacity to affect individual rights and interests. For this reason, a number of checks and balances have been built into the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In summary, activities will only be declared under the Bill on the application of those carrying out the activity and after the Minister has satisfied himself or herself that among other things, it is in the public interest to provide the protection. The Minister's declaration will be by way of a disallowable instrument and so will be subject to Parliamentary scrutiny.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In circumstances where information gained by a quality assurance activity may relate to a serious criminal offence, the Minister may authorise the disclosure of the information for law enforcement, Royal Commissions or other prescribed purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further, before members of committees established for the purposes of evaluating the services provided by other health care professionals will be entitled to the protection of immunity from suit, their participation will have to have been in good faith. The Bill will not provide immunity in relation to proceedings for the breach of the laws of procedural fairness, thus providing balancing protection for affected health care professionals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Confidentiality</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The confidentiality provisions of this legislation will only make confidential, information which is created solely for the purposes of quality assurance activities. It will not make secret, information which is generated in the ordinary course of health care, such as hospital records. It will also permit disclosure of non-identifying and aggregated information&mdash;an important factor in promoting the educational and practical use of information obtained.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Disclosure of Information</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill prohibits the disclosure of information which has been created solely for the purpose of authorised quality assurance activities and studies, and which may identify individuals directly or indirectly, unless all those concerned consent to the disclosure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Statutory Immunity</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This legislation also provides statutory immunity to members of authorised committees carrying out quality assurance activities such as credentialling. This will hopefully encourage high quality health care professionals to participate in these activities without fear of suit. At the same time, it is important that the person whose conduct is being assessed is treated in accordance with the principles of procedural fairness throughout these quality assurance activities. These provisions again seek to balance these competing interests in a manner that is broadly acceptable to the community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A Complementary Approach</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A co-operative approach is integral to the success of quality assurance activities. This legislation embraces this concept by complementing the existing State and Territory laws.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This legislation is intended to encourage quality assurance activities and responsible activities such as credentialling in a very direct way. Many doctors have indicated to the Government their strong concern for improving the quality of health care and reducing the number of adverse patient outcomes. This Bill provides the protective framework to foster these activities for the benefit of the whole community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend this Bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I present the Explanatory Memorandum to this Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">MEDICARE AGREEMENTS BILL 1992</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am pleased to be able to move the introduction of an important piece of legislation that amends the Health Insurance Act 1973 and will build upon the foundations of the best health care system Australia has ever seen.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Medicare was established by this Government in 1984 and fulfils three major functions:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Medicare guarantees access to public hospital services provided by the States and Territories to all eligible Australians;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Medicare guarantees access to services provided by medical practitioners and optometrists;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme which is the third leg of Medicare provides access to essential pharmaceuticals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill is concerned with the first of these health care functions, that is, continued provision of public hospital and other public health services to Australian residents.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While a solid health care foundation has been laid this Government is not content to stand still. We want to ensure that there is some national policy consistency and momentum on important issues such as improving public patient access to hospital services and improving the planning, efficiency and delivery of public hospital services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The National Health Strategy has set the direction for reform and identified the challenges we have to face. We know that the projected population change will mean increased demand for health services into the next century and that technological change often brings more expensive medical interventions. The National Health Strategy has also identified the impressive efficiency gains our public hospital system has achieved over the last ten years and ways to improve those gains by developing better waiting list management, better hospital budgeting by identifying and comparing treatment costs and through improved integration of community and hospital care.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill is the vehicle for maintaining the impetus for hospital reform. It will establish the framework for the Commonwealth/State Medicare Agreements and provide a special appropriation to guarantee funding certainty to State and Territory Governments over the next five years. The money to be provided under the Agreements will fund hospital reform initiatives across Australia in co-operation with the States and Territories.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill and through it, the Medicare Agreements, offer scope to make public hospital services stronger, to tie in assured funding for five years and provide incentive money to kick start reform pilots in all aspects of hospital planning, management and service delivery.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth has two objectives for the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, we intend to provide a funding guarantee to the States and Territories for the five year life of the Medicare Agreement from 1 July 1993 to 30 June 1998.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Second, our objective is to enshrine the Medicare Principles and associated Commitments in Commonwealth legislation. The Principles and Commitments have been developed in consultation with the States and the wording reflects State suggestions. While the Principles focus on the provision of public hospital services to eligible persons, it is acknowledged that they operate in an environment where eligible people have the right to choose private health care in public and private hospitals supported by private health insurance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nonetheless, the Principles are centred on public hospital provision for public patients, since their purpose is to articulate the reasons for Commonwealth funding of State hospital services. The Principles are:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Principle 1: Eligible persons must be given the choice to receive public hospital services free of charge as public patients.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Principle 2: Access to public hospital services is to be on the basis of clinical need.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Principle 3: To the maximum practicable extent, a State will ensure the provision of public hospital services equitably to all eligible persons, regardless of their geographical location.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Principles articulate the concepts of choice, equity and access in public hospital service delivery. They give expression to the security that every Australian resident is looking for in their public hospital system and the reason that our health system is so much better than other nations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also outlines the broad conditions for funding that will apply in the Medicare Agreements. The most fundamental of these is that receipt of funds is conditional upon signature of the Medicare Agreements. These conditions include taking steps towards passage of State and Territory legislation that is complementary to the Commonwealth Bill and which enshrine the Medicare Principles and Commitments. Under the Medicare Agreement both levels of government will undertake to implement the Principles and Commitments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth does not expect the States to implement the Principles and Commitments alone, but to recognise that both levels of government have an interest and duty to maintain our public hospital services and to ensure that public patients get the most comprehensive and fairest health service possible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part of this provision involves the delivery of information to eligible public patients. This is reflected in Commitment One which requires the joint Commonwealth and State development of a Public Patients' Hospital Charter. The Commonwealth's vision for such a charter is that it will be a `plain English' guide to what Australian residents can reasonably expect as a public hospital patient.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth does recognise that immediate passage of complementary State and Territory legislation may not be possible in some States, despite the best endeavours of governments. It is for this reason that the Bill allows some scope for definition in the Agreements of what constitutes reasonable efforts towards adoption of the Principles and Commitments in legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Commitment Two encompasses efficiency and quality in public hospital service delivery. This is one of the priorities of the Bill and Medicare Agreements and will be supported by the incentive package reforms. These reforms include continuing the development and implementation of Casemix systems in hospital service delivery, ensuring elective surgery for public patients is organised efficiently and fairly, and investigating with the States and Territories better ways of developing capital strategic plans for hospitals and providing hospital services that meet local area needs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will not achieve this level of reform without the States and Territories. Improvement in our public hospital services involves Commonwealth and State and Territory commitment of effort and money. The Commonwealth is providing a funding increase of approximately seven percent over the base hospital funding grants to make our public hospital services more efficient and effective. This legislation will demonstrate to the Australian public that both levels of government are committed to excellence in health care.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the same time, we recognise that circumstances differ in each State, and in the bilateral negotiations taking place, the outcome of which will be reflected in the Agreements, we are responding positively to the particular circumstances of each State, within the overall framework of the Principles and Commitments. The Bill provides for this flexibility. It allows for flexibility and consultation on the Agreement and it allows for consultation with the States and Territories on the timetable for implementing components of the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the Bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">NATURAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT (FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE) BILL 1992</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am pleased to be able to speak in support of this legislation. The Bill before the Senate will provide a statutory basis to enhance the arrangements for Commonwealth involvement in activities and programs related to natural resources management. The primary objective of this Bill is to encourage the efficient, sustainable and equitable management of the nation's natural resources.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will bring within the one piece of legislation the authority for the Commonwealth to develop integrated approaches to land, water and associated vegetation management issues with community groups, the States and Territories and other organisations. In effect, this legislation captures, in many respects, the `putting into practice' of some central aspects of ecologically sustainable development.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislation is the means by which the Commonwealth will continue to provide funding for Australia's Landcare groups. The impressive growth of the Landcare movement, with the active support of both farm and conservation groups, is evidence of the increasing acceptance by members of local communities of their role in helping to overcome land degradation and to develop and adopt more sustainable resource management practices. Landcare groups now number over 1300, a dramatic rise from the 76 such groups in 1985. Estimated membership is now over 39,000 or about 30% of Australia's farm population. In recent years a growing proportion of Commonwealth funding has gone to support Landcare groups because we have recognised that community-based action by resource users is an increasingly important and effective means of dealing with land degradation problems.Since taking up the portfolio, the Minister has met many enthusiastic landcare group members from around Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Last year when concerns were put to the Minister about the diversity and complexity of government programs, and their lack of integration, he decided to merge the Government's land, water and related vegetation programs administered by his Department. The Minister was concerned that individual programs did not recognise sufficiently the linkages between these resources and between the industries and communities that use and depend on them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accordingly the Minister circulated in April of this year a Discussion Paper outlining his proposals for the future direction of natural resource management programs and foreshadowing this legislation. This paper was circulated widely among key stakeholder groups and the comments received indicated wide support for a more integrated approach to natural  resource management. The integration of these programs within a sustainable natural resources management package provides another element to the National Landcare Program that the Minister established earlier this year with the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories to improve access and assessment arrangements and bring a more integrated approach to land, water and vegetation management programs administered by their portfolios.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, the Minister recently obtained the agreement of his State colleagues to amalgamate three Ministerial Councils, for Agriculture, Water Resources and Soil Conservation, to bring a more integrated focus to our consideration of policy issues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Government has demonstrated a major, long-term commitment to improvement in the management of the nation's natural resources. For example it has committed $320 million to landcare and related tree planting and remnant vegetation conservation during the Decade of Landcare. In this year's Budget the Minister obtained $77 million for landcare and related sustainable natural resource management activities including the Federal Water Resources Assistance Program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This legislation will repeal two Acts under which financial assistance for soil conservation and water resource programs has been provided&mdash;the Soil Conservation (Financial Assistance) Act 1985 and the National Water Resources (Financial Assistance) Act 1978. The programs that were conducted under these Acts have made a significant contribution to the national soil conservation effort and improvement in the management of Australia's water resources.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In particular, the National Soil Conservation Program introduced by this Government in 1983 has been crucial to the successful growth of the Landcare movement and the bringing together of production and conservation interests to achieve more sustainable land use. Through the Federal Water Resources Assistance Program, we have shifted the emphasis from resource development towards resource management, focussing on issues such as more efficient use of water resources, comprehensive floodplain management and improved water quality.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill will establish the authority for the Commonwealth to enter into agreements with the States and Territories and members of the community to pursue activities that can address the major issues such as land degradation and water quality that action under these Acts and programs sought to independently address.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This legislation will allow programs to be developed more in accordance with the principles of ecologically sustainable development. These have been enunciated by the Government, reported on by the Ecologically Sustainable Development (ESD) Working Groups and further publicised in the draft ESD National Strategy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Agreements under the Bill between the Commonwealth and the States and Territories are to be developed as Partnership Agreements. These will constitute a formal expression of Commonwealth/ State/Territory agreements on a shared list of priority strategic outcomes and on the package of complementary initiatives to achieve them. The Agreements will include details of the manner in which assistance will be provided for community landcare projects in each State or Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As well as establishing the objectives and intended outcomes of natural resource management strategies the agreements will set out the conditions of financial assistance and establish the respective contributions by the partners. These contributions may include commitments to joint funding of activities, contributions in kind and may extend to commitments to policy reform in areas such as institutional arrangements and resource pricing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Partnership Agreements will also establish monitoring, evaluation and review arrangements for agreed strategies. This is a significant aspect of the Partnership Agreement approach. It ensures strategies and programs of activities are assessed in terms of their effectiveness and against their strategic objectives. It also provides information on which future strategies and activities can be modelled.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is intended that agreements negotiated under this legislation would commence in the 1993-94 financial year with the level of assistance determined in the Budget process for that year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will also authorise agreements with other persons, bodies, authorities, institutions and organisations that would not be parties to Partnership Agreements with States but who have the capacity to develop and implement programs and projects to achieve natural resource management objectives. Organisations in this category could include research institutes, the CSIRO and other Commonwealth research bodies and major non government organisations undertaking projects of national significance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Payments for activities conducted by these agencies are to be made from a Natural Resources Management Fund which will replace the National Soil Conservation Program Fund established under the Soil Conservation (Financial Assistance) Act 1985. This will give the flexibility required to fund activities that for a variety of reasons, including financial or seasonal, do not coincide with the Commonwealth's Budget cycle.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill establishes the basic conditions of financial assistance and the means by which the Commonwealth can ensure that financial assistance is used efficiently and for the intended purposes. Further details of financial assistance and how it is to be provided will be contained in agreements and include details of financial and project reporting and acquittal of advances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will allow for the establishment of the National Landcare Advisory Committee to provide advice on national issues, strategic directions and policy priorities to be addressed in the National Landcare Program and provide the means through which community views on landcare related issues can be provided to Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Membership of the Committee will be comprised of community and government representatives. It is the intention of both the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories and the Minister, as Ministers responsible for administration of the various components of the National Landcare Program, that non-government representatives including the Chairperson, will form the majority of the Committee's membership. This reflects the growing importance of community-based action for the successful implementation of many natural resource management and nature conservation programs and initiatives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This arrangement is consistent with the general balance of representation on the State and Territory committees that have been assembled throughout Australia to provide initial assessment of projects for National Landcare Program assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The intention is for the National Landcare Advisory Committee to be chaired by an independent person with standing in natural resources management or a related field. Other members of the Committee will be drawn from groups involved in or affected by natural resources management and will include representatives and individuals from the farming community, conservation organisations, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and other community-based representatives with experience in or knowledge of natural resources management and representatives from the three spheres of government. Because of the interest of my colleague the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories, Mrs Kelly, in the activities of the National Landcare Advisory Committee, the Minister will consult with her on matters concerning the operation of the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The transitional provisions in the legislation are to ensure that reporting and auditing obligations to the Commonwealth for projects, entered into under agreements within the legislation to be repealed, are observed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This legislation underlines the Government's continuing commitment to achieving better outcomes from the use of the nation's water, soil and related vegetation resources. It is a demonstration of the Government's commitment to the goals of ecologically sustainable development in trying to better integrate decision making and policies affecting not only Australia's agricultural sector but the natural resources related to that sector.</PARA>

I said to him directly and immediately, `For God's sake, this is just off-the-record banter. Under no circumstances should this be reported'. And he did that in a complete breach of faith.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation, very simply, was this: I was most unhappy to hear from one of the Governor's staff members while I was waiting to go into the interview that a puppy belonging to the Governor's family had been lost the night before. A great deal of scouring of the neighbourhood had gone on to find it. The first thing I expressed to the Governor when I went in there, in a spirit of sympathetic solidarity&mdash;because I know very well what the impact of such a loss would be on my own family&mdash;was condolences about it. I did so again at the end of the meeting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was as far as my exchange with the Governor went. It is totally absurd to say that he was preoccupied with that to the extent of conducting the affairs of state or that this in any way dominated the conversation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that whatever Senator Evans says in China or Hong Kong, on the record or off the record, reflects upon Australians generally. It reflects upon us. It is not the first time that he has embarrassed Australia in this way. He embarrassed us in South Africa when he abused the officials who were provided for his own security. He embarrassed us when he attacked the Indian High Commissioner in Melbourne because that man happened to have a different view to his in a particular instance. He has embarrassed us in this chamber when he has sworn across the chamber in a way that no other senator has ever done. He clearly has a failing in this area. It would be one thing having a failing if it did not reflect upon Australia, but in the position of Foreign Minister it does reflect upon Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Instead of coming in here and seeking to blame the journalist, he should be apologising to China for seeking to make fun of the paramount leader of China because he wishes to amuse some journalist in Hong Kong with a tale or two. That is apparently what it was all about. There is no suggestion that he was wishing to deliberately insult China. He was seeking to be funny for the benefit of some journalist; to impress these journalists with his level of humour. But the effect of it has been&mdash;that is what is important&mdash;to embarrass our country. As I said, he cannot use the excuse that it was off the record. The Foreign Minister of Australia, when dealing with the international press, simply does not make fun of the head of state of another country. I find it amazing that he is not even prepared to come in here and advise us that he has apologised to China for any embarrassment thereby caused. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a classic case, again, of double standards. A week or two ago the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) made a slip in relation to Mr Carr, for which he immediately apologised. In the view of the Labor Party that was a hanging offence. Do honourable senators remember what Mr Keating said? He said it demonstrated that Dr Hewson was not suited for government because he had slipped up in making a statement to which Mr Carr took offence. That is one standard. But when the Foreign Minister of this country, Senator Evans, goes to Hong Kong and ridicules the paramount leader of China in discussion with journalists, that is nothing. That is just a joke and it is irresponsible for the journalist to have reported it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think that the matter should rest at this stage. I think Senator Evans should go from this chamber and register an apology to China for the embarrassment he has caused Australia. At the very least, he should try to desist from this in the future but, looking at his record in this area, that is very unlikely to occur. I invite the Minister to indicate to the chamber now that he is prepared to apologise to China for any embarrassment caused by his flippant and very unwise comments in Hong Kong. </PARA>

<PARA>I am saying that it is Marxist ideology and Marxist theology that there will be this relationship and the Chinese leadership ought to recognise that.

That incident prevented us, as a delegation of Australian students, from meeting with Chou En-lai, the then Premier.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What people seem to fail to appreciate&mdash;and it is a demonstration of the sorts of cultural gaps that exist here&mdash;is that while it is a terrible insult in China to call someone a dog or to associate in some way an individual with a dog, which is part of the problem that existed in that incident years ago to which Senator Teague referred, it just happens to be the case by contrast that to say that someone eats dog is very likely to be regarded, particularly in Canton and Sichuan, as a compliment on that person's gourmet tastes. Dog happens to be a very sophisticated and highly regarded item of Chinese cuisine, whatever we might think about that. While it might be a terrible thing to say in the Australian context that someone eats dog, in itself it just does not have that kind of connotation. </PARA>

The trade union movement seems to have so much money to spend on strikes and attacking the Liberal Party, yet we seem to need to use taxpayers' funds to support these types of specific activities which are of interest to the Australian trade union movement, but not of great interest to the Australian taxpayer. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government has directly given only a very limited amount to the ANC. It was $80,000 in total. That was the subject of a lot of discussion 18 months or so ago. The particular context was clearly described at the time. It was to strengthen the economic department of the ANC to create within it a physical capacity to do the kind of economic planning that we all regard as a crucial element in the future of that country, acknowledging the role that, whichever way one looks at it, however much one might like it or not, the ANC is going to play in it. That was the sum of money then and it was the year before last that that money was given.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The money that has gone through APHEDA has never, in my knowledge&mdash;I can certainly confirm this absolutely&mdash;been given directly to the ANC for any purpose.

I will certainly seek&mdash;I do not think we can do it on the basis of the figures that are here in the chamber at the moment&mdash;a precise compilation and total of the money in this year's program that has been utilised in that indirect way by ANC members, but I cannot do that right now. </PARA>

Could the Minister indicate what comments the Government has made in relation to the recent exposure of the ANC use of torture in its camps? I think for the public record it is important that we get the Minister's views on that issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Minister has probably heard the expression that people can do well by doing good. Could someone go through the total APHEDA budget, 91 per cent of which is paid by the taxpayer of Australia, and indicate what proportion of that money is actually paid to Australians, in particular trade union officials? Looking through this, it is very hard for me to evaluate all of these programs. I am sure that some are most worthy. This goes back to the accountability and the proper concerns that people on this side of the chamber have to make sure that taxpayers' funds are properly accounted for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot of money has been given to the ACTU for its foreign aid purposes. The ACTU seems to have heaps of money for a whole host of political purposes, but it does not seem to give a very high priority to foreign aid activities except when those activities can be funded by the taxpayer. So I would like the Department in due course to provide me with the figures of just how much of this $3.4m is actually paid out to Australian trade union officials?</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have criticised the Minister from this side of the chamber on many occasions for the fact that he has chosen a political party, a political organisation, the ANC, to be the sole recipient of funds from the Australian taxpayer and that he is picking winners as to who may be winning government after the next elections in South Africa. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Kemp, Senator Hill, Mr Carlton from the other place and I had the opportunity to go to South Africa some two months ago as the guests of the Southern African Forum and to meet with leaders and people from all the political parties involved. That included meeting everyone&mdash;people from the PAC on the far left; officials from the ANC; people from Solidarity, the Indian party; people from the coloured party; people from Inkatha, including Chief Buthelezi, about whom I will have more to say in a moment; people from Helen Sussman's party and Helen Sussman herself; people generally who are concerned about the way in which the dilemma of South Africa is to be solved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The one thing that became quite clear and apparent from these meetings was this: only the PAC and ANC want a unitary form of government. Everybody else wants power sharing and some form of federation or confederation. It is well to note that had South Africa not had a unitary form of government, apartheid would have been impossible to implement. Simply, if there is to be another unitary government to replace the current unitary government, then it will be winner take all and, in my view, an awful bloodbath could result. If, however, all the players are allowed to have a say and there is some form of power sharing&mdash;and already agreement has been reached in respect of nine economic regions, with one of them possibly being divided into two to provide two Xhosa states&mdash;we will find that having power sharing and stability in South Africa is possible. As I said, those opinions were gained from all the political players when we were there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also had the opportunity to meet with Judge Goldstone of the Goldstone Commission, a most impressive man. We were there for the opening day's hearings into the Boipatong massacre. But we also learned something which we do not see in this paper and which the Minister has never drawn to the attention of this place or the Australian people, and that is that just as Boipatong was the most horrendous massacre&mdash;and we did indeed go to Boipatong and meet with people who had been assaulted, injured and hacked&mdash;there was an equivalent which the Commission was also investigating called Crossroads where it was exactly the reverse. In other words, the violence and the massacres that had been perpetrated were on both sides; they had been perpetrated by the ANC and they had been perpetrated by the Zulus and people who are members of Inkatha. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was very important, I thought, that at the Goldstone Commission to hear the evidence was the former Chief Justice of India, for instance, sitting on the bench with the members of that Commission.

When Chief Buthelezi and other Ministers who attended him at this meeting made a formal speech, of which I have a copy, he spoke about the way Minister Evans had personally treated him. He spoke about the way that he was interested in coming to Australia, particularly as he found the Australian Constitution a good model and one that could be useful in solving South Africa's problems. He explained that, although he had expressed his wish to the Minister, or through to the Minister, to be invited to Australia&mdash;just as Nelson Mandela had been invited to Australia&mdash;and have the opportunity to learn the things that perhaps we had to teach, the Minister simply refused to allow that to occur; the Minister deigned to allow him perhaps to have a visa and come. </PARA>

The context in which I was using the expression `kick against the pricks' was exactly the context which Senator Bishop has described&mdash;pricks in the sense not of the vulgar connotation but pricks in the sense of the pricks of life, against which sometimes it is pointless to rage; one has to accept the inevitability.

To give him credit, even the Minister seemed somewhat frustrated in the Estimates Committee to learn that it was still in its draft form, after having been promised to us a year ago.

In this situation, where AIDAB has been internally wrestling with how it should describe its assessment for a period of over a year, one is not unreasonably somewhat suspicious.

The consultants were engaged as part of a review team that produced a single document, but that document or the information which lay behind that document was itself inconclusive on particular subject areas because of differing evaluations or differing qualitative responses from particular groups in Indonesia which were the beneficiaries of the programs. Some took different views about the various projects and it was a matter of trying to reconcile those views and reach some common and credible judgment about them.

I think AIDAB in recent years has had a pretty good track record in doing just that. It is in nobody's interests in terms of the longer term credibility of the organisation or of Australia internationally to try to conceal or paper over or whitewash things that may have gone wrong.

But I can say that the report in question is a joint internal report which was prepared by both Papua New Guinea and Australian representatives on stage 1 of the police project. It is not a matter of both governments necessarily accepting every comment which appears in the body of the report because some were evaluations from one side and some from another side from the different perspectives. What is important is the basic conclusions and recommendations that flowed from that. As I understand it, those conclusions and recommendations were jointly written and tendered to the respective governments and there was unanimity.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am told that the comments about being trained for Bougainville, or language to that effect which appears in the report, were a function of the review team being told at one stage during its inquiry that officers who had been on this Australian course had gone very shortly thereafter to Bougainville and had utilised some of the skills that they had been taught.

It may be an understandable misperception for the reasons I have already put on the record&mdash;namely, the kinds of skills that people are being taught are to some extent relevant and applicable in the environment that they confronted on Bougainville.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole question of the role of the police and the constitutionality of it is clearly one for especially the Papua New Guinea authorities to resolve. It needs to be appreciated that the situation on Bougainville, although it has involved the military, still is, in a sense, a civil disturbance.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have no direct personal knowledge of this matter. All I can do is read to Senator Hill the briefing that I have in front of me. The agreement on development cooperation between India and Australia does specify telecommunications as a sector for cooperation following an official Indian Government request in October 1990 and the prolonged negotiation of terms of reference.

A tender call by India in January 1992 was for the supply of hardware and off-the-shelf software for five regional network management centres. Therefore, it differs significantly from the AIDAB project in terms of the number of centres and the fact that it does not transfer the capability to modify the software. The tender is a simple procurement exercise without a development component. However, the tender does include the centre, which is the subject of the AIDAB project.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Telecom Australia International advises that the aid project would provide ready access to the most senior Indian officials responsible for implementing India's five-year communications plan. Under the eighth five-year plan, the Indian Government intends to invest the equivalent of $20 billion in the telecommunications sector. If Australia is to secure a significant share of business, it will need to establish a suitable profile with the Department of Telecommunications.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As always, the story of this is rather more complicated than the simplistic way in which it has been described by Senator Hill. As I recall, the matter of the supply of this group of garbage compactors was raised with me by the Mauritian Foreign Minister to emphasise the importance that Mauritius attached to this. It is something that was not initiated by us but came very much from the Mauritian side. AIDAB proceeded to supply 10 garbage compactors under the commodity assistance program, which provides for the supply of particular kinds of goods and equipment, because it was developmentally important for Mauritius and in Australia's commercial interests. Let me explain why.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was developmentally important because Mauritius has a chronic problem with urban solid waste collection and the supply of the compactors is regarded by them as a high priority to help them alleviate that problem. The supply of 10 units under the aid program would, in AIDAB's judgment, complement and support Australia's commercial interests in Mauritius by making Australia the preferred supplier of garbage compactors and accessories to that country through familiarity with and confidence in Australian equipment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government of Mauritius had requested the supply of up to 30 such compactors, but it was decided to limit to 10 the number of AIDAB funded compactors to allow Australian companies to meet commercially the demand for the remaining 20. It was believed at the time that because Industrial Containers was the only Australia company that was in the Mauritius market, it would be in the strongest position to win the aid contract for the 10 compactors, not to mention any subsequent commercial tenders that might be called by the Government of Mauritius. In the event, it proved not to be the strongest contender for the first 10 compactors supplied by AIDAB. But, if Senator Hill chooses to listen, he will hear me say that other Australian contractors were successful beneficiaries of this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are six or more suppliers of this equipment in Australia who are interested in the supply of it. I do not think we should be in the business of seeking to protect some individual supplier. What is important is to try to attract the business for Australia. The first 10 garbage compactors provided by AIDAB have gone to an Australian contractor and the remaining 20 will be acquired, we very much hope and expect, commercially from the Australian market. It will be a matter of normal competitive pressures to determine who gets that contract. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the final and important point: if we had not proceeded with the supply of 10 compactors under the aid program, the Government of Mauritius would have approached other donors, for example, the French, for the supply of garbage compactors, because it is doubtful whether the Government of Mauritius is in a position to fund the commercial procurement of the whole of the estimated 30 compactors that were needed. That would have meant the loss of most, if not all, of the market to Australia. It has been a matter of fine judgment as to how best to get a toehold in the market that would secure the biggest return to Australia over the longest period of time with the maximum number of sales. That is the basis of it. </PARA>

He might address himself to the question whether this is the best type of aid to be providing, but I guess that he and his advisers have decided that this is good quality aid for the scarce Australian dollar. But why the top of the market? Why Mercedes Benz trucks which cost $15,000 more than the Mitsubishi model that had been found to be quite satisfactory in the past?

That is why it becomes a mystery to the Minister&mdash;I can understand that&mdash;particularly in circumstances where matters do not go to public tender. In fact, if it was not for an aggrieved supplier, we would not know about the matter at all. So I am not going to ask him to respond to that at the moment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When Senator Hill says, `formal security review', this is a matter of ongoing review by the Department. There is nothing I would rather do than re-establish the mission in Beirut, for all sorts of obvious reasons in terms of effective servicing of the very large number of Australians of Lebanese origin who would welcome the provision of that service, not to mention the Lebanese in Lebanon, of course.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the security problem that has inhibited us. We make our judgment on a combination of readings through ordinary diplomatic methods of the overall security situation, and a judgment about the likelihood of the situation stabilising, whether or not the Taif accords are being successfully implemented and how successful the process of establishing a working and effective government is. We make all those sorts of judgments, combined with the assessments of our colleagues, in particular the British and French, who do have missions there on the ground and who have considerable day-to-day experience of the operating environment. We have been in close consultation with them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have established, to put it succinctly, that their perceived security needs continue to be huge in terms of guarding services, around-the-clock provision of bodyguards for senior people moving backwards and forwards, plus the guarding of buildings and so on. Although improved, it is still a very volatile environment that exists in Beirut and one could simply not responsibly put Australian officers in there in that environment without taking similar precautions proportionate to what would obviously be a much smaller mission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is where the matter rests. We had all hoped that the security situation would continue to rather rapidly improve in the latter part of this year with hopefully the withdrawal of Syrian forces, the stabilisation of government and hopefully the secession of hostilities in southern Lebanon and the role of the Hezbollah and so on, all of which contributes to the present uncertainties in Beirut itself. Unfortunately those things have not happened, but we are continuing to review it. </PARA>

Is the Minister aware of statements made by the President of the Small Business Association, Mr Peter Boyle, where he described what would happen to workers trying to negotiate with their employer under a system of individual employment contracts?

The subject of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS> that night was the Kennett and coalition industrial relations policies. It was said in a revealing introduction to the interview with Mr Boyle that he was the only businessman who would agree to be interviewed on that subject. During the interview the interviewer asked Mr Boyle this question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If you had an employee that said, no, I won't work weekends and nights, unless you pay me penalties, what would you do?</PARA>
<PARA>That is a very fair question. The answer from Mr Boyle is extremely revealing when one considers that the Opposition's industrial relations policy and that of the Victorian Government is to force people onto individual work contracts and require them to be conducted in negotiations between the employer and the employee on their own. What did Mr Boyle say as the representative of the Small Business Association of Australia? He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, I would seek to strike an agreement with another person that was prepared to do that and if in fact, that was legal, and this legislation&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the Kennett legislation&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA>Then he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I mean, now beggars can't be choosers and I mean that in a business sense as well as an employment sense.</PARA>
<PARA>We now know that, at least in the eyes of Mr Boyle, workers who refuse to accept a cut in wages are to be regarded as beggars and they are not to be regarded as having rights to choose. That may well be a revealing insight into Mr Boyle's mentality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other revealing insight is that Mr Boyle is saying exactly what we have said would apply under individual work contract type agreements that are to be introduced in Victoria and would be introduced if the Opposition's industrial relations policy were to be law in this country.

This is a low wage policy and, when one considers the consumption tax and the effect on inflation, a high prices policy as well.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe that Australians are aware, as a result of the remarks he made last week, of the Prime Minister's concern about violence on television. In fact, he reinforced in the Caucus only a few days ago the fact that very recently he, as a parent, had to turn off the television in his own household. When he found his daughters watching a movie at a reasonable time slot at night which he said was truly horrible, he exercised parental control and switched it off. The fact is that violent movies were being shown in that time slot. But it is not only a question of television; it is also a question of film and videos.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This morning at the Ita Buttrose conference on the family the Prime Minister made clear that he had found from what he has seen and certainly from soundings in the community a lack of confidence in the community about the M category of films and videos. It is far too broad. It covers matters from very mild violence being portrayed to those situations in which a very dramatic and traumatic amount of violence is realistically depicted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So there is quite clearly a need to have the M category revised, and the Prime Minister has made a suggestion as to how that might be done. Certainly the M category, which is supposedly unsuitable for children under 15 years of age, is too broad and I think most parents find that they cannot have any confidence in that category. It is an advisory category anyway. It may well be that there is a need to make the top end of the M category more regulatory so that cinema operators and video store retailers and hirers are penalised if they make these videos available to those who ought not to be viewing them or hiring them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister is suggesting that this matter be put on the agenda of the next meeting of the Australian Government Council&mdash;a meeting of the Premiers, Chief Ministers and the Prime Minister, which will be held, I think, on 7 December in Perth&mdash;to ensure that there is widespread political support for changes to this category. This would enable parents and, indeed, those who want to attend cinemas or hire videos generally, to accept more confidently the M category in relation to the level of violence, coarse language or sex matters that might be portrayed. I believe that this is a very worthwhile move indeed.</PARA>

I refer to reports that the Government has decided to delay or perhaps not present at all legislation that is designed to further regulate tobacco advertising. I ask the Minister: does the Government now not accept figures that show tobacco smoking is the largest single preventable cause of death and disease in Australia today and is estimated to have caused 20,000 deaths in 1991 alone? Does he reject findings that most people who smoke start between the ages of 12 and 16 and that advertising by tobacco companies, including sports sponsorship, is a factor that influences them?  If the Government does recognise the social and economic costs of smoking, will the legislation proceed before Christmas?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As honourable senators will no doubt be aware, the UN will be celebrating its fiftieth anniversary in 1995. The UN has recently established a preparatory committee to oversee all the arrangements for that anniversary, and I am very pleased to advise the Senate that Australia's permanent representative to the UN, Ambassador Richard Butler, was elected unanimously to chair that preparatory committee for the fiftieth anniversary. That does reflect very highly not only on Australia's standing but on Ambassador Butler's personal standing in the United Nations as well as, of course, continuing the fine tradition that Australia has established in terms of its commitment to the UN, going all the way back to Doc Evatt in 1945.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is worth making the point that the fiftieth anniversary will not just be an occasion for celebrations&mdash;although it will certainly be that&mdash;but will provide a major focus for progress on key issues affecting the efficiency of the organisation, including placing the UN on a more secure financial footing; restructuring the membership and operation of the Security Council so that it does more accurately reflect present global power realities&mdash;not those of the post-World War II era; and ensuring that it is better able to avert human tragedies, such as those we have seen this year in Somalia and the Balkans.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear that the UN, certainly in Australia's judgment, is going to have to develop a very considered rethinking of its position in the whole peace and security area, not only in terms of creating a capacity, where necessary, for collective intervention in extreme cases, not only for creating a more effective capacity for providing collective assistance by way of peacekeeping and so on for the many situations that, unhappily, are likely to arise in the future, but also&mdash;and this has been a particular Australian preoccupation&mdash;creating a better preventive capacity through the measures in the area of preventive diplomacy, or so-called peace-making, through an intensified effort on arms control and disarmament issues and also through much more concerted international action on non-military threats to security, such as famine, poverty, natural disasters and environmental degradation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of these areas&mdash;and this is the point of what I am saying&mdash;are likely to feature prominently in the agenda for the preparations for the fiftieth anniversary because many countries around the world are looking for major achievement in those areas and see the 1995 anniversary as being the target date for that. I am very confident that, as a result of Ambassador Butler's election to chair that preparatory committee, Australia will be in a particularly good position to continue the significant contribution we are already making to all those aspects of the UN's agenda, and it is a very important feather in Australia's cap for us to be playing this role.</PARA>

I have now been advised by the ABC that it has signed a three-year lease for a transponder on the Palapa satellite which will begin on the date the new service begins. The ABC has been investigating a number of options regarding the satellite up-link facilities for the service. Originally, it thought it might be able to lease them.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is true that there was some suggestion that up to 2,000 Japanese tour guides might be imported into Australia in order to serve the tourist industry. That figure was never a realistic figure, and no applications for such a number of Japanese tour guides to enter Australia have been made. These matters have been the subject of the setting up of an authority to look at the whole question of the training of tour guide operators. It has been done in a way which I believe leads to the conclusion that there is a great capacity within Australian education institutions and training authorities to provide young Australians, in particular, with the opportunity to make themselves proficient enough in Japanese to provide a service to those Japanese tourists who come here in great numbers and help Australia to earn foreign exchange through the tourism industry.</PARA></TALK.START>

If that is built on over succeeding years, I am quite confident that the sorts of visa applications which were foreshadowed and about which there were such grave misgivings will not come to pass and the Australian workers who are seeking employment in this area will find that with the combination of education, training and opportunity they will get the jobs in this sector which they deserve to hold down in order to provide this service.</PARA>

We cut taxes, we introduced Medicare, we improved the value of the social wage and we did a number of other things so that real household disposable income&mdash;the true measure of the purchasing power of households&mdash;has improved.

<PARA>After Question Time the Minister for Industrial Relations, Senator Cook, added to the answer he gave during Question Time. I was not going to take note of Senator Cook's answer, but I guess he has provoked me into doing so. The issue at stake&mdash;and it was not addressed by the Minister because it is not in his interests to do so&mdash;is that a week or so ago JLV, as seen in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS>, came out slamming the industrial relations reform package of the Opposition, supported by Martin Ferguson, who is obviously very close to Mr Bill Johnson of JLV.

However, the point is that his work force might be doing well and his company might be doing well; the turnover is not an indication of how well one is doing. I am sure the Minister knows that.

As soon as I mention the name JLV, they use words that I could not repeat in this Parliament because he has left a string of debts behind him.

It is a quite extraordinary one. I added to my answer at the end of Question Time. I drew the parallel between SPC&mdash;the Shepparton Preserving Company&mdash;and this company, JLV. Let us go back and look at what happened in the case of the Shepparton Preserving Company, SPC.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation was that the members of that company, a growers collective, found that its management, during the heady days of the stock market boom, had overspent the capital of the company. It faced creditors across the board and needed to close its doors; it was going to shut itself down. The shareholders of that company dismissed the management and appointed a new board. That board negotiated with its work force an enterprise agreement which was later registered under the Industrial Relations Act of the Commonwealth. It was a genuine workplace agreement. That meant that the company was able to grow its way, as a company, out of debt into profit, maintain its employment and continue to put its quality product on the market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I accept unchecked the word of Senator Campbell&mdash;and I say straight away that I have never found Senator Campbell to be someone who misleads in this place; I cannot say that that is unequivocally true of some of his colleagues, but in his case I can say it&mdash;there are creditors of this company worth between $5.5m and $8.5m in Western Australia. This Government does not support anyone&mdash;and nor do I&mdash;welshing on his or her obligations to suppliers of a particular company or avoiding obligations to creditors. Nothing in my answer suggests that we would or do. If there is any generosity or human spirit in this chamber, that will be freely recognised across the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This company, which is in a similar situation to SPC, has negotiated a workplace agreement with its work force. Productivity has grown by 25 per cent. It is now looking at a more buoyant future. That is exactly what SPC did. It put this company in a position where it can pay back the debt. I have no compunction in saying that that is what it should do if there are creditors of this order in the wings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a matter for applause and approval that an Australian company, which is up against it while Australia is   coming out of a recession, is negotiating with its work force, is getting a higher productivity environment and is growing the fortunes of the company and bringing itself out of the red into the black, can now pay back the debt. All those companies that Senator Campbell has referred to that may have been otherwise hurt will not be; they will be saved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is exactly what we are talking about with workplace reform. It is happening under our Government.

<PARA>The answer that Senator Cook gave to my question goes to the nub of one, if not the, key element of the industrial relations debate in this country, which is: how can we best improve the living standards of ordinary Australians? How can we increase real earnings?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Acting Deputy President, you may recall before the last election that Mr Keating indulged in the politics of the big scare and the big lie that we have seen so often. Guess what was going to happen under the John Howard policy in the last election? Real wages were going to explode. That was the big scare tactic. Senator Evans, who is in the chamber, will well recall Mr Keating tramping the country saying, `Do not accept the industrial relations policy of the coalition because there will be a wage break-out'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This time, the Government is running the reverse in the big scare program, which is, `Do not accept the IR policy of Mr Howard because it will lead to a cut in real wages'. To put all this in perspective, we now know after some 10 years the results of the much vaunted wages policy of the Keating Government. What sort of results does it return for ordinary Australian workers?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The debate between Senator Cook and myself has involved looking at what has happened to living standards under the Labor Government. We do not need to talk about what will happen in the future, because we have had a 10-year model to see just how effective the ACTU bosses and the senior Labor Ministers have been in protecting and building the real incomes of ordinary Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The debate centres on two sets of figures: average weekly earnings and household disposable incomes. From time to time, Senator Cook has fluctuated between whether he prefers average weekly earnings or household disposable income as the best measure. In terms of cutting real wages and what will be done to award wages and the earnings of people, average weekly earnings is the central figure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that the figures produced by the Parliamentary Library show that in the nine to 10 years of the Labor Government, a government whose major aim was to improve the living standards of ordinary Australians, real earnings have fallen. The union bosses conspired with Labor Ministers and worked out this great thing called the accord. The accord is essentially a mechanism to keep trade unions in power and privilege. It is not&mdash;and the results show this&mdash;to increase the living standards of ordinary Australians. The figures that have been produced by the Parliamentary Library show that average weekly earnings have fallen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Household disposable incomes have also fallen since December 1989. These are more complex figures. They include welfare payments, whether wives are working, part time workers in the household and a whole host of other factors. It is certainly one way of measuring living standards. When talking about the industrial system as distinct from the welfare system, one has to look at average weekly earnings. We have seen the record of the Keating Government and Senator Cook. They have not only cut the average earnings of ordinary Australians; as a result of their policies, they have also thrown one million Australians out of work. So we have seen the results of their IR policies. They have failed. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA>I rise to speak on this report to express my outrage and disappointment at AOTC with regard to an undertaking it gave to the Senate Select Committee on Community Standards Relevant to the Supply of Services Utilising Telecommunications Technologies. The Senate Committee was formed after representations from members of the public concerned about access to and advertising of pornography by 0055 service calls. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee, at the end of its deliberations, made 12 recommendations. These recommendations included that AOTC adopt a code of conduct that service providers will not provide knowingly, or negligently, information on any 0055 service number which in any way may be interpreted as indecent, obscene, offensive or sexually titillating or denote sexual suggestion. AOTC was to ensure that all 0055 services that were in breach of this code of conduct would be transferred to the opt-in 0051 closed user service or discontinued. AOTC was not to allow the provision or advertising of any 0055 service which could be described or interpreted as the equivalent of R or X film or video classifications. AOTC was to undertake the introduction of immediate random monitoring to ensure contractual compliance of the message content on both 0051 and 0055 with the code of conduct. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were assured in the Committee that AOTC agreed with us and that our recommendations would be adopted. On page 40 of this annual report, AOTC welcomes the outcomes of the Senate inquiry and states that it is adopting specific recommendations towards more stringent controls. Unfortunately, I must inform the Senate that this is totally untrue. AOTC is simply paying lip service to the Australian Senate, and this is something which all senators should find unacceptable. </PARA>

I have a copy of the amended letter and, with the Senate's permission, I would like to read it into <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. The letter reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Mr Holmes,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee is concerned about a reported breach of your standards with regard to 0055 and 0051 telephone messages.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One 0055 number advertised on late night television in Melbourne was apparently used by the service provider to hook customers into 0051 services. This was done by a series of women who started titillating comments on a particular theme and then invited listeners to call a series of 0051 numbers for `better' versions of the same themes. Advice was also given on how to `short cut' the processes set up for becoming 0051 subscribers.</PARA>
<PARA>This is in clear breach of the recommendations that our Committee made, and I thank Senator Tierney for bringing this to our attention. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other 0055 numbers currently available apparently offer `your own tape' of adult themes, or linked to so-called `X-rated' 0051 numbers (despite this Committee's recommendations that 0051 services not provide X-rated material).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee members would like to assess the transcripts of the following telephone messages:</PARA>
<PARA>In view of some of the material that Senator Tierney has just handed to me and which I believe has been tabled, clearly this practice is much wider than we perhaps had first thought. Therefore we need to call on AOTC to take action urgently. My letter concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We need to expedite this matter in time for our next meeting at the end of November.</PARA>
<PARA>We will then be discussing this in detail. I hope we will get very firm answers from the Chairman of Telecom. I hope we will be told that Telecom will stop this practice, whatever it is and however prevalent it is, immediately. Telecom has given the Committee assurances. As Senator Tierney pointed out, Telecom in its annual report has said, `Look, this was a problem, we have fixed it, don't worry'. Yet today we have the same old story with a magazine and the same old problem on which our Committee worked for more than 12 months.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>This is one of the saddest and most melancholy duties I have had to perform in 14 years in the Parliament. The loss of the Air Force Boeing 707 two weeks and a year ago in Bass Strait cost this country five fine lives; five families suffered the grievous loss of losing a husband or a father in the prime of their life. At a lesser level, we lost an aircraft, and the RAAF, which has enjoyed a very high professional reputation as a professional air force for the last 30 or 40 years, has suffered quite a blow to its reputation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very painful for me to say this, but it must be said: this was an accident that should never have happened. The RAAF document is only a summary of the inquiry into the accident. There is a great deal in that summary of interest to the Parliament. Paragraph 2 on the first page states that the pilot in command was demonstrating a flight sequence `which he had personally devised'. On page 2, under the heading `Causes', it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The inquiry process concluded that the two principal causes of the accident were that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">a.the instructor and captain of the aircraft devised a demonstration of asymmetric flight which . . . was inherently dangerous and which was certain to lead to a sudden departure from controlled flight, and he did so without appreciating that central fact; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">b.the demonstration having been conducted and the aircraft having suddenly departed controlled flight, the crew failed to recover the aircraft before it crashed into the sea.</PARA>
<PARA>Further on, the summary makes reference to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . deficiencies in the acquisition and documentation of B707 operational knowledge and the absence of effective mechanisms to prevent the erosion of corporate B707 operational knowledge during periods of high pilot resignation. . . </PARA>
<PARA>Briefly, what happened is that the pilot closed down two engines on the one side, allowed the air speed to decay and it is alleged&mdash;although it is not mentioned in this summary&mdash;that there was a probable lack of rudder authority because the rudder boost was not in and the pilot could not counteract the yaw of the two engines operating on one side. The airspeed decayed and the aeroplane then went into a flick roll. If anyone has ever been in a flick roll manoeuvre, they would know that they just happen automatically and with great rapidity. In that flick roll, which occurred at a very low level of 5,000 feet, there would not have been time to recover, even had the pilot been able to, and very probably the aircraft suffered structural damage in the flick roll, which is quite a violent manoeuvre. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can remember in 1959 when the first Boeing 707 came to Europe. It was a Pan Am aircraft and was demonstrating stalls over France; it threw an engine off. It was not unusual that No. 1 engine was thrown off by accident. Years ago, when the KC135s&mdash;which are basically very similar to the 707&mdash;were introduced into the United States Air Force service, there was a series of fatal accidents through precisely the same causes: asymmetric flight, decaying airspeed. That was 30 years ago; the same accident was repeated a year ago, and it is absolutely inexcusable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The conclusions contained in the summary state that the accident was the result of the actions of the aircraft captain. That is qualified later on when it is stated that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the general circumstances relating to the causes of the accident mitigate the degree of responsibility for the accident attributable to the captain.</PARA>
<PARA>That is rightly so; the captain was never provided with the training, the manuals and the documentation for the endorsement he was doing. That is absolutely inexcusable. It is very wrong to see this accident, as the summary does, as a failing of the pilot in command alone. The real reason for the accident, as the summary states on the top of page 3, is the relatively high resignation rates of the mid-1980s which took so many experienced pilots out of the Air Force. We have some experienced pilots left, but we do not have enough. We have a degradation in capability. I disagree very much with clause 10(f) in the summary, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . while many persons contributed unwittingly to the general circumstances relating to primary and contributory causes, none was negligent.</PARA>
<PARA>That is not true; the senior officers who did know better must accept the responsibility for the degradation in training procedures which let this accident come about. One can hide accidents in the Army and Navy, but one cannot hide them in the Air Force where a very high level of technical skill is involved. This is a consequence of the reduction in the Defence Department vote, and the Government and the Ministers ought to think about that because it could well have been the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in that aircraft or senior members of the Cabinet. This accident exposes very serious deficiencies in the Air Force training procedures. It is a tragedy that it has happened; let us learn from it and let us take immediate action to correct it. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak briefly on this summary of the inquiry into the accident involving No. 33 Squadron. Senator MacGibbon has gone through in some detail the matters spelt out in this desperately sad summary of the inquiry into the accident of the Boeing 707 near East Sale on 29 October last year. As he said, it would appear to be suggesting that we should be looking at pilot error as the cause of this accident. The principal causes are deemed to be that the instructor devised a demonstration which was inherently dangerous and did so without appreciating that central fact, and that the crew failed to recover the aircraft before it crashed into the sea. Under the heading `General Circumstances' in this summary, it states that:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the existence of several factors which heightened the possibility of an accident or serious incident arising from inadequate professional knowledge . . .</PARA>
<PARA>You, as a doctor, Madam Acting Deputy President, can be struck off the roll for inadequate professional knowledge, but you would expect your instructors in your medical school to have provided you with professional knowledge that was adequate to protect your patients. As Senator MacGibbon just said, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) of this country could indeed have been a victim of this inadequate professional knowledge. There are a number of other detailed matters in the summary which suggest that there is a need for improvement in the preparation of crews training on B707s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On a number of occasions in recent years, senior Air Force officers have expressed to me their worries about the training of 707 pilots, mainly because they claimed that people were being posted to these positions too early in their professional lives; they had not yet had sufficient professional experience in order to undertake the training. This was a direct cause of the heavy wastage during the 1980s of which you, Madam Acting Deputy President, would be well aware and about which Mr Manfred Cross's committee reported in such detail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">None is deemed to have been negligent. I would say the Federal Government stands condemned for negligence because the accident has to be directly related to the amount of training time given to these people who are promoted, perhaps, into these positions earlier than they otherwise might have been because of the wastage rates. The Federal Government has to be condemned for the reduction in flying time, as it is for the reduction in exercise time and steaming time for the other two services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More extensive education of all RAAF multi-engine pilots is one of the recommendations contained in this summary. But does that really mean that it is finally acknowledging on paper, in a very oblique way, that there should be more training hours? Why is that not spelt out? We know that there is this gap in experience level in all three Services after the massive wastage in the 1980s. Why is the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) not here to make a statement about this very important summary? I wrote to the Minister on 13 November about the accidents that were happening in the Air Force and the Army expressing my concern, stating:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is of great concern to me as to whether these accidents are found to be due to human error either on the land or in the air and if so, how much they might be due to the long term effects of wastage of personnel which we have suffered over recent years. There is still cause for concern that as a result of that wastage some people may have been posted to positions for which they didn't have the necessary experience.</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister responded in December, saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it is fair to say, at this stage, that the general lowering of experience levels amongst aircrews in the late eighties has not been established as a significant factor in the majority of the accidents experienced over the last two years.</PARA>
<PARA>Is he prepared to acknowledge now that these people were being put into jobs for which they did not have enough background and for which they were being given too little training? I asked him a question on notice on 12 December 1991 about these accidents, and he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Air Force has suffered some increase in accident rate, but investigations into the accidents have shown no causal link between them and any reduction in training allocation. The Services indicate strongly that any reduction in training allocation has not been allowed to compromise safety standards during or after training.</PARA>
<PARA>What a hollow answer that has to be. We know that there has been a cut in the Budget because of Mr Beazley's misallocation of Budget resources. That is why the Opposition is determined that there will be a change, and that there will be increased expenditure on training, and opportunities for people for flying hours, steaming hours and exercise time. It is to save lives. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>The electronic lodgment is a further extension of the self-assessment system, a process that relieves the Australian Taxation Office of re-processing information from hard copy to its computers for the purpose of producing an assessment or a refund. The report before the Senate, Audit Report No. 5, is the first evaluation by the Australian National Audit Office of the new electronic lodgment service. We have to acknowledge that it has been a successful innovation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, it is pleasing to note that not only was there a high degree of cooperation with the audit team, headed by Margaret Innes, but also the outcome was praiseworthy of the Taxation Office's implementation of the electronic lodgment facility. I believe that the degree of cooperation evident here in this particular project audit will erase some of the memory from earlier this year when there appeared to be a reluctance by the head of the Tax Office, Mr Boucher, to be subject to an audit at that time by the Australian National Audit Office. Due to tremendous pressure, that decision was reversed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The electronic lodgment service enables taxpayers to transmit tax returns as electronic records to the Tax Office for processing on its own computers. The main purpose of electronic lodgment is to expedite the Tax Office's processing of returns. In the 1991-92 processing year, 4.7 million individual tax returns were received through this medium, with approximately 95 per cent of refunds being made within 14 days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, not surprisingly, I wish to take this opportunity to raise some questions. Fundamental questions of privacy need to be addressed. The tax agent and the Tax Office are both agents of the taxpayer in respect of the one transaction, which seems to contradict fundamental principal and agents arrangements. There is no uniform system within the Tax Office of checking across what is a very decentralised office system nowadays. Indeed, the Audit Office recommended that there be a national audit and checking of standards to ensure consistency, and to ensure that tax returns held by tax agents do match the records submitted through the ELS. It was indicated that this checking should be done on a sample basis at least. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further problem is that not all taxpayers are necessarily aware of the conditions under which their tax returns are being processed, and the mechanism that is put in place to protect the privacy of the personal and taxation information recorded on the returns. There is a further deficiency in that the Tax Office software does not at the present time detect internal inconsistencies, omissions or certain inaccuracies. We are told that the cross-check process is still at least two years down the track. Another problem is that assessments can be issued under this medium without a signed return. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, a further problem is that the medium is so limited as to provide very little information to tax auditors to meet their requirements for audit. Generally, additional supplementary information must be obtained from the tax agent and the taxpayer. It is part of this process of removing responsibility and work from the Tax Office to the individual taxpayers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As with all automated systems, data inaccuracies can occur as a result of incorrect data input, deliberate or inadvertent modification of the data and systems failure. The Australian National Audit Office found no indication that data processed through the ELS will be less reliable than data processed by taxation officers from paper tax return documents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian National Audit Office has concluded that the ELS works effectively as a processing system, and has been a successful development for the Taxation Office in terms of staff savings, increased speed of processing and acceptance by taxpayers. However, no evaluation seems to have been made of the cash flow consequences of this new service. I would imagine that tax agents will tend initially to put through the ELS system those returns that will have a refund, but delay returns where further payments are required by taxpayers to the end. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to record my satisfaction that the Tax Office has finally restricted the service to registered tax agents and Australia Post in order to preserve a greater degree of privacy and uphold the provisions of section 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. We all know that computer bureau networks are not governed to the same degree by privacy legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important for listeners to this broadcast to be aware that the Tax Office does not contend that the electronic record is the legal tax document; it is merely the electronic record of the legal document which is held by the tax agent. Tax agents transmit the tax return information to the Tax Office, rather than an officer of the Tax Office keying in the information from hard copy received from the taxpayers or through their tax agents. Legally, the print-out held by the tax agent will, therefore, be the document which may be subject to penalty or litigation. In fact, the Australian Government Solicitor has advised that the tax agent is the registered Commissioner's authorised agent for this purpose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of legal issues, which no doubt my colleague Senator Bronwyn Bishop will wish to explore, regarding the legality of some of those arrangements, because they are somewhat unusual and have yet to be tested in the courts. This whole arrangement is one of facilitating and reducing costs to the Tax Office and putting further responsibilities onto the taxpayer and the tax agent. The real problem of tax uncertainty in this country lies not necessarily with tax administration, although in some areas there are some unfortunate flaws, but with the law itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have too many tax laws which are incapable of consistent interpretation. I suppose the worst area for this is capital gains. There are too many tax laws which create excessive compliance issues. This Senate is about to consider further complications relating to car parking. People will just have to go out and physically measure how far their office or building is from the nearest car park. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about the problems of people with disabilities&mdash;they are not taken into account&mdash;who park behind the office building? What about the problem of whether it is the nearest route to drive or walk? What about the problem of one-way streets? What about the problem of a building being on one side of the street and the car park on the other?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also difficulties with case law precedent. Judges, of course, must rely on lawyers' arguments. We have seen difficulties with the Tax Office not necessarily accepting what is recognised in the trade as accepted precedent, the Taxation Commissioner believing that, in many cases, the situations are not identical. How closely are we going to require this concept of identical or non-identical situations to upset the precedent of case law?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also the difficulty of what I call establishing the changing mood of the court itself&mdash;particularly the High Court, where we have seen a very different High Court in the 1970s from the High Court we see today. Then there is the inconsistency of tax rulings with a slant towards revenue protection&mdash;almost as a reflex revenue approach. Forward sales tend to be acceptable but not, for example, as I have repeatedly said, swap receipts and payments. There is a dreadful inconsistency there. There is then the unreasonable threat of part IVA. If all else fails, of course, part IVA tends to come back. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to this most important Auditor-General's Audit Report No. 5 of 1992-93 into the Australian Taxation Office, Electronic Lodgment Service, I would like to endorse the remarks that have been made by my colleague Senator Watson, as together, from the time that self-assessment was introduced into our taxation system, he and I have said consistently that what we have done is to impose a self-assessment system upon a legislative framework which was designed for assessment; and the problems that flow from that are really quite extraordinary.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General, in the report, highlights one of the most important facts that flows from the way in which this adhockery has been pursued as a method of implementing the new system. On page x of the report, in the section headed `Legal basis for Electronic Tax Returns', the Auditor-General says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ANAO noted that the ELS is defined by the ATO as a temporary system supporting a permanent function.</PARA>
<PARA>Interesting. He continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The arrangements supporting the interim paperless option, whereby the tax agent acts as an agent of the Commissioner for Taxation as well as an agent for the taxpayer, have likewise been described as an interim measure. The ANAO has recommended that definitive legal arrangements be put in place as soon as possible to remove the uncertainties regarding the determination of lodgment, prosecution action and recovery of penalties.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a most serious point. In other words, the Government has still not addressed the legal and legislative framework in which this changed system is operating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Several other aspects of grave concern that relate to these matters have come out of the inquiry into the Australian Taxation Office being conducted by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. Among the things that have come to our attention is that the Commissioner now has the power to make a public ruling which becomes binding. Indeed, in evidence before the Committee the Commissioner admitted that if he attended a lunch in Gulargambone and made a speech that speech could be interpreted as a ruling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleague Senator Watson made the point that, if the law is to be respected and enforced, it must be certain. To have that particular circumstance acknowledged by the Tax Office and then to say, `Oh, but we would not do it' is not acceptable. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Watson" NAMEID="VJ4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VJ4">Senator Watson</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is just another extension of uncertainty.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SE4">Senator BISHOP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As my colleague says, it is another extension of uncertainty; but I would say that it is another extension of ad hockery. Since this Government has been in office, I understand that we have added to the tax law something like 18,000 pages of tax legislation. Most of it is incomprehensible to ordinary Australians. Yet ordinary Australians are subject to a strict liability rule. That means that if they make a mistake they are liable to the penalty regime, irrespective of whether they deliberately made the mistake or whether it was just a genuine accident or mistake that occurred. No differentiation is made at all; strict liability applies. Indeed, from a public ruling that has just been made, the Commissioner has decided that he will retrospectively apply increased pensions, which again is unacceptable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This, in turn, raises another interesting question, relating to the idea that the Commissioner can make rulings which are binding&mdash;that means which have the full force of the law. In more than one forum I have floated the idea, and I have asked for it to be investigated, that rulings of the Commissioner should be done by way of regulation and should be subject to tabling and disallowance in this Parliament because they are secondary legislation and they do have the force of law. It is an idea, I must say, which has been met with some favour. Many people are interested in the concept. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing that has come out of the unwillingness of the Australian Taxation Office to submit to audit is that this is the first time together with the Public Accounts Committee inquiry that the Tax Office has really been subject to full accountability. We are finding that the Tax Office demands and penalises ordinary taxpayers according to a standard which is very high, and higher than the standard it applies to itself. The Auditor-General has criticised the Tax Office for its failure to keep records properly and yet the Australian Taxation Office has the audacity to make a statement that small business does not keep its records properly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this report, the recommendations all go to areas where there is a need for additional attention to administrative matters. Yet, last year the Australian Taxation Office converted $61m for administrative function to salary function because it has 1,000 people on the payroll who are now surplus to its needs but who cannot be put off the payroll and made compulsorily redundant simply because of the Public Sector Union agreement. So we have had the spectacle of the Government having to bail out the Tax Office with an additional grant of $114m. If anyone wants to read the last of the Estimates hearings concerning Treasury, they will see that as we went through the Commissioner's strategy which was adopted by the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) three weeks after the Budget to fill the hole that was found in the Budget, as we went through each section, which would say `There is $350m to be added to the revenue here', none of the officers were able to substantiate how and why that money was to be raised. The definitive question is: if the Commissioner was able to identify $1.7 billion of revenue that was not being collected, why was he not busy collecting it and why is he not going to do it until the year after next?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another point was very significant. If honourable senators read the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard,</EMPHASIS> they will see the admission on the part of the officers that that entire strategy was done in less than three weeks. Two senior officers&mdash;Mr Carmody, who was to be the replacement Commissioner of Taxation, and Mr Highfield&mdash;were asked to commence work on that strategy about one week after the Budget. The whole document was concluded by 16 September. To say that the work that was necessary to project those figures could be done in that time is ludicrous. Part of the statement of the so-called strategy said that it was essential to purchase additional information technology in accordance with the modernisation program. Mr Seymour, who was in charge of doing all the research work to solve the technology problems, had not been involved in any way in identifying the problem which was supposed to be identified in the strategy. He could merely say that, once they had discovered the problem, he was sure that the market could provide an answer. I am sure that the market can provide an answer, too. But if one is going to say that one needs to bring down money from the modernisation program and that that was not needed from the strategy document because the Tax Office has the right to draw down against money appropriated for the modernisation program at any time, then it was not necessary for it to be in that strategy document. Yet it was there to try to bolster the figures. It is a sad and sorry tale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I am not surprised that, when the first of these audits comes out of the Tax Office, the Auditor-General makes a range of recommendations regarding areas that need attention in order to protect both taxpayers and their privacy and to ensure that a proper system is working. But, most importantly, the legal framework in which the entire system operates is extraordinarily important. It is an indictment of the Tax Office that here we are in 1992&mdash;this system has been in place since 1990&mdash;and there has been no attempt to solve the problem to date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we are most indebted to the Auditor-General. It will be most interesting to see his full report on the Tax Office when it comes down. As Senator Watson reminded the Senate, the Tax Office rigorously resisted the right of the Auditor-General to come in and conduct the audit, saying, `Our records are not yet in order'. I do not think that the tax man would ever accept that excuse from a taxpayer. After much pressure from the Estimates Committee, the Tax Office succumbed and the Auditor-General began his audit. It will be due soon. We will be waiting with bated breath to see what he has to say. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, I would like to join in the remarks of Senator Watson and congratulate those people from the National Audit Office who were associated with the conduct of the audit. We are very fortunate to have such a strong Auditor-General and  team on which our whole system of scrutiny depends. If the Auditor-General were ever to let us down, the whole system would break down. So when we see the calibre of the work that he brings out, we should pay heed to what he has to say. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is up to us, as members of the Public Accounts Committee, to oversee the implementation of his reports and to follow up on the matters that he raises. That, fellow senators and Madam Acting Deputy President, is what accountability is all about&mdash;through the Parliament to the people to ensure that we do not have a cosying up between the Executive and the bureaucracy of the sort described so eloquently by the royal commissioners in Western Australia. They said that the system broke down because the Parliament did not do its job. Here in this Parliament we take it very seriously. It is part of our job to speak on this report today. I join with my colleague Senator Watson in saying, `Well done, Auditor-General and your team&mdash;and Australian Tax Office, lift your game'. </PARA>

<PARA>As the title indicates, this report is a review of the determinations of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and of the Privacy Commissioner. It deals with the way that decisions of those two bodies are to be enforced, if at all. The reason for bringing this report in now is that events, to some extent, were about to overtake the Committee in that on 3 November 1992 the Prime Minister introduced the Sex Discrimination and Other Legislation Amendment Bill into the House of Representatives to alter the procedures in respect of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee divided equally, in the sense that four people said that there ought to be an ability to have the decisions of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and of the Privacy Commissioner enforced through the Federal Court. That is the general thrust of what the Prime Minister's legislation will do, although the mechanism is a little different in each case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister wants any decision of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission to be directly taken to the Federal Court and registered as an order, whereas the majority's position&mdash;and it was only a majority by dint of the fact that I, as Chair, exercised a casting vote in favour of that position&mdash;is that the decisions of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and those of the Privacy Commissioner which are not obeyed should be taken to the Federal Court and registered if the parties so desire, and, if they are not complied with within 30 days, then there ought to be a hearing. As I said, the Prime Minister has a system which does not leave that up to the discretion of the parties but has it immediately registered in the court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minority report says that there should be no ability on the part of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission or of the Privacy Commissioner to make decisions at all, and that their functions should be left to carrying out conciliation. So the difference between the majority and the minority is as to whether there ought to be enforceability in terms of whatever decisions the Commission and the Commissioner make. As I said, the majority say they ought to be able to make decisions and those decisions ought to be enforceable. The minority says that they ought not to be able to make decisions, and that, even if they were, such decisions should not be enforceable, and that the function of those two bodies&mdash;the Commission and the Commissioner&mdash;should be left to simply conciliating between the parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are short of time in the legislative program.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I strongly disagree with the recommendation of the majority that determinations of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission should have force of law unless successfully appealed to the Federal Court. From Senator Cooney's remarks, I think the idea could have been gained that determinations are not presently enforceable.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;After 28 days, yes. I accept that correction. In most cases, this means that there will be an effective reversal of the onus of proof; that the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, or more specifically, I expect, the Sex Discrimination Commissioner, will be invested with punitive powers after following procedures which do not have any real rules of evidence, and do not provide the right of cross-examination or any real burden of proof.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, when I put to one of the journalist supporters of this recommendation, a few weeks ago, that this was a reversal of the onus of proof, she said, `What's wrong with that?'. I said, `Well, if that's your attitude, why don't we go right back to the dark ages and reintroduce trial by ordeal, under which witches would have stones tied around their necks and be thrown into the village pond. If they drowned, they were pronounced innocent. If they survived after about five minutes in the pond, they were deemed to be witches and were burnt at the stake instead'. Heads you lose; tails you lose as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true, as Senator Cooney has said, that the recommendation provides the right of appeal to the Federal Court by the person against whom the complaint is made. That needs the very heavy qualification: if you have the money and the determination to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A friend of mine&mdash;the husband of the electorate secretary of one of my colleagues&mdash;was a victim of Western Australian sexual harassment legislation which has similar provisions to those that are proposed in the Committee's majority report. He appealed to the Supreme Court ultimately, and the Supreme Court threw out the determination of the Western Australian Equal Opportunity Commissioner. On the way through, he paid almost $30,000 in legal fees, for which he has not yet been reimbursed. How many people have $30,000 to pay to lawyers to take this action in the courts? How many people, even if they have it or can raise it, will risk losing that amount of money if the court judgment ultimately goes against them?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this case my friend was advised not to pursue the appeal to the Supreme Court but to pay up. A monetary award was given by the determination of the Equal Opportunity Commission. My friend was advised to pay up&mdash;`Don't take it to the Supreme Court'. He rejected that advice and ultimately won. But to allow that sort of procedure really amounts to statutory sanction blackmail. Do we really want that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regrettably, as Senator Cooney has said&mdash;and he also corrected me&mdash;the Government has adopted, in a somewhat harsher fashion, the de facto reversal of the onus of proof. It has proposed amendments, moreover, which enhance the dangers in the reversal of the onus of proof. As the Prime Minister said in his second reading speech on 3 November:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . this Bill will amend the definition of sexual harassment to remove the requirement that the complainant demonstrate disadvantage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the new definition, the test will be satisfied if the complainant felt offended, humiliated or intimidated by unwelcome conduct . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Offence, humiliation and intimidation are extraordinarily subjective concepts. When coupled with the de facto reversal of the onus of proof, who is going to prove the complainant was not offended or humiliated? How would one even begin to prove that a complainant was not offended or humiliated? The alternatives proposed by this recommendation are that offence, humiliation and intimidation would be determined without the rules of evidence, et cetera, as I said before, by a person who would have punitive powers. The Prime Minister's speech went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The test also requires an objective element: that is, a reasonable person, having regard to all the circumstances, would have anticipated that the complainant would be offended, humiliated or intimidated. . . </PARA>
<PARA>A reasonable person having regard to all the circumstances&mdash;what is objective about that test? Somebody makes a guess or a judgment about whether a reasonable person would be intimidated, offended or humiliated. I know that provisions like that are applied to a great deal of law. Such provisions may be necessary. Under some circumstances they may even be good, but they are not objective. Either the author of that second reading speech&mdash;of course, it would not have been the Prime Minister himself&mdash;does not understand what objectivity is or is consciously debasing the language to facilitate his or her social engineering objectives. It could be argued that it shows us something about the mind-set of the authors of this legislation if they think the test of the reasonable person is an objective test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When someone&mdash;in this case, the Sex Discrimination Commissioner&mdash;has subjective or even arbitrary authority to impose penalties, the attitudes and beliefs of the incumbent in that position are highly relevant. The incumbent now is Quentin Bryce, who a couple of weeks ago was ordered by the Federal Court to redo two complaints which she had previously rejected and refused to investigate on the grounds that they were frivolous. One was a complaint about the fact that a Brisbane disco charges men a $2 higher admission fee than it does women. One would have thought that if words mean anything&mdash;to social engineers, words are things of convenience rather than meaning&mdash;that would have had to be an open and shut case of sex discrimination. It was thrown out arbitrarily by Quentin Bryce on the grounds that it was frivolous and she was not going to investigate it. She has, as I said, since been ordered by the Federal Court to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question of whether the state ought to be interfering with the admission charges for men and women by some disco in Brisbane is a different question. The fact is that the state has so legislated but the law is, not just because of my say-so but because of the say-so of the Federal Court, not being implemented properly by Quentin Bryce, who has displayed the most blatant bias in the administration of the existing Act. What I regard as bad proposed law will be made worse by the administration of Quentin Bryce. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The policy announced by the Government last week is taken principally from the recommendations of the Lavarch report. A letter from the honourable member for Fisher, Mr Lavarch, was published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> two days ago, the essential silliness of which was exceeded only by its rabid intellectual dishonesty. But I do not propose to deal with that any more here. I will deal with that in another forum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I implore the Government&mdash;particularly because I know how Cabinets operate: the majority of members of the Cabinet do have some commonsense but have not really thought about this because so much legislation goes through Cabinet&mdash;to reconsider its attitude to this question and either drastically amend or not proceed with the Bill that was introduced into the Parliament last week. Failing that, I believe it should at least be sent off to an inquiry by a Senate committee, if it gets as far as the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RURAL ADJUSTMENT BILL 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Rural Adjustment Bill 1992 provides for changes in the Rural Adjustment Scheme. The revised Scheme is a cornerstone of the Government's overall rural policy approach for achieving a more sustainable, productive and profitable farm sector. The Government's vision is a farm sector which is able to thrive in a highly variable economic and natural resource environment, without relying on government assistance for survival and growth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government sees its role largely as a facilitator of a rural sector that is industry and community driven. We will ensure that the operating environment within which farmers work is conducive to sound business decision making, and that the messages farmers are receiving from us are consistent, with an emphasis on self reliance and risk management. We will encourage farm business managers to equip themselves with the necessary skills and training to make the most of their opportunities and we will ensure that the Government's rural policies and programs, such as the National Drought Policy, the Income Equalisation Deposits Scheme and the Rural Adjustment Scheme, function in an integrated way and encourage good management practices.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill will have, over the remainder of this decade, a significant impact on the development of a stronger, more resilient and more competitive farm sector. It will drive the process of structural adjustment necessary to address the formidable economic and environmental problems facing the sector. In achieving this, the Government recognises the need to balance structural change and social justice. For this reason, the Bill is complemented by the Farm Household Support Bill 1992 which, in addition to assistance under the Rural Adjustment Scheme, provides the means for farmers with no future prospects in farming to leave with dignity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the Government has taken into account criticisms of the existing Rural Adjustment Scheme, which was introduced in 1988, in making the changes to the Scheme that are presented in this Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The 1988 Scheme contained more devolved arrangements than previous Rural Adjustment Schemes. This had the advantage of greater flexibility and it allowed the State Rural Adjustment Authorities to respond to local conditions and local needs. The Scheme also provided an avenue to respond to drought and downturn through measures such as the Debt Reconstruction with Interest Subsidy and the Crop Planting Scheme. Although this flexibility has been very valuable and has allowed the Government to respond quickly to the needs of the farm sector as they have arisen, successive amendments to the 1988 Scheme have increased the emphasis on assistance rather than structural adjustment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The changes to the Scheme outlined in this Bill will restore a strong structural adjustment focus. They follow a comprehensive review by independent consultants and extensive consultations with the States and the farm sector.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new arrangements will be introduced on 1 January 1993. There will be a focus on improved farm productivity, profitability and sustainability through structural adjustment and more effective management of the farm business. The new Scheme will still allow the Government to respond to crises, but in a consistent, structured way rather than through ad hoc policy changes. The provisions for exceptional circumstances will allow us to respond quickly and appropriately to severe downturns without undermining the direction and purpose of the Scheme as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is intended that the Rural Adjustment Scheme should support the commercial financial system rather than act to usurp or compete with commercial institutions. The Government's expectation is that State Rural Adjustment Authorities will work in cooperation with farmers, their financial advisers and financiers, and rural counsellors in the assessment of the financial situation of farmers, and in the provision of appropriate financial packages.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In normal circumstances, eligible farmers will be able to obtain interest rate subsidies of up to 50 per cent on commercial finance, to enhance the productivity, sustainability and profitability of their businesses. Farmers will also be able to obtain grants to improve their skills and to assist with the cost of obtaining financial, planning and other advice relating to their farm business. Such financial assistance will be funded on the basis of the Commonwealth contributing 90 per cent of the assistance and the States contributing ten per cent. This funding arrangement will also apply to agreed State administration costs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where exceptional circumstances such as severe drought or substantial commodity price downturns are found to exist, interest subsidies may be extended beyond 50 per cent, with the Commonwealth and the States sharing the costs of the assistance above 50 per cent equally.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the operation of the Scheme, the Commonwealth will provide sufficient funds as working capital to those States which do not have adequate reserves. Thereafter, payment to the States will be on a quarterly acquittals basis. This will ensure greater accountability of Commonwealth funds.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As indicated, the States have the important role of administering the Scheme and this is appropriate because of their knowledge of their farmers' circumstances and requirements. In their administration, they will need to be aware of the objectives of the Rural Adjustment Scheme as spelt out in this Bill. The Minister will also be negotiating an agreement with the States on the operation of the Scheme, and they will be required to administer it within policy guidelines that the Commonwealth will develop in consultation with the States.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In order to continue to improve the effectiveness of the Rural Adjustment Scheme, the Government believes it is necessary for there to be strategic oversight of the Scheme and its operations. This will allow the Scheme to be adjusted according to changing circumstances and ensure that it addresses national objectives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A Rural Adjustment Scheme Advisory Council will be established to provide advice to the Minister on the operations of the Scheme from a national and strategic perspective. It will recommend to the Minister an on-going three-year strategic plan and a proposed annual program for the Rural Adjustment Scheme. The Council will also provide advice to the Minister on the appropriate level of funding for the Scheme and the appropriate level of funding as between States under the Scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A significant function of the Council will be to provide advice to the Minister, on request, as to whether exceptional circumstances are affecting farmers and whether additional support is required in those circumstances. This would include advice on the types and terms of support which should be provided.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In undertaking its functions, the Council will consult with interested parties, including the States. It will be able to establish specialist sub-committees to assist in its work.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Council will be required to submit an annual report to the Minister on its operations. This report is to include information on the operations of the Rural Adjustment Scheme and will be tabled in Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Council will consist of up to eight Ministerial appointees. The members will include a representative of the National Farmers' Federation, a representative of the Commonwealth, at least one representative of the States, and up to three persons selected for their expertise in farm management, financial administration, training, economics and sustainable agriculture. The Minister will consult with the States regarding their representation on the Council.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the new Rural Adjustment Scheme will support those farmers with good prospects for long-term profitability to increase their productivity and sustainability. In a competitive environment where farmers are faced with the challenge of constantly improving productivity, the Government believes that taxpayers' money is best invested in those farmers who have the capacity to make the most of Government financial support and to become independent of that support within a reasonable time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For those farmers without future prospects in farming, enhanced farm exit provisions will be introduced. These include an increased re-establishment grant of $45,000 under the Rural Adjustment Scheme for eligible farmers who decide to leave the sector. The grant is available subject to an assets test on the sale of their productive assets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Farm Household Support Scheme, which I mentioned earlier, will replace the household support provisions of Part C of the existing Rural Adjustment Scheme and will provide support for farmers who are unable to access commercial finance to meet daily family requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, it is intended that the Scheme will be reviewed after four years and will come to an end after eight years. This will provide time for farmers to adjust to the requirements of individual risk management and increased self reliance which will be the hallmarks of the successful farmer in the 1990s and beyond.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the Bill to honourable senators and present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">STATES GRANTS (RURAL ADJUSTMENT) AMENDMENT BILL 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill amends several provisions of the current Rural Adjustment Scheme, which was introduced in January 1989.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Rural Adjustment Scheme as it operates at present provides financial support to farmers for a range of purposes, including the purchase of land and equipment, as well as through carry on finance for farmers in short term financial difficulties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, we are all aware that a large number of farmers are suffering from severe and prolonged drought, particularly in the western districts of New South Wales and south western Queensland. However, the carry on finance available under Part B of the current Rural Adjustment Scheme has not proved sufficient to meet the needs of these farmers. With this in mind, the Government allocated 14 million dollars in the Budget to support these drought stricken farmers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To enable immediate access to this assistance, the provisions of the Rural Adjustment Scheme Agreement have been amended by agreement between the relevant State and Territory Ministers and the Commonwealth. The New South Wales and Queensland Ministers of Agriculture have agreed to all three amendments, and as from 1 September 1992 the Rural Adjustment Scheme Authorities in each State began assessing applications for this assistance and advancing grants.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is now appropriate to bring these amendments before the Commonwealth Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These amendments to the Agreement specify that finance shall be made available so that farmers may acquire livestock, restructure debt, improve productivity and for carry on purposes. Commonwealth funds may be used to pay no more than 75 per cent of interest subsidies, but each State may choose to pay the remaining 25 per cent to provide for a subsidy to cover the whole interest bill of the farmer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 21 September 1992 the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy announced a new set of farm adjustment and assistance measures that promote a more productive and profitable farm sector and provide improved assistance to farm families suffering hardship. These measures will be incorporated in the new Rural Adjustment Scheme which will be introduced on 1 January 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The drought assistance measures I have announced today will contribute significantly to the effectiveness of the current Rural Adjustment Scheme and they will reappear in the new Rural Adjustment Scheme in a broader format. Exceptional circumstances, not just drought conditions, will be provided for, removing the need for ad hoc responses to particular circumstances and ensuring that any assistance provided is consistent with the Government's overall rural policy approach.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new Rural Adjustment Scheme will address the pressure exerted by a range of circumstances such as drought, flood and economic downturn that cause particular hardship. This will be done in a consistent manner and one that has been agreed beforehand with State governments. As well as responding to the plight of farmers in New South Wales and Queensland, the assistance provided through these amendments will provide a demonstration of how the new National Drought Policy will operate, through the Rural Adjustment Scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the Bill to the Honourable Senators and present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">FARM HOUSEHOLD SUPPORT BILL 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the Government has recognised the problems in the rural sector associated with structural adjustment and to address these, we have refocussed the Rural Adjustment Scheme on productivity improvement, and long term sustainable profitability.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We also recognise that there are a number of farmers who have no long term prospects in farming, and consequently have not been able to obtain commercial carry on finance. Many need support simply to put food on the table.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new Farm Household Support scheme is therefore targeted at providing support to this group of farmers who are unable to access carry on finance and require assistance in meeting the day-to-day living expenses of the farm family.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the Rural Adjustment Scheme is concerned with the farm as a business enterprise and is focused on productivity and profitability, the Farm Household Support Scheme is concerned with the welfare of the family. The Government recognises that, although it has a responsibility to facilitate the adjustment of the farm sector and improve productivity, it also has a responsibility to the people engaged in farming as families and individuals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We do not want to see needy farmers or their families suffer because they miss out on standard welfare payments because of the size of their asset bases. Standard assets tests as applied to other welfare payments are not appropriate for a number of reasons and this is one of the issues addressed by the introduction of Farm Household Support.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new scheme will ensure that the revised Rural Adjustment Scheme with its sharper adjustment and productivity focus is complemented by a more generous and broader household support component. This means that the support requirements of all farmers will be met. Farm Household Support replaces the Household Support provision of Part C of the old RAS.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislation is within the Primary Industries and Energy portfolio and will be administered by the Department of Social Security (DSS) on an agency basis. Administration by DSS has the advantage of a network of established offices throughout rural Australia at which the farmer will be able to apply for Farm Household Support. To facilitate the smooth operation of the new scheme, Farm Household Support has been designed to be administratively as close as possible to schemes with which DSS officers are already familiar.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Farm Household Support payment will be income tested to ensure that it is targeted at those in genuine financial hardship and a non-farm assets test will also be applied.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have excluded farm assets from the assets test in recognition of the asset-rich/income-poor status of many farmers. Our concern with assets is simply to ensure that we are not providing support to families who have significant off-farm assets and are able to support themselves independently.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Farm Household Support Scheme will fulfil the family support needs of two groups who are unable to access commercial finance:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.those who have taken the decision to leave the sector will receive support while they sell the property; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.those who believe they have a future in the industry and wish to obtain carry on finance to help them weather a bad patch.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In both situations, Farm Household Support will be available as a loan for up to two years. To assist those who take the often difficult decision to leave in that two year period, the first nine months of Farm Household Support received will be converted to a grant. They may also be eligible for the re-establishment grant through the Rural Adjustment Scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Farmers will not need to offer their property for sale in order to receive Farm Household Support. However, special incentives are available for farmers to sell quickly and leave.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We wish to encourage those who cannot exist on their farm without government help to seriously consider leaving farming. To increase the incentive to leave quickly the full nine month grant is cashed out if the farmer leaves in under that time. That is, farmers who complete the sale of their property within the grant period of 9 months will receive the balance of the grant amount as a lump sum. The cash out will be provided at the maximum payable Jobsearch Allowance rate to increase the incentive to sell within the nine month period.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Farmers who do not leave at the end of two years, whether through a return to profitability or reluctance to leave, will not qualify for the grant period and will have to repay all of the Farm Household Support received.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Farmers will only be required to submit an application for Farm Household Support with the Department of Social Security every six months and the rate of Farm Household Support set at that visit will be current until the next six monthly review. However, the rate will not be set in concrete. Farm Household Support recipients can seek a reassessment of their entitlement at any time due to changed circumstances, such as a greatly reduced income.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Farm Household Support will be available at the equivalent of the Jobsearch Allowance to which the farmer would be entitled, taking into account their income and off-farm assets. However, as Farm Household Support is a loan after the first nine months, individual farmers will have the flexibility to nominate how much of the allowance, up to this entitlement level, they feel they need or wish to take on as new debt.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Jobsearch Allowance will still be available to farmers  and their spouses under the normal and hardship provisions. Some families will find themselves eligible for both schemes and will need to decide whether they wish to access Farm Household Support or Jobsearch Allowance. Farm families who choose to access Jobsearch Allowance will lose their access to the Rural Adjustment Scheme re-establishment grant once the farmer or his or her spouse has received nine months of Jobsearch Allowance payments. This nine month period will be calculated from the introduction of the Farm Household Support scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With the introduction of Farm Household Support, the modified provisions of the Jobsearch Allowance which were introduced for farmers on 1 December 1991 will no longer be available to new applicants. Those already on modified Jobsearch Allowance will continue to receive their allowance until they are no longer eligible or until the modified Jobsearch Allowance is sunsetted in December 1993. They will have the option of transferring to Farm Household Support.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An extensive publicity campaign will be run by my Department in the lead up to the introduction of Farm Household Support to ensure that farmers are aware of their options and of the implications of selecting Farm Household Support or Jobsearch Allowance or transferring between the two.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Current recipients of household assistance under Part C of the old Rural Adjustment Scheme will be transferred automatically to Farm Household Support when it is introduced, but they will be treated as a separate category to ensure that they are not disadvantaged by the transfer. In fact, this group will be receiving a bonus three month grant period over that offered to them under the present Part C.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If Part C recipients wish to access the flexibility under Farm Household Support of determining the rate at which they wish to be paid, they can opt to transfer to Farm Household Support, in which case they will be treated as new Farm Household Support applicants. Time spent on Part C will be subtracted from the two year period available under Farm Household Support.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, Farm Household Support presents the soft edge of the changes to the Rural Adjustment Scheme. It provides a safety net for those farmers who are unable to access commercial finance or Rural Adjustment Scheme support and need help in meeting their daily living expenses. At the same time it does not undermine the achievement of our goal of a productive and sustainable farm sector. Farm Household Support will provide farmers who have an uncertain future with a breathing space in which to consider their options. If they decide to sell and leave farming there is a generous package of support available, up to $55,000 in grants for farmers eligible for the re-establishment grant.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The cost of Farm Household Support will be met from within the forward estimates for the Rural Adjustment Scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The combination of Farm Household Support and the Rural Adjustment Scheme ensure that the support needs of all groups of Australian farmers will be met while the sector  adjusts to the challenges of improving productivity in the face of declining terms of trade and corrupt world markets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the Bill to the honourable senators and present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">INCOME EQUALISATION DEPOSITS LAWS AMENDMENTS BILL 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill amends several provisions of the current Income Equalisation Deposit (IED) Scheme which was introduced in July 1989. These amendments follow a review undertaken by the Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is encouraging the adoption of sustainable development principles in farm management. This will involve producers improving their financial planning and risk management skills, including managing for drought. To assist them, the Government has introduced improvements in its policies and in the links between its policies. These changes include an improved Income Equalisation Deposit Scheme. There are also important links with the new Rural Adjustment Scheme, the National Drought Policy and National Landcare program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What we are doing here is going further down the track of assisting farmers to fend for themselves by building cash reserves. In achieving this, we must equip farmers with the necessary tools.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe that an attractive IED scheme can go a long way towards assisting and encouraging farmers to build cash reserves for use during downturns. The improved IED scheme including the new Farm Management Bond, will play a key role in doing this by assisting farmers with their management of financial risk.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The minimum amount that can be deposited has been reduced from $5,000 to $1,000. This will allow the small to medium farmer to put aside a small amount frequently, rather than wait until he or she is able to put together what would be, for some, a relatively large amount. It could be regarded as similar to making a deposit in a saving account&mdash;making a provision for the future.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The maximum amount that can be held in IEDs has been increased to $300,000 from $250,000. The figure of $250,000 applied when the current Scheme was introduced in July 1989. The increase to $300,000 will enable farmers to maintain deposits in real terms. In the main, the large farmer has the resources to make provision for downturns without Government assistance and, of course,  many of them do so. However, deposits of $300,000 will provide a valuable reserve for all farmers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a further encouragement for farmers to increase their reserves, depositors will be able, if they wish, to reinvest interest earned on deposits. The option to reinvest interest is a standard practice in the commercial sector and I believe that farmers should be able to take advantage of this in respect of IEDs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">IEDs are deductible from taxable primary production income, but are included in taxable income when they are withdrawn. In the current situation, when funds are withdrawn a withholding tax of 29 per cent is applied unless the depositor self assesses otherwise. My view is that farmers would, on average, be in a lower tax bracket than 29 per cent as they would be more likely to be withdrawing funds during times of hardship and low incomes. This would, in particular, be the case in respect of farm management bonds as they can only be drawn on in times of hardship. Accordingly, the withholding rate has been reduced to 20 per cent. The withholding tax rate is changed by regulation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As part of the new IED scheme, we have provided for the introduction of Farm Management Bonds (FMBs). These bonds will provide additional encouragement for genuine farmers to build cash reserves for use during contingencies such as drought.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Interest is paid on the investment component of the deposit. For ordinary IEDs this is deemed to be 61 per cent, however, for the new FMB the investment component will be 80 per cent. The improved return on FMBs is intended to encourage farmers to build reserves for use during hardship arising from natural events such as drought, fire, flood, etc, and hardship arising from significant falls in commodity prices.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a need to ensure that FMBs are used for the purpose that is intended. In order to achieve this, farmers, when applying to withdraw funds from FMBs will have to provide evidence in support of the grounds on which they wish to do so. However, they will still be able to withdraw funds even if the circumstances I have previously mentioned do not apply, but the deposit in respect of the amount they wish to withdraw will be regarded to have been an ordinary IED from the date of deposit. The implications of this are that interest will be paid on 61 per cent and not 80 per cent of the deposit and excess interest paid or reinvested will have to be repaid or deducted from the funds returned to the farmer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In respect to commodity prices, a request for withdrawal must be accompanied by evidence of prices received for sales of commodities comprising the major part of the depositors income for the last four years. In determining whether or not a significant fall in prices has occurred, there is an assumption that unless special circumstances apply, a significant price fall occurs when the average of prices received in the year of application is at least 25 per cent lower than the average of the prices received for the previous three years. However, this will not restrict the evidence, information or the considerations to be taken into account when deciding if a depositor is suffering hardship arising from a significant fall in commodity prices.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The existing legislation contains a provision whereby depositors, when requesting a withdrawal on grounds of financial hardship within 12 months of deposit, can appeal against a determination to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. This will be extended to determinations made in respect of requests for withdrawals of FMBs made on the ground of natural events, significant falls in commodity prices and financial hardship caused by other factors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The existing legislation also provides that additional information may be sought within one month of the date of receipt of the request to assist in a decision being taken and this will also be extended to FMBs. There is an additional  provision that a decision must be taken within a month of receipt of the further information or within two months of the original request to withdraw, whichever is the sooner, irrespective of whether or not the additional information has been received. In order to correct this anomaly, the provision will be altered so that a decision does not have to be taken until the additional information has been supplied. This will have the effect of preventing an Administrative Appeals Tribunal review taking place before the additional information has been supplied.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I have already mentioned, only genuine farmers will be able to make deposits in FMBs. This will mean that only those with taxable non-farm income of less than $50,000 will be able to deposit funds in FMBs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The farm sector faces certain risks that other sectors of the economy are not exposed to and I believe it is appropriate that farmers should be assisted in managing those risks. A limit of $80,000 on the amount that can be deposited in FMBs will be sufficient to allow farmers to do this.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some 3,500 farmers have funds in IEDs. They will be able to directly transfer them into FMBs at any time provided they meet the eligibility requirements of FMBs. This will ensure that existing owners of IEDs are not disadvantaged.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the changes to the IED scheme provided for in this Bill are part of an integrated set of policies, including changes to the Rural Adjustment Scheme, the National Drought Policy, the Farm Household Support Scheme and others which the Government has put in place to build a more resilient, sustainable, self reliant and internationally competitive rural sector.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the Bill to Honourable Senators and present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Higher Education Funding Act 1988, in accordance with agreed triennial funding arrangements and to reflect changed funding arrangements agreed between the Commonwealth, States and higher education institutions which will have the effect of increasing the autonomy and flexibility of higher education institutions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The present Act provides for Commonwealth higher education funding to be provided to universities through payments made to State Governments. In the context of the 1991 review of Commonwealth-State relations, all Governments agreed that the funding mechanism for higher education should reflect the reality, that universities are part of a national system of higher education and the Commonwealth has primary responsibility for the public funding of that system. There was agreement that direct funding from the Commonwealth to higher education institutions is appropriate, to improve the accountability and transparency of the Commonwealth to the electorate. The Bill puts this change into effect. From 1993, higher education institutions will be paid direct by the Commonwealth, and institutions rather than the States will be directly accountable to the Commonwealth for the expenditure of grants.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To complement these arrangements and to assist in the accountability process, the Bill includes a statement of the Commonwealth's objectives in higher education. The Bill also provides for payment of higher education funds in limited instances to bodies other than higher education institutions where this best meets the objectives of the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These new arrangements for direct funding of higher education institutions are accompanied by improved consultative processes so that consideration of State needs and strategies becomes an integral part of the triennial planning cycle.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In accordance with these established triennial planning and funding processes, the Bill provides funds for higher education for 1995, the third year of the new funding triennium. In total, the Commonwealth has committed $4.7 billion to higher education in 1995. This amount takes into account the Government's decisions which I have just announced to provide, in 1995, some $23.6 million for additional student intakes and $274 million for capital purposes, as well as the $252 million for research  programs already committed. Provision is also made within the 1993-95 funding triennium for a $12 million increase in research grants funding in 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the Government announced in the 1992-93 Budget, from 1994 higher education capital grants are to be incorporated into institutions' general operating grants rather than allocated on a project by project basis. The Bill provides for this decision, as well as for the increased resources available in 1993 and 1994, announced in the Budget, to address higher education building infrastructure needs. The roll-in of capital funds will provide flexibility, financial stability and continuity for universities in their capital planning; students should benefit from improved capital facilities as universities are able to manage their resources more effectively.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The needs of institutions which are growing at extraordinary rates or which are experiencing significant development and need funds, for example, for new campuses are taken into account in a separate fund for special capital projects. This discretionary pool of funds will be available for allocation by the Commonwealth following consultation with the States and institutions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also reflects other Government decisions on higher education funding announced in its 1992 Budget, in particular the decision to support the establishment of a new open learning program in 1993. This program will open the door to tertiary education for many people currently without access through traditional arrangements. The program will have major advantages for people in rural and remote areas as well as for people with work or family commitments or disabilities which make access to on-campus courses difficult. Arrangements for the operation of this program are well under way and are designed to ensure the quality of open learning provision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also provides for an increase in the number of Australian Postgraduate Research Awards available to students annually from 1993, as announced in the Budget. This increase acknowledges that skilled personnel are critical to Australia's research and development efforts and responds to growing demand for awards.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some minor changes to the Higher Education Contribution Scheme (HECS) are included in the Bill, in particular the increased discount for up-front payment of HECS to apply from 1993, some additional exemptions from HECS so that student places funded by employers are put on the same footing as State-funded places, and some rationalisation of the Scheme to ensure that Australian tax-payers do not have to meet the higher education costs of certain groups of students who may never earn an income in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also includes protection for the rights and  responsibilities of higher education institutions to make their own decisions, independent of Government interference, on the provision of services and amenities for their students. Student organisations, which provide a wide range of services to their members&mdash;counselling, sporting, health and careers services, for example&mdash;are funded mainly by a services and amenities fee collected from students by institutions on behalf of organisations representing the interests of students generally. In the past, some States have interfered with the rights of institutions to make their own decisions about imposing or collecting these fees. The Bill provides an avenue for the Commonwealth to make up any shortfall in revenue experienced by an institution as a result of a decision of this kind by a State. Consequential amendment of the States Grants (General Purposes) legislation will be required at a later date to ensure that the Commonwealth can subsequently recover this money from a State if necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also includes routine cost supplementation for Commonwealth grants to higher education. In total, the Commonwealth is committed to spending some $13.6 billion on higher education over the 1993-95 triennium. This level of funding and the improved funding arrangements put in place represent a major commitment to the enhancement Australia's higher education system in the interests of present and prospective students and the nation as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill and commend the Bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">STATES GRANTS (SCHOOLS ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill proposes to amend the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Act 1988 to provide for supplementation of funds appropriated for schools programs for 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill extends eligibility for the English as a Second Language Program to dependants of certain categories of temporary entry permit holders who are in Australia on visas rather than on temporary entry permits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill provides for additional funds under the Award Restructuring Assistance Program in 1992 to meet the Commonwealth's share of additional costs associated with the increase in the salary benchmark for 4 year trained teachers to $38,000 per year and with the introduction of Advanced Skills Teacher positions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill appropriates additional funds for schools programs for 1992 in line with current supplementation arrangements. Total funding for schools programs for 1992 is estimated to be $2,662.5 million, comprising $2,082.8 million for general recurrent grants, $307.4 million for capital grants and $272.3 million for targeted and joint programs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the Bill to the Senate and present the Explanatory Memorandum to this Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">STATES GRANTS (PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ASSISTANCE) BILL 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recognising this Government's responsibility for all Australians, the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Bill 1992 continues this Government's commitment to equity, quality and excellence in primary and secondary education in Australia. It secures funding for these purposes for the next funding period, 1993 to 1996, and provides for substantial increases in funding in 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth shares responsibility with the States for the quality of public education and is a partner with the States and parents in supporting private education. In both relationships it is concerned with improving educational outcomes so that young Australians can adapt better to changing economic, industrial and social circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill supersedes the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Act 1988 which authorised funding for the 1989 to 1992 funding period. The new title of the Bill more accurately reflects the Commonwealth's leadership role in primary and secondary education and its interest in educational activities that support improved outcomes, regardless of where they take place.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also gives effect to a number of measures announced in the context of, and subsequent to, the 1992-93 Budget.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the area of general recurrent funding, it provides for increases in per capita grant levels for all schools arising from the rollback of the Award Restructuring Assistance Program into general recurrent grants from 1993; for additional real increases in per capita grant levels for non-government schools in categories 5 to 12 in each year from 1993 to 1996 (guaranteed in legislation); and for maintenance in real terms of per capita grant levels for non-government schools in categories 1 to 4 and for government schools over the period 1993 to 1996 (also guaranteed in legislation).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From 1993, Average Government School Recurrent Costs will replace the Community Standard as the benchmark for general recurrent funding levels. Supplementation arrangements, formalised in legislation for the first time in 1993, will also reflect this change with all recurrent programs to be supplemented annually for the full annual movement in latest known Average Government School Recurrent Costs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Changes to be introduced through the Revised New Schools Policy will reduce the level of regulation of established non-government schools to allow these schools greater flexibility to plan their own development. The assessment provisions applying to new schools and schools undertaking certain changes in operation are to be strengthened.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill provides some $60 million in 1993 in additional capital grants for the refurbishment of government secondary schools and some $45 million in additional capital grants for non-government schools, with additional funds to be provided for non-government schools in subsequent years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These changes to general recurrent and capital funding will ensure that non-government schools will enjoy stability and security of funding over the next eight years, from a substantially increased funding base. This will enable schools to continue to respond to the growth in participation, to the agreed national curriculum framework and to the challenges emerging from recent reports on post compulsory education. The certainty of funding which the non-government sector has enjoyed over the past eight years, certainty which is now critical to the survival and success of a substantial non-government system, will continue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill embodies the Government's belief that education is not a toy to be played with at the whim of political ideologues. Education is too important to be the victim of misguided, free market ideology. Freedom of conscience is the issue here. This Bill will provide increased educational opportunities for millions of young Australians, within a funding framework which guarantees stability, security and certainty for government and non-government schools through to the next century.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also establishes the framework for the new National Equity Program for Schools. The proposed new broadbanding arrangements endorsed recently by the Australian Education Council and to be introduced from 1994 will provide for financial assistance under four elements focused on access, equity, incentives and national priorities. Subject to agreement with school authorities, new provisions giving effect to broadbanding from 1994 will be introduced in the 1993 Budget Session of Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the interim, in 1993 the provisions relating to education in English as a second language, special education, education in disadvantaged schools and schools in country areas, for students with disabilities and for projects enhancing literacy and learning have been  grouped together under Part 6 of the Bill to reflect this new structure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As part of the National Equity Program for Schools from 1993 the Government will also introduce grants for national projects to assist gifted and talented students and to improve the learning experiences of girls. The Students at Risk Program will continue in 1993 and will be extended to the non-government sector.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Funds appropriated by the Bill for the 1993 program year are estimated to total some $2,873.2 million, comprising some $2,180.0 million for general recurrent grants to government and non-government schools, $400.2 million for capital grants for government and non-government schools, $271.7 million for national equity programs, $16.5 million for the School Language Program and $4.8 million for other joint programs.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill will make amendments to the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967 to ensure that all persons working in the offshore petroleum industry in Commonwealth waters are protected by occupational health and safety legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Currently persons working in the industry offshore Western Australia and Queensland are not covered by occupational health and safety provisions. The Bill rectifies that situation. However, the provisions of the Bill will cease to apply once the relevant States move to extend the coverage of their occupational health and safety legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The occupational health and safety provisions in the Bill reflect similar provisions found in most State legislation and closely follow those in the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Act 1991. The occupational health and safety provisions in the Commonwealth OH&amp;S Act are modelled on existing State/Territory legislation. The Bill places a general duty of care on employers and employees alike to protect the health and safety of all those working in the offshore petroleum industry. It provides a framework within which employers and employees may co-operate to address health and safety issues in the workplace.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments will provide a framework at the workplace for the selection of employee health and safety representatives and the establishment of health and safety committees with employer and employee representation to facilitate co-operation in the protection of the health and safety of employees at work.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Standards on specific hazards may be included in regulations and codes of practice may be approved by the Designated Authority for the relevant adjacent area to give guidance to the industry on meeting obligations made by the occupational health and safety provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The provisions will be administered by the Designated Authority for the relevant adjacent area.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is indisputable that there is a need for a framework within which employers and employees co-operate to protect the health and safety of all those working in a potentially hazardous industry such as the offshore petroleum industry. The need was heightened by the major disaster which occurred on the Piper Alpha production platform in the UK sector of the North Sea in 1988. 167 lives were lost.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Government has responded comprehensively to this disaster and set up the Consultative Committee on Safety in the Offshore Petroleum Industry (COSOP). COSOP, consisting of State and Commonwealth government, union and industry representatives, was charged with assessing the findings from the UK inquiries and advising the Government on the future direction of offshore safety in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">COSOP's principal recommendations were:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the adoption of the "Safety Case" approach to offshore safety together with the progressive introduction of objective setting regulations to replace prescriptive requirements wherever possible;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the extension of occupational health and safety coverage, based on the relevant provisions of the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Act, to those offshore areas where no occupational health and safety provisions currently apply;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the establishment of a single point of contact and responsibility for offshore occupational health and safety matters in each State/NT; the adequate resourcing and training of authorities to enable them to effectively administer the new regime; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the establishment of a national incident data base.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These recommendations have been accepted by the Commonwealth and State/NT Governments, the petroleum industry and the unions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first element, the adoption of the "Safety Case" approach to offshore safety is already being implemented. Companies operating in Australian waters are now required by the offshore petroleum legislation to prepare Safety Cases for all platforms and floating production facilities for which either design commences or which commence operating after 1 July this year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Safety Case is a concept new to Australia for the management of hazardous industries. The principle has also been adopted in a draft Standard prepared by Worksafe for adoption by all jurisdictions by the end of 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The extension of occupational health and safety coverage to all offshore areas, which will be implemented by this Bill, is the second element of the Government's response.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further elements of COSOP's recommendations will be implemented over the next 12 to 24 months. The Government has made available in the Budget $379,000 in 1992-93, with further sums in the following financial years to ensure implementation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The implementation of COSOP's recommendations represents a substantial change in approach to the management of safety in the offshore petroleum industry. They are designed to diminish the situations and conditions that can lead to accidents occurring and will result in improved safety conditions for all employees on Australia's offshore petroleum installations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They will also demonstrate the way in which governments, unions and industry can work together to further the national interest.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">None of the amendments in this Bill have any significant financial impact.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the Bill Honourable Senators and present the Explanatory Memorandum.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am happy to make a short statement. This morning, I said that I was interested to hear the reaction of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Evans) to the report that the ANC, to which the Government gives taxpayers' money, had been guilty of torture. I said that I was interested to hear that his reaction was:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>I simply want to correct the use of the word `tasteless'. The Minister sent me a note saying that he would like me to apologise. I am delighted to correct the record, because what he actually said was that he had a distaste for torture. I said that he had said it was tasteless.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We dealt at some length with the China matter this morning. I do not think that there is any necessity to go over that ground. I simply make the point that the contest this morning was an assertion by Senator Bishop that I had used a particular word. I responded with some vigour that I did not use that word. I said that it was an absurd reference to make in the context of allegations and evidence as serious as that, and that I was sure that I did not use that word. Senator Bishop said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any check of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> will show that it was used.</PARA>
<PARA>There are a number of references of that kind. It is obvious what the word `distaste' means, particularly in the context in which I used it, having referred in a sentence before to the behaviour in question being totally indefensible and having referred to it again two sentences later, where I said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But I am very clear in my own mind that it is, I repeat, absolutely indefensible.</PARA>
<PARA>In reference to some talking points, I said in the middle of the same paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I did see some talking points that were prepared, and I think I approved them, making very clear our distaste for the activities in question.</PARA>
<PARA>It is obvious that `distaste' used in that context means something very much more than `the behaviour in question is not tasteful'. Any reading of any dictionary will demonstrate that. It implies repugnance, repellence and language of that kind. That is the nature of the expression that I used. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am indebted to Senator Bishop for acknowledging that the record is different from that which was asserted. She had no choice in the matter because <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> proves that beyond doubt. However, I am not indebted to her for failing to apologise for what was a very clear misrepresentation of my position and one which, moreover, she has only made worse by the vehemence with which she continues to assert her position. Getting Senator Bishop to change her spots is a labour of Hercules and not one that I am inclined to attempt on this occasion. Perhaps we can now move on. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before lunch, I was asking some questions in relation to the Embassy in Beirut. The Minister said basically, as I understood him, that on a general assessment, taking into account advice from Britain and Canada, those involved felt there was not a level of security which would allow the Australian Embassy to be reopened at this time but that that had not been a decision made on the basis of any specific security assessment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following down that line, it appeared that the Minister was basically saying that security could be reasonably assured but that it would be at some considerable cost because of the need for around-the-clock surveillance, et cetera. Has the Minister and the Government assessed what the cost of reopening that mission would be, particularly in terms of additional security?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bearing in mind that it would be principally manned by officials who are currently based in Damascus, as its principal role would be an immigration one, I presume that there would not be a great increase in overall cost as far as personnel is concerned in reopening the Embassy in Beirut, other than costs that would be associated with the security aspect. That is why I am asking the Minister whether an assessment has been made of what additional costs would be incurred in putting in place a regime offering satisfactory security. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, I am able to confirm that we did announce through Mr Hand on 1 October a proposal to establish an informal Australian Government office in Beirut to assist with immigration and consular services in Lebanon of the kind I mentioned earlier. The premises are presently being negotiated. They will involve three interconnected rooms at a hotel. A lease is being drawn up in relation to that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Duty statements are being prepared and we hope that that will be established as soon as possible with the opening of the office early next year. I am told that the exercise has been welcomed by the Lebanese authorities, although obviously we would all prefer to be able to regularise the status of that office and have a proper full scale mission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem does continue to be the security one. It is not quite true to say there has been no assessment of the security. The security has not been assessed by sending someone especially over from AFP or otherwise, but a judgment has been made about the security situation. Certainly, a lot of discussions have been held with the United States, and Britain and France as well, on security matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a demonstration of the kind of costs that can be involved in this, the United States mission has presently 23 US-based personnel and 435 locally engaged staff, of whom approximately 300 are security personnel. Of course, it may well be thought that the United States is more comparatively vulnerable than an Australian presence would be, but nonetheless, on any view, it would be an extremely expensive business to provide the around-the-clock guards and other security of living places, travel and so on that in our judgment would be necessary to protect A-based staff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not sure that any precise calculation has been made. I can check that and, depending on the assumptions one makes about ratio of security staff to particular personnel, all I can say is that the sum involved was manifestly larger than we could afford within the present budgetary constraints we are operating under so far as posts are concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a matter of weighing cost against the security factor. One takes into account the security issue in its own right, because one does not want to put unnecessarily Australian personnel at risk, but also very much part of the calculation is the financial cost involved of producing an acceptable level of security for such personnel. That cost, as I have explained to the Lebanese Government and the Lebanese community in Australia, is simply not one that we can be reasonably expected to bear at this stage. </PARA>

The figures are around somewhere of the individual components. I have already said that I will seek to get them out. It is a matter of a prima facie assumption being made that a level of security of anything like that which would be needed, even if not the same ratios as for the United States, would nonetheless simply be unmanageable within present budgetary constraints. It is a self-evident proposition. Once one reaches a certain cost level, it is pointless worrying about how much more than that it might involve. A certain minimum is too much.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might say the information provided by the Department relating to the questions asked in hearings was tabled here in the Senate only 48 hours ago. I am looking at the material on page 75. That is the first of a series of questions, and the questions that were taken on notice related to the employment of a Thai national, married to an Australian, who had lodged a complaint for sexual harassment against the head of mission, Ambassador Butler. This matter had come to our attention because it seemed that the matter was being swept under the carpet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Information was brought to me from a number of sources. At no stage have we identified the woman concerned. That would be totally unfair, and the only reason Ambassador Butler is identified is that he chose to go on the record. That is the reason his name is on the record; he put it there. Many questions were asked about this because of the strange occurrence that the husband of the woman who made the complaint was shipped home. It is my understanding that he was not given the reasons for his shipment home, other than to go home for consultation, until he arrived in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second part of my question&mdash;and in just a moment I will deal with some of the material supplied by the Department&mdash;related to an investigation of Ambassador Butler by the fraud prevention and discipline section concerning failure to acquit certain accounts, as I understand it. I think as we go through the answers we will see what picture will emerge there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To begin with the matter of the woman's sexual harassment: my concern was always this; not to determine the facts of the matter but to ensure that she gets justice. I asked for a job description of the position she held. I have it. The job description is PN6138; she is a secretary and her duties are to perform secretarial, typing and clerical duties for the consular and administrative section and like duties, as distinct from the head of the mission, who, of course, is a full plenipotentiary; a very powerful man. As I have said before, we are looking at a master-servant relationship. I asked for the letters of advice that were given by the Department to the woman concerned, because I wanted to see firstly who had signed them. It seemed to me to be quite unjust that Mr Forrester, the man who had recalled the husband, also had carriage of investigating the wife. It seems to me to be a very strange set of circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The information that has been given in answer to my question is this. I said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I want to see the form of the letter that she wrote&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>because I had been advised that she had written a letter&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and I want to know who helped her write it. Secondly, I want to see your letter to her again with her particulars erased; and I want to see whether, in the same letter, you advised her that she could make a formal complaint to the Secretary as well as to an external agency which could cost her money. Can I have those two documents, please, Minister?</PARA>
<PARA>The response that I have says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Legal advice has been sought in this matter. The advice is that the complainant's letter should not be released without the consent of the complainant and the person against whom the complaint is made.</PARA>
<PARA>The plot thickens! The response continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department does not have information in regard to who, if anyone, helped the complainant write the letter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two letters from the Department in which advice was provided to the complainant in the terms of Senator Bishop's question. It would be appropriate in the terms of privacy&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>Whose privacy?&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">considerations to release the following extracts relevant to the question.</PARA>
<PARA>There is one letter written on 12 August and, of course, there is no signature provided. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would like to remind you again of your right to take up this matter formally in terms of paragraph 3.4 of the Public Service Commission's guidelines on eliminating sexual harassment. My own view&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>says the anonymous writer&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">is that given that one of the parties is a very senior officer of the Department&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>he is a bit special&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">it would be appropriate for any formal investigation to be conducted by an external agency such as the Merit Protection and Review Agency under Section 50 of the Merit Protection (Australian Government Employees) Act. This is an option suggested for such cases in the PSC guidelines and one which would be supported by the Department.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So here we have it. She has the right to make a formal complaint to the Department but, `oh no; it's a very senior officer of the Department. For heaven's sake, we can't do it here'. I asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) to be responsible and he said he would be.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I continue to believe that, if you wish to lodge a formal complaint, it should be lodged with an external agency, for reasons I have outlined to you earlier.</PARA>
<PARA>That is, Mr Butler is a very senior officer. That is the reason given. Quite plainly, I can only see, by reading between the lines, that the complainant has come back and said, `But I don't want to do that' and the Department has come back at her and said, `Well, you're going to have to do it'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will go back and find the time, the date and the place when the Minister said he would take responsibility in this matter because, as we know, ambassadors are appointed&mdash;this is going to be relevant to all three ambassadors: Butler, Burke and Boucher&mdash;by the Governor-General in Executive Council on the recommendation of the Minister. Therefore, it is the Minister's responsibility. So I ask the Minister: what has he personally done to find out whether or not justice has been done in this case and how far has it progressed to his personal knowledge, as he agreed to take responsibility?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As to how far the matter has progressed, the informal conciliation process conducted by Mr Forrester was not successful, as I think I told the Estimates Committee.

It does remain open to the complainant, as has always been the case, to lodge a formal complaint.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have consistently advised the complainant, as Senator Bishop has just pointed out, that if she wished to lodge a formal complaint she should approach an external agency with the appropriate investigative powers. The reason for that, if I might interpolate in answer to that criticism at this point, is the language of section 5.5 of the Public Service Commission personnel management guidelines on the elimination of sexual harassment. Section 5.5 of those guidelines states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Especially where senior staff are involved it may be desirable for the investigation to be carried out by someone from outside of the area, e.g. someone from another office of the department, or another department, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission or the Merit Protection and Review Agency.</PARA>
<PARA>The judgment that has been made by the Department, which I endorse, is that, given the sensitivities, the degree of difficulty of this matter and the degree of publicity it has attracted, not to mention the efforts of Senator Bishop to allege bad faith by various people in the Department in this matter, it would be appropriate for the matter to be dealt with by an external agency if it is to be further pursued. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The complainant has been advised that the departmental workplace harassment contact officers remain available to meet with her if she so wishes. She was contacted as recently as 16 October and invited to a meeting in the Department to go over the options available to her. Those options, I may again mention for the record, are spelt out in detail in paragraph 3.4 of the Public Service Commission guidelines. The options are described as extending to, among other things, lodging a grievance directly to the Secretary under Public Service regulation 83 and, if not satisfied, request that the grievance be referred to the Merit Protection and Review Agency under Public Service regulation 84. My understanding is that no such grievance has been so lodged. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is a matter for the complainant, not for the Department. The complainant may also directly approach the Merit Protection and Review Agency under section 50 of the Merit Protection (Australian Government Employees) Act, lodge a complaint with the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission under the Sex Discrimination Act, and seek advice from a lawyer as to possible remedial action under the larger civil or perhaps even criminal law. They are the options; they have been communicated to her on a number of occasions and that is where the matter rests.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The complainant has advised us, I am told, that she is still considering the options available to her to resolve the matter and is not yet ready to inform my Department whether or not she wishes to pursue the matter further. I do not think it is remotely appropriate for this matter to be further pursued by the Department, let alone me, in that particular environment that I have just described. The options are available to her; it is entirely up to her to determine how she wants to move from now on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Might I just address two other matters: first, the opening salvo from Senator Bishop about the job description for the woman in question and the master-servant relationship that is necessarily involved in a job relationship of that kind. I simply again make the point, as I have on numerous occasions, that the realities of that kind of relationship do cut both ways. Yes, on the one hand, that might well be thought as creating an intimidating situation in which harassment might be thought to be able to be got away with. On the other hand, equally, the existence of that power relationship can be applied in a quite different way because of the nature and extent of the reputation that is at stake, the significance of that reputation, the desire of the person to maintain it and the ease with which that reputation can be brought into question simply by an allegation being made, one being put in the public domain or pursued in the public domain in the way in which this one has been. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So there are, as we all know simply from common knowledge of human nature, two ways in which one can look at this situation. It is simply quite inappropriate for Senator Bishop to make the continuing assumption that she has that the problems about this whole affair lie only on one side of the equation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, on the subject of the letters that were the subject of our reply and which appear in extracted form on page 79 of the additional information supplied, those letters were over the signature, I am told, of Mr Forrester. I do not think there needs to be any confidentiality maintained about that, but there is a question of very real confidentiality involved in releasing the letters in question without the consent both of the complainant and of the person against whom the complaint was made. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One matter raised with great indignation by Senator Bishop was the suggestion that it was somehow outrageous that there could be some requirement of consent by the person against whom the complaint was made. In this respect, I simply make the point that, under privacy principle No. 11 of the Privacy Act 1988, personal information&mdash;and this is of a kind which presumably contains material in the nature of allegations of the kind that are in issue here&mdash;shall not be released to a person, body or agency unless one or more of the exceptions set out in those principles apply. Briefly these are:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) the individual concerned is reasonably likely to have been aware, or made aware under Principle 2, that information of that kind is usually passed to that person, body or agency;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) the individual concerned has consented to the disclosure;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c). . . the disclosure is necessary to prevent. . . threat to the life or health. . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) the disclosure is required or authorised by or under law; or</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(e) the disclosure is reasonably necessary for the enforcement of the criminal law. . . </PARA>
<PARA>It is the judgment of the Department&mdash;I think we all found on legal advice&mdash;that none of those exceptions is applicable in this particular case. That is the reason why the answer has been given to Senator Bishop in the form that it has. Fundamental privacy considerations are involved here and it would not seem appropriate, let alone within the terms of the Privacy Act, for any exception to be made to the prohibition against governmental release as to those matters. If the grievance persists&mdash;and this is the nub of the issue, of course&mdash;it is perfectly open to the complainant to pursue that grievance in a whole variety of other ways that I have already mentioned. </PARA>

But he did not bother to read that there must always be an adherence to the principles of natural justice. How can anyone expect logic or justice to be relevant to a man who is as intemperate as this? He has stood there and basically told us, in a most incoherent manner, that quite simply he does not give a damn. He has Mr Forrester doing his work for him.

He undertook language training until 31 October 1991 and commenced duty on 1 November 1991; and they both came home in March 1992. Something very funny has been going on in that embassy. </PARA>

But when her husband was recalled, as she was a locally engaged employee she came back with him and lost her employment. I ask the Minister: is she eligible to make a complaint under section 83 of the Public Service Act now that she has resigned because she wanted to come back to Australia with her husband who was recalled by Mr Forrester, the person who was in charge of her case? Is she eligible to make a complaint under section 83?</PARA>

The fact that I may or may not have had access to it as a member of that part of Estimates Committee B which dealt with Finance and Treasury and not Foreign Affairs and Trade is another question&mdash;and that is a matter that the Minister would not have countenanced.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the important point is this: I asked for the material; the reason the Minister has given me that he cannot let me have the material is that he would first have to have the permission of both parties involved. Now we hear that nobody has ever asked those people whether that material could be made available to me. Has it occurred to the Minister that this woman is frightened? Has it occurred to the Minister that she is intimidated by the fact that her argument is with a head of mission, a full plenipotentiary?  Mr Forrester had the power to bring back her husband, and did so; he had the power, therefore, for her to lose her job as well. Mr Forrester wrote and said, in very plain language:</PARA>

<PARA>`I' being a First Assistant Secretary&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that, if you wish to lodge a formal complaint, it should be lodged with an external agency, for reasons I have outlined to you earlier.</PARA>
<PARA>That is, `We don't want to know about you; you are an embarrassment. You are causing embarrassment to one of our own'. I put it to the Minister again that this case is a cause celebre for three reasons:  Mr Butler chose to go on the record and talk about how he dimmed the lights in his office and how he had soft music playing; he chose to make those statements. Nobody prodded him, nobody asked him to do it, he elected to do it. That report was then picked up in the newspapers here and it became a cause celebre.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The plight of this woman then came to my attention through a variety of sources. It was quite clear that she was being intimidated. I then raised the matter in this Parliament because the Minister is well known for looking after mates. Ambassador Butler is a mate, as Brian Burke is a mate, as perhaps Boucher is a mate. All these people are being looked after by the Minister and he personally will not take responsibility. It is simply not good enough for a Minister of the Crown to say, `She is an inconvenience, I don't want to know about her' and to have his Department give her advice that says, `Go away lady, we don't want to know about you'. I ask the Minister again: when will he take personal responsibility for actions concerning senior people in his Department and not concur in the reasoning that says, `He's a very senior officer, you know; please go away'?</PARA>

I was advised a few days ago that a former locally engaged staff member at the Australian Embassy in Bonn has lodged a complaint with the Merit Protection and Review Agency&mdash;one of the procedures we have constantly referred to as available to complainants in these situations&mdash;alleging sexual harassment by two departmental officers formerly posted to the Embassy.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The matter relating to the officer's recall from Bangkok is a completely separate and distinct matter from the matter relating to the harassment complaint by the spouse. The sequence of events, as my Department became aware of them, essentially is this: on 20 February of the year in question Mr Forrester gave the officer reasons for withdrawing him from the post. On 24 February the spouse contacted the Department by phone and by fax to report the alleged harassment which occurred on 14 January, some weeks earlier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 25 February the workplace harassment officer first spoke to the spouse about the options available. On 26 February&mdash;these are running in separate streams, but the dates run in this sequence&mdash;the officer faxed to Mr Forrester a message saying that he agreed with the opinion that he return home, but he did not accept the reasons for the conclusion of his posting. That is an interesting variation on the chronology that Senator Bishop identified before. On 26 February the posting was terminated. On 11 March the officer and his spouse left Bangkok. </PARA>

The suggestion that Senator Bishop began with at an earlier stage of this discussion this afternoon, that no reasons were given, was expressly countered by what Mr Forrester said in evidence&mdash;or what was certainly said during the course of the Estimates hearing. I am advised again that that was the situation. The officer in question was well aware of the reasons for recall. Of course it had nothing whatsoever to do with the alleged harassment situation as it existed in the post, and of which the Department first became aware only four days after the reasons were given for the recall being imminent. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The matter was unsatisfactory in a number of ways. Firstly, it was unsatisfactory in that in the Estimates Committee on 4 September 1991 the officers and the Minister said that no breach of the regulations had occurred. It was only as a result of our continuing to press the matter that it was then further investigated almost a year later at the Estimates Committee. We immediately found out that Mr Burke had breached the regulations, and that was acknowledged by the Minister and by the Department. That was unsatisfactory.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the matter was unsatisfactory in that an officer of the Department clearly misled the Estimates Committee on 4 September 1991. He misled the Estimates Committee when he said that a particular memorandum which set out the obligations upon the Ambassador by the Department `had not been distributed to him'&mdash;that is, Mr Burke.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Here we go again. There is no other way to interpret other than in simple English language that the document was given to Mr Burke. A year ago, the Minister said it was not; he now accepts that it was. There is a separate dispute about whether Mr Burke understood the contents of that document, and the Department apparently decided that Mr Burke did not understand it or did not read the relevant paragraph.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bureaucrat concerned justified misleading the Senate by saying that, in bureaucratese, if that is the expression, he could claim that the document was not distributed because, even though he knew it was given to Mr Burke, Mr Burke had not signed an acknowledgment of that and therefore he could come before the Senate and say it was not distributed to Mr Burke. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On no sensible interpretation can that explanation stand. The facts are that the document was given to Mr Burke and the relevant officer misled the Senate Estimates Committee on 4 September 1991. There was no other interpretation open to the Estimates Committee but to believe that that officer was saying that the document was not given to Mr Burke&mdash;in fact, at that time the officer knew that the document had been given to Mr Burke. That is an unsatisfactory aspect of this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I regret that, even though the officer was pressed in the subsequent Estimates Committee a year later, he was not prepared to acknowledge that in those terms but fell back again on trying to develop this argument that, because Mr Burke did not sign the acknowledgment, it was legitimate for him to come into the Parliament, through the Estimates Committee procedure, a year before and put on the record that Mr Burke had not got the document, it had not been distributed to him. That was very unsatisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not suggesting that the officer deliberately misled the Committee, but I am very frustrated by that interpretation. For me not to make the claim that the Committee was deliberately misled is to be very generous in favour of that officer, but I will not press that further except to say that it is another unsatisfactory aspect of this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What worries us particularly is that, in relation to Mr Burke and the pursuit of his breach of regulations, there seems to have been a very different approach by the Department and the Minister to alleged breaches in relation to other people. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My colleague says, `He's a mate'. That seems to colour the way in which the evidence was put to the parliamentary Committee in September 1991 in terms of this very generous interpretation by the Department that, because Mr Burke did not sign the acknowledgment, it was prepared to find in his favour that he did not read the document and did not understand it, or certainly did not read the relevant paragraph.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a very helpful interpretation to Mr Burke, and an interpretation that does not seem to be open to anyone else. Everyone else is expected to abide by the regulations, but Mr Burke is excused, even though he had the document, even though he has had all the training and experience of someone who has risen to the office of a State Premier. The Department is prepared to accept that he either did not read the relevant paragraph or did not understand it and, therefore, it should find in his favour that he did not deliberately breach the obligations contained therein. So I find in that instance the approach of the Department very different to other cases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there is the astonishing development in relation to subsequent apparent breaches of the regulations when this matter became public knowledge. The approach of the Department was to send officers to Dublin to regularise the affair. The specific instruction Mr Davin was given before he went off to Ireland was: `if possible to devise a means by which any vehicles purchased by Mr Burke in excess of his entitlements could be regularised'&mdash;in other words, `He may be in breach but see if there is a way to sort it out without having to take any further action against Mr Burke'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this second way, there seems to be a distinction in the way in which the Department and the Department's Minister went about dealing with Mr Burke and the apparent breaches of the regulations that had come to the attention of the Department and possibly the Minister. Related to that was the overall way in which the Burke case was handled as compared with other cases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to mention names here, but I have material on other cases where, in not dissimilar circumstances, the approach of the Department has been to send officers, equipped with notes of authority that give them the right to seize books and papers, et cetera, to gain evidence to prosecute an officer for an alleged breach of these regulations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But that is a totally different approach to that which was applied in the case of Mr Burke. As I said, the way in which it was applied in the case of Mr Burke was to see if there was a way in which the Department could help him out of this predicament. The background to that is that Mr Burke was a Labor mate. He was somebody who had to be looked after, whereas these other officers do not have the same political connections, and they can be treated differently. I regard that as highly unsatisfactory. All of this has taken 12 months of struggle to get out of the Department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the bottom line is that we find that Mr Burke did breach the regulations. But we are now told that no action can be taken against him because he is no longer under the authority of the crown, which is handy for Mr Burke. But that may be the case. Secondly, in relation to those parts that could potentially be regularised so that there would not be further breaches, the Department bent over backwards to help Mr Burke through this difficulty. Thirdly, the Department took an astonishing interpretation of the documents and his knowledge in all the circumstances to the effect that it accepted that he did not know the regulations, even though the regulations had been given to him. Fourthly, as I said at the outset, I also object to the way in which the Senate was misled in the Estimates Committee by an officer who believed that in the terms of the bureaucracy he could come into the Parliament and say that the document was not distributed to Mr Burke, even though he knew that it had been delivered to Mr Burke, because Mr Burke did not sign an acknowledgment of receipt of that document. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So overall&mdash;and I guess this matter is coming to a close&mdash;it is a highly unsatisfactory affair. I do not think the handling of it is something of which the Department should be proud. I certainly do not think the handling of it is something of which the Minister should be proud. But then again, as we have found in this instance and in a few others&mdash;Senator Richardson's Marshall Islands affair comes immediately to mind&mdash;if one has a very close link with the Labor Party, if one is a mate, then when one runs into a clash of interest with this Department and this Minister one seems to have an advantage over others who do not have such a close association. </PARA>

I try to do these things with scrupulous fairness and respect for the individuals that are involved. Nobody in my position can sensibly do otherwise. I have not been a Minister for nearly 10 years without being acutely aware of the responsibilities that one has in that respect when it comes to these personnel matters. Be that as it may, the three specific features of the whole affair that Senator Hill chooses to concentrate on today and describe as unsatisfactory require, I guess, some very brief comment from me. I do not propose to give any extended discussion of these things because they have been the subject of exhaustive discussion, I think we would all acknowledge, in Estimates Committee B.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the business of whether or not a breach occurred, yes it is the case that it was subsequently discovered a very long time after the initial response was given that there had been a brief overlap period&mdash;a matter of days or weeks; it is still unclear&mdash;right at the beginning of the saga in question at which Mr Burke did hold one more car than he had been given departmental authorisation for or that he was entitled to. That is acknowledged and I do not make anything more of that except to say yes, I accept that that was unsatisfactory, that that was not fully investigated in all respects, as it no doubt should have been at the time, to establish that there was a technical breach of that kind. But it was a breach that was subsequently regularised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the second matter raised by Senator Hill, that the officer in his evidence did mislead the Committee&mdash;Senator Hill was kind enough to say that he did not regard it as an exercise in deliberate misleading, but he did say at the outset that the officer misled the Committee in saying that the circular had not been distributed to Mr Burke&mdash;I guess it is a matter of how one chooses to deploy words in this situation. The point that we have always tried to make very clear and which has not in any way been countermanded by any evidence that Senator Hill has heard in the Estimates Committee is that the circular was certainly never `distributed' in the way that it should have been through proper briefing of procedure and accompanying signature and documentation to indicate that the person in question had been taken through it and was aware of all its contents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, while it was obviously the case&mdash;and this has not been contested&mdash;that the document in question was given to Mr Burke as an attachment to a memo in response to a particular query from Mr Burke, it has been said over and over again that the context in which that particular exchange took place was a very limited and narrow one in which the officer in question was responding to a very specific request from Mr Burke for advice as to one particular aspect of the car matter, namely, about the extent to which one could hold a car without incurring significant mileage while still being consistent with the letter and spirit of the rules. That was the matter that was highlighted when the document was handed over. That was the matter that was addressed in the accompanying memo. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we have said on many occasions, that being the context of that particular handing over of the memo in question and that being accompanied by a series of subsequent denials by Mr Burke that he was aware of the basic elements of that memo, it was quite appropriate, I think, for the senior departmental officers to take the position that they consistently have that they could not in conscience make any judgment or determination that Mr Burke was aware of his precise obligations in this respect on the basis of that communication. So that is where I think that matter has to rest. There is nothing being hidden. All the material is on the public record. It is just a question of how one chooses to characterise it.

I can only express my confidence that I am sure that would be so. Certainly it was not a matter in which I, or any other member of the Government or anyone else with a political role, played any role. It was dealt with strictly and scrupulously as an administrative matter, as these things should be. As to the question of discipline, the difficulty was that by the time this matter came to light Mr Burke had already announced his resignation and even the application&mdash;</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, in May 1991 he had submitted his resignation. The matters that Senator Hill was exercised about, the officer going across to Dublin to deal with the car matter and to achieve a regularisation of the payment by Mr Burke of large amounts of duty that he otherwise may not have, all of that was done after Mr Burke had indicated that he was resigning anyway from the job. So, even had it been appropriate to apply a disciplinary sanction in the form of a dismissal or something of that kind, it would have been manifestly inappropriate to do so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was no question, however, for reasons I have already indicated, of there being a disciplinary sanction because: first, the matter was regularised, and there was no continuing breach when the matter was resolved in this way; and, secondly, as to the state of mind or the intention, or knowledge, which might have given rise to a disciplinary proceeding notwithstanding a subsequent regularisation, there simply was no conclusive evidence, and the benefit of the doubt had to be given. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has been shown up as unsatisfactory by this is the absence of an array of disciplinary weapons or sanctions, if you like, available to deal not only with political appointees&mdash;heads of mission and that kind of status, so far as their long term association with the Public Service Act is concerned&mdash;but also with ordinary members of the Public Service who do assume the status of unattached officers when they go on postings abroad. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have taken action, as I have previously indicated, to raise with the Public Service Commission this particular anomaly. As a result of that, Senator Hill might be interested to hear, the Public Service Commission has advised that it does think that appropriate amendments are necessary to the Public Service Act and that the Office of Parliamentary Counsel has been instructed to draw those up. Regrettably, time ran out and made it impossible to proceed with that this session. But I certainly hope that there will be some legislation introduced to fix that up so far as Public Service Act people are concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difficulty in dealing with non-Public Service Act people remains. It has been suggested to us, I am told, by the Public Service Commissioner that perhaps the best way of dealing with that is in future terms and conditions documents there be an explicit sanctions provision of some kind, yet to be determined, built in, giving a contractual right to respond in some appropriate way when these situations arise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we are alerted, as a result of these problems, to that hiatus&mdash;gap, if you like&mdash;in the present legal provisions that are available, and we are doing our best to fix that.

I challenge you on the fact that you said that you were not acting any differently towards Mr Burke as a mate. Maybe you would care to tell the Senate why he has been treated so differently all the way along the line. He has had preferential treatment that only a mate could get.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no other posting that we have been able to discover in all our investigations through the Estimates committees, questions or anything else that has had the type of treatment that Mr Burke has had&mdash;with the extra number of trips that he was allowed; the extra number of visits home that he was allowed; the excessive quantity of phone calls that he had; the extra holidays that he had; the extra cars that he had; and, to add to that, the poor management at the Embassy, where every budget allocation at the post in a given year had been overspent. Yet here we have a situation where, as Senator Hill just said, he is treated differently from every single solitary other ambassador, and you think that that is quite acceptable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Minister, there is no point in saying to us that all of this came to light after he quit. Let us face it: if you had had half a wit about you, you would have cut him loose a lot earlier than saying to him `Come on Brian, baby&mdash;jump before I push', because you knew that you were hoisting yourself on your own petard. It was becoming crystal clear to everybody. Everybody in Western Australia knew that. We knew it here. You knew it.  And yet you continued to defend a mate. It might be highly honourable to defend one's mates. But when it is at the expense of the Australian taxpayers and our reputation overseas, surely a limit has to be drawn somewhere along the line. Why do you still today continue to defend a man who has led us into disrepute in Ireland, who has not done the job well, and who has been given special treatment? That favoured treatment is just indefensible. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, each individual matter that did have difficulties attached to it, such as the car matter, was addressed and resolved in the way that we have discussed. The perhaps excessive use of telephones and the inappropriate or inadequate procedures that were employed in relation to them, and the rule of thumb percentage rule that was applied, and so on, to the differentiation between official and private calls&mdash;all those issues, as they came to light, were addressed. Allegations were made about trips or visits or whatever, but I am not aware of there being any unresolved questions about that. Questions have been raised from time to time, but some visits were specifically authorised in the context of Mr Burke's particular skills as a trade ambassador, as we thought at the time on the available evidence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other issues arose as a consequence. Mr Burke found himself in a very difficult situation, as I recall, in having to prepare himself for his appearance before the Western Australia Inc. Royal Commission. That made some specific provision for leave, trips to Australia, extended holidays and so on appropriate in those circumstances&mdash;which simply had not arisen in any comparable case before, so  it is very difficult to compare them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I just do not accept that there is any particular pattern that emerges here that requires justification. Everyone is very conscious of the need to be scrupulously strict in applying rules to people who are appointed otherwise than from the Public Service. Those rules have been applied each time to the extent that there are procedural problems that have come to light. To the extent that there are problems about absence of sanctions that have come to light, we are addressing those, as I have said. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reference that I made to political appointments, which got Senator Knowles a little excited at the outset, is simply a term of art to describe those appointments which are made from time to time by governments. I think we have fewer of them now than at any previous time in living memory that are made of non-career diplomats to postings for good individual reasons in individual cases. I do not resile from that description. It is a convenient one, and it does not carry with it any connotations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, as to the question of releasing details of telephone calls, on the basis of legal advice, including advice from the Privacy Commission, my Department decided that in relation to the release of telephone logs from the official residence in Dublin, the protection of privacy had to be paramount. That matter, in general terms, has been made clearly on the record. That legal advice was just as applicable in its terms to voluntary release to the Royal Commission as it would have been in its terms to voluntary release to the media or to anyone else. The Privacy Act applies. There has to be some good reason because of the privacy invading potential of this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was always open to the Royal Commission to subpoena documents in question had the Royal Commission believed that these documents would have been helpful to it in the pursuit of its inquiries. I say very clearly for the record now that were my Department to receive a subpoena from the Royal Commission, compelling production of the telephone records in question, we would fully comply with our legal obligations. The way the Privacy Act is structured, it is capable of being overridden by a subpoena, a royal commission or a court in that way. But it is not capable of being overridden through a voluntary release purely in response to a less than totally formal subpoena request. That is the reason why that matter has stood where it has. </PARA>

It is wrong, with respect, to suggest that the reason Mr Burke kept on coming back to Australia and going on holidays and everything else was to do with his preparation of his case for the Royal Commission.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More generally, the Department's philosophy about management has been one so far as possible of devolution to posts, putting responsible people in charge, having periodic audits to see that they are doing the job well, but not trying through a vast clerical apparatus back here to second guess every single transaction, every single leave sheet, every single car registration document or whatever. To do that would produce an impossibly inefficient bureaucratic system. Consistent with good management principles everywhere, we are trying to go down the path of devolution and a lot more authority these days is invested in posts' management systems than previously. The ultimate responsibility for the effectiveness and efficiency of those posts rests with the head of mission at the time, but he obviously has staff people associated with him. </PARA>

That investigation has showed, essentially, that there were some problems about funds control. In particular, during one period there were some problems about procedures being incompletely exercised. There was no evidence that anyone could discern of any fraudulent behaviour or any mismanagement on a scale that would justify objectively some kind of disciplinary proceeding.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Chairman, one matter that was debated at some length in Estimates Committee B was Supply Bills (Nos 3 and 4). I want to pursue a little further the debate that we had in the Estimates hearings on this matter. The Supply Bills that were introduced&mdash;Supply Bills Nos 3 and 4&mdash;were, as I think the Government itself agreed, extraordinary Bills. They were introduced without precedent in the sense that they were introduced on the day of presentation of the Budget as distinct from later on. That made those Bills unprecedented.</PARA></TALK.START>

Given that there was no knowledge on Budget night of precisely when the Appropriation Bills would be passed, it seems extraordinary, as we pointed out in the Estimates hearings, that the Government would need to introduce a supply Bill at that time. Certainly, Supply Bills have been introduced in Budget sessions, but normally when a more demonstrated need has arisen. I would appreciate any further comments that Senator Button might be able to make on that, given the seemingly extraordinary circumstances. </PARA>

I accept the point about the timing, but I would hope the Department would take measures to get a response on this matter, with any specific material, to the Committee as quickly as possible, because the matter is of considerable importance. It impinges on a variety of issues going to the heart of the financing of government. It is very relevant to the whole question of the relationship between the Commonwealth and the States because many of the payments we are talking about are to State governments for particular purposes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have raised many times in the past in this chamber that we have seen special deals done on specific payments to the States which have been, in effect, kept secret from other States and, indeed, have largely escaped the Loan Council and Premiers Conference arrangements. We have had numerous examples of those over recent years. We have had ongoing payments of this nature to South Australia, ostensibly for one purpose, but in fact used for other purposes over each of the last five or six years, from memory, and it is an amount now totalling well over $100m. We have had similar payments to other States. Western Australia is another one that comes particularly to mind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a matter of very serious concern that over recent years the Commonwealth appears to have been turning the Advance to the Minister for Finance into a virtual slush fund for the Commonwealth to make payments to favoured States for anything it likes, with the nature of the transaction, and indeed the very existence of the transaction, not coming into the parliamentary arena for some months at least; in many cases, as a result of the timing of these transactions, avoiding the normal scrutiny processes of the Parliament totally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of the payments to the State governments that have been made under seemingly secret deals around the time of the Premiers Conference each year eventually turn up in obscure tables hidden well into the mass of Budget papers and are almost impossible for the average observer, commentator, and politician for that matter, to dig out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a matter of very considerable concern. Its importance has been highlighted in recent weeks with the breach by the Victorian Government of the Loan Council borrowing guidelines. Although that is not directly related to the Advance to the Minister for Finance, it is a very important example of what I am talking about because, in essence, what I am talking about is the misuse of the Advance to the Minister for Finance in the sense that it is being used in ways that it was never originally intended to be used. The Advance to the Minister for Finance is supposed to be for unforeseen circumstances. In many cases in recent years where payments have been made to State governments through the Advance to the Minister for Finance, in no way could they be described as being characterised by unforeseen circumstances. Of course, the second criterion for the use of the Advance to the Minister for Finance is that the circumstances be urgent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In each of the last five or six years at least, we have seen payments made for deals done around about Premiers Conference time. These deals, using the Advance to the Minister for Finance, have been done not in the full public gaze of that Conference; rather they have been done between the Commonwealth and an individual State or between the Commonwealth and more than one State with no-one knowing about them until they turn up in the relevant Budget paper, No. 4 I think, at the time of the August Budget. It does not normally then get the scrutiny through the Estimates committees or in any other way that is required for most expenditures by the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I say, this is a matter I have raised on many occasions, and I think I have had a positive response from the Department of Finance to many of the questions about what I would describe as the misuse of the Advance to the Minister for Finance&mdash;certainly, at best, one could say the very loose application of the criteria of `unforeseen and urgent' to requests made for its usage, particularly in terms of payments to individual States. I have been encouraged by the positive responses I have had from the Department accepting many of the points I have made. I hope that the Minister will be able to tell the Senate whether the concerns that I think we have all expressed&mdash;certainly I have expressed them&mdash;and that the Department has acknowledged in recent years have been dealt with. If the Minister could tell the Senate what further steps have been taken to prevent the misuse of the AMF in the ways that I am referring to, I would find that helpful before going on to any further questions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wonder whether the Minister would care to comment on my understanding that, in each of at least the last five years, arrangements have been made at around the time of the Premiers Conference, which is normally held in June, for deals with individual States&mdash;and over the last five years those States have included New South Wales, Tasmania, South Australia, Western Australia and I think Victoria&mdash;for a deal between the Prime Minister or Treasurer of the day and the Premier of the particular State for a payment for a particular purpose for which subsequently the Advance to the Minister for Finance was used and which then eventually turns up, I think, in Budget Paper No. 4. For those payments the criterion of `urgent and unforeseen' is used, despite the fact that invariably there is no discernible urgent nature about the payment and certainly no unforeseen nature, given that for most of them it has been a regular pattern from one year to the next to make a payment for this particular purpose using the Advance to the Minister for Finance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that there is no way in which such regular annual payments using the Advance to the Minister for Finance can possibly be regarded as unforeseen.

It is on that matter I believe that the Department of Finance publicly expressed in the Estimates committee some sympathy with the views and the concerns that I have expressed. If nothing has been put in train to attempt to change that practice and that type of use of the AMF, then I put to the Minister: will the Department look at a much tighter use of the AMF using those criteria? If it is not the case that we will look at it more tightly, what we are really admitting is that the Government will continue to use the AMF as a slush fund to enable it to make payments and special deals with its mates in individual States to suit the whim of the governments of the day without proper parliamentary scrutiny. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think there are cases documented over a number of years where moneys that have been appropriated to the States for particular purposes seem to have been used for other purposes.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that is common knowledge to everybody here. He goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think that is well accepted, but it is clearly not a practice that either the Commonwealth or States would normally countenance. In essence, the whole nature of the accountability and responsibility is to ensure that the moneys appropriated for the particular programs are spent on these purposes. That would be the basis on which any subsequent evaluation or assessment of how well that program had performed would be based.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not know whether Senator Short can construe that as sympathy. Mr Barrett is saying that, over a number of years, there have been instances where payments to the States have not always been used for the purposes specified. That seems to be quite common knowledge. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I want to raise one particular issue in response to a visit by Mr Robert Corbin, the President of the National Rifle Association of the United States, to this country. Mr Corbin was interviewed on the ABC's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">PM</EMPHASIS> program on Monday, 9 November 1992. I find it a fascinating and slightly frightening interview.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I actually look at some of the issues that Mr Corbin raised, I would like to quote from a brochure which has just come to hand today. It is a quote, in fact, from <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Playboy</EMPHASIS> magazine which relates to Dr Alfred Kinsey and his position as a world authority&mdash;or supposed world authority&mdash;on sexuality. As all those people who read about these matters know, Dr Judith Riesman has recently exploded a number of the myths and has exposed some of the inherent bias and fraudulent methods, as she puts it, used in Kinsey's research. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The net result of Dr Riesman's exploration of this particular issue has been that magazines like <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Playboy</EMPHASIS>&mdash;dedicated primarily I guess to the propagation of a fairly sexist male viewpoint about the world&mdash;have been put in a situation of some difficulty. For example, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Playboy</EMPHASIS> stated in October 1988 that Riesman's research `puts men's magazines on the endangered species list'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here is a quote from <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Playboy</EMPHASIS> which in many ways summarises some of the problems that I believe people like Mr Robert Corbin want to export to Australia. This comes from someone who is very annoyed indeed about the effect of Dr Judith Riesman's views about sexuality. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would have taken a .357 magnum, walked up to her and said, `Judith, you are history'.</PARA>

In his interview, Mr Corbin brought home to many of us the essential differences that have so far existed between the Australian view towards guns and what seems to be now the quintessential American view about the use of firearms and the value they have to individuals and their families.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Corbin does not just represent some nut organisation. Mr Corbin, as President of the National Rifle Association, represents an organisation that has 2.4 million paid up members. It has an annual budget, according to the congressional lobbying records, of $US88m. I will indicate in a minute what Mr Corbin thinks about the effect he and his organisation have on politicians and their views about, for example, guns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Corbin has been invited here by many Australian shooting organisations. Obviously, as he has indicated, he is here to discuss the gun issue. He has indicated that he is here to give advice not only to the shooting lobby but also to a significant number of politicians, as he puts it, in discreet private meetings, about the way they should deal with the gun issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Corbin does not pretend to be someone who gives advice about the most intelligent way to have gun control legislation. In fact, Mr Corbin boasts that he is a partisan person who represents a partisan organisation that has, as one of its major aims, the right of Americans to bear arms. We are not talking about the eighteenth century when the American Constitution was written; we are talking about the twentieth century when most Americans live in an urbanised or suburbanised society where guns are not exactly necessary to defend them against bears, hostile Indians or other dangers of the frontier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this interview, Mr Corbin indicated quite clearly that the National Rifle Association, as a lobby group, has taken on politicians in the United States and, as he puts it, `we have unseated many of them'. He said:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I was invited over here to tell the people who invited me just how we do it in the United States. Our institute for legislative action. How we go about lobbying. How we conduct ourselves. Like, we send out to every candidate, from whether you are running for President all the way down to a constable in a precinct of a county, questionnaires asking how they stand on the gun issue.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">in every race, we just don't have that kind of money, but we do pick key races where we think we have an opportunity to win.</PARA>
<PARA>The interviewer says:</PARA>

<PARA>He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That's correct.</PARA>
<PARA>Mind you, what he did not was quote his predecessor, the President of the NRA, who said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All guns are good guns. There are no bad guns. I say the whole nation should be an armed nation. Period.</PARA>
<PARA>Thus spake NRA President, Joe Fossey in 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that there are many people in this country who need guns for various reasons. Obviously, there are more of them in the Northern Territory, Queensland, outback New South Wales and, for some weird and unaccountable reason, Tasmania. Tasmania seems to have an incredible per capita ownership of guns. As we all know, Tasmania registers only pistols and all the rest are unregistered. At one time, Tasmania was seriously considering setting up a manufacturing industry to make semi-automatic and automatic machine-guns. Then again, that was Tasmania in the time of Robin Gray. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very interesting that Mr Corbin is coming here to tell the gun lobby how it ought to start to influence the Australian legislatures. He will be talking about how to raise funds, how to pressure members of parliament, and how to ensure that an organisation at least appears to be an organisation which has the capacity to knock off uncooperative members of parliament. It would be very nice to know that all of us, as members of parliament, can come into this chamber and believe that there is no single interest group out there which can make a decision about our career&mdash;one group, and one group only. After all, we do represent a wide spectrum of constituents, we hope, rather than a particular powerful interest group. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the first point I raise tonight. The real issue is not whether some crazy American, part of a wealthy lobbying group in the United States, is coming here to teach our gun lobby how to do it&mdash;how to influence us; it is whether  we believe that single issue lobby groups should utterly take control of the destiny of members of parliament in this place and in other legislatures. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What about the ACTU?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JE4">Senator AULICH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand what Senator Brownhill is saying, and that he is trying to indicate that the ACTU is one individual powerful lobby group. It does not compare with the gun lobby, Right to Life, et cetera. Even to raise that issue is, in many ways, to belittle the problem that we have in Australia now. We are at the crossroads for the way that we as a society, and we as legislators, determine what happens with the guns in this community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will look at some of the figures that relate to the gun lobby. In Australia there is already a disturbing increase in the ownership of guns. For example, 3.5 million guns of all types now exist in Australia. In 1979 there was one gun for every five or six people. In Australia it is now one in four. More than one-quarter of all Australian households possess a gun. More than one-third of all murders reported to police are committed with firearms. Gunshot wounds are the most common cause of death amongst homicide victims. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we all know, and it is commonsense, the death rate for victims assaulted with guns is several times that of those assaulted with other weapons. In other words, if there is a domestic argument in a house and there is a gun available, if there is ammunition in the house and it is loaded, it is more likely to be used, and it is more likely to be used in a lethal fashion than any other instrument of assault whether it be an axe, a tomahawk or whatever else is around the place. That is statistically the case. The police forces and various institutes of criminality agree that those figures are perfectly supportable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The figures of the Australian Bankers Association reveal striking increases in the number of armed hold-ups in banks. For example, in Queensland in 1980 there were eight armed hold-ups of private banks. Seven years later, in 1987, the figure had risen to 45. I accept that recession may affect the way people behave and the desperation in which they act, but the fact that in Queensland alone armed hold-ups increased from eight to 45 is an indication of the trend.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training recently met with about 40 street kids in Perth. Senator Panizza might be interested in this. There were three young people in that group to whom we were talking who had already been convicted of armed hold-ups at least once and some more than once. They were young people aged from 24 down. To look at some of them, butter would not have melted in their mouths, but in that group there were young people who, because of access to guns and because of their desperation in these harsh economic times, have been prepared to involve themselves in armed hold-ups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of us know that various types of murders occur with guns in this country. They occur with lunatics such as Wade Frankum just blasting people away in shopping centres because something happened to his girlfriend or whatever. There are various reasons for that. There are others who get involved in domestic arguments where they simply take the most lethal weapon they can find readily to hand and blast their partner or their children away. There are others who, out of desperation, plan hold-ups and believe that is the way they can pay for a heroin habit or, for that matter, make enough money to survive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How many people now have we seen who have been killed in cold blood, by accident or in desperation in shops simply because they resisted someone who might have got away with a couple of hundred dollars?  A person's life has gone for a couple of hundred dollars because some desperate young kid has managed to get hold of a gun. That is what the banks say. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Between 1968 and 1971, almost 6,000 Australians took their own lives by using guns or explosives. The police are asked to undertake horrible jobs in all sorts of places, from picking people up off roads and going to the family and saying, `I am sorry, your son'&mdash;or daughter, or husband&mdash;`has been wiped out on the highway', to all the other jobs they have to do. What is the position of the police now? Many of them are under real threat, and the figures show it. Between 1976 and 1985, nearly all of the 65 murders of on-duty Australian police officers were committed through the use of firearms or bombs. Sixty-five policemen on duty in nine years were knocked off by guns or bombs. They are the people who are protecting us. They have a rotten job to do. They were on-duty policemen. The figures do not include those who were off duty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I make on behalf of a number of legislators in this community, State and Federal, is that I am heartily fed up with the gun lobby and with gutless Ministers, at the State level in particular, who will not stand up to the gun lobby and say that enough is enough. For example, some say that the Labor Party lost under Barrie Unsworth because it stood up on the gun issue. They will not stand up in a bipartisan way and say, `Look, this is not an issue for one political party to use to triumph over another in certain electorates'. But there are some who will stand up and say, `The community is fed up with the availability of guns in this community, particularly semi-automatic weapons'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is bad enough that half the videos that our kids see are full of violence and, I believe, are genuine encouragement in some cases for the feeble-minded and the immature to actually go and commit violence if guns are available. The key is the availability of those sorts of weapons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some States have started to move, and they have started to move because the political scandal of them doing nothing after these massacres has forced them to move. But we are now starting to lose our momentum. The press, who work on a 7 1/2-day week basis in terms of the capacity for issues to stay alive, has forgotten all about it. So have many of the Ministers around this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am saying two things tonight. The first is that the legislators in this country will have to start to show more courage, perspicacity, intelligence and a greater capacity to discuss this issue right down to the wire, at which time we will have to ask what sort of a society we want. Do we or do we not want a society that relies on guns to solve arguments, which sees the gun as a method of proving a person's manhood?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, I want to get a message through to Mr Corbin. Mr Corbin has not shown himself to be particularly tolerant of alternative viewpoints in the US. It simply knocks off people on single issues whenever it suits it, regardless of that legislator's ability or otherwise. I say to Mr Corbin: `You have blood on your hands. Get out of this country as quickly as possible. Cease your private meetings with individual members of parliament. We do not want you here. We do not want to be like the United States with all its problems with gun laws. It is about time you went back to America'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is my message tonight. I can assure Mr Corbin that I speak on behalf of a significant part of the Australian community, including my own electorate in Tasmania, who are fed up, first, with the gutlessness of politicians on this question and, secondly, with someone from America with its failed record on violence in the community coming here and telling us how we ought to be running our legislatures in the matter of gun control. </PARA>

We used to leave the magazine out because it used to add weight. The weight is cut down and is a safety angle. Only one bullet is used at a time as the target is marked.

Nor has there been a weapon belonging to one of those members used in a massacre in Australia. That is definite. Further to that, it is almost impossible to carry out a massacre with a single shot rifle&mdash;because it is only a single shot anyhow, and, hopefully, if someone were to use one of those, someone would mow him or her down before there was a chance to put a second slug in.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Taxation was on the agenda agreed by the Australian and New Zealand Governments for the 1992 Review of the Australia&mdash;New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement (CER), in acknowledgment of the importance the business community attached to trans-Tasman taxation issues. In the course of the 1992 CER Review, a great deal of valuable preparatory work was completed. Australian and New Zealand officials held a series of intensive discussions on trans-Tasman tax issues, including those identified by the two business communities; a joint paper that canvassed in considerable depth trans-Tasman aspects of taxation of equity was prepared; and model Double Taxation Agreements were exchanged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Formal negotiations to put in place possible new trans-Tasman taxation arrangements did not, however, commence in the 1992 CER Review time-frame. The reasons for this were explained to the business community in the Joint Media Statement on the 1992 CER Review, released by the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development, Mr John Kerin, and the NZ Minister for Trade Negotiations, Mr Philip Burdon, on 7 October 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both Governments recognised that aspects of the tax arrangements being discussed were unprecedented and would have wide-ranging implications, including in relation to fiscal sovereignty, revenue and broader international tax policy objectives. In view of these considerations, it was acknowledged that further steps could not be taken until both Governments had conducted the careful and thorough analysis necessary to decide the best outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be remiss of the Australian Government to make any precipitate decision on trans-Tasman taxation issues or enter into negotiations without first carefully weighing up all the potential costs and benefits to Australia of any new trans-Tasman tax arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2 and 3) Trans-Tasman taxation arrangements are governed by the existing Australia-New Zealand Double Taxation Agreement (DTA).

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Economic double taxation of dividends, first in the hands of companies and then in the hands of shareholders, has been identified by the Australian and NZ business communities as a disincentive to trans-Tasman investment.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By conscious design, neither countries' imputation system allows credit against residents' personal tax liabilities for company tax paid in the other country (or any other country) as they do for domestic tax.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addressing the business community's interest in reducing possible double taxation of income distributed to shareholders from trans-Tasman equity investments, it is necessary to weigh these potentially serious risks and costs against possible benefits.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The new arrangements whereby pharmacists must view an entitlement card to confirm that a person has an entitlement to free or concessional prescriptions under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, are not, to my knowledge, causing payment problems for chemists located in country towns who service remote areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The Health Insurance Commission, which administers the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, has advised pharmacists who are in remote areas and who do not see patients on a regular basis, to contact the Commission for special assistance in correctly identifying their patients' pharmaceutical benefits entitlement numbers. Such arrangements are already in place for some pharmacists who supply outback Aboriginal communities. These arrangements ensure that the pharmacist has a correct record of a patient's entitlement. Where a pharmacist is satisfied that a patient continues to be eligible for medication at a free or concessional rate, the pharmacist need not sight an entitlement card on all occasions.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator Gareth Evans</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The Government appreciates the genuine concern in Australia and in the international community about the plutonium shipments and considers that ensuring their safety and security must be the paramount objective. The Government does not accept, however, a number of the advertisement's claims about the safety of the shipments which are technically unsubstantiated and unsustainable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Strict international guidelines on safety and physical protection measures for plutonium transportation are in place, having been developed over many years, including by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). They include stringent testing to ensure the integrity of the casks in which plutonium is transported.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has conducted an intensive examination of all aspects of the planned shipments to ensure that any implications for Australia could be fully considered. Australian and Japanese officials have discussed the security and safety arrangements for the shipments in the course of regular consultations under the 1982 Agreement between Australia and Japan for Cooperation in the Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy. Australia has also discussed the arrangements with the European Atomic Energy Community (EURATOM) and with the United States, which has an agreement with Japan on physical protection and safety arrangements for the shipments. Under that agreement, the United States has approved the transportation plan for the shipments. Japan has also provided publicly information on arrangements for the shipments, including information on the construction and equipment of the transport ship and its escort vessel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said in my answer of 16 September to a question without notice in the Senate (Senate <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> pp 961, 962), on the basis of all these exchanges and careful examination of all the issues, the Government has satisfied itself that the physical protection and safety arrangements for the shipments meet or exceed international standards for the transport of plutonium.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In regard to the advertisement's criticism of Japan's planned plutonium use, as I said in the Senate on 15 September in answer to a question without notice (Senate <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> pp 864, 865), the Government would not support the stockpiling of plutonium by Japan or any other non-nuclear weapon state. In this context, the Government accepts Japan's clear and frequent statements that, as a fundamental principle, it will not possess plutonium in excess of the amount required for its nuclear power program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Japan is almost totally reliant on imported fuel for power production and has pursued nuclear fuel reprocessing as one way of enhancing its energy independence. The plutonium shipped from Europe will be used on an ongoing basis in Japan's nuclear fuel recycling program. All nuclear facilities in Japan are subject to continuing intensive IAEA safeguards and the Government has no reason to doubt Japan's commitment to the use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes only, in accordance with its obligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In all of these circumstances, a Government protest to Japan would not be appropriate. The Government will, however, continue to take the closest possible continuing interest in all aspects of the issue and in particular in the question of safety and security of the shipment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Australia does not know the route and does not expect the Japanese Government will depart from its clearly stated intention for security reasons not to advise other countries of the route.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Japan is not under any international legal obligation to advise Australia of entry of the plutonium ship into the 200 nautical mile Australian Fishing Zone (AFZ). The ship is entitled under international law to transit the AFZ and other countries' 200 nautical mile Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ). However, Japan has said that, in principle, the ships will not be routed through countries' EEZs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) If emergency circumstances were to arise in the course of a shipment and Japan requested Australia's assistance, the Australian Government would consider such a request in accordance with the international law applicable to ships in distress.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of assistance to the ships at sea, under the 1982 Law of the Sea Convention, which is generally regarded as declaratory of customary international law in this respect, assistance would be required to the extent that it could be given without serious danger to rescue personnel and equipment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of port access, under the customary international law relating to the sovereignty of coastal states and also under the 1923 Geneva Convention on the International Regime of Maritime Ports, to which both Australia and Japan are parties, it would be within the discretion of the Australian Government to determine on a non-discriminatory basis whether port access would be granted. Port access is normally granted to ships in distress but safety would be a paramount consideration in deciding whether to grant access to the plutonium ship.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) Appropriate arrangements, involving a number of Government Departments and Agencies, including the Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre, are in place to coordinate an Australian response to maritime emergencies, including any emergency involving the plutonium ship. Such arrangements would be activated promptly if an emergency arose.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia has a capacity to assist ships in distress but the exact nature of the response would depend on the nature of the emergency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) Australian-obligated plutonium is not involved in the first shipment. Australia is, however, a significant supplier of uranium to the Japanese nuclear fuel cycle and, under the 1982 Australia and Japan nuclear cooperation agreement, Australian-obligated nuclear material may be reprocessed, subject to stringent safeguards and physical protection requirements specified in the agreement. A proportion of the plutonium returned to Japan over time will therefore have an Australian safeguards obligation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any such material will always be subject to an Australian bilateral safeguards agreement. While in the jurisdiction of Japan, it is subject to the 1982 nuclear cooperation agreement between Australia and Japan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While in France, the material is subject to the nuclear safeguards agreements between Australia and France and Australia and EURATOM. Those agreements provide strict controls to ensure that all Australian-obligated nuclear material (including plutonium) is used exclusively for peaceful, non-explosive purposes, is fully accounted for, and is subject to internationally agreed levels of physical protection.</PARA>
