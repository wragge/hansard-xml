<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS>TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill is an Omnibus Bill amending 3 Acts administered within the Transport and Communications portfolio. While none of the proposed amendments involve significant policy changes, they are important for the general administration of the Transport and Communications portfolio. Details of the amendments are as follows.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Air Navigation Act 1920</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part 2 of this Bill proposes a number of miscellaneous amendments to the Air Navigation Act 1920. Many of these changes make the law in relation to international aircraft movements clearer to the aviation industry both in Australia and overseas. They provide for consistency in the area of aircraft operations and clarity in relation to offences committed under the Act. The changes also remove ambiguities which exist at the moment between provisions in the Act and provisions in the Regulations. These changes do not impact adversely on industry as there is no proposed tightening of regulatory powers in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments do, however:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">replace the existing general offence provision with specific offence provisions and penalties;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">clarify the provisions relating to international airline licences, permissions and approvals; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">enable regulations to be made providing for on-the-spot fines for specific offences and remove the power to prescribe a term of imprisonment in regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I will address each of these amendments in turn.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 22 of the Act currently contains a general offence provision which sets a single penalty in respect of each of the offences contained in the Act. General offence provisions of this kind have been criticised by the Courts for failing to provide any indication of the relative seriousness of each of the offences contained in the Act and therefore providing no guidance in the exercise of the discretion of a sentencing Court. They have also been criticised as being unhelpful in determining whether an offence has actually been committed, that is, determining whether a particular provision creates an obligation with criminal sanctions or is purely administrative.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The offences are now stated in the Act itself. That is, the amendments contained in the present Bill describe each of the offences in the Act and allocate an appropriate penalty. Section 22 is repealed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second group of amendments concern the licensing provisions of the Act. At present, the Act deals specifically with the grant of international airline licences, permissions and approvals to foreign aircraft. Complementary provisions in relation to Australian aircraft are contained mostly in the Regulations. The amendments will transfer and amalgamate these provisions into the Act so that powers for the regulation of Australian aircraft operating scheduled and non-scheduled flights are co-located and provide similarly to those for foreign aircraft.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, the Bill amends the power to make regulations in section 26 of the Act. In accordance with Commonwealth criminal law policy, serious offences warranting a penalty of imprisonment will be contained in the Act rather than the Regulations. Secondly, the Regulations will enable a person who is alleged to have contravened a specified provision of the Regulations to pay an on-the-spot fine as an alternative to prosecution. The level of the fine would not exceed one-fifth of the maximum penalty payable by a person who is prosecuted for a breach of the specified regulation. I emphasise that the payment of an on-the-spot fine is an alternative to prosecution which is not intended to deprive a person from seeking to defend the matter should he or she choose to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Except in the provision of a stronger deterrent for unlicensed scheduled operations, the Bill does not introduce any new regulatory powers. The new provisions of subsections 13A(3), 14(3A), 15(2C) and 17(1B) specify certain categories of flights which may be exempt from the requirement to obtain prior permission. This Government has deregulated many areas of the aviation industry as part of its micro-economic reform program. This Bill introduces, in a small way, some further opportunities for administrative savings for both the industry and my Department.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am advised by my Department that it has already begun to exempt certain categories of flights in accordance with guidelines issued by the Government for certain categories of charter flights. The provisions in this Bill make the legislative base for doing this very clear. Such measures mean less contact by aircraft operators with Government bureaucracy and reduced public service surveillance and expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Broadcasting Act 1942</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part 3 of the Bill contains measures to correct drafting anomalies arising from amendments to the Broadcasting Act 1942 contained in the Broadcasting Amendment Act (No. 2) 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Firstly, the Bill will make minor changes to the definitions of `AM commercial radio licence' and `non-metropolitan FM commercial radio licence' contained in the Broadcasting Act. Subsection 89D(5A) of the Broadcasting Act enables the holder of a non-metropolitan AM commercial radio licence to seek to convert to FM by applying to vary the technical conditions of the licence warrant. However, the existing definition of an AM commercial radio licence excludes those licences where the warrant includes an FM translator, even though the main service may be on AM. The amendment will clarify that the Minister may convert such non-metropolitan AM commercial radio licences to FM by changing the technical conditions of the licence warrant.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly, the Bill will amend subsection 80B(2) of the Broadcasting Act to clarify a minor drafting inconsistency between paragraph (a) and paragraph (b) of that subsection.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Radio Licence Fees Act 1964</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part 4 of the Bill corrects a drafting oversight in the Radio Licence Fees Amendment Act 1991. This concerns the level of licence fees to be paid under paragraph 6(2A)(e) of the Radio Licence Fees Act 1964. The current licence fee ceiling of 6.5% for licensees with revenues greater than $10m contained in paragraph 6(2A)(e) should have been reduced by 50% by the 1991 Amendment Act. The current 6.5% licence fee ceiling will be reduced to 3.25% by this Bill to give effect to the original intention of the 1991 amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reduced ceiling of 3.25% will take effect retrospectively from 1 January 1992. The amendment is retrospective in effect as it is beneficial to affected licensees and ensures that the changes in fees apply to all fees payable in 1992. A mechanism has been included to require the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal to refund the difference between the amount of licence fees paid by affected licensees as calculated under the existing formula (with the 6.5% ceiling), and the amount that would have been payable under the amended formula.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said last night, it is part of the package of very hastily cobbled together measures announced by the Government as part of its One Nation-One Job plan announced on 26 February. Again, as I said last night, this Bill really is a political stunt. It does not improve the taxation system. It creates more anomalies between the various motor vehicles and it introduces a new anomaly between the so-called luxury car price and the price at which the depreciation limit is set. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill adds to the complexity&mdash;and, therefore, the administrative and compliance costs&mdash;of the already cumbersome and anomaly-ridden wholesale sales tax system. There will now be no fewer than five rates of tax applying to vehicles, ranging from 0 to 10 per cent, 15 per cent, 20 per cent and 30 per cent. So much for the simplification procedures that this Government had talked about implementing. I ask again: where are the simplification procedures that the Government had in mind?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A major anomaly created by the Bill is that it does separate the luxury car tax threshold from the depreciation limit, and it is now possible for a vehicle to be priced at retail below the depreciation limit of $45,462 but above the new luxury car tax threshold of $43,937 for sales tax purposes. It is to deal with that anomaly that I will be moving in the committee stage of the debate an amendment to correct that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that the amendments being proposed are consistent with the Government's aim to limit the sales tax reduction of 5 per cent to vehicles in the medium and cheaper end of the price scale. I apologise that the amendment is not yet available. It is a very complex technical amendment. I hope it will be available to the chamber in a very short time so that we can get on with the business of its consideration after the second reading debate has concluded. If not then, perhaps I can talk to Senator McMullan about that. I am just foreshadowing that amendment to remove the very major anomaly which, I believe, this Bill has created. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we are debating the Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1992. This cosmetic and selective reduction of Labor's biggest consumption tax, the wholesale sales tax, is typical of the shallow and dishonest approach of the Keating `One Job' package which was delivered on 26 February this year. A fifth level of sales tax has now been created in what is nothing more than a vote buying exercise. If it were something more than a vote buying exercise, something more radical would have been done and this tax reduction would have been extended to many other areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill clearly shows the Liberal and National parties' commitment to thoroughly reform the tax system. It also shows our commitment to complete reform that will not only benefit the individual consumer but also strengthen the entire economy, and a Government out to buy a few votes while refusing to contemplate reform is what we are faced with today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very obvious that this Bill is intended as an electoral sweetener, nothing more and nothing less, as it is purely and simply confined strictly to passenger motor vehicles. If the Government were serious about this, it would have extended it to other vehicles, and particularly vehicles which produce income for this country. Passenger vehicles will now attract a new 15 per cent sales tax level while trucks, delivery vans, utilities and motor cycles will continue to attract the 20 per cent level. Why is there the discrimination between the two?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Herein lies the great difference between what this Government is doing and what the Liberal and National parties are suggesting. We will make sure that the whole of this wholesale sales tax is removed from those business motor vehicles and that the goods and services tax will be fully refunded as a business input. The Government benefit is aimed squarely at the private consumer with the carrot of an $800 reduction on a six-cylinder sedan. Why has the Government not extended that to the businesses and the wealth producing sectors of this country?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Vehicles used in earning income as an essential part of business do not share the benefit because there are no votes in it. It would be too much to expect the Keating Labor Government to take action to reduce the cost of business inputs for the good of the national economy.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is purely and simply designed to grab a vote wherever it can. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cost of sales tax revenue for 1992-93, we are told, will be $185m. This represents less than 2 per cent of the $10 billion that is likely to be raised by this hidden consumption tax next year. It represents 8 per cent of nearly $2.3 billion in sales tax that was levied on vehicles, tyres, oil and batteries in 1990-91, and herein lies another difference. All of those items, once again, will have the wholesale sales tax taken off them and the goods and services tax fully refunded under a Liberal and National government. Why has this Government not taken that lead?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All this huge tax rip-off amounts to is a fairly minor concession and a reduction in a massive consumption tax levied upon one of our most essential business inputs. When one stops to think of how transport, fuel, parts and all other associated transport costs impact on the price of every product going right down through the manufacturing and retail chain, then one starts to realise the huge burden that Australian consumers are carrying today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No-one really needs an economics degree to realise that the added purchase and running costs of commercial vehicles impact right across the production chain and add to the cost of every consumer item that is packaged, shelved and delivered by a vehicle. Once again, we can ask the question: why has the Government walked away from providing real and tangible tax relief to those areas of the community?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the worst features of sales tax is its complexity&mdash;my colleague Senator Short referred to that a moment ago&mdash;which is so often the result of political manipulation rather than any kind of economic necessity. Twelve months ago sales tax was levied at zero, 10 per cent, 20 per cent and 30 per cent, with a special, politically driven 50 per cent impost applying to so-called luxury vehicles. Once again, there was no rhyme or reason why that 50 per cent tax had to be put on luxury vehicles. It was nothing to do with the actual features of the vehicle; it all had to do with price. There was some magical price at which a vehicle suddenly attracted a 50 per cent tax. No justification has ever been offered by this Government as to why whole ranges of items should attract tax at 20 per cent rather than 10 per cent, or 30 per cent rather than 20 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Twelve months ago the then Hawke-Keating Government had to acknowledge the failure of its artificial envy tax rate on luxury vehicles. The Government had to withdraw it because it was having an enormous impact right across the board. It was actually losing revenue and driving imported vehicle dealers to the wall. But then again, when there are a million people unemployed, what is a few more? The Government does not seem to worry. Having regained a slight measure of simplicity, we are now back to five levels of consumption tax because this Government is out to buy some votes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is nonsense for this Government to maintain that it does not have a form of consumption tax. Certainly it is better for this Government to play politics by lowering a tax rather than raising it, as occurred in 1990, but the Labor principle is the same&mdash;economic sense comes last, and a very poor last at that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Simplicity in indirect taxation is not an ideal merely to achieve tidiness. The simpler a system is, the better it is understood by the business proprietor and the consumer, and the harder it is for governments to manipulate it. I remind the Senate that back in 1983, prior to this Government coming to office, Mr Keating promised a simplified tax system. Yet we have another almost 20,000 pages of tax laws, regulations and alterations somewhere along the line. If that is not a nightmare for businesses to deal with, what is? If it is not a nightmare for businesses to deal with five levels of hidden consumption tax, what is? This Government keeps on saying that it does not have a consumption tax. Because of the complexity of sales tax, which is hidden from the consumer, it has been very easy for this Labor Government to increase its overall level by extending it to a greater range of items. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under this Labor Government, the sales tax burden per head of population, even adjusted for inflation, has risen from $480 to $760 per head&mdash;a rise of 60 per cent for which not 1c of compensation has been given. Once again, it is absolute nonsense for this Government to maintain that its taxation is not regressive; it is. To increase hidden consumption taxes by 60 per cent and not give anyone another cent in his or her pay packet is absolute, downright stealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor cannot deny that it has maintained and greatly increased what is now a 5.4 per cent tax on final consumption right across the board. The problem is that this amounts to an 8.1 per cent tax on transport, a 7.4 per cent tax on housing expenditure, a 5.9 per cent tax on personal care and a 3.3 per cent tax on food and beverages&mdash;which Labor pretends will be taxed for the first time under the goods and services tax&mdash;and even a 1.3 per cent tax on medical services. All these taxes mount up and go right across the board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is only fair to comment that the goods and services tax will in no way increase the cost of medical services as it will be zero rated, with the goods and services tax refunded for all the inputs into the delivery of the service, but the patient will pay no goods and services tax. I wish I had a dollar for every time I have heard the Labor Party&mdash;and, of course, its acolytes&mdash;bleating around the traps that we are going to tax health and education. That is simply not true. They know it not to be true, yet it does not stop them repeating it ad nauseam. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Making family cars cheaper for a while does not alter the fact that, under this Labor Government, sales tax has become a true consumption tax and one that, unlike the goods and services tax, is very regressive. It is a fact that the poorest 10 per cent of Australian families with children pay 4.2 per cent of their income in sales tax while families in the highest 10 per cent income range pay 2.9 per cent of their income. Who is this Government favouring?  It is certainly favouring the higher income earners, not the lower ones. Yet it keeps on bleating that we are supposedly providing a tax system for the wealthy to penalise the poor. It is not true. Every fiddling, deceitful piece of sales tax legislation put up by this Government means a continuation of an illogical, regressive system that hits the consumer and poisons the economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Keating Labor Government expects the applause of farmers because $10m has been made available for crop planting assistance. But what recognition is the rural sector getting in this Bill? Not one cent. Farmers will continue to pay $170m each year on such essential business items as trucks and utilities because Labor has failed to include those items in the new 15 per cent sales tax rate. Therein, once again, lies the difference. The Government has refused to take one cent of sales tax away from the rural sector with regard to vehicles. We are going to take it all away from the rural sector so that it can get back to being productive. Farmers, certainly, will continue to be the group with the highest incidence of sales tax, at a rate of 6.8 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is claimed that we are a weird mob, and one could only agree. To place the biggest tax consumption burden on battling exporters who are not free to pass on the costs is absolutely ludicrous, and that is what this Government is doing to the farmers. I suppose it would be more true to say that we have a weird government, prepared to perpetuate such a situation with the average broadacre farm losing $27,500 in 1992-93. Labor can only misrepresent and vilify the honest, practical alternatives that the Liberal and National parties are proposing to the damaging, outworn, hidden consumption tax that is being rejigged in this Bill. The Government does not want to hear the truth about a consistent, visible 15 per cent goods and services tax that will be refundable as a business input and will thus end the present distorting and cascading effect. </PARA>

This is a product, for example, that the Government is now saying is untaxed. Let us look at it.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before we leave the supermarket, let us remember that the product had to get to the supermarket; it was transported on a truck that was taxed, which had tyres that were taxed, a battery that is taxed and fuel that is taxed at 26c a litre.

The mere fact that businesses cannot pay any more and that giving a lot of employees more wage increases at the moment will push more people into higher payroll tax levels, higher training guarantee levels and higher taxation generally does not matter. The Government is quite happy not to remove these taxes and instead pushes them on further and further.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The GST is very different from the wholesale sales tax in a number of ways. Anyone who pretended that there were no indirect taxes in Australia would be misleading the people. But no-one has ever pretended that. There is an indirect tax that raises about $9 billion; it does not raise $27 billion. That is the significant difference. The wholesale sales tax operates differently from the GST: it raises less money, it is less regressive, the redistributive consequences are not as bad. A change from the wholesale sales tax to the GST would be regressive, unfair and undesirable. That is why the GST is being rejected by the people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also true that the wholesale sales tax distinguishes a different tax rate for different products&mdash;so does the GST, but it has less capacity to distinguish, particularly in the way in which the Opposition proposes to introduce it. The Opposition will have zero-rated exemption and 15 per cent. There are differences, but it is much more broad brushed&mdash;the 15 per cent applies to many things to which the wholesale sales tax does not directly apply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Notwithstanding the passionate invocation, sometimes incorrect, of all the taxes that apply but fall on products on supermarket shelves, it is true&mdash;no-one could deny it&mdash;that income tax, wholesale sales tax and every other tax have an impact on the price of every good produced. That is true. It is true that income tax affects the price of products. That is true&mdash;it always will be. What is fundamentally true and what everybody knows is that the goods and services tax, as the Opposition proposes, will put up the price of food and clothing.

It is as straightforward as that. That is what the Opposition is concerned about and it is what the Australian people are concerned about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A few other interesting things have been said in this debate. Senator Tambling came in and tried to make a great point about how bad it was to have a wholesale sales tax on an item. But, unfortunately, he had to acknowledge that the item would probably be more expensive under the GST because it will apply to that product as well. That was a very short contribution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We then had the argument that the GST has no cascading effect. We have had this debate in here before; I am not going to go over it all again. It is quite clearly untrue. The industry most adversely affected by the cascading effect through the exemptions in GST is the tourist industry&mdash;the one industry that we should not be hitting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition talked about reducing the cost to business of taxes. We have 70,000 businesses paying wholesale sales tax; 1.5 million businesses would pay GST. There are in excess of 1.4 million companies, for whom every minute compliance cost of this GST is an extra cost on those businesses. Many of those small businesses cannot and will not be able to afford that. All of the evidence from New Zealand makes that absolutely clear. The articles that have been written by accountants and others on the cost to business of running those taxes makes it clear. I know that those opposite do not like to hear it, but it is nevertheless absolutely true, as you would be only too well aware, Mr Acting Deputy President. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just in case anybody has forgotten&mdash;because I have been responding to what was said in the second reading debate&mdash;we are actually talking about a Bill to reduce the tax on cars to improve the motor vehicle industry and to improve the quality of our motor vehicle fleet by replacement, which will improve transport efficiency and reduce pollution. For that reason, we are of course pleased to be introducing this legislation. I know that there has to be some delay in the committee stage because of a drafting problem with the Opposition amendment. I am not seeking to score a point because what the Opposition is trying to do is a complex matter. Although I do not envisage, on anything I have seen to this time, that we will be supporting the Opposition's amendment, I do not wish to proceed on the basis of just a drafting problem. Let us defer a little to try to get what is before us correct and then deal with it on its merits, rather than deal just with methods of drafting, et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is essentially the second reading debate as we see it. It is a plus for the consumer; it is a plus for the manufacturer; it is a plus for the nation; therefore it must be supported, and we will worry about the committee stage when it arises later today.

<PARA>My colleague Dr Woods, in the House of Representatives, outlined the Opposition's position regarding the original Senate amendments made on 11 December. As the new amendments moved by the Government cover Senate amendments Nos 1 to 5, we are not unhappy to accept the change in the wording that is being put forward. Basically, the Government's amendments achieve the same purpose outlined in Senate amendments 1 to 5, except that the groups to be represented on the board are not named specifically. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the amendments passed in the House of Representatives do not meet all the concerns of the Opposition. We do not believe that they deal adequately with the issue of representation on the board of the Institute by the Australian Medical Association, the Australian Private Hospitals Association or the Australian Hospital Association. The Opposition firmly believes that there should be a clear and defined opportunity for these bodies to have a representative on the board. The amendments passed by the House of Representatives provide for a nominee to be a person with knowledge of the needs of consumers of health services, a person with knowledge of the needs of consumers of welfare services, and a person with knowledge of the needs of consumers of housing assistance services. The final position provided for in the amendments is for a person with expertise in research into public health issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It could be argued by some that nominees from the AMA, the APHA or the AHA would not fit into the first three categories of persons and so would be competing with each other and the Public Health Association of Australia to be represented in that final position. In fact, the Opposition has some doubts that the AMA, the APHA and the AHA would fit into the fourth category. We believe that it is appropriate for these bodies to be represented on the board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The AMA served on the interim board. It was not invited to serve on the first board, nor was it consulted. Given the fact that doctors are in control of $4 billion worth of Commonwealth funds and are involved in a whole range of issues, including statistical analysis, one would think that they would be an appropriate group to be represented in this institute. The APHA or the AHA also should have the opportunity of being represented. In 1987, the Minister was requested to include someone from the hospital sector on the board. In 1991, when the terms of the first board members expired, he said that he would consider the matter. Obviously, it looks like he has not done so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Hospitals account for almost half of the total health expenditure in Australia. In the committee stage of the Australian Institute of Health Amendment Bill in December we indicated the relevance and importance of having a representative from the hospital sector here. This is not only so that hospitals can have input but also, if the Institute of Health is to gather the statistics that it needs in the hospital area, it really ought to have the health providers on side. They can provide figures when asked for them, or they can provide figures in a very cooperative and proactive way. I am sure that if they were recognised by being on this board, they would be more inclined to cooperate with the Institute of Health than they would otherwise be, given the fact that they have no input to that board. For the sake of having a good working relationship with the hospital sector, they ought to be represented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the amendments as they now stand do not adequately address the issue of having the health providers&mdash;the doctors and/or the hospitals&mdash;on the board.

The Government was smart; I will admit that. Somebody in the Department said, `We'll trick them. We'll fix it.

It was, in fact, the Democrats who realised late last year that, under the new legislation that we have before us, consumer groups had been excluded from the board of the Australian Institute of Health, and I should add that that was without any consultation with the groups themselves, not even any consultation with those groups who were on the original board. They were simply omitted.

This is why we refused to take the changes that were made in the House of Representatives, because we believe that we had to have listed in the schedule specific organisations, including all of those organisations I have just mentioned. It was with considerable difficulty that we finally got the Government to agree with our point of view.

I hope that the Minister will be able to say what Mr Howe has said in answer to the letter and why it is that this group is not included in the list of bodies which may nominate Institute members. I can only question the Government's motives. As I have said, perhaps the Council on the Ageing is just not one of those groups that appeal to Mr Howe.

The fact is that the nominations that may come forward from the 10 groups were listed in a schedule which included the Australian Medical Association and the Australian Hospital Association. It can be expected that nominations will come forward from those bodies. It is outrageous to make a presumption in the terms that Senator Walters did about the response of the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) to the list of names that will come forward from those organisations. As I say, I believe that Senator Walters's fears have been stated in an exaggerated form and in the context of a much wider argument about her view of the Government's dealing with general practitioners, in particular, and perhaps the medical profession generally.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the bodies which have been nominated represent a very good span of those who have such knowledge as would enable them to put forward persons of eminence who are able to assist the Institute in conducting its various functions.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The object of the exercise to start with was to move the Institute into areas such as housing. For that reason, there needed to be an expansion. This list of bodies that may nominate board members is a sensible way to deal with the expansion of the board. Senator Reid has properly asked whether those who have a particular concern with the interests of the aged in our community and their receiving of health care are properly represented. I suppose it is possible to list two, three, four, five or more organisations as nominating bodies in this respect. I imagine that bodies such as the Australian Pensioners and Superannuants Federation, the Catholic Social Welfare Commission, the Consumers Health Forum of Australia, perhaps the Australian Council of Social Service, although not as specifically, will have elements within them who would be able to understand the sorts of concerns that might otherwise be put by other bodies. I am quite sure that the interests of the aged in the operations of this Institute, in so far as it may have impact on the provision of health care to that sector of the population, can be adequately dealt with by the nominations coming forward from those bodies listed in the schedule. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the nomination process is a reasonable compromise&mdash;I think that is a term that has been used. It has sufficient merit to be regarded as a proper process and not simply as some sort of lowest common denominator result of exhaustion on the part of the Labor Party, the Minister's office and the Democrats, as has been portrayed. It is a sensible arrangement that will enable the Institute to undertake its extended task to focus on welfare and housing statistics, which it is being asked to be involved in. It is an important extension. The board needs to reflect that extension. This process allows that to take place. I believe that the proposal put by the Government ought to be supported and the Opposition amendment, for that reason, rejected.</PARA>

I believe that it is a sensible proposal which obviously has had sufficient merit to be attractive to the Democrats as a proposal in its own right. I do not believe that taking up a fall back position if this Government amendment is rejected is a proper way to look at this situation. The Government puts this forward in good faith as a sensible proposal. The Democrats put it forward and have given their support to it as a sensible proposal.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I was discussing this issue with the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe) and not with Senator Tate, perhaps I could fill the Committee in. The Minister basically expressed the view to us that what the Senate had ended up with last year had far too much medical bias and was, in effect, again going to be looking at just medical issues as opposed to broadening the Institute out by looking at welfare and housing issues. He also was very concerned at the size of board we had ended up with. He did, however, concede the value of consumer representation. I add that we wish that this had been a part of the discussions last year; but it was not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, he argued very strongly that we not go beyond 15 and that we not get back to a situation where we would have medical bias as opposed to broad representation, where other groups were able to have their place on the board, providing a reasonable balance. We tried to negotiate for an additional number of people on the board at that stage. The comment was made to us: `We might as well stay where we are because we now have a board dealing with health issues. The board the Senate has set up is very heavily weighted towards looking at health again'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also agree with the way Senator Tate put it. We have reached a reasonable compromise and the board we will now be looking at has four possibilities for consumer representation. I really cannot understand this continuing argument that somehow the AMA will not be considered. It depends on who it puts forward. It may, indeed, decide to talk to such organisations as the Public Health Association. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other organisations in the past have worked together to nominate someone for the board, and I think that was mentioned in the letter read out by Senator Reid. I cannot understand how we are automatically excluding health people. Obviously, two still are wanted, but not four. This is where we have come to an understanding and where the Government has finally agreed that the body should actually be listed. The big difference between where we were last year and where we are now is that then the Government would not agree at all that anyone should actually be listed in the legislation. </PARA>

That, to my mind, is simply a way of characterising the amendments that are favoured by the Opposition as not really dealing with the problem of too much weight, as he saw it, being given to those with medical expertise. I see it as no stronger a comment than that and certainly not as the one which has been characterised as a threat by Opposition senators. I am sure it was not regarded as such by Senator Lees.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is the first time I have entered this debate. I have previously, in private, expressed my concern not so much about the direction that this body might take but about the possibility that the impeccable nature of its research and statistics might in some way be diluted by decisions being made by the Government. I ask the Minister: why has the Government used its numbers in the House of Representatives to amend the schedule of amendments made by the Senate in respect of the two bodies to which Senator Walters referred?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the Senate is owed a reasonable explanation of that. To date I have not heard such an explanation and I am wanting to hear it. Maybe the Minister told the Democrats in private why, but I think the Senate Committee of the Whole is entitled to hear from the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate) why the Australian Medical Association&mdash;for whom I am not going in to bat&mdash;the Australian Hospitals Association and the Australian Private Hospitals' Association have, in effect, been blackballed by the Minister. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe that Senator Harradine, in his final remarks, indicates that he has not understood the way in which the Government proposal will work. It is certainly not intended to blackball the AMA or the Private Hospitals Association but, rather than having a board composed of representatives of particular named organisations, the board is to be composed of persons with expertise in various areas, and those persons are to be drawn from a list of nominees of those organisations set out in the Schedule, including the AMA, the Australian Private Hospitals' Association and the Australian Hospitals Association.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that it is a different method of composing the board in a way which will ensure that it sufficiently covers the expanding interests and tasks given to the Institute by this Parliament. I am sure that anyone on this board would regard it as a great honour and perform his or her functions with integrity, but it doubly ensures that those who are appointed are there because of their personal expertise and capacity to contribute rather than simply being a member of a particular organisation. I think that that has merit too. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is just a simple difference that has emerged in what is regarded as a good way to ensure that the sort of expertise that is required is available to the board of the Institute and it has nothing to do with blackballing. As I have indicated, in answer to Senator Patterson, it is quite probable that the AMA, the Private Hospitals' Association and the Australian Hospitals Association will nominate people who are in fact members of the AMA or are associated with the provision of hospital care in Australia. It may well be that those nominees find favour when the Minister makes his decision to appoint members to the board. There is certainly no blackballing of persons associated with those very worthy organisations, whose worth is recognised by their presence in the schedule of bodies that may nominate board members. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have not misunderstood, as Senator Tate alleges, the purport of the Government's decision. In fact, what he has now told the Committee only reinforces my view that the Government's decision, in effect, blackballs the AMA.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was for many years a member of the Australian Council of Trade Unions. We found ourselves placed in a similar position by the then Government in respect of appointments to a particular board. We would not accept the situation whereby our nominee might or might not be accepted by the Government; that the Government might appoint a person who might be a member of a union affiliated with the ACTU or might indeed appoint somebody on the ACTU executive who may not have the confidence of the ACTU. We felt blackballed, and I imagine the AMA similarly is entitled to feel blackballed by the decision of the Government in this case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the Minister is really saying is that the Government, or the Minister, will decide. The Minister said&mdash;these are his words, not mine&mdash;that the AMA may nominate a person and, if that person finds favour with the Minister, that person will be appointed. What if the person does not find favour with the Minister? What does he or she have to do to find favour with the Minister&mdash;accept the Government's view of health? Is that what it means? If that is what it means, the credibility of the Australian Institute of Health is at stake.

The Australian Democrats are not going to support ours because the Bill will come back from the House of Representatives if the coalition's amendments are agreed to. I want to ask the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate) a question. I have asked him this a number of times in various ways. I suppose he will say to me that he cannot look into a crystal ball and tell what the House of Representatives will do, but his Party has the numbers in the House of Representatives. I ask him: If the Democrats were to agree with our amendments, would the Bill come back to the Senate without the approval of the House of Representatives? That is what we want to know.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not possible to predict what would happen in the House of Representatives, despite Senator Patterson putting this as though it were a simple matter. I think it would be the third time that it had gone down there. I have indicated the basic position&mdash;namely, that the Government would not be able to countenance the Australian Institute of Health working with the board in its simple form, as was appropriate to its more restricted range of functions. I do not know what would happen if there were an absolute impasse again between these chambers in order to enable the board to be constituted in a way which reflected the wider range of functions, but I do believe that it has been sufficiently indicated that what the Opposition has put forward is not acceptable to the Government. That is why we believe the amendments that the Government is proposing sufficiently provide for the composition of the board and the Senate ought to get on with dealing with the vote.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I find this incredible. The Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate) has just said that he has no idea what the House of Representatives would do. He has two officers beside him who could ring the Minister and find out for this chamber what action would be taken in the House of Representatives. Why will the Minister not do that? At the moment, we have amendments before the chamber that include two bodies which are essential, we believe, to the smooth running and credibility of the Australian Institute of Health, that is, the Australian Medical Association and the hospitals.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister will not even ask one of his officers to go out and ring the responsible Minister and find out what the House of Representatives will do. Why will the Minister not do that? We know jolly well why the Minister will not do that: because the Democrats are clinging by the skin of their toes to&mdash;and let us get it clear&mdash;a new reason for not supporting our amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They came into the Senate today and told us that the real reason why they are not supporting our amendments is that the Minister had threatened them. Okay, they do not like the word `threatened'. They said that the Minister had said that if they do support our amendments the status quo would remain and the Government would revert to the original legislation. Senator Lees told us that in her speech. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was the excuse for refusing to support our amendments. The Minister was then asked whether that was true and he said, `No, that is not true. We would not revert to the original legislation. We would not have the status quo. We would include those consumer groups'. The Minister gave that assurance in the Senate. The Democrats, I might add, had said previously today that they stuck with their original argument in the debate in December, that the AMA and the private hospitals played a very important part and their expertise was really essential for this Institute. Senator Lees told us that she wanted to support us but she could not, because the Government had said it would revert to the original legislation and maintain the status quo. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We asked for time for the Democrats to work it out; we asked for progress to be reported. The Democrats voted against that and sat with the Minister all the way through that division, shoring up the fact that they would be supporting the Government&mdash;and we now have a change. Senator Lees now tells us that, after all, she is not supporting our amendments because the Minister had said we would go back to the status quo. She has now changed her position. She is now saying the reason she is not supporting our amendments is not that the Government said it would go back to the status quo. No, it is not that. The reason is that if we sent the Bill down to the House of Representatives&mdash;she still, I might add, wants to support our amendments&mdash;the House of Representatives would only send it back again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Patterson very rightly said, `Is that a fact, Minister?' First of all, Senator Patterson said to the Minister, `Is it a fact that the Democrats' excuse for not supporting us is the status quo threat?', and he said, `No, that is not true'. So now Senator Patterson says to him, `Is it a fact that the Bill will be returned again?', and he says, `I do not know', and he will not ask one of his officers to find out for the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I invite honourable senators to tell me what credibility the Board of the Australian Institute of Health could have without membership from the medical profession and the hospitals, both public and private. The credibility is zilch&mdash;none at all. The Minister says that they could come in under peak bodies promoting research into public health issues and they could come in representing consumers of health services&mdash;doctors representing consumers of health services. When I asked the Minister whether he could give me a guarantee that they would be accepted under either of those headings, he said, `No, I will not, and I cannot'. He will not and he cannot because the Government is not going to&mdash;and it is very clear why it is not going to: they were deliberately excluded by the Government when this Senate sent down to the House of Representatives an amendment deliberately including them. The Government deliberately excluded them, and it is no use the Minister saying that that is not accurate. It is there in black and white. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Chairman, I find it extraordinary that the Government does not accept our amendments. It is excluding a body representative of more than 20,000 doctors in this country. Although it has been said that every doctor in the country is a member of the AMA, 60 per cent of them pay the fees. It is excluding 600 public hospitals in this country, represented by the Australian Hospitals Association, which has some small membership of the private hospitals. There is a total of about 900 hospitals in this country&mdash;330 private hospitals and 600 public hospitals.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Hospitals Association primarily represents the public hospitals; in other words, those staffed by full time doctors and nurses. They are being excluded from a body whose primary purpose is to do research and which aims at promoting health in this country. Instead, we have a whole group of consumers of health services, consumers of welfare services and consumers of housing assistance services, and a peak body representing research into public health associations&mdash;all nominated by the Minister. I agree with Senator Tate: I would be amazed if people from the AMA or from the Australian Hospitals Association were not included.

If there is concern that the expansion of the Institute will cause a bias towards health and insufficient concentration on housing and welfare services, the Minister can address that and balance it out by the appointing of his three nominees. To use such an excuse is just a furphy and does not support his argument at all. I just want to put that on the record.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I remind the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade of the agreed statement of the Commonwealth Foreign Ministers on South Africa in London in February 1991 that sanctions should be retained until `fundamental and irreversible change has been secured'. I remind the Minister of his statement of last week that the reform process in South Africa was `now absolutely irreversible'. When did the Australian Government move the goalposts and abandon the irreversible change test and impose as a new test the Keating statement of yesterday that the Australian Government will not lift sanctions until a democratic, non-racial government is established and a non-racial constitution is agreed upon? Is the Keating statement now Government policy or would the Labor Party and the Minister abandon these new conditions if the ANC gave them permission to do so?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1048" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like the Bourbons of old, it has often been said that the Opposition learns nothing and forgets nothing. There could never have been a clearer demonstration of the utility of the whole sanctions process than the outcome of the recent referendum. The inability and unwillingness of the South African people to go back to a situation where they were the pariahs of the world, where they were denied access to sporting contacts and where everything else that had created that status for them as pariahs was in place, were obviously crucial reasons for the yes vote. The continuation of a kind of policy on sanctions which is embodied in the Commonwealth formula is absolutely crucial, and will go on being crucial, to the future of this process as it has been in the past. The phased relaxation of sanctions reflecting phased developments in the constitutional process in South Africa is our policy, has been our policy and will remain our policy, and nothing the Prime Minister said diverged from that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question of the irreversibility of the whole process is one that involves, in the way the Opposition puts it, no more than a play on words. It is perfectly possible to make the judgment, as I have for some time now, that the process itself is irreversible, but to take the view simultaneously that the speed at which each particular part of that process falls into place, the facility with which it falls into place and the legitimacy in the sense of the acceptability with which it falls into place, still need the discipline of external sanctions and still need the prospect of some sort of external pressure hanging over the heads of the players. That is the very clear view of the ANC, whose claim to credibility in this respect is clearly the fact that it represents the overwhelming majority of the overwhelming proportion of the South African population.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the view, obviously, of all of the other black players in the process, possibly with the exception of the Inkatha&mdash;one never knows quite where it is on the question of sanctions at this stage. The process may be set firmly on the course of long term achievement. But we saw all too unhappily last year that the capacity of the National Government to drag its feet, to seek political advantage from the way in which that process actually works in terms of the timing of it and each particular step of it, is always there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very important indeed that there continue to be some kind of disciplined focus on the National Party to ensure that, however much we might have confidence in its overall direction, it does in fact produce the goods. The whole point of the sanctions policy, as we have constantly said, is not to reward rhetoric, it is not to reward good intentions; it is to reward results. The truth of the matter is that the results are not yet firmly and finally on the board.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next stage of the process is, we all hope, agreement on appropriate transitional mechanisms, using the language of the Commonwealth communique last year. It is everyone's hope that there will be agreement on such transitional mechanisms reached at the next meeting of the CODESA, the Convention for a Democratic South Africa, which is scheduled to take place before the end of April. There is some preliminary skirmishing going on at the moment between different models for what that transition government should be, but there is obviously a rapidly growing convergence between the positions of the respective parties on that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If that transitional mechanism is agreed between the parties at CODESA next month, then it will be appropriate to lift trade and investment sanctions. If there is further agreement next month, or at any stage thereafter, that all remaining sanctions, or at least financial sanctions, should be lifted, then we will of course, consistent with Commonwealth policy, fall into place on that. There is some indication that it might be possible as early again as the end of next month to be in a position of lifting financial sanctions as well as trade and investment sanctions. We will simply have to see. The position Australia has taken in this respect, which I have articulated, which the Prime Minister has articulated, is no more and no less than the Commonwealth position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might say finally that I had a phone call this morning from the Chairman of the Commonwealth Foreign Ministers Committee, the Canadian External Affairs Minister Barbara McDougall, and it was perfectly clear from that conversation that that is the Canadian Government's position&mdash;the one that I am articulating at the moment&mdash;and it will remain the Commonwealth's position.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce. In the light of his comments at Question Time yesterday about the protection of the textile, clothing and footwear industries, can the Minister advise the Senate of the precise levels of protection for these industries? Can he further advise the Senate of details of the Government's proposals for a phase-down of protection levels up to the year 2000? Can the Minister tell the Senate whether he has examined the proposals for the abolition of all tariffs on Australian industries, particularly the TCF industries, and the withdrawal of Government support for restructuring in the TCF industries?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1050" SPEAKER="Button Sen The Hon J.N." NAMEID="4F4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRY, TECHNOLOGY AND COMMERCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There has been some comment in the media and elsewhere, and indeed even amongst members of the Opposition, on the alleged effects of tariff reductions generally and tariff reductions in the TCF sector particularly. Much of the comment has been ill-informed about the actual levels of protection afforded particular industries. The Government has announced a phase-down of tariff protection for TCF, a phase-down which gives them to the year 2000 to adjust and restructure and move into more competitive sectors of the industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time the Government has committed funds to assist companies in restructuring. An additional $51m for this was announced by the Prime Minister in the One Nation economic statement last month. That is because it is the Government's view that, in assisting industries through a transition period from levels of high protection to levels of relatively low protection, there is a government role in assisting in that restructuring process. The Government's aim in all of this is to develop internationally competitive TCF industries and to reduce the costs of TCF products to Australian consumers, particularly clothing and footwear.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is precisely because of that enormous labour cost disability that these industries have to restructure; not in terms of reducing wages here below a reasonable and appropriate level, but because of the competitive pressure from countries with low labour costs and, perhaps in some circumstances, better raw materials. The cost of clothing and footwear to every consumer in this country is high in relative terms. Every teenager who buys a pair of Reeboks knows that.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Walters, in her normal spirit of largess and charity, is endeavouring to help. For once she is following the argument. I welcome her words of warm support on this issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Childs asked what the actual levels of tariff protection are. In 1992 clothing manufacturers enjoy a protection level of 51 per cent. In the year 2000, under the phase-down program, that will be 25 per cent. At that stage it will be at least five times the manufacturing average. By 1996 the level of protection afforded these industries will be 10 times the manufacturing average. The 25 per cent figure at the year 2000 will be the highest level of protection for any industry. Footwear tariffs in 1992 will be 41 per cent, phasing to 15 per cent in the year 2000. Import quotas will end in February or March next year, which will have an effect on the industry, but the tariff figures are the ones that will remain and it is important for people to have these figures in their minds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposals put forward by the Government represent a staged plan of transition for these industries. They contrast with Opposition proposals about a zero tariff in the year 2000 under the Liberals' consumption tax package. That is a very big difference. The Government understands that in a country like Australia, which is trying to compete internationally, it has to nurture and build on the industries which it has. Industries such as TCF and motor vehicles will have a 15 per cent tariff by the year 2000 and no tariff under the Opposition's proposals. It is those sorts of figures that will help these industries restructure and improve their export performance, particularly in the case of motor vehicles.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition understands none of this. The Opposition has gone from a high tariff party to a zero tariff party just because of the arrival of John Hewson and Ian McLachlan.

It says that if we have a new tax, a goods and services tax, then we can reduce all tariffs to zero.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ship turnaround times are currently on average 20 to 30 per cent faster because of improved container exchange rates, and truck turnaround times have been reduced to something between 10 and 20 minutes. These achievements are applying pressures to the cost structures of shipping cargo. There is fierce price competition between stevedores, as anyone who reads the trade papers in this industry will know, and current contracts are being negotiated at between 20 and 30 per cent less than the same contracts negotiated last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, as I continue to say in the Senate, other elements in the seagoing transport equation&mdash;in particular, port authorities and the linkages with land transport, which are principally State government issues&mdash;must be similarly encouraged to lift efficiency. The Government has announced terms of reference for an inquiry into port authority operations&mdash;these were given to the Industry Commission&mdash;to add impetus to waterfront reform. The Government has also initiated a Prices Surveillance Authority examination of land based charges imposed by the shipping companies aimed at opening out the components of port related costs passed on to shippers. These initiatives were announced by the Prime Minister in the recent One Nation statement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ultimately, the reflection of lower waterfront costs&mdash;and they are significantly lower&mdash;in shipping freight rates is one component amongst the various price and service components that are resolved through commercial negotiations between shipping companies and their customers.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Jones raises a point, which is extremely important in our credit dependent society, about the way in which guarantees are sought by financial institutions. A borrower comes forward and perhaps there is a misgiving or a question mark in the mind of the local bank manager, for example, as to whether the person has the capacity to repay the loan over some time. The institution then seeks, for example, a partner, a spouse, a parent or some other relative or close friend to act as guarantor. In some circles, the expression `sexually transmitted debt' is used. It refers to the fact that a spouse or partner might take on the obligation of a guarantor because of emotional ties rather than a real assessment of the vulnerability to some sort of risk that might be undertaken. Certainly there must be many instances where that is the case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, I recall last year telling the Senate of a case where an elderly immigrant couple provided a number of personal and business guarantees in relation to a loan offered by the National Bank to their son. This elderly immigrant couple were poorly educated with not much of a grasp of English&mdash;certainly not of business matters&mdash;and both were pensioners and dependent on the bank manager for financial guidance. The bank manager, it was alleged, knew that the state of the son's business was poor but, nevertheless, did not make this information available to the parents who then acted as guarantors. The TPC instituted proceedings on behalf of the parents against the bank which tried to enforce the guarantee alleging unconscionable conduct. The case was eventually settled and the National Bank introduced new methods of dealing with guarantors in its various branches.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a very great problem. Therefore, I have asked the Attorney-General's Department to look at privacy legislation to ensure that there are no impediments to guarantors being made fully aware of the true financial status of the borrower who is seeking the loan and their assistance as a backup. I believe it is very important that that be the case. Indeed, under the Privacy Act at the moment it is quite open to a guarantor to ask the potential borrower to give permission to obtain the credit reference file. That would go a long way towards ensuring that decisions are made without emotions clouding the issue and that people undertake these guarantees&mdash;which can of course, if they are enforced, even lead to the loss of a family home&mdash;with the fullest information possible.</PARA>

Therefore I ask: can the Minister advise how many times in the last 12 months the CAA has called upon the North Queensland Emergency Response Group to mount rescue operations? Is it true that last week the CAA used the Emergency Response Group to locate the wreckage of a plane that crashed outside Ingham, with the loss of three lives? Is it also true that the Emergency Response Group responded this week to a CAA call when three men went missing in a dinghy and were subsequently found by the Emergency Response Group? How will the Government meet its international rescue obligations in north Queensland if the Emergency Response Group ceases to operate after 30 June this year?

From 1977 to 1988, the Department of Social Security provided some administrative funding to that centre to assist with salaries and running costs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was part of an agreement between the Department of Social Security and the Community Services Department in Victoria. It was about $60,000 a year, in round figures. The funding agreement expired in June 1988. Funding was continued while there was a review of the situation. As a result of that review, the decision was taken not to continue funding the centre, which is not to say that the centre does not fulfil a very valuable role. Like many other welfare agencies, it receives referrals from Social Security, because there are many needs in the community that cannot be satisfied in a Social Security office. It is customary in every Social Security office every day of the year for referrals to be made to centres of that kind mainly because they fulfil functions that are outside the scope of the Department. As the Department expanded the coverage of that centre from the late 1970s to now, the need for Social Security funding of it became less.</PARA>

As I understand it, an application has been received by the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services for funding, and that is currently being considered by the Minister.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday Senator Alston asked me a question concerning labour market program expenditure. The Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services  has received the following advice from his Department, the Department of Employment, Education and Training:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DEET advises that there is no basis for the claim by Senator Alston that there will be an underspend of $69 million against a provision of $454 million in the 1991 Budget for labour market programs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Rates of expenditure under labour market programs vary markedly over the course of the year reflecting a range of seasonal factors including the tendency of many training institutions to reduce their level of activity over the Christmas/New Year period.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However to 24 March 1992 expenditure on labour market programs totalled $358 million out of a total provision in the 1991/92 Budget of $454 million, equivalent to 79% of the total budget allocation. Pro rata expenditure over that period would have been 73% of the total budget allocation. Expenditure to 24 March 1992 is therefore more than $27 million over the pro rata.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the Government is further increasing its rate of expenditure under labour market programs to assist unemployed people in acquiring skills and generally enhancing their capacity to obtain employment over the remainder of this year and next year, there will be an increased overall level of expenditure this financial year. DEET therefore anticipates that the additional funds sought in the Additional Estimates Bills will be close to fully utilised in this financial year.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During Question Time today, in response to a question from Senator Childs about the Government's tariff policies and other tariff policies, the Leader of the Government, Senator Button, made a totally misleading attack on the coalition's proposals for and policies towards tariffs as contained in the coalition's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback</EMPHASIS> document. I am very surprised that Senator Button took what was no more than an attempted cheap political shot. Yesterday he attacked Senator Spindler for doing precisely the same thing. Today, I regret to say, the responsible Minister for tariff and industry policy in this nation has done exactly the same thing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason why Senator Button's answer today was so totally misleading was that he completely omitted to mention the environment within which the coalition's tariff policies are framed. If he looked at page 57 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback</EMPHASIS> document summary he would find, in a section dealing with tariff reform and anti-dumping measures, the following statement:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However it is important to recognise that tariff reduction should proceed in tandem with genuine micro-reform which is designed to reduce or eliminate the major cost disadvantages which bedevil our industries. The Hawke Government has failed to deliver the necessary reform and more recently has compounded this failing by its interest rate and exchange rate policies.</PARA>
<PARA>The next paragraph goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Liberal and National Parties will cut tariffs to negligible levels by the Year 2000 as part of a reform agenda which allows our firms to take on the best in the world and win. In this respect, tariff cuts are not an attempt to create a "level playing field" in international trade. . . we are putting our own domestic house in order. We are eliminating unnecessary domestic costs so that our export industries can become leaner and more competitive.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If Senator Button was attempting to give the Senate today a balanced comment in relation to the coalition's proposals on tariffs he would have acknowledged those statements. The fundamental difference between this side of the Parliament and the Government side is that we look at tariff policy in the context of the need for tariffs. They relate entirely to the cost structure and the competitiveness of Australian industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Senator Button is really serious about a meaningful reduction in costs and the building of a competitive environment in which Australian industry can operate with the reduction in tariffs that the Government is proposing, why has the Government not reduced the biggest killer of jobs and competitiveness in Australia, payroll tax? Why has the Government not taken off industry the fuel excise burden of almost $4 billion a year? Why does not the Government take off industry the almost $7 billion a year cost impost of the wholesale sales tax system?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why does not the Government take the other tax measures that have been proposed in the coalition's Fightback proposals to get government costs off the back of industry to allow industry to be competitive, cost reducing, efficient and able to compete properly against imports in both the international markets and our domestic market? That is the fundamental difference between the Government's tariff policy and the coalition's tariff policy. The coalition's tariff policy is the end result of the reductions in cost that sensible, proper policy measures will produce. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Time and again the Government has refused to take any of the measures necessary to enable industry to survive in a lower inflation context. The Government should not get up on its high horse and take the high moral ground when talking about its approach to industry. Senator Button should go out and ask industry of its greatest imposts and problems in relation to its ability to compete not only overseas but also domestically. Time and again he will find essentially that industry&mdash;and, very importantly, this includes tariffs and motor vehicles&mdash;cannot compete in this country because of the costs that the Government's lack of micro-economic reform and its abjectly failed macro policies have produced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has produced the highest interest rates in the Western world and the highest cost structure within which industry has to operate in this country. It has failed to take any of the measures that industry and every Australian knows are necessary to enable our industries, be they manufacturing or any other industries, to breathe, grow and create jobs for the Australians who are out of work as a result of the Government's policies&mdash;the 1 1/2 million Australians who are either underemployed or unemployed as the deliberate and direct result of the Government's financial bungling, mismanagement and incompetence.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy President. I have received a little message from my team. It says, `Everything good is worth waiting for; what is five minutes more?'. I am not sure that I can live up to 25 minutes more. The quote in the `Trust the Women' exhibition that `The greatest problem is getting into the place' has certainly proved true for me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to pay tribute at this point to my loyal team, who have endured the discomfort and hardship with me for the 40 days in the wilderness between Jo Vallentine's resignation and my appointment. Their dedication and commitment have been inspiring, as has been the support of friends both within and outside the Greens (WA). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The delay I have experienced has been interesting as well as frustrating, and has certainly whetted my appetite for active participation in the parliamentary arena. I would also like to express my appreciation for the support I received from the Senate while I was experiencing the difficulties caused by the Western Australian Government's failure to expedite the filling of the Senate vacancy. I look forward to a continuation of that support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As foreshadowed in my notice of motion yesterday, I see my first task as endeavouring to ensure that the lack of complete representation of the States will not recur and that future colleagues will not experience similar problems to those I have experienced. While grateful for the motion passed in the Senate and to Senator Coulter for presenting it, I regret the opportunity it provided for some speakers in the debate to denigrate my predecessor in her absence. I regard Jo Vallentine as a courageous, committed, honest and pioneering woman who truly represented her electors. She was the voice for many people, not only in Western Australia&mdash;indeed, throughout Australia&mdash;but also the world. She was the first parliamentarian in the world to be elected on the issue of nuclear disarmament, and the peace movement viewed her as a beacon of light in the darkness of world politics at that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is always easier to honour a pioneer or a prophet with the benefit of hindsight. I could not help thinking of Jo Vallentine when Senator Giles told the story of Muriel Matters in her excellent opening speech at the `Trust the Women' exhibition, and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Muriel Matters travelled to Britain to join the Women's Freedom League after Australian women achieved the vote in 1902. She was a talented speaker, performed regularly in Hyde Park on Sunday afternoons, and threw herself wholeheartedly into the campaign for women's suffrage. She was among those who chained themselves to a grille in the Ladies Gallery in the House of Commons, whence she harangued the Honourable Members. In 1909 she floated over Westminster in a balloon shouting `votes for women' through a megaphone.</PARA>
<PARA>Muriel Matters was imprisoned for her actions. It is obvious that she did not receive a positive response from the Establishment of her time. I believe that people 50 years from now will remember more as a heroine than a heretic the honourable senator who cried out from the gallery `Shame!  You promised you'd never do it' to the Prime Minister as he committed Australia to war. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">History's verdict may well be kinder to Jo Vallentine than to any of the rest of us here. I regard her as a pioneer and feel it a privilege to follow her and build upon the foundation that she laid for me when she became the first senator for the Greens (WA) two years ago. I must stress that unlike Jo, who started her political career as an Independent, I do not regard myself as an Independent, but succeed her in her later role as the first Greens senator here, soon to be followed by a second, a third and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this point I would like to explain the underlying philosophy of Green politics because, particularly in Australia, the implications of the word `Green' are not fully understood. While it is often limited to leafy trees and furry animals, `Green' has actually become the symbol for a change in perspective that has arisen in different parts of the world in the past 10 to 20 years. Its earliest beginnings were seen as the environment movement, feminism, the anti-nuclear movement and other alternative movements that have emerged and increased in importance since the early 1970s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many different paths lead individuals towards a Green political involvement. Jo Vallentine's path came from the peace movement. Other well known figures like Christine Milne and Bob Brown became involved through their deep concern for the environment. My path was the area of social justice. Working for 10 years as a clinical psychologist in a maximum security prison for males was a radicalising experience which forced me to challenge, in the deepest possible way, the sincerity and integrity of my own values and beliefs and those of the society to which I belonged. I believe that experience will also help me when I am in other institutions, and I do not think the example is inappropriate in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On entering the prison system, I assumed that everyone in prison deserved to be there and that law was about truth and justice. To my amazement, I found that many people who were in positions of power deserved to be in prison and prisons were full of the poor and the powerless. I choose one example from a myriad to illustrate my point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Western Australia where Aboriginal people constitute 2 per cent of the State population, the 1991 Parliamentary Sub-committee on Parole reported that of all people who were held in police lock-ups in the year preceding the report, 97 per cent were Aboriginal. It also reported that 45 per cent of all of those imprisoned in that year were Aboriginal. Those figures speak for themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was also surprised to see the connection between justice issues and political and economic processes.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some years ago in a study of worldwide attitudes regarding capital punishment, I read a United Nations publication that was examining the factors influencing death penalty legislation in various countries throughout the world. To my surprise, the most common factor influencing attitudes towards the death penalty was not found to be religious, moral or philosophical, but economic. In countries which had experienced a period of affluence followed by a recession, there was a political shift towards the Right, law and order became more common as an electoral platform and calls for the death penalty increased. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are seeing signs of this in Australia today. An example is the recent juvenile justice legislation introduced by the Western Australia Government which, as the Premier, Dr Lawrence, stated, now provides the harshest penalties for juveniles in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While working in Bangladesh in a medical and community development project for three years, I began to see the connection between social equity and the ability to protect the environment. Need and greed are two factors which seriously influence the capacity or will to safeguard the environment we have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far I have touched on two of the four pillars of Green politics&mdash;peace and social justice. Another, and the most well known, is environmental responsibility. What is less well known is that this is inextricably linked to economics. Central to Green politics is the connection between the economic well-being of a society and an ecologically sustainable plan for future generations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">William Rees points to the need for fundamental changes in a paper recently published in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Ecologist</EMPHASIS>, where he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The evidence suggests. . . that we may be fast approaching absolute limits to material economic growth. We no longer have the luxury of `trading off' ecological damage for economic benefits if we hope to have a sustainable future. The maintenance of global ecological integrity necessarily becomes our highest priority and must be taken account of in every local and regional development decision.</PARA>
<PARA>Rees sees this emphasis as requiring:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a profound shift in societal values and attitudes, and a significant restructuring of national and global economies. On the positive side, the attitudinal changes and policy responses. . . have the potential to produce a more politically secure, ecologically stable and economically just global society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens' modus operandi is the antithesis of economic rationalism. It is a holistic perspective that reflects the inter-relatedness and inter-connectedness of the world and all in it. The `externals' of the well-being of the environment and the people and living things in it must be part of the equation when making economic decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens have been accused of putting the environment before people and jobs. Protection of the environment has also been spoken of as a luxury we cannot afford because we desperately need jobs. Not only is this foolish in terms of our long term well-being, it is simply not true. Ian Lowe from Griffith University states in his paper, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The politics of long-term issues:</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the green movement offers the only significant countervailing force to the tyranny of the short-term-</PARA>
<PARA>which, he believes, is operating in the political arena. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Conservation Foundation, Greenpeace and the Wilderness Society, among others, have clearly outlined the employment opportunities in ecologically sustainable industry, in particular through the realignment of the timber industry onto a plantation base. Research shows that there are employment opportunities in energy efficiency and that there are more jobs in energy from renewable sources than fossil fuel sources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While environmental responsibility allows for employment and ecologically sustainable development, the point needs to be made that there is a logical contradiction between the economists' belief in the `market' and concerns for social justice and equity. I again cite Ian Lowe, in his Boyer lecture `Who's Paying the Driver?':</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Economists tend to believe in markets because they think they are the most efficient means of allocating resources between competing interests. Whether this is true or not, even the most besotted admirer of markets would probably not claim that they contain any feature or mechanism which could promote equity, even in principle. Indeed there is a fundamental sense in which markets will always promote inequity. If a market is used to allocate a scarce resource, whether it is beach-front land or a team of accomplished professional footballers, those with large bank accounts will always be able to outbid those with lighter wallets. Thus allocation through a market means those who are rich will get what they want and those who are poor will miss out. Those of us who are not rich are limited to competing for those things which the rich do not want sufficiently to bid the price up out of our reach.</PARA>
<PARA>Encouraging further employment, by way of incentives and concessions, in areas like construction and resource development does not make sense economically, socially or environmentally. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>We end up with large sections of the work force, and much of the available capital, in areas subject to big fluctuations in employment as a result of a dependence on world markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as the environmental cost in terms of depletion of the earth's life-giving resources, there is a great social cost to those under-represented in the labour forces&mdash;women, Aboriginal people and young people. For these strategies to benefit those social groups who have large unemployment or a tendency to be concentrated in low wage areas and part time work, their special needs must also be targeted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am well aware that there will be senators and members of this Parliament who share a deep concern for at least some of these issues I have mentioned. I am also aware that some present have an impressive history of championing these causes. I look forward with pleasure to working with others of all political persuasions wherever our respective concerns coincide&mdash;a very practical and necessary approach considering my solitary position in this Senate. It does not matter who is responsible for an issue being addressed as long as it is addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The common thread that unites all those who come into the political arena as Greens, and which sets us apart from other political parties, is a profound conviction that the structures and old ways of addressing the problems will not be effective. While cynicism and apathy regarding politics and politicians engulf the Australian community, as they have done elsewhere, there is a small but growing minority that has not given up but is seeking a revolutionary change in the political system.   This revolution, which may be more appropriately called a transformation because it utilises that which is good from the past, is centred on the political process rather than the issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Grassroots participation is the fourth and most crucial pillar of Green politics. One of the advantages of participatory democracy is that it is possible to get input from groups and individuals not usually heard. Decisions can be made and action decided after consideration of a variety of perspectives. Through this process the special needs of groups that are disadvantaged because of the dominance of interests different from their own become heard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One such group is women. When people talk about equality for women, what they usually mean is that women must become like men so they can compete, receive recognition, and have some say in a world ordered according to values most often associated with men. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Integral to small `l' liberal theory is the notion of individuals as competing with each other for scarce resources. It underlies the dominant ideology of our current society&mdash;economic rationalism&mdash;and permeates the institutions and structures of public life, which is the realm of the masculine. What the Greens are trying to do is bring those values traditionally associated with women and the private spheres of home and family into the public arena&mdash;namely, non-violence, cooperation, nurturing, a respect for all people, all other life-forms and our environment and an acceptance of diversity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Electoral systems are only one aspect of ensuring community participation in the political process. We also need a commitment of political will towards grassroots consultation. Like all comprehensive proportional representation systems, Hare-Clark more accurately reflects the diversity of political opinion and community expression than other electoral systems. Hare-Clark creates a stable system for political groups to operate under, while providing the electorate with alternative individual representation. It is just one example, but it illustrates the Greens' conviction that the adversarial processes of election and parliamentary debate must be broken down. True community representation, consultation and agreement come out of processes that attempt to take full account of the widest point of view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Party politics has floated away from the world of ordinary people like Muriel Matters' balloon. Challenging this and returning to responsible, accountable community consultation and grassroots involvement in the political process is the key to Green politics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fritjof Capra, in his book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Turning Point</EMPHASIS>, suggests that the present civilisation is under challenge from three transitions which shape the very foundation of our lives and will deeply affect our social, economic and political system. The first and most profound is the slow, reluctant but inevitable decline of patriarchy. The second transition is forced on us by the decline of the fossil fuel age, while the third is connected with a shift in cultural values&mdash;a profound change in thoughts and perceptions that we need to have away from a mechanistic Newtonian world view to an ecological world view. As Capra says, we are reaching the turning point. These transitions involve not only a crisis of individuals, governments or social institutions; they are all contributing to our global crisis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I shall read an analysis that Fritjof Capra quotes of Toynbee's account of the rise and fall of civilisation. I would like honourable senators to listen for where I think the Greens are being referred to. Fritjof Capra states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After civilisations have reached a peak of vitality, they tend to lose their cultural steam and decline. An essential element in this cultural breakdown, according to Toynbee, is a loss of flexibility. When social structures and behaviour patterns have become so rigid that the society can no longer adapt to changing situations, it will be unable to carry on the creative process of cultural evolution. It will break down and, eventually, disintegrate. Whereas growing civilisations display endless variety and versatility, those in the process of disintegration show uniformity and lack of inventiveness. The loss of flexibility in a disintegrating society is accompanied by a general loss of harmony amongst its elements, which inevitably leads to the outbreak of social discord and disruption.</PARA>
<PARA>I wonder whether we recognise the current political system or our social milieu at the moment. Capra continues:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, during the painful process of disintegration&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>already, as I have said, based on those three transitions and challenges&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the society's creativity&mdash;its ability to respond to challenges&mdash;is not completely lost. Although the cultural mainstream has become petrified by clinging to fixed ideas and rigid patterns of behaviour, creative minorities will appear on the scene and carry on the process of challenge-and-response. The dominant social institutions will refuse to hand over their leading roles to these new cultural forces, but they will inevitably go on to decline and disintegrate, and the creative minorities may be able to transform some of the old elements into a new configuration. The process of cultural evolution will then continue, but in new circumstances and with new protagonists.</PARA>
<PARA>All of us need to prepare ourselves for this turning point by deeply re-examining the main premises and values of our culture and by rejecting conceptual models that have outlived their usefulness. Such a change must be accompanied by a profound modification of most social relationships and structures, not the least those of the party political system. Each diverse viewpoint can contribute to the transformation which is required. As a Green senator, I am committed to work towards that social transformation and welcome the opportunity to work for it in this place. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>The report of the National Companies and Securities Commission deals with its winding up. The National Companies and Securities Commission has now been replaced by the ASC, the Australian Securities Commission. The NCSC did a grand job in the 1980s with limited resources. It was a creature of the old cooperative scheme between the States and the Commonwealth, but was never quite as adequately resourced as it should have been. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tribute should be paid to Mr Henry Bosch, who did great work in the 1980s as Chairman of the National Companies and Securities Commission. Prior to that, Mr Leigh Masel, also of Melbourne, headed that body and tribute should be paid to the work that he did. I want to take these few minutes now to acknowledge that during the 1980s, which have now become, as it were, a matter of shame in respect of some of the conduct of some of the corporate sector, there were nevertheless people who tried to battle against considerable odds. Henry Bosch was one of those and Leigh Masel, who preceded him, should also be acknowledged in the same context as somebody who made a mighty contribution to the work of keeping corporations in a pure state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, their attempt to do that failed. Nevertheless, it cannot be looked upon as an era in which the National Companies and Securities Commission had nothing but failures. It had some considerable success and it carried the torch when nobody else was able to do so. The detection of crime in the 1980s was more aimed at drug running, the importation of illicit drugs and their sale. Although the commission of corporate crime is now heading the list of crime that gives us concern, it was perhaps more relevant to examine it then than it is now when so much more attention is being paid to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I would like to acknowledge the efforts of the two people I have mentioned and also at the same time mention the great reforms that have taken place through the new corporations legislation. That has been a great tribute to the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) and, may I say, to the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate), who sits in front of me and who has also done great work in this area. Mr Tony Hartnell, who heads up the ASC, again is doing splendid work. But he and the two Ministers I have mentioned did have a context in which they were able to move forward with great success. Perhaps they would not have been able to move forward with such success if that context was not there. That context was created by Henry Bosch and, prior to him, by Mr Leigh Masel. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak to the report of the National Companies and Securities Commission, but in a tone slightly different from that of the previous speaker, Senator Cooney, although I support the thrust of what he said. The Australian economy and business sector, in some parts, went through a period when cowboys thought that the rules of the game were not what was right and what was wrong, rather what one could get away with.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of the tragic failure of the cooperative system of federalism in respect of national companies and securities legislation, the failure of State governments and the Federal Government to properly fund, resource and show a commitment towards the enforcement of company codes and company law, there was a binge in indulgence of a sort which ultimately reflected very badly on Australia's integrity, particularly internationally, and the capacity of good and decent Australians to do business overseas. That is not to say that the reason for the failure of every business and every entrepreneur that fell over was that the business or entrepreneur had committed a sin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, let me raise a word of warning again about what I describe as the cowboy attitude of those in more recent times who have used colourful language in talking about the scalps that they are seeking to nail to the wall. I think it was Mr Bosch who made some outrageous claims in respect of Mr Skase. I make no judgments about Mr Skase one way or another. But Mr Skase is no different from any other Australian: that is, before the law there is a presumption of innocence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think Mr Bosch on one occasion&mdash;because he did not have the resources for investigation and prosecution&mdash;used the process of public statements and press statements as a way of highlighting what he saw as the intrinsic faults in the system. I think it was Mr Hartnell or the ASC that, after exhaustive inquiry into the activities of the Bond Corporation, used words to the effect that senior directors of the Bond Corporation may have committed serious criminal offences and may have committed serious breaches of company law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, it was my understanding that the ASC and the National Companies and Securities Commission approached the law, their task and the directors in the same way as any other body. Frankly, I find it quite sad that we have public utterances which do two things: reverse the onus of proof and cast a judgment of guilt even before charges are laid. So those to whom they refer commence their tribulations, trials and prosecutions with an absolute presumption by these authorities that there is inherent guilt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If that is to be the norm, there is something fundamentally flawed and wrong with the processes. Perhaps it is because, as with the Costigan royal commission, governments create a level of expectation in the community that the Mr Bigs will be caught, major white collar crimes will be exposed and prosecutions and convictions obtained. Perhaps that is why these bodies feel compelled to speak in a hairy-chested, virile way about those that in some cases they are not prosecuting but, dare I say it, persecuting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that does not begin to be the norm with respect to any part of law enforcement in Australia. I am pleased that the proper resources are there for the ASC to discharge its responsibilities with competence and diligence. Let us hope that it does so within the parameters of the law and the norms and the standards of accepted law in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the documents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both of the Auditor-General's reports Nos. 22 and 23, which you have just tabled, Mr Acting Deputy President, are important documents. In the limited amount of time available prior to the reports being tabled, it was not possible to analyse them in depth. However, there are some comments I would like to make in relation to Audit Report No. 23, Aggregate and Departmental Financial Statements 1990-91, which I think is the more important of the two reports, although they are both important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report emanates from the requirements of the Audit Act. Section 50A(b) of the Audit Act 1901 requires the Minister for Finance to prepare an aggregate financial statement showing total receipts and expenditures of the Consolidated Revenue Fund, the Loan Fund and the Trust Fund. Section 50 of the Act requires the Secretary of each department to prepare a financial statement showing departmental receipts and expenditures and such other information as is required by financial statement guidelines issued by the Minister for Finance. Both types of statement are audited by the Auditor-General under section 51 of the Act. It is in relation to that that the Auditor-General has produced this report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to note that, of the 55 departmental financial statements which have been audited, and which are the subject of this report, 14 of them were qualified in respect of inadequate accounts and records, or breaches of financial statement guidelines of Commonwealth laws. The Auditor-General says on page 4 of his report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Auditor-General's Audit Report No. 22 1990-91 on the 1989-90 financial statements prepared by the Minister for Finance and the related accounts and records of departments drew attention to the high incidence of non-observance of, and breakdowns in, basic controls and procedures, including detailed legislative requirements. The matters raised in 1990-91, and the errors disclosed, did not have a material effect on the financial statements but the ANAO considers that the need for compliance with laws and for proper financial management requires improvement in the accounts and records.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the Auditor-General is saying that many departments need to lift their game in terms of their proper financial management. In particular, this requires an improvement in departmental accounts and records. That is of particular interest, since the Government has attempted to put some organisations&mdash;and I will come to this a little later in my remarks&mdash;outside the ambit of the Australian National Audit Office and has also slowed down the proposed wide-ranging changes to the Audit Act. There are grounds for concern on both of those counts. I hope that the Government will address those concerns in this chamber and elsewhere before too long. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is extraordinary that the proposed fundamental review and rewrite of the Audit Act has taken so long and has been so long delayed. It is having a considerably detrimental effect on the operations, activities and approach of the Australian National Audit Office. I repeat: 14 out of 55 departmental statements have been qualified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many weaknesses and deficiencies were noted in last year's report, as I have said. The Auditor-General is really saying that no substantive action appears to have been taken in the last year to remedy the deficiencies that were the subject of comment a year ago. Indeed, the Auditor-General points out that in some cases the situation is even worse now than it was. For example, again on page 4, in paragraph 1.3.4 the Auditor-General says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The audit examination of the accounts and records maintained by the 55 departments during 1990-91 did not reveal any general improvement compared with previous years. The audits in a number of departments disclosed deficiencies of a more serious nature in particular areas of financial management. . . The number of individual matters raised, based on audit review of systems and sample checking of transactions, remained at a relatively high level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will pick out a few examples of the more substantive breaches that the Auditor-General has identified. The Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories exceeded its appropriations for the National Film and Archives Centre twice. The same sort of breach occurred recently and was disclosed yesterday in the Advance to the Minister for Finance information for February 1992, which showed that the Department of Administrative Services had overspent its appropriations by a considerable amount before it sought funds to continue its programs. This is another example of the problems and concerns that the Auditor-General has identified and expressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the Department of Defence, the Auditor-General, in paragraph 1.3.14, says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The audit report on the Department's financial statement was qualified because up to 7% of claims for payment were paid during the year on the certificate of officers who had not been properly appointed for this purpose, contrary to paragraph 34(2)(b) of the Audit Act.</PARA>
<PARA>The Department of Finance itself&mdash;the custodian of rectitude, one would hope, in terms of financial practices&mdash;also did not escape the attention of the Auditor-General. In relation to that Department, in paragraph 1.3.18, the Auditor-General says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The practice of the Department of Finance in netting bank fees and interest charges against interest paid by the Reserve Bank was in breach of the Constitution. Failure to maintain separate records for the old and new superannuation schemes was in breach of the Audit Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Those charges&mdash;particularly the one in relation to the netting of bank fees and interest charges against interest paid by the Reserve Bank, which is in breach of the Constitution&mdash;are very serious. It is quite extraordinary that the Department of Finance could have made that mistake. This is unfortunate, given the role model that in many respects that Department has and certainly should have so far as the correct procedures for other departments are concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General found that unidentified amounts in excess of $100,000 were included in the trust fund balance of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. As I understand it, that is, again, a breach of the provisions of the Audit Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In paragraph 1.3.28, the Auditor-General had this to say about the Department of Primary Industries and Energy:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The audit of the Department's accounts and records disclosed that the Department did not make arrangements in sufficient time to waive repayments of advances of $7.838 million and had incomplete records of loans of $6.54 billion guaranteed by the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a huge amount of money for which the Commonwealth has a contingent liability in the form of a guarantee. It is a matter of very serious concern, I believe, if the Department of Primary Industries and Energy had incomplete records of loans totalling that amount. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are numerous other examples but I will not go into them all. I think it is fair to say, after reading this report quickly, that the general feeling from the report is that the Government has not taken the steps that the Auditor-General has identified in the past to improve the financial recordings and financial statements of government departments and agencies. That is exemplified, as I have said earlier, by the fact that the Government is taking so long to get its act together in relation to a major revision of the Audit Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although discussing the role of the Auditor-General and the role of the Audit Act can often seem a pretty dry and arid affair, it is&mdash;and it should be remembered that it is&mdash;a fundamentally important function of government because the Auditor-General and the Audit Office, through the Audit Act, really are the custodians, in many respects, of the finances of our nation. The Audit Office verifies that the accounts of government are being properly maintained and that the financial transactions of government are being properly carried out. So the Audit Office has a fundamental role. I am concerned, and I know that many others are concerned, about an apparent lack of urgency on the Government's part in respect of the need to ensure that the resources of the Audit Office and the legislative framework under which it operates are sufficient and adequate to fulfil the very necessary role that it plays. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said before&mdash;and we have debated this matter in this place and other places&mdash;on at least two occasions now in the last year we have seen the Government quite deliberately refuse, or wish to refuse, to give the Audit Office an essential role to play in relation to the auditing of the accounts of agencies. Two in particular that come to mind are the Australian Wool Realisation Commission and the National Rail Corporation. The Government quite deliberately took away or weakened the specific authority that the Auditor-General and the Audit Office had in respect of auditing the accounts of those authorities. Fortunately, that was changed as a result of amendments moved by the coalition and supported by the Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is very important that the Government make a statement to the Parliament very soon as to what it expects of the Audit Office; and what it is proposing to do in relation to the role, the mandate and the general legislative framework of the Audit Office and the Auditor-General. While the continuing uncertainty remains, there is a risk that the auditing of the finances of the Commonwealth&mdash;that is, the finances of the Australian taxpayers&mdash;is not going to be carried out as efficiently as I am sure we would all want it to be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I congratulate the Auditor-General on this report. It is a very timely report and I hope it will lead to an improvement in the practices and operations of those departments of which it is critical. I hope that the Government will make a statement soon to the Parliament about some of the matters to which I have referred today. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My Dear Treasurer</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On behalf of the Senator Select Committee on Superannuation, I am writing to draw your attention to the Byrnwood case which was discussed in evidence given to the Senator Select Committee on Superannuation at its public hearings in Perth. I also seek your support and cooperation in ensuring that the former employees of Byrnwood are given every consideration when decisions are made in respect of taxation applicable to payments that they secure in lieu of their superannuation entitlements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Briefly, the directors of Byrnwood Pty Ltd., which traded as Peter's Bakeries and Swan Lake Natural Foods, were also the trustees of the Byrnwood Superannuation Fund. Byrnwood went into liquidation in 1990 and the receiver-manager found a great number of irregularities in the conduct of the superannuation affairs of the company, including non-payment of the 3% productivity award superannuation contribution, breaching of the in-house asset rule, and `confiscation' of employees own contributions into the company superannuation fund. Full details of the case are outlined in the attached Hansard.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee understands that the former employees of the company have or are about to receive approximately $10,000 each from three sources:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.payments from the receiver-manager in respect of the 3% award super;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.payments from the receiver-manager in respect of the employees own contributions; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.an out-of-court settlement from one of the directors of Byrnwood equivalent to 72% of the amount that would have been the employees' entitlement at November 1990.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Press reports (see attached) indicate that the payments received by the former employees may be taxed at marginal rates because the moneys were not paid from a superannuation fund. I understand that the matter is still under investigation by the Perth office of the Taxation Office and a decision has not yet been made on whether the moneys will be regarded as assessable income and hence subject to taxation. Should the Australian Taxation Office not be in a position to apply superannuation rates of taxation to these moneys, then it would be entirely appropriate for the Parliament to legislate to address this anomaly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clearly, the Committee has no wish to interfere with the statutory responsibilities of the Commissioner of Taxation but we wish to highlight some deficiencies in current regulations which fall within your portfolio.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Firstly, the high cost of civil court action and the uncertainty of the result effectively precludes members of a fund from taking action against former trustees. In the Byrnwood case, as one of the former trustees was a declared bankrupt and another was domiciled in Hong Kong, it seems likely that legal costs would exceed any settlement determined by the courts if the action by the members were successful. If the ISC had powers similar to the Trade Practices Commission to institute civil proceedings against individuals or companies alleged to be in breach of the law, the members may have been able to take some action against the trustees. As matters currently stand, they virtually have no hope of recourse through the legal system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly, the Byrnwood case highlights the need for arms' length relationships between employers and trustees of corporate superannuation funds. There is clear potential for conflict of interest when the directors of the company are also the sole trustees of the corporate superannuation fund. It is clearly unacceptable that the employer and trustee of the fund are one and the same entity as occurred in the Byrnwood case.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thirdly, whilst there seems to be some confusion over whether the Byrnwood fund was a complying fund, if it was a complying fund it breached the `in-house' asset rule. This raises the question of what can be done to improve ISC audit procedures to pick-up such flagrant breaches of regulations and what penalties can be imposed on trustees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would welcome the opportunity to discuss the Byrnwood case with you further and I reiterate the Committee's concern that the Byrnwood employees should be given fair and equitable treatment in the taxation of benefits due to them following the winding up of their employer.</PARA>

<PARA>Honourable senators will recall that in June last year the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation was established with the responsibility of reporting on 17 terms of reference by the last sitting day in May 1992. The procedural resolution which accompanied the Committee's terms of reference stated that it should have leave to report from time to time its proceedings and the evidence taken and such interim recommendations it may deem fit. This speech, therefore, is inter alia an interim report of the inquiry by the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee has endeavoured to use all possible mechanisms and opportunities to ensure that its work is at the forefront of public debate on superannuation in Australia. To this end, last December the Committee tabled a background discussion paper entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Super Systems Survey</EMPHASIS>&mdash;a survey of superannuation which subsequently proved to be a much sought after document with over 600 copies being distributed on request to individuals and organisations interested in superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since that time, the Committee has embarked on an ambitious and fairly arduous round of public hearings&mdash;so far totalling 14 days&mdash;during which more than 100 witnesses have been examined and almost 1,800 pages of publicly available <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> have been produced. The Committee has adopted a policy whereby nearly all of the submissions have been published on receipt. This public stance has also been followed by having almost all hearings held in open session. This policy has already paid generous dividends in that we have been able to observe significant changes in attitudes and position, both in the Public Service and industry, about the shape of superannuation in the 1990s and beyond. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Byrnwood case is very similar to the Maxwell case in England, but in miniature. During one of the hearings in Perth the Committee was given an in-depth briefing on the Byrnwood case. The Byrnwood case, like most of the case studies examined by the Committee, provides some important lessons which I believe should be brought before the Senate today. Before elaborating on the issues arising out of Byrnwood, I would first like to outline the facts of that case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Byrnwood Pty Ltd traded as Peters Bakeries and Swan Lake Natural Foods and employed 40 to 50 employees. Most of the production workers were members of the Federated Miscellaneous Workers Union, many of them from non-English speaking backgrounds. The company ran a defined benefit scheme for employees called the Byrnwood superannuation fund. The last actuarial review of the fund was conducted for the 1988-89 financial year. At that stage the fund was healthy and the actuary recommended in January 1990 that no payments be made by the employer. In addition, the award required the employer to pay 3 per cent superannuation into a nominated industry fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 12 November 1990 Coopers &amp; Lybrand advised suppliers, customers and staff that it had been appointed as receiver-manager to Byrnwood Pty Ltd. On 18 November 1990 the receiver-manager advised the union at a meeting of his concern with respect to the state of the superannuation fund. He appointed three staff to audit the fund. On 18 December 1990 the receiver-manager wrote to all employees advising them that the company did not remit certain superannuation payments, including those payable by the company for occupational superannuation and those deducted from employees' wages, to the relevant superannuation funds, but that all payments would be made to the funds as required by the relevant award or trust deed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 20 December 1990 the receiver-manager wrote to the union saying that it had become evident that there were some irregularities in respect of the company's superannuation fund, and that preliminary inquiries had established that, whilst the company had recognised its liability to make contributions under the 3 per cent occupational superannuation requirements, no fund was set up and no payments had been made. It also advised that it appeared that some contributions deducted from employees' wages were not remitted to the employees' contribution fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Examination of the trust deed for the Byrnwood superannuation fund, which was dated as recently as 29 May 1987, revealed that the deed was an agreement between Byrnwood Pty Ltd as the employer of the one part and Byrnwood Pty Ltd as trustee of the other part. The receiver-manager advised the union that he was only acting in the capacity of employer and was, therefore, not in a position to act as trustee of the superannuation fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, since the trust deed provided for the principal employer to appoint and remove trustees, the receiver-manager indicated that he would give consideration to appointing a nominee of the members as a trustee. In view of concerns with respect to the question of the liabilities of the trustees, this invitation was not accepted. It is not clear whether the receiver-manager, acting as the principal employer, ever exercised the right to remove the existing trustees, or whether they actually resigned their position as trustee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After a number of meetings and conferences in the Western Australian Industrial Relations Commission the following became clear&mdash;the trustees of the fund were the same people as the directors of Byrnwood Pty Ltd. According to the NCSC return for the year ended 30 June 1988, these were: Richard Hutchison Baird of 16 Grant St, Cottesloe, WA; and David James Humann of Apartment 11a, Piccadilly Mansion, 6 Po Shan Road, Hong Kong. Mr Baird was also recorded as the principal executive officer and the company secretary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, Mr Humann, also a senior partner in Price Waterhouse, indicated that he had submitted a written resignation as director in mid-1990, as a result of which a further search was made of ASC records on 6 June 1991. Although they recorded the appointment of an additional director, William Francis Cawley, of 82A Collins St, West Perth, WA, and that Mr Baird's address had been altered and Mr Humann's address had changed to 16 Grant St, Cottesloe, WA&mdash;the previous address for Mr Baird&mdash;they had no notification of Mr Humann's resignation. This in itself posed an interesting question as to who exactly were the directors at the time of the appointment of the receiver-manager. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The company had $6.7m of secured debts, mainly to ANZ and Standard Chartered Finance. In addition, approximately 90 per cent of the superannuation fund's assets, or $435,105, had been lent as an unsecured loan from the superannuation fund to Byrnwood and was an unsecured debt which the receiver indicated there was no chance of recovering. In fact, as at November 1990, the superannuation fund only had $30,000 left in assets. An actuarial assessment conducted by Jacques Martin Industry in August 1991, concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1. While the actuary to the fund has calculated that the liability of the superannuation fund was $262,471.64, the assets of the fund at the time should have been $461,206.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2. The directors of Byrnwood Pty Ltd, in the capacity as trustee for the Byrnwood superannuation fund, had a legal responsibility to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.recover from the employer unpaid contributions deducted from employees' wages and not remitted to the fund;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.recover from the employer contributions due to the superannuation fund up to 18 January 1990 when actuarial advice was received that no further company contributions were required; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.invest the trust monies in such a manner as would be seen to be prudent to a reasonable person charged with investing someone else's money.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The investments should have been monitored by the Trustee and immediate action taken if doubts existed about the suitability of the investments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3. The chart of accounts provided show the company holding a liability, to the Byrnwood Superannuation Fund, on the books at $435,105.04, at the end of October 1990. If an interest return of, say 14 per cent had been applied, this would have accumulated to $485,310 at the end of August 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Likewise, if the minimum actuarial liability was increased with interest, the amount would be $293,965 at the end of August 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The trust deed provided that in the event of the superannuation fund being wound up, the assets be equitably distributed amongst the members. Clearly, had the directors of the trustee company acted properly, the benefits available for distribution to the members of the trust would have been significantly greater than the minimum actuarial liability calculated by the actuary to the fund.</PARA>
<PARA>In effect, the trustees, in direct breach of their trust to members of the fund, had knowingly invested members' funds in the company with very little prospect of a reasonable return. Despite inquiries of the police, there appeared to be little interest in pursuing those trustees or directors for their actions which, at the very least, were a breach of trust but could quite properly be seen as theft. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the ASC should examine Byrnwood with a view to ensuring that the said directors are not given another opportunity to squander employee superannuation funds, either in their current or future capacities as director trustees. Surely the conduct of the trustees, if it is sustained to be of the standard alleged in evidence, is sufficient to exclude them from sitting on any company board. In addition, the fact that the employer actually made deductions from employees' wages and did not remit them to the superannuation fund but retained them within the employer company, is surely prima facie evidence of theft. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The extraordinary fact of the matter was that the employees had virtually no avenue through which to pursue recovery of their rightful entitlements from the superannuation fund. Advice was received that, while a common law action could be taken, it would be likely to take several years and would prove to be extremely costly&mdash;in the vicinity of $50,000 to $100,000-plus, with no-one in a position to fund it&mdash;and there was no guarantee of success, particularly as the only director domiciled in Australia no longer had any assets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As it transpired, a settlement was eventually reached with one of the directors, Mr Humann, to settle for a total of $200,000, or approximately 76 per cent of the minimum actuarial liability assessed as at November 1990, or 43 per cent of what should have been the fund's assets at that date, to be paid in instalments by mid-1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should now like to give some attention to the lessons to be learnt from the Byrnwood case. Firstly, there is the matter of trust deeds. The Byrnwood trust deed, which was clearly provided by a firm of solicitors and was not particularly old, purports to be an agreement between Byrnwood Pty Limited, hereinafter called the principal employer, of the one part and Byrnwood Pty Limited, hereinafter called the trustee, of the other part. This becomes quite farcical when one considers that there are a number of provisions within the trust deed which require the trustee and the principal employer to agree: changes in the review date, which could quite possibly postpone indefinitely the declaration of an interest rate; or amendment of the trust deed without reference to the members, subject only to ratification by an actuary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the deed provides for all the trustees to be nominated by the principal employer. Such a provision can be used to ensure apparent compliance with OSS guidelines on joint trusteeship without reference to the members or their union. This highlights the need for arm's length relationships between employers and the trustees of corporate superannuation funds. There is clear potential for conflict of interest when the directors of the company are also the sole trustees of the corporate superannuation fund. In practice, I maintain that there is absolutely no difference between the two except a legal fiction. It is clearly unacceptable that the employer and trustee of the fund are one and the same entity, as occurred in the Byrnwood case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the high cost of civil court action and the uncertainty of the result effectively precludes members of a fund, particularly members who have just been made redundant and who have no money, from taking action against former trustees. In the Byrnwood case, as one of the former trustees was a declared bankrupt and another was domiciled in Hong Kong, it seems likely that legal costs would exceed any settlement determined by the courts if the action by the members were successful. If the ASC had powers similar to the Trade Practices Commission to institute civil proceedings against individuals or companies alleged to be in breach of the law, the members may have been able to take some action against the trustees. As matters currently stand, they have virtually no hope of recourse through the legal system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, whilst there seems to be some confusion over whether the Byrnwood fund was a complying fund, if it was a complying fund it breached the in-house asset rule. This raises the question of what can be done to improve ASC audit procedures to pick up such flagrant breaches of regulations and what penalties can be imposed on trustees. The in-house asset rule sets at a maximum of 10 per cent the amount of moneys that can be invested from a superannuation fund in the employer. In this case, 90 per cent of the moneys were taken from the superannuation fund and invested with the employer. Again, it clearly seems to be a prima facie breach of the law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, having due regard to the interests of Byrnwood's former employees, the Committee believes that payments which have been made by the former trustee director&mdash;who I emphasise was a partner in Price Waterhouse&mdash;should not be taxed at marginal rates or under the capital gains provisions of the tax Act. Instead, the payment should be taxed as an eligible termination payment so that the pre-1983 benefit would be subject to an effective tax rate of 2 per cent to 3 per cent or less and the post-1983 benefit subject to the same taxation arrangements as other superannuation benefits. To this end, the Treasurer has received the letter which I have just tabled from this Committee requesting that he consider referring our request to the Australian Taxation Office and to allow it to exercise discretion in this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Surely these ex-employees, who had to endure the shock of being retrenched and then suffer the indignity of not being able to receive their superannuation funds because they were stolen, should be given every consideration in this matter. Should the Tax Commissioner not have the legal power to act in the way described, the Government has an obligation to change the existing legislation to ensure that the Byrnwood employees and others who in the future might be similarly aggrieved are treated with absolute fairness and equity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The circumstances of the Byrnwood case, as well as the potential for other funds to suffer a similar demise, place an onus on the Committee in its report, which will be presented at the end of the autumn sittings, to make particular recommendations to ensure that in future the scope for such maladministration and fraudulent theft and behaviour is eliminated. The facts in the Byrnwood case bear remarkable similarity to the recent case in the United Kingdom, the Maxwell case&mdash;which I will be speaking on at another time in another forum&mdash;except that in the Maxwell case some hundreds of millions of pounds were fraudulently taken by the employer from the principal superannuation fund. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The principal purpose of the Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1992 is to reduce the rate of sales tax payable on certain motor vehicles from 20 to 15 per cent. That is achieved by reducing the sales tax rate applicable to vehicles covered by the fifth schedule to the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act from 20 to 15 per cent. However, in effecting the changes contained in the Bill, an amendment has also been proposed to the formula contained in item 61 in the second schedule to the Act. It is that formula that has previously been used to ensure that only those vehicles priced at retail above the income tax depreciation limit contained in section 57AF of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 attracted the so-called luxury tax&mdash;that is, sales tax at the rate of 30 per cent. The item 61 formula does not now refer to the rate of tax applicable to fifth schedule vehicles&mdash;that is, 15 per cent. Rather, the formula refers simply to 20 per cent, without any specific reference to the derivation of the 20 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Bill is passed as currently drafted, it will effectively reduce the luxury car tax threshold from its previous level of $45,462 to $43,937. That reduction is the result of maintaining the historical wholesale value threshold of $30,505 but reducing the tax rate for vehicles priced at or below the wholesale threshold from 20 per cent to 15 per cent. From a policy point of view, the implication is that the policy formulated in 1986, and maintained since then, of setting the income tax depreciation limit and the luxury car tax threshold at the same level will be discontinued. Under the Bill, it will now be theoretically possible for a motor vehicle to be priced at retail below the depreciation limit but above the luxury car tax threshold that would apply to vehicles priced at retail between $43,937 and $45,462. That is a black hole, if you like, of something like $1,500. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, that is contrary to the policy adopted in 1986, when the linkage between the two concepts&mdash;namely, the depreciation limit and the luxury car tax threshold limit&mdash;was legislated for. It would be a change quite contrary to the policy that was adopted then. More significantly, it also appears to conflict with the Government's intentions in its economic statement of 26 February. I quote from page 197 of that statement:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The 15 per cent WST rate will apply to all new passenger motor vehicles (whether domestic or imported) that are priced below the luxury motor vehicle threshold (which for 1991-92 is a sale value for WST purposes of $30,505, equivalent to a retail price of $45,462).</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, in the economic statement of 26 February the Government was saying that the retail price to which the changes in the sales tax rate would apply is $45,462, not the $43,937 which will be the result of the formula now contained in the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That gap has some significant effects. First, it is highly confusing. It is illogical because it has always been seen as desirable and logical to have the depreciation limit value set at the same level, in effect, as the retail price level for the application of the luxury car tax of 30 per cent. As a result of this Bill, we now have a gap opening between the two. The practical effect, as I understand it, is that it becomes virtually impossible to price a car at retail in that range of $43,937 to $45,462 because of the very large amount of extra sales tax that has to be paid once the retail price of $43,937 is exceeded. Although the depreciation limit remains at $45,462, this black hole effect&mdash;for want of a better description, and I think it is an accurate description&mdash;means that cars will not be priced at that level. Instead, the retail threshold of $43,937 will become the de facto depreciation limit, and that represents in practical terms a lowering of the depreciation limit by stealth. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I bet I am doing better than Senator Cook. Because the statement of the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, refers to the $45,462 figure, with which we agree, and because, as I understand it, the Bill separates the depreciation limit from the retail price limit for the application of the luxury tax rate, we believe that it would make commonsense and remove a lot of the confusion to bring the Bill into line with what would seem to have been everyone's intentions. Hence, on behalf of the Opposition, I have circulated an amendment to clause 4&mdash;and there are consequential amendments to clauses 5 and 6&mdash;that would have the effect of removing the gap that has opened up as a result of this Bill between the $43,937 figure and the depreciation limit figure of $45,462.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As my colleague has explained, the Government's Bill unintentionally creates an unnecessary anomaly in that it results in a retail price threshold for sales tax purposes of $43,936, yet it retains an income tax depreciation limit of $45,462. We believe that these amendments, which have the support of industry, will overcome this problem by ensuring that the retail threshold price at which the tax rate increase is triggered&mdash;I think they are the operative words&mdash;would remain tied to the income depreciation limit. I think those words are important. In achieving this result, the amendments do no more than reinstate a policy of the Australian Labor Party adopted by the Government when in 1986 it introduced what I referred to last night as a highly discriminatory luxury car tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, as a result of the wording in this Bill&mdash;which as a consequence has created what I do not believe to be its intention&mdash;the Government has now abandoned this nexus policy without any sound reason or explanation. A tremendous amount of confusion and detriment will be caused to the industry&mdash;detriment that I believe was never intended&mdash;as a result of the intention to lower this tax from 20 per cent to 15 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Logic actually dictates that the luxury car tax threshold should not fall below the income tax depreciation limit. Indeed, to do otherwise under these circumstances would mean that there would be a reduction by stealth in the income tax depreciation limit as it now applies to new motor vehicles. When we consider that the substantial tax penalty applied under the Government's Bill would lead to an increase in the retail price of a new vehicle from $43,935 to $48,462, we see that the practical impact of that on the industry would be that no new vehicles would be priced within this range. As a result, in practical terms, the depreciation limit for new vehicles would fall from $45,462 to $43,936. We may say that is desirable inasmuch as that would tend to force down the prices of new vehicles. In fact, this has not been publicly announced by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There does seem to be confusion. The One Nation statement, which my colleague Senator Short has referred to, gives reference to the Government's intention in this issue. What we are really attempting to do is to give credence or support to what the Government is seeking to achieve in the One Nation statement, but which this Bill unintentionally would take away. But, unfortunately, the action is unintentionally discriminatory in that distributors of cars which were previously priced below the $42,000 level will not be subject to the effective retail price fixing imposed on cars previously priced between $44,000 and $45,462. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another unintended impact. As a result of this problem, the distributors of such vehicles will be given no opportunity or incentive to put within their vehicles added safety features; perhaps these might be withdrawn in order to get the price down. I think this is an unintended effect of this Bill. Ultimately, we believe that the prices should not be forced down through government legislation; market forces should dictate whether or not prices fall in response to tax rate reductions and whether or not distributors choose to reintroduce safety measures to such vehicles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the very minor differences in revenue terms that these amendments are going to achieve if passed by the Government, I believe that the Government&mdash;in the interests of consistency of policy, of achieving harmony within industry, of seeking to achieve the objectives which are sought by this Bill&mdash;should agree to these amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of my colleagues have previously indicated that already the depreciation limit is out of kilter with what was set during the 1970s when a luxury tax depreciation threshold was set relating to, I think, a Ford LTD. Unfortunately, as a result of improvements in car design, the ABS in its statistics, in trying to relate modern cars back to this concept of, say, a Ford LTD in the 1970s, has had to severely discount modern features, including power steering and a lot of safety equipment. The result is that we now have a luxury car tax threshold which is far below the market price for such cars. This, indeed, is unfortunate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, Senator Button, has acknowledged this problem and, without putting too much emphasis on it, has indicated that further consideration will be given to this particular problem. Mr Chairman, it is for your interpretation as well as mine just what `further consideration' of this matter actually means. But I generally believe that Senator Button has acknowledged that a problem does exist and that, as a result of the manner in which the Australian Bureau of Statistics has calculated the updating of this limit, the limit is now out of kilter with reality and needs fixing. So I believe it would be, indeed, unfortunate if the Government rejected the amendments and then within a few weeks turned around and sought to adjust the problem, as it would cause further confusion in the interim period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am concerned that a consequence of the complexity and the difficulty of calculation of this so-called determined area, which will increase as a result of the consequence of this change&mdash;because the void that I referred to will extend the range from $43,937 to $48,156&mdash;will be a completely unacceptable mathematical situation which really is adverse to the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a further consequence, there will be distortions and the distributors will certainly be discouraged from adding needed safety equipment and other equipment accepted as being necessary in modern day cars nowadays. Of course, it will cause distortions because imported cars in particular are automatically fitted with some of this equipment. It may, in effect, work to the detriment of certain Australian cars where those features are regarded as optional extras. I believe there is a lot of support for the amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also the problem as to the relevance of the depreciation limit which is set by section 57AF of the Act. I drew attention to this during my second reading speech last night. Rather than traverse this particular area again, I direct the Minister's attention to my remarks, which were reported on page 979 of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. I look forward to the Government's support for the amendments which are designed to overcome what I regard as an important unintended consequence of the Government's legislation. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Incidentally, I fully support the amendment moved by my colleague Senator Short and so well explained by him and by Senator Watson not only today but also yesterday evening. I am sure that the consequence of the wording of the Bill, as my colleague Senator Short said, was unintended and that the Government probably never even thought about until now. These things do happen. I certainly support Senator Watson's remarks: this problem should be fixed now so as not to leave confusion for the next two or three weeks, or whatever the case might be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan) a specific question, which he might be able to address later on. He may remember a section of the Bill that positively excludes utilities, trucks, vans, four-wheel drives and dual cabs from being classed as passenger vehicles. The question I would like to ask is: what criteria have been used to exclude and remove completely the dual cab type of vehicle from this category? I know that the four-wheel drive, the utility and the dual cab have been excluded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Generally, there are two variations in all models of the dual cab. Firstly, there is the high model four-wheel drive. A differential is fitted to the front of these vehicles which means that the chassis has to be raised. This is classed as an off-road vehicle. Generally, it is a diesel powered vehicle&mdash;not that that matters very much. Secondly, there is a two-wheel drive version which is lower, because there is no front differential to cover, and is generally petrol powered. This vehicle normally has two bucket seats in the front with a full bench seat in the back. There is a certain amount of room in the rear that can be used to carry a minimal amount of goods. Because this space is beyond the back axle, it is unsafe to overload the vehicle. In order to improve its looks, this space can be fitted with a fibreglass cover. So that is the sort of configuration we finish up with. Goods cannot really be carted in such a vehicle which is generally used only for carrying passengers. Local governments, which do not pay sales tax, and other enterprises use such vehicles as a personnel carrier. They carry passengers to and from work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, dual cabs remain taxed at a rate of 20 per cent, just like the other vehicles which have been excluded. I have my reasons for saying that, in line with the new legislation, all of the other vehicles should be taxed at 15 per cent. I cannot understand why a two-wheel drive dual cab with two bench seats or even a full bench seat in the front, and a full bench seat at the back&mdash;I believe Nissan may produce such a vehicle&mdash;is not classed as a passenger vehicle, and thus attract a 15 per cent tax. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At this stage I might respond to the comments made by Senator Short and Senator Watson. I will give my response to the amendments at this stage and I will catch up with Senator Panizza's comments at the conclusion of what I have to say. One could go into a welter of technicality on this matter. I will try to boil it down to only two or three basic points. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Watson was right in one regard: at the end of the day, this is not one of the major tax issues of the nation. It is neither big in revenue terms, nor in terms of the range of goods affected. It is a question of how one best deals with things which fall at the margin when one has money limits affecting tax rates and a gap emerges.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Essentially, the confusion is that there are two gaps. There has always been one gap. There has always been a gap within the retail pricing range&mdash;that is, when we get to what Senator Short was referring to as a black hole. Whether at the threshold we go from 20 to 30 per cent or 15 to 30 per cent, an effective&mdash;as Senator Short calls it&mdash;retail pricing black hole is created. It is marginally larger now because we are talking about 15 to 30 per cent instead of 20 to 30 per cent. But that is of itself no significance as a conceptual matter; nor does it change the fundamental nature of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But there seems to be some cause for concern. The mischief that this legislation is likely to cause, which is not immediately apparent to me, relates to concern about the distinction between the depreciation rate, the depreciation cut-off and the retail price. There is talk of the depreciation level being reduced by stealth. I have to say that that is just not right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us get into perspective the figure of $45,462 and its impact on depreciation. If one buys a car for $90,000, one can depreciate it as if it was bought for $45,462. That is absolutely unchanged. </PARA>

If one paid only $43,936, that is all one can depreciate it for. Nobody loses any effective depreciation.

In the attempt to avoid creating two retail threshold values, those opposite are creating two wholesale threshold values rather than the one we have at present. Vehicles taxed at 20 per cent will have one threshold level and those taxed at 15 per cent will have another.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the Opposition is wrong in proposing that the wholesale threshold be raised because the benefit of the reduction in wholesale sales tax rates will flow almost certainly to the wholesaler, not to the customer. That is not what we want to achieve. We have set out to try to reduce the price of motor cars and Senator Short's amendment counteracts that. It will mean that the retail price will stay the same and someone's profit margin will go up. The benefit of the tax reduction will not flow to the consumer. None of us wants to elevate this to a form of high art; we are talking about a fairly arcane and minor matter. Nevertheless, it warrants pursuit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On balance, the course of action that the Opposition is proposing does not improve the situation. My understanding of the situation is that the industry's concern is less as time goes on and it can look at it in more detail.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the actual effect of what Senator Short claims is the non-alignment between the luxury car threshold and the depreciation limit, it is true to say that prior to this Bill any luxury car could be fully depreciated by an Australian business; subsequent to this Bill being passed all non-luxury cars will still be fully depreciable but the luxury car threshold in retail prices will be approximately $1,600 less than the depreciation limit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Short is arguing that that is bad for business; that this creates this `black hole'. However, I think there is another way to look at it. Many businesses would want to purchase a non-luxury car&mdash;not all businesses purchase the most expensive cars&mdash;and they might still be able to add some depreciable items, such as communications systems and intercoms. Under the current regime an add-on such as that would not be depreciable where a non-luxury car was priced right on that luxury tax threshold. So it is not really all bad for business, as the honourable senator said. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The really important point to make is that the alignment between these two levels has been broken purely because the level of the wholesale sales tax is being lowered.

Under the GST proposal this sort of problem would not have arisen. This is quite pertinent because it demonstrates the difficulties that any government inevitably gets into with a wholesale sales tax by pursuing an increase in revenue, or even changing the definitional basis.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition amendment is seeking to circumvent what we regard as an unintended consequence or minor mischief. We have never indicated that it is a matter of great moment, either for the industry or in terms of lost revenue. Our amendment demonstrates that, in order to ensure a continuity of Government policy under a sales tax regime, the amendment, unfortunately, has to be dreadfully complex again. That sort of thing does not assist in the tax simplification exercise upon which the Government is embarking, not only in terms of sales tax, but also in terms of income tax when, in such situations, one has sales tax elements tied to income tax elements and vice versa. This is always a problem where one tries to align two sets of revenue raising matters. I acknowledge that it is a problem. The Opposition seeks to draw attention to the problem and to provide a solution to what we believe to be an unintended consequence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me explain to the chamber what has been colloquially referred to as a `black hole'. I do not think that the term means very much to the listening audience. Perhaps I should explain&mdash;and I think I made this point in my speech last night&mdash;that there is a substantial sales tax penalty in this Government's Bill because of an increase in the retail price of a new vehicle from $43,835 to $45,462. We have debated the fact that, basically, it will be difficult for retailers to price vehicles within this range. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rationale behind that is that a $1 retail price increase above a $43,936 threshold would bring about a doubling of the quantum of sales tax payable from $4,575.72 to $9,151.44. This is the implication of an apparently simple change to the sales tax legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our amendment seeks to bring back or narrow what has unintentionally been increased by increasing the quantum of the penalty regime, and, because of the penalty regime, the effective market price of cars. It is true that, technically, it will not change from the $45,000, but in practical terms, because of the establishment of this lower wholesale tax price, people will not price their cars at that limit because of the sales tax implication. So in a sense, it is correct to say that the limit of $45,462 really does not change. However, the practical effect on pricing policies, because of the sales tax implications, will result in a pricing policy that will cause those detrimental problems. </PARA>

The problem that we have with the wholesale sales tax regime is that it is very complicated, there is a whole mixture of rates and it is because of these different rates that we have this problem. If we had a uniform rate, particularly in the form of a value added tax, these problems would not arise.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator McMullan said that he did not understand why this is, in fact, a reduction by stealth in the depreciation element. The answer to that is that because of the additional tax impost for prices over the $43,937 limit, there will not be cars priced between that limit and $45,462. Therefore, in practical terms it means that the figure of $45,462 will cease to have relevance and the relevant figure will, in fact, be $43,937.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The complexity with which we are dealing&mdash;which I acknowledge&mdash;is not a product of whether we are taxing at the wholesale level or the retail level, it is a product of the fact that we are taxing at different rates. Of course, we could have a GST at different rates or a wholesale sales tax at one rate. The complexity arises from the decision which the Government makes consciously, and defends and advocates, to have the capacity within our indirect tax system to discriminate and say, `We wish to tax this at a different level from that'. Although it is true that at the margin one inevitably pays a price of complexity, there are great administrative problems with the GST&mdash;in my view, worse&mdash;but that is another argument. </PARA>

I make no apology for the fact that the Government discriminates on a greater range of criteria on different products, and I will continue to advocate that we should. I do not apologise for the fact that the Government believes that it is appropriate and socially desirable as an equitable revenue measure to distinguish between the rate of tax one applies on cars bought by Australians in the normal course of their daily lives and luxury cars. I do not apologise for that one bit. There is a minor price we pay, which is a price of complexity. </PARA>

I appreciate that it is very unlikely that there will be a car priced at $45,462. I accept that, but it has nothing to do with the argument. No car will be less depreciable after this change than before it, except for those whose prices will fall. Of course, they will then still be fully depreciable. This was Senator Kernot's question. A car which is currently depreciated at $45,462, because of the retail price being X and the tax price being Y will still be fully depreciable, it will just cost less. </PARA>

I think those were the words that Senator Watson used; Senator Short used slightly different words.

That much I can say. I have an understanding of the outcome of the discussions between the industry and the Minister but I was not a party to them and it is not for me to comment on that.

Other countries are doing something about it while we continue to do nothing. The ecologically sustainable working group on transport has recommended that fuel efficient vehicles be taxed at a preferential rate relative to less fuel efficient ones. It is not a revenue raising measure but a measure that is designed to influence the behaviour of purchasers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason that we have to start doing something about this is absolutely obvious; most people know it but we need to provide some incentives. We have to start to reverse the air pollution that is engulfing our cities.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is simply negligent of this Government to ignore these problems. All we need is some basic planning. We need to provide members of the community with incentives to change their behaviour in order to limit the amount of damage we do to our cities and to look quite closely at the amount of energy we import and squander. At a recent conference Brian Dawson, who is an oil export from the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics, which the Opposition likes to quote quite often, predicted that crude oil imports will rise sharply over the next two years. He predicted that by the year 1994-95 imports would jump by a staggering 38 per cent from this financial year. This means that we will be importing $US6.5m worth of oil per day, which will give us an annual oil import bill of approximately $3.1 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendment No. 2 is merely one of the measures that need to be implemented. It proposes to introduce a formula into the sales tax regime which varies the tax payable on new passenger motor vehicles on the basis of fuel efficiency and the volume of the car. Senator Panizza said yesterday, when speaking against this proposal, that one should compare apples with apples. That is exactly what this proposal does. The sales tax is calculated by a formula which balances the fuel consumption of the vehicle against the volume of the vehicle. The amendment seeks to promote efficient motor vehicles, whatever their size, so as to improve the efficiency of the Australian motor vehicle fleet. </PARA>

At page 123, in respect of taxation measures that would help reduce fuel consumption by taxing the vehicle, it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Effectiveness requires operating on purchase price, and those vehicle attributes which cause high fuel consumption, so as to encourage individuals and companies to buy fuel-efficient cars.</PARA>

To some extent that is appropriate. The purists would say that one should never do that, and in this instance I am not trying to score a partisan point. That is one of the arguments the Opposition would put forward about the GST&mdash;it does not wish to make those distinctions through the tax system. Many purists would agree with that, whether they agree with a goods and services based tax or some other form of tax. They would apply the same argument to income tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I certainly do not take it that far. Ten minutes ago in this chamber I argued that there are circumstances in which it is appropriate to distinguish within one's tax policy to achieve economic and social objectives. I am not saying that this is verboten and that I would not contemplate it, but it is something that one ought do fairly cautiously, carefully and rarely, or else one winds up with the worst of all possible worlds. The tax system is very complex and one winds up with the different objectives being pursued conflicting with each other. Perhaps the tax policy already has the problem of having the three fundamental objectives which drive it sometimes coming into conflict. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Simplicity, efficiency and equity are not always reconcilable. Sometimes to achieve equity one has to put in some complexity. For example, if one wants to protect a group of people, one might put in a special clause to protect them. The Senate does that often.

One starts driving oneself out backwards. </PARA>

For that reason, they are welcome. However, this amendment adds an extra layer of complexity, and I am not yet convinced it will achieve its objective. It sounds wonderful. In fact, the environmental argument is one of the reasons why the Government was persuaded to go to the reduction of 15 per cent in the first place.

When looking at it from the safety angle, one will see that the power to weight ratio drops.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The assumption in what has just been said is quite remarkable because it is totally at variance with the facts. The facts do not show that large vehicles which have smaller motors, and are therefore slower, are involved in more accidents. It is quite the other way. It is the smaller high-powered vehicles that zip in and out and have the sort of acceleration implied by Senator Panizza that are the ones involved in more of the accidents. So, in fact, the argument really runs the other way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us pick up the arguments that have been put forward so far. First of all, in relation to what Senator Watson was saying about the classes of vehicles and the fact that more expensive vehicles would not be involved in this, we of course are able in this legislation to pick up only in this particular category because this is the category to which the Government has directed our attention. This principle, of course, could be extended to more expensive vehicles at some later stage. But that opportunity is not presented to us here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the GATT agreement, I am really surprised at just how often the Government trots out this sort of argument. How many other nations are following GATT to the detriment of their industries as slavishly as we are? There are precious few, if any, countries that are following GATT to the letter of the law. At a time when we have such high unemployment, it would seem to me self-evident that a government that is elected by the Australian people has a responsibility primarily to the Australian people, rather than to some abstract document that is not observed by most other nations. For that reason, I think the Government needs to rethink its attitude to our first amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second amendment, the fuel efficiency amendment, has arisen out of the consideration of fuel efficiency. But we should bear in mind that some people for a variety of reasons&mdash;they may have large families; they may have the need to carry goods in their cars; they may have an association with family needs and so on&mdash;find it necessary to buy a larger vehicle. So it was felt that simply putting in a factor which related to fuel efficiency in terms of litres per hundred kilometres would unfairly disadvantage those people who, for quite legitimate reasons, found it necessary to buy a larger vehicle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This formula relates the fuel efficiency to the size of the vehicle so that a large vehicle which is, nonetheless, fuel efficient can still attract a low rate of tax and a small vehicle, which may in turn be less fuel efficient in terms of the consumption for the size of the vehicle, would attract a higher rate of tax. Therefore, there is a pressure on manufacturers to manufacture in every class vehicles that achieve the maximum fuel efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sorry that Senator Panizza has left the chamber. I am sure that in the past I have heard him support Ralph Sarich from his own State of Western Australia and the development of his motor. That motor has now been placed in a General Motors vehicle of moderate size and came in with a fuel consumption, if I remember the figure correctly, of 2.8 litres per hundred kilometres. A vehicle like that would not suffer from any of the disadvantages to which Senator Panizza incorrectly referred, but would attract under this formula probably a tax rate of 7 1/2 per cent, as it should. So it should move us towards greater fuel efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Coming to the substantial argument that the Government has raised, economists have been telling us for a very long time that if we are going to address the very many social and environmental problems which beset us, we need, in their jargon, to `internalise the externalities' so that the cost of goods and services properly reflects their true costs; not just the cost to the manufacturer, the cost to the producer, but the cost to the community in terms of externalities. These would be things like deaths on the road, air pollution in our cities leading to a great amount of ill health, air pollution leading to the decay of city buildings and so on. These costs should be properly registered against the use of those things which are causing these costs to be borne. That is the proper way of costing these things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I simply ask the Government whether it accepts in principle the internalisation of those externalities. If it does, there is no other way in which that can be done other than through the tax system. Rather than make the tax system more complex, it really simplifies the tax system because what the tax system seeks to do then is to internalise those externalities. There is a unitary principle which runs across the whole tax system and it is simply a matter of estimating what those externalities are and putting them into the tax structure so that people are given the correct price signals when they make choices, in this case about motor vehicles and, hopefully, about a whole lot of other things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator McMullan correctly identifies one of the reasons we object so strongly to the Fightback package is that the single rate of 15 per cent denies us as a community, denies the Government, the opportunity to vary that rate, as it should be for those external costs to be internalised. He has come part of the way, but I wonder why he does not go the whole way and recognise that the tax structure is the only way in which externalities can be internalised as they should be in terms of fuel efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Kernot has stressed that figure of $3.1 billion, which is the import bill. Senator Panizza interjected, `How about our exports?'. That is totally irrelevant. We can reduce that import bill of $3.1 billion to zero by improving the fuel efficiency of our motor vehicles, as most of our fuel is used in road transport. We could improve our overall economic performance by $3.1 billion. If we still continue to export, so much the better. But it seems to me that the only instrument that is available to us through market systems, the virtues of which are much extolled by both the Government and the Opposition, is to internalise those externalities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only way we can internalise those externalities is by the Government measuring those externalities and internalising them through the use of the tax structure. Therefore, I think the amendment that Senator Kernot moved has a great deal to commend it. Just as with our amendment in respect of sales tax on recycled paper, which the Government, together with the Opposition, rejected on a number of occasions and then finally made its own, this one also will eventually, as it must, be picked up by the Government and be supported. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The objects of the Forest Conservation and Development Bill 1991 are, in cooperation with the States, firstly, to identify and facilitate the protection and conservation of forest areas of significant environmental, cultural and heritage value; and, secondly, to facilitate investment by enterprises in major wood processing projects for the production of value-added products for export, import replacement or both. These objects will be achieved by, firstly, establishing the procedures and conditions for granting resource security to a wood processing project. This would include completion by the Commonwealth and one or more of the States concerned of a comprehensive, integrated assessment process involving consideration of the environmental, cultural, heritage, social and economic impacts of the project. Secondly, they will be achieved by preventing the exercise of Commonwealth decision-making powers in relation to the project, except in the exceptional circumstances provided for in this Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite these appealing objectives, the Bill in its current form fails to deliver in all respects. The Bill in this form gives the timber industry no resource guarantees whatsoever. It simply exposes major timber industry projects to legislated ministerial intervention and Labor Party politics. The Bill does not provide the industry with the capability to pursue innovative business plans which could rejuvenate the industry, particularly its widely dispersed sawmilling sectors. The Bill shuts out this sector of the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberal and National parties, after very detailed consideration of the legislation and consultation with all aspects of industry, believe that the legislation we have before us will not provide genuine resource security and, therefore, in its present form cannot be supported. Therefore, I move the following amendment on behalf of the coalition:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the end of motion add", but the Senate is of the opinion that the Bill should be withdrawn and introduced in an amended form so that it offers genuine resource security to forest development projects that encourage investment, no matter how small, in enterprises that add value to Australian timber by:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(c)  minimising duplication of Commonwealth and State administration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment appeals to the Government to take note of what the coalition has been saying in relation to amending this legislation in order to take into account the particular concerns that we have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far back as November of last year, the Opposition expressed its preferred position on resource security legislation. The Government has not responded to this unambiguous request to reconsider the legislation. It has shown no desire to build into the legislation equity of support for small and large projects, nor has it shown the political determination to build real guarantees of resource security into the legislation. It has persisted in the fiction that it is doing something important to spur along investment in the timber industry when it has done nothing whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment represents an avenue by which the Government can overcome the Bill's weaknesses. Simply, the coalition wants to extend resource guarantees to small and large timber projects. We wish to see resource projects assessed on a case by case, project by project basis. We do not want the assessment bogged down in duplicated State and Federal environmental and other impact studies. We want an efficient assessment process that, whilst meeting the community's genuine environmental concerns, gives the industry confidence so that it can continue to invest and develop in this country. The Liberal and National parties believe that regional based approaches provide the best practical alternative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make it absolutely clear that the Liberal and National parties totally support the need for resource security and totally support the development of a pulp mill in northern Tasmania and Maryvale in Victoria, given that they satisfy appropriate environmental guidelines. We were, and still are, willing to work with the Government and industry to draft appropriate pieces of resource security legislation for these projects. We are willing to co-operate with the industry and Government in drafting an appropriate and suitably eligible package to offer resource security to the remainder of the industry. We emphasise that we believe the need for resource security legislation has only arisen as a result of the Government's appalling and cynical manipulation of resource development issues, and we do not believe that industry will need or seek resource security legislation under a Hewson Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberal and National parties are totally committed to facilitating development which satisfies strict environmental guidelines. The Opposition supports the framework that has been put in place in Tasmania which will allow a pulp mill to be developed in that State. We support that pulp mill having legislative resource security under State law. Similarly, we support development in other States on the same basis, including extension of the existing project at Maryvale in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concern of the Opposition with this piece of legislation is that the objective is not achieved. As Senator Walsh pointed out in his Cassandra column in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 12 November 1991, in examining the impact of this legislation and the five loose exemptions from resource security which are contained at clause 17:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If words mean what they say, this seems to permit closing down a project at any time by ministerial fiat. "Resource security" takes on a distinctly Orwellian flavour.</PARA>
<PARA>I quote this because the analysis of the Bill by Senator Walsh is the very same analysis of this proposal that was given to the industry by the Opposition from the time the broad proposal was made public by the Government and from the time the working papers which related to the development of this legislation came into our hands. The five exemptions that are listed under clause 17 are a way in which a project can be thwarted down the track. It became quite obvious to the coalition that this was not a formula for resource security but for continued uncertainty in the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very interesting to look at various papers that have been distributed. In particular, I refer to an information paper that was distributed by the Minister for Resources, Mr Alan Griffiths, on 19 February 1991. It is a very important document that covers many of the issues that relate to this area. On page 5, under the heading `Can resource security be provided by non-legislative means?', it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the past, the Government has adopted non-legislative, intergovernmental forest agreements as a means to resolve forest disputes and encourage investment in Tasmania and East Gippsland in Victoria. These have not worked and, in turn, have resulted in a serious lack of investor confidence and an absence of much needed investment in value-adding activities. Given this background, it is extremely unlikely that non-legislative instruments will work in the future.</PARA>
<PARA>This is an important statement issued by the Minister which merely demonstrates much of the hypocrisy that we have all come to know and expect from the Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill in its current form gives no security to the timber industry. We should consider for a moment the mechanics of the legislation. The Commonwealth declares that it will not intervene to disrupt a project. But under clause 17 of the Bill it has retained the power to act on a major and unforeseen environmental or cultural impact not identified at the time of initial access; that is, if it is an unforeseen threat to fauna or flora in the project area, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Crean, can intervene. This provision gives the Minister considerable latitude, and there is no qualification in the Bill which explains how rigorously defined this unforeseen event has to be before the Minister will intervene. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How secure will a potential investor feel within this legislative framework?  There is no guarantee that a Minister driven in search of Green and Democrat preferences at an election will not again overturn a project. There is no legal remedy to projects in case of breach of undertakings for the State and Federal governments, a matter which poorly reflects on the faith the Government has put in its own guarantees. The Government will not put its money where its mouth is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition believes that the Bill is fundamentally flawed. As an umbrella Bill, it duplicates State processes, provides no real guarantee of resource security, and opens the door for phenomenal interventions and abuse for a veritable host of reasons. The Bill has obvious shortcomings. It does not provide resource security. It is wide open for intervention by those who oppose any commercial use of native forests because of the vague provisions under which the Commonwealth may withdraw resource security, including ill-defined biodiversity criteria. The extreme Greens will have yet another legislative weapon in their armoury if the Bill is passed. For them it is a dice heavily loaded in their favour, both in the two-year assessment process and in the subsequent avenues for Commonwealth intervention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The explicit exclusion of any payment of compensation by the Commonwealth is totally unsatisfactory. The Bill does not consider the small sawmill operators&mdash;1200 Australia-wide&mdash;and the small rural towns that draw their livelihood from them. The Bill gives only an illusion of security to large timber industry projects above an investment level of $100m. The Government is indifferent to the smaller rural-based timber industries and it is indifferent to the commercial prospects in regard to value-added strategies that they are well placed to adopt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government can still use such mechanisms as the Foreign Investment Review Board requirements to intervene in such projects, as it did in the past in the Wesley Vale project. It involves the Commonwealth in detailed planning in areas where it has no special expertise and creates undesirable and time consuming duplication of approval processes. Instead of duplicating approval processes, the Commonwealth should simply lay down criteria to be met for large and small scale resource projects at the outset and allow these to be met by interaction between the State government and the relevant companies. Once these standards are met, the Commonwealth should then legislate to endorse the agreement between the States and the enterprise. This would cut down on duplicating administration and would enable effective fast-tracking of projects, which is not possible under existing arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation is a hopelessly compromised attempt to please everyone which has succeeded in pleasing no-one. The National Association of Forest Industries in its submission to the Government in December 1990 made it very clear that the commercial sector of the industry accepts that there are important issues that have to be dealt with in a responsible and detailed way. I have to mention the five-stage process that the National Association of Forest Industries set out in its December submission. This represents a very reasonable assessment of the task which governments face as a prelude to making decisions in relation to secure access to resources and proper conservation values, both of which are important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I seek leave to table an exchange of correspondence between the shadow Minister for primary industries, Bruce Lloyd, and the Minister for Resources, Alan Griffiths. I did seek Minister Cook's endorsement to do so. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The industry's submission has made quite clear to the Government what needs to be done regarding the agreement between the State and the industry. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1). . . an area of forest should be identified under a wood supply agreement as being suitable for long-term investment.</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3)The State and Commonwealth would provide a detailed assessment of the region, looking at conservation values and economic and social issues.

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5)The remaining area would be designed under the legislation as multiple use forest. Under the Commonwealth/State agreement, multiple use forest would be available for production forestry in the long term.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the industry viewpoint&mdash;not just a simple grabbing of a piece of land and a grabbing of a volume of resource, but a careful assessment of what needs to be preserved, what needs to be conserved and what is available for exploitation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This issue is naturally attracting a lot of attention&mdash;from governments, from industry, from individuals and from the media. It is very interesting to reflect on some of the representations and the points that have been made. I have just mentioned that I have tabled the exchange of correspondence, which includes the major submission with regard to what industry sees as the desirable amendments that are so very necessary and which the Liberal and National parties will endorse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me also give some other examples. In a letter of 24 March 1992 from the Premier of Tasmania, Mr Ray Groom, to Mr Keating, the Prime Minister, Mr Groom says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The National Association of Forest Industries has now proposed a number of amendments to the Forest Conservation and Development Bill. The Federal Opposition supports those amendments and I urge the Government to support them too in order to ensure the industry gets the resource security it needs.</PARA>
<PARA>Then there is a letter dated 28 February 1992 from Australian Paper Manufacturers to Mr Griffiths, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AMCOR Ltd announced on 27 February capital expenditure at Maryvale on increased capacity including plantation development of $154m to be spent over the next four years.</PARA>
<PARA>The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would urge you to consider appropriate amendments as suggested by NAFI. It was pleasing to note some foreshadowing of regional security in the economic statement in the CALM-AHC process.</PARA>
<PARA>From the Forest Protection Society of New South Wales comes a press release of 24 March 1992 which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mrs O'Neil went on to say that New South Wales FPS members were urging the Government to accept amendments to the legislation to cover forestry activities in this State, notably the saw milling sector. Without such amendments, the legislation will leave New South Wales industry out in the cold.</PARA>
<PARA>There is an important press release&mdash;that of the National Association of Forest Industries Ltd itself&mdash;attributed to the Director of that Association, Dr Robert Bain. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dr Bain said in the past 24 hours the Federal Opposition and the Tasmanian Government had confirmed their support for a package of amendments presented to the Government last Friday. The amendments will make the legislation genuinely workable. They will enable State governments to put forward properly accredited forest management and development plans with Commonwealth legislation which will provide for the long term conservation and management of forests.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments bring this legislation largely into line with an information paper on resource security issued by the Minister for Resources last year.</PARA>
<PARA>I have already reflected on the hypocrisy of the Minister's stance in that information paper and what the industry and the community can now rightfully expect the Government's action to be. I refer to a press release of the Forest Industries Federation of Western Australian in which that Association has called on the Western Australian Premier, Carmen Lawrence, to intervene. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The letter to the Premier says that without the amendments the legislation does not offer long term security or the confidence for industry to invest in projects throughout the south west. A spokesman for the industry said the potential for industry investment in the next 10 years exceeds $4 billion and offers thousands of new jobs.</PARA>
<PARA>Part of the statement from the Forest Protection Society of Queensland reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This legislation needs to be passed by the Senate but only after it has been amended to encompass State and regional timber strategies rather than just individual projects.</PARA>
<PARA>In a press release entitled `Resource security needed for private plantations too', the Australian Forest Growers states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's private tree plantation owners today joined calls for the Federal Government to adopt proposed amendments to its resource security legislation as a matter of urgency.</PARA>
<PARA>The Forest Protection Society of Western Australian states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The CALM-AHC agreement on forests will be strongly opposed if industry amendments are not included in resource security legislation to be debated in the Federal Senate tomorrow.</PARA>
<PARA>The New South Wales Forest Industries in a press release states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Executive Director of the New South Wales Forest Products Association Doctor Bill Hurditch said today that the recent introduction of State based legislation giving interim protection to the New South Wales industry would be jeopardised by Commonwealth intervention unless the amendments were adopted in the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA>I could go on. Other press releases and statements that I have include those from the Pulp and Paper Manufacturers Federation of Australia, the Victorian Association of Forest Industries, the Australian logging council and, of course, many others interested in this particular area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of these reinforce and state the important point: investment in the hardwood industry is drying up from all sources. It is drying up because hardly anyone believes that the political system in this country&mdash;at either State or Federal level&mdash;will ever be able to muster the firmness of will and the sheer determination needed to break the monopoly of the urban interest groups over the timber industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to direct the attention of the Senate to the joint statement put out by my colleagues the shadow Minister for primary industry, Mr Bruce Lloyd, and the shadow Minister for the environment, the Hon. Fred Chaney, on 5 November 1991, soon after they had seen a draft form of the legislation. In that statement my colleagues made it quite clear that the coalition would support the resource security legislation if it were to accord with the patterns we believe would work, and not produce the difficulties that this legislation will certainly produce. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact of the matter is that this piece of legislation has been born out of cheap politicking. The Labor Government has played games with Australia's basic welfare and with the welfare of Australia's fundamentally important and competitive industries in order to purchase votes and purchase preferences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Chaney and Mr Lloyd have more recently reinforced the position. They have talked about the stance that we will take with regard to this legislation today and the amendment I have moved to the second reading. In the next few days we will present to the Senate committee that will consider this Bill after considerations here today and tomorrow, all of the amendments that we have drafted with regard to those amendments that have been put forward by the industry. I am pleased to note that Senator Burns is Chairman and Senator Brownhill is Deputy Chairman of that committee, and I am sure there will be many other honourable senators participating as we invite the representatives of industries and other groups to make their submissions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come back to the statement made last evening of Mr Lloyd and Mr Chaney in which they said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The future of the resource security legislation rests with the Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If it accepts and moves the amendments proposed by the National Association of Forest Industries, the amended legislation will be supported by the Federal Opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If not, the legislation is doomed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments will make bad legislation more acceptable, and provide some degree of resource security for this important national industry to invest up to $8 billion in timber as well as pulp and paper projects.</PARA>
<PARA>The amendments seek three fundamental and important changes. They extend eligibility for resource security to projects that are to be conducted under duly accredited State forest industry development plans; allow for alternative resource to be provided in the event that the area previously secured is lost for some unforeseen circumstance; and remove the clause which says no compensation will be payable in the event of the resource being removed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Bill fails, it will be because the Government does not want it and has refused to include these amendments which the coalition, the unions, the National Association of Forest Industries, and the rest of the timber industry believe are basic to providing the type of security which will allow investment. The future of the Forest Conservation and Development Bill is therefore fairly and squarely with the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition asks for the withdrawal of this legislation and for genuine resource security legislation to be introduced for the endorsement of approved regional strategies, or for the endorsement of agreements on the development of major projects such as the pulp mill. The legislation is not in a form that is satisfactory. Whilst we will vote that we proceed to the second reading of the Bill after we have moved the amendment that I have already mentioned, we could not pass and move to the third reading stage because of the complexity. It is essential that this matter be given the comprehensive Senate committee consideration that is so very necessary. This is an important issue. It will certainly tax the Senate, but our proposals are certainly being presented in the good interests of Australia. I move:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At end of motion, add ", but the Senate is of the opinion that the bill should be withdrawn and introduced in an amended form so that it offers genuine resource security to forest development projects that encourage investment, no matter how small, in enterprises that add value to Australian timber by:</PARA>

If that is what Senator Coulter says, I can understand that. The Democrats say that we should preserve the forests at all costs and that the value of life is not measured by bread alone, but that there are other issues we have to look at, such as the quality of life and the environment in which we move.

We do not want unfettered licence, as the Opposition would have. We do not want prohibition, as the Democrats seem to want.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 25 February this year North Broken Hill wrote to the Government&mdash;and, I believe, to the Opposition as well&mdash;and said this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to the proposed resource security legislation&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is the Bill which we are debating today&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we would urge that this legislation progress as rapidly as possible as it is our opinion that this will provide an immediate signal to potential partners of the willingness of the Federal Government to create the necessary environment to allow the development of this nationally important project.</PARA>
<PARA>That is an entirely different picture from the one that Senator Tambling was putting forward&mdash;that the industry was opposed to this Bill. Indeed, I would have thought that Senator Tambling, coming from the Northern Territory as he does, would not be as concerned as his fellow senators from Tasmania because, if there is to be development in Tasmania, this is the very Bill that will get it going. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Tambling, either explicitly or at least implicitly, said that the Commonwealth was moving in here and making all the decisions. However, before a project can go ahead, the second condition states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The designated Ministers must be satisfied that the Commonwealth has completed an appropriate assessment process that was conducted in cooperation with one or more States in which it is proposed to conduct the wood processing project.</PARA>
<PARA>As again emphasised in clause 3, the process set up by this legislation is one that goes forward in cooperation with the industry, with the States in which the industry will develop a particular resource, and with the Commonwealth itself. It is an act of cooperation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What Senator Tambling is saying, and what the Opposition's position seems to be, is that the only body to make a decision is the State concerned. What he says is, `Well, if the States come up with a project, the Commonwealth ought to approve it.' In my view, if that were done it would be an abdication by the Commonwealth of its duty not only to see that industries develop but also to protect the resources of this country in a balanced way, and to use its facilities to investigate these things to the best of its ability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Acting Deputy President&mdash;I see there is a new Acting Deputy President in the chair, Senator Crichton-Browne, and certainly there is none better&mdash;one of the issues raised by Senator Tambling in leading the debate on behalf of the Opposition was that the Government is not interested in small projects; that this legislation is aimed only at those big projects in which more than $100m is involved. Certainly, the legislation deals with investments where at least $100m is put forward to finance the project. However, it is incorrect for the Opposition, through its leading speaker, to say that the Government does not turn its mind to the other issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposition put forward by the Opposition, that smaller concerns will not be dealt with by the Government in an appropriate manner, is not correct because the Government fully appreciates the important role which the sawmilling sector plays in the industry and its concern to have secure access to forest resources. The Commonwealth will provide a legislative level of resource security for the sawmilling sector provided that that sector can form an enterprise to meet the eligibility criteria specified in clauses 5 and 11 of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 5 is headed `Wood Processing Projects', and deals with that issue. Clause 11, which is headed `Characteristics of the Wood Processing Project', sets out five conditions which must be met before a project can proceed. In addition to the legislation for the sawmilling sector, the Government intends to provide resource security on a non-legislative basis for investments that do not meet the $100m threshold. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The arrangements to be offered by the Commonwealth through formal Commonwealth-State agreements are similar to the provisions in the legislation in that they include comprehensive up-front assessment and provisions to accommodate changing circumstances of an exceptional nature. The type of project which the Government envisages could well use these arrangements is the hardwood sawmilling industry in the south-east forests of New South Wales, which at this stage cannot meet the $100m eligibility threshold. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In such an instance the Commonwealth would require a number of provisions: firstly, that the enterprise must be willing to commit either to value-adding investment or to industry restructuring; secondly, that the relevant State government must be prepared to offer a longer term contractually based supply licence for sawlogs to enable the investment to proceed, as has been the case in Victoria and Western Australia; and, thirdly, that the woodchip export company must have invested or be prepared to invest in other value-adding activities in Australia, either in sawmilling enterprises or commercial plantations, and agree that domestic value-adding of the woodchips has priority over their use for export. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To the extent that the Commonwealth is involved in export licensing in the region concerned, it will offer a longer term export licence up to the year 2000, and thereafter on a case by case basis on the understanding that if the woodchips are required for domestic use then, subject to market consideration, they should be directed to that end. This should not detract from the Commonwealth's firm desire to achieve maximum domestic processing of woodchips by the year 2000 or soon thereafter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Tambling spent some time on the issue of compensation. It should be said in relation to compensation that the Government believes that there are adequate provisions in the approaches outlined in the Bill to ensure that, even in the unlikely event of resource withdrawal, adequate resources would remain available to projects. These provisions are outlined in clause 9 of the Bill, which authorises the Commonwealth to enter into agreement with a State concerning the provision of resource security for a wood processing project. Clause 9 states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">9(1)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth may enter into an agreement, with one or more States, concerning the provision of resource security for a wood processing project.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> (2)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The agreement is legally binding, but neither the Commonwealth nor any State is liable to pay damages for any breach.</PARA>
<PARA>While the Bill explicitly rules out, as I have just quoted, liability by the Commonwealth or a State to pay financial compensation, it does not prevent the provision of structural adjustment assistance, such as the Government has provided in the past in cases involving World Heritage listings of the forests of south-west Tasmania, the north Queensland rainforests and, most recently, in response to the cessation of logging on Fraser Island. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the Government's record in the area of compensation is good. The Government is entitled to rest on its record with respect to compensation. The issues raised by the Opposition in this regard have been most ungenerous, given the history of the Government's actions in this area until now. Furthermore, there is nothing in the legislation which would preclude a State agreeing to make available alternative resources of equivalent quantity, quality and price in the event of the withdrawal of resources due to unforeseen circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is difficult to understand why the Opposition would want to withdraw this Bill. I am instructed that when the Government was introducing this legislation it wrote to the relevant Opposition shadow Ministers informing them that while the objects of the legislation were straightforward&mdash;and that is made clear by what I have already quoted&mdash;the Bill itself was quite complex. Because of this, the Government extended an invitation for Opposition spokesmen to meet and discuss the legislation prior to the second reading debate. Unfortunately, that invitation was not accepted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has a basis for feeling a little chagrined that the speaker who is leading for the Opposition in this debate should come forward and demand that the Government withdraw this well thought out Bill which takes the middle course between unfettered licence and prohibition. It strikes a happy balance between the need for conservation of our forests and the need to see that proper development takes place. But the Opposition has demanded that this legislation be withdrawn. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation, as I have demonstrated by the quotes that I have given, has met the approval of the industry. The people who develop the forests, who determine the way in which they are used and who are responsible for operating the mills which turn this raw resource into paper, want this Bill passed. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question arises as to why Senator Tambling and the Opposition have taken the approach they have. I think they have done so because they do not understand the Bill. I suppose that there are difficulties in reading Bills. But I would suggest that those opposite see whether they can find someone on their side of the chamber with the ability of Shane Gilbert, the adviser to the Minister on this side. They need someone to take them through the Bill and tell them what it is all about. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think Senator Tambling's comment is very pertinent&mdash;it is the sort of question that should be asked in this chamber. It is a fair question to put to this side. Of course, this Bill by providing resource security gives security for the environment, security for development and security for jobs. The Opposition's approach may give security for development, but it certainly does not give security for the environment. I think Senator Coulter's approach&mdash;I hope I do not do him wrong&mdash;will be to give security for the environment, but not security for development. I think honourable senators would acknowledge that jobs can be obtained through giving security for the environment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have heard the Democrats put the argument forward in the chamber again and again that more jobs can be created by the preservation of resources, by locking up the environment completely, than by development. That might be a perception that the Democrats have but it is certainly not the perception that the industry or the unions have. They want jobs and they see jobs being produced through the development of these resources. That seems to be the community's approach to this as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government says, `Look, the legitimate demands of people for development, the legitimate demands of people for jobs, must be met, but they must be met in the context of the legitimate demands for the environment'. It is not doing the cause of the environment a great deal of good if the approach taken is that there should be no development of any resources, anywhere, at any time. That is not what the community wants. Indeed, it is not what the community needs and it is not the reward that the community should have for the great effort that it has put into developing this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we must have&mdash;and I finish as I started&mdash;is balance, reason and proper judgment. This Bill exhibits the exercise of all of those things. The objects of the Bill are stated in clause 3(1); the way in which those objects are to be achieved is set out in clause 3(2). If those objects are followed, that happy state that we all search for&mdash;of people having jobs, of development, of having an industry and at the same time preserving people's quality of life&mdash;will be obtained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by saying that the combination of legislated resource security for large projects, including integrated hardwood sawmilling projects and large-scale plantation programs, together with the framework of enhanced intergovernmental agreements&mdash;honourable senators should not forget that this is to be done across the board by all governments, State and Federal&mdash;for smaller scale investments in the hardwood sawmilling industry, is an unprecedented package which delivers security and incentive for industry restructuring in an environmentally responsible framework. For all of these reasons, the Government firmly believes that the legislation is sound public policy. The Government urges that all senators support the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I might begin by picking up some remarks of Senator Cooney who referred to me a moment ago and drew a totally false dichotomy between, on the one hand, caring for the environment and what he called `development' and what the Forest Conservation and Development Bill misnames `development'. It is a common trick to present the alternatives as though there were only two and then to ask, `Which one do you want?' when there are other alternatives which can meet much better the various criteria.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Specifically&mdash;and I will refer to this later on&mdash;in the area of fibre for paper making, one can achieve four to five times the amount of fibre production per hectare of land area by growing crops other than wood. It was done for some thousands of years before wood became the common method of paper raw material around the turn of the century&mdash;the nineteenth century into the twentieth century. Two crops in particular that have been well researched and have enormous capability for addressing that issue in Australia are kenaf in the tropical areas and certain species of cannabis in the more temperate climates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we do not need Senator Cooney to go into our old growth forests for woodchipping for paper manufacture. Also in the area of sawn timber for house construction, for high value adding furniture manufacture, there are better opportunities out of the forests and into plantations. Indeed, in north Queensland, where I was just a short time ago, a number of the councils around the Cairns region, recognising that tropical rainforest timbers have become unavailable for high quality furniture manufacture, have embarked on an extensive program of growing plantation tropical rainforest timbers. Some of those are able to be cut and sawn within 10 years and produced as very high quality furniture&mdash;something which is much better achieved in that way than going into old growth forests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I bear for a moment on this word `development', which both previous speakers used. Development is something that one observes when a child grows. It is a process of the gradual evolving of a potential within an individual, an organism, or in a whole system. It proceeds apace; it produces something which is beautiful, finished and complete and then that development ceases. That is the natural process of development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have in the case of forest development very often is clear-felling for woodchips. How Senator Cooney or Senator Tambling can use the word `development' in relation to that is something which really begs a great question mark. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Cooney also mentioned the possibility of investments following the passage of this legislation. As I will develop in my speech, there is no guarantee whatsoever that the one proposal which has been held out, namely, the pulp mill possibly to be built by North Broken Hill, will be built even if this legislation is passed. Specifically, North Broken Hill has given no guarantee whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of guarantees, one can remember the early days. I am old enough and have been in the conservation movement long enough to remember when woodchipping began in this country. It was said that woodchipping would involve only the scraps and leftovers from the sawlog processes that were going on in the forests, and that there would be a more efficient use of those things. As I understand it, Daishowa specifically gave a guarantee that it would build a pulp mill based on chipping in the forests of New South Wales. We have seen what has happened to both those guarantees. Chipping is now far more extensive than simply using the waste from sawlogs and Daishowa has not built a pulp mill in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, how can any newly emerging company enter the market post the passage of this legislation and undertake to spend $100m on something which involved chipping? How would that fit in with the former Prime Minister's undertaking that there would be no more woodchipping in Australia after the year 2000? Again, this begs credibility, because nobody invests that sort of money over such a short timeframe and expects to get the sort of return that would allow woodchipping to be phased out within that timeframe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Forest Conservation and Development Bill is a complete misnomer. Indeed, we are debating one of the most bizarre, dishonest and potentially destructive pieces of legislation to have come before this chamber. This Bill has a title which is unmatched in its Orwellian dishonesty by any that I can recall. The Forest Conservation and Development Bill would not promote forest conservation, but rather forest destruction. Far from encouraging forest development, whatever that may mean&mdash;I have referred to the word `development' already&mdash;it would entrench an outdated and unsustainable mode of economic development. If either the Government or the Opposition really understood the term `ecologically sustainable development' they would understand that if sustainable development were put in place, legislation such as this corrupt Bill&mdash;which is masquerading under the title of the Forest Conservation and Development Bill&mdash;would not be needed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is well known&mdash;and Senator Cooney has referred to this&mdash;that the Democrats are categorically opposed to this Bill and that there is absolutely no way it could be amended to change our view. This Bill is the wrong solution to a problem which has been wilfully misinterpreted and exaggerated. We have heard that said this afternoon. For years, the forestry and forests products industry has complained that it does not have secure access to native forests for logging. It has complained that new national parks and conservation reserves have eaten into the resource available for logging. It has complained about the periodic involvement of the Australian Heritage Commission in Commonwealth decisions on applications to log new areas. It has claimed also that billions of dollars of further investment in wood processing projects will not occur until so-called resource security is provided. In short, the industry has identified federal and State environment approval procedures as the source of all its woes and has made it quite clear that it would dearly love to clear-fell the environmental approval procedures from the legal landscape. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the remarkable aspects of the resource security debate is the Government's</PARA>
<PARA>apparent failure to seriously challenge the industry's grievances and false claims. The Government's intention to proceed with resource security legislation was announced by the former Prime Minister in his industry statement in March last year. In that statement he accepted that the protection of native forests had been partly to blame for a contraction of the forest resource available to industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only four months later, the Resource Assessment Commission, in the most comprehensive assessment of timber availability done to that point, identified the real cause of resource contraction as the over-cutting of forests. In the draft report of its forest and timber inquiry, the Commission concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An important consequence of the prolonged period of overcutting is an impending shortage in the supply of hardwood sawlogs.

A tax-deductible charge equivalent to 2 per cent of the exempt interest actually paid to non-residents is now levied on Approved Issuers. The abolition of the tax for Approved Issuers is likely in some cases to make it more attractive than previously for firms operating in New Zealand to borrow offshore. As a result there may be some diversion of business away from Australian banks operating in New Zealand.

These procedures were the subject of a press release issued on 15 April 1988 by the Commissioner of Taxation after consultation with the Italian Embassy.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The meaning of the term `lease' in Division 5 of Part IIIA of the Income Tax Assessment Act is given its common law meaning.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) In relation to land the traditional legal distinction between a `lease' and an `agreement to lease' is maintained in Part IIIA.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) Is the Government currently considering specific proposals to reform these inequities in the wholesale sales tax treatment of road transport, or is the policy the same as usual?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) Was I aware of a Treasury paper prepared for the Caucus economic industrial relations committee on 26 November 1991, which showed that a figure I quoted in answer to Senator Walsh's question on 5 December was incorrect?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister has provided the following answers to the honourable senator's questions:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The figures quoted on 5 December 1991 in answer to a question from Senator Walsh were derived from a Press Release issued on 1 December 1991 by the then Treasurer, Mr Kerin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The wholesale sales tax (WST) and petroleum fuel excises apply to some business inputs and thus have some cascading effect through the production chain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not, however, accept that this cascading effect leads to an uncompetitive business tax system. Nor do I accept that Australia's business tax structure is uncompetitive. Under this Government, the corporate tax rate at the investor level has been reduced to a relatively low level compared with other OECD countries and, in addition to other measures, the competitiveness of Australian business will be further enhanced by the accelerated depreciation measures announced on 26 February by the Prime Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) I cannot agree with the honourable senator that the differential impact of the WST system on road, rail, sea and air places a disproportionate burden on the cost of groceries. The WST system as a whole adds only an estimated 1.37 percentage points to the gross industry costs of food, beverages and tobacco. An estimate of the contribution of the sales tax on road freight transport, compared with other forms of transport, to this cost is not available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that under the Opposition's GST that all groceries including food will be subject to a 15 per cent tax on their retail price (including the costs of distribution).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) It is not the Government's intention to change the wholesale sales tax (WST) treatment of road transport. The WST is a tax on goods and is not directly levied on services such as transport. However, in lieu of a tax on output, the inputs to services are generally taxed. Thus, while goods producers are able to claim exemption on most of their inputs, which limits the cascading of tax through the production chain, service providers (including the road transport industry) pay tax on their inputs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) The honourable senator has stated that in answer to Senator Walsh's question I suggested that the WST system adds about 2 percentage points to the cost of road transport. In fact I stated that the cost was 2.8 percentage points.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 2.8 per cent figure is the average gross cost of the WST system on the road transport industry. It includes both the direct effect of WST paid on goods purchased by the industry and the indirect effects through the production chain. The road transport industry definition covers passenger and freight road transport. The gross costs include materials used, capital costs, wages salaries and supplements  and  net  commodity  and  indirect taxes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics has, in a separate study, calculated some indicative figures to show that the WST adds 2 per cent to the cost of operating a two axle rigid truck, around 3.8 per cent to a large articulated truck and up to 4.5 per cent for a triple road train. These figures are calculated on a different basis to the ones above. They cover the direct effect of tax paid by the road freight industry on their inputs and in the depreciation of capital items and are expressed as proportion of operating net gross costs.</PARA>
