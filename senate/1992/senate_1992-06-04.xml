<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Minister</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to Ministerial Guidelines 1991 made on 5 February 1992 under section 44 of the Student Assistance Act 1973, considered by the Committee at its meeting of 30 April 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many of the Guidelines confer important discretions upon public officials. One such discretion is to decide a withholding from an entitlement; another is to decide whether failure to pay a debt was the fault of the debtor. Other discretions are to waive or write off a debt entirely or to approve repayment by instalments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most of these discretions have criteria to limit and guide their exercise. However, some criteria include other discretions. Some discretions appear to be subject to internal review, but there is no indication that they are subject to independent merit review by an external tribunal such as the AAT.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some of the discretions have important implications for personal rights. For example, one provision is that a section of the Act may be used to garnishee deductions from wages and salary or from an account at a bank or other financial institution.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee would appreciate your advice on the availability of review of all of the discretions in the Guidelines. Thus, in the case where wages or a bank account may be garnisheed, external merits review would appear to be essential. The parent Act provides extensive review provisions and it may be that the discretions in the Guidelines are caught by these. However, we would appreciate your advice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yours sincerely</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CANBERRA ACT 2600</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator Giles</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your letter of 30 April 1992 detailing concerns of the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances regarding the Ministerial Guidelines 1991 under section 44 of the Student Assistance Act 1973 covering debt recovery action.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I note your concern that the Guidelines confer important discretionary powers on public officials without clearly stating what review mechanisms, if any, are available to individuals affected by their decisions. The Committee is keen to ensure that debtors have appeal rights in relation to the garnishee of wages or a bank account, but it is also of the view that decisions to waive or write off debts, withhold from an entitlement or to approve repayment by instalments should be appellable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As you are aware, the parent Act prescribes the appeal process available to AUSTUDY students. A decision of an authorised person may be reviewed by a senior authorised person. The outcome of a review by the senior authorised person may subsequently be reviewed by the Student Assistance Review Tribunal (SART). If the client is still dissatisfied, he or she may apply to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) for a further review.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In all cases the review process applies only to decisions made by authorised persons, or to such decisions as subsequently varied by a lower appeal body. Only matters of eligibility or entitlement are reviewable. (The exceptions to this ruling concern "procedural decisions" as defined under section 13(1) and relate to the discretion of authorised persons to extend the length of time clients have to lodge an appeal to SART.)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All decisions to waive or write-off debts, to approve withholdings from entitlement and garnishee arrangements are made by prescribed officers rather than authorised persons, and, as such, are not appellable under the Act. It is not possible to establish a review process for decisions of prescribed persons in the Ministerial Guidelines without amending the parent Act. Such action is not envisaged.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You expressed particular concern for clients subject to garnishee action. It should be noted that under the Social Security Act 1991, DSS clients have no rights of appeal against a decision to garnishee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clients who are dissatisfied with a decision concerning the debt recovery process may write to me seeking redress. Alternatively, as you are aware, they may appeal under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Parliament House</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CANBERRA ACT 2600</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Minister</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to Determination No. 1991-92/12, Community Aged Care Services General Conditions and Determination No. 1991-92/24, made under sections 10GI and 10F respectively of the Aged or Disabled Persons Care Act 1954.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Community Aged Care Services General Conditions</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 3 includes a number of detailed criteria which are to be used by a Community Aged Care Assessment Authority for the assessment of the needs of individuals. These involve the exercise of discretions. Then, apparently despite the assessment by the Authority, clause 3(5) provides that the Secretary may accept or reject a recommendation of a Hostel Care Assessment Authority or a Community Aged Care Assessment Authority.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee asks whether there is provision for review of Authority decisions. Also, is there provision for review of the open-ended discretion of the Secretary to reject a recommendation of a presumably expert Authority applying clearly defined criteria? On the face of it, this would appear to be a clear case where AAT review should be provided. Perhaps this is included in the parent Act. If so, it should have been notified in the Explanatory Statement. In addition, it would appear that there should be provisions requiring the Authority and the Secretary to give reasons for the adverse exercise of a discretion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Again, clause 9(3) provides for the Secretary to give notice to the organisation to take mandatory steps. Clause 9(4) provides for the Secretary, in his or her discretion, to impose sanctions on an organisation. In both these cases review may be appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the context of the desirability of external merits review in the above cases the Committee noted that the Secretary, as defined in clause 1, includes either the Secretary or an officer of the Department authorised in writing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under clauses 6(2)(d) and (e) a recipient has to "show" that he or she has less than certain levels of income after costs. To whom does the recipient have to show this? This would also appear to be a suitable case for AAT review.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On a different matter, clause 10(8) provides in wide terms for an indemnity and release to the Commonwealth and its officers. The Committee was concerned at the extent of this indemnity, which includes the cost to the Commonwealth of defending or settling any claim, including those relating to any vehicle or equipment, in respect of any liability as a result of the provision of community aged care. Admittedly, an organisation is required by clause 10(9) to carry public liability insurance, but this would presumably only cover situations where the organisation was the defendant. Certainly it would not cover all of the situations included in clause 10(8) where the Commonwealth or its officers were the defendants.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amendment of the General Conditions of Recurrent Subsidies</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The provisions of this instrument largely parallel those of the previous instrument and our concerns are similar.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">New clauses 2(b)(i), 3(2)(b), 3(3)(f) and (g) and 3(6) provide for the acceptance, rejection, variation or review by the Secretary of recommendations by the Hostel Care Assessment Authority and Personal Care Assessment Authority. Here, as with the previous instrument, the Committee is concerned about review of discretions. In particular, is there AAT review of the discretion of the Secretary, where presumably expert Authorities, applying clearly defined criteria, have their assessments rejected? Is there a requirement that reasons must be given for a rejection? The Committee noted that under clause 3(7) there is a right of review to the Minister from adverse decisions of the Secretary under clause 3(6). However, in this context Minister means the Minister or any officer authorised in writing. There is a similar provision for the Secretary. The argument in favour of independent review is stronger where there is a wide delegation power.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As with the previous instrument, it would seem that this is a case where AAT review should be available.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are other discretions where review may be appropriate. Clause 3(5)(c) provides that the Secretary may extend the period during which assessments are to be made. Clause 3(8) provides a discretion about repayment of monies. With reference to this latter situation, the Administrative Review Council has recently recommended in respect of the Child Care Act 1972 that recovery powers not substantially different from those in other Acts should be subject to merits review.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On another point, clause 3(6)(e) provides that where there is a variation of an assessment or classification, it is taken to have effect from the original date of assessment and any payments will be adjusted accordingly. Clause 3(8) reinforces this by providing that, where there has been a variation under clause 3(6) or (7), the Secretary may require repayment and the moneys become a recoverable debt or can be deducted from future payments. On its face, this retrospectivity could operate to the prejudice of a person other than the Commonwealth with the provision consequently being of no effect.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee would appreciate your advice.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CANBERRA ACT 2600</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator Giles</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your letter of 7 May 1992 regarding Determinations number 1991-92/12 and 1991-92/24 made under section 10GI and 10F of the Aged or Disabled Persons Care Act 1954 ("the Act").</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In you letter, the Committee raise a general concern about the adequacy of review mechanisms provided in these two instruments, suggesting several areas where merits review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ("the AAT") should occur. The letter also raises concerns about a range of other powers within those Determinations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I acknowledge the Committee's concerns and agree that it may be more appropriate to have an independent body, such as the AAT, review the exercise of certain discretionary powers. However, the points you query relate both to decisions which could appropriately be subject to merits review and other decisions where such a review would not, in my opinion, be appropriate. Later in this letter I have outlined some areas where I agree that merits review by the AAT could apply and other areas where I would submit that other existing avenues of review (such as review by the Federal Court) would appear to be sufficient and more appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, in the meantime, it is imperative that the process of implementing the revised hostel General Conditions and the Community Aged Care Services General Conditions contained in the Determinations should continue unimpeded. This is crucial, as the amendments in the Determinations to the section 10F and 10GI Conditions allow for implementation of the new initiatives in aged care which will see substantial increases in funding to hostels and expansion of the services provided in the community. As you are aware, the new arrangements for hostels were introduced on 29 April 1992, while a number of Community Aged Care Packages projects have been funded since mid February 1992. To this end I am prepared to give the Committee certain undertakings as to making amendments to the General Conditions and seeking amendments to the Act in an effort to address the Committee's concerns. As the Committee appreciates, any changes proposed to the Act will be subject to the priorities of the legislative program of the Government which is a matter on which I am unable to give binding assurances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In general, sections 10F and 10GI of the Act require me to formulate General Conditions for the payment of financial assistance to organisations which run hostels and which provide Community Aged Care Services Packages respectively, and list a range of specific issues the conditions could cover. The General Conditions form part of the Agreement which each organisation has with me and are the prime means by which I can ensure that organisations use the funds they receive appropriately.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The main issue raised in your letter focuses on the assessment role of Community Aged Care Assessment Authorities ("CACAA"), Hostel Care Assessment Authorities ("HCAA"), Personal Care Assessment Authorities ("PCAA"), and the Secretary's power to accept/reject their recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is very important to note that despite the similarities in their names (which are due to historical reasons) those bodies have very differing roles within the aged care program. The primary role of HCAAs, and of newly created CACAAs, is to assess frail aged as to their eligibility for entry to a kind of care, against the specified criteria set out in the Determinations. Conversely, assessments undertaken by PCAAs are a basis upon which people already admitted to hostels are ranked in order of their requirement for care, which in turn leads to decisions about allocation of finite resources to hostel providers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Therefore, while I agree that AAT merits review may be appropriate for HCAA and CACAA assessments, I would not see this as appropriate for the reviews of PCAA decisions. The AAT has previously expressed the opinion that decisions involving the distribution of limited resources (where to grant a benefit to one applicant would involve a denial of a similar benefit in respect of another applicant) would not be appropriate for merits review. This would appear to apply to PCAA assessments as the relevant Government decision which established the basis for this scheme did so by predetermining the proportions of residents which, when ranked, will be allocated to each personal care level. Estimates for the program are based on these proportions, as are the cut-off scores for the assessment instrument, and only a specific level of growth is included for increases in average dependency each year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to PCAA assessments, there is room for clarification of the decision and review points which may go some way to addressing the Committee's concerns relating to the Secretary's discretion. This would involve some clarification of wording in the relevant clauses of the General Conditions to clarify the role of the PCAA in making an assessment and the role of the Secretary in deciding an initial classification and at any time reviewing assessments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Outlined below are details of the respective roles of the three assessment authorities and some changes to the current provisions which I am willing to pursue in an attempt to address the Committee's concerns:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">HOSTEL CARE AND COMMUNITY AGED CARE ASSESSMENTS</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The HCAA assesses for an entry to the level of care provided by hostels. In the majority of cases this is now done by Geriatric Assessment Teams ("GAT"), composed of a range of health professionals. However, there are still many HCAAs composed of people associated with the hostel who may not have specific assessment skills. It is intended that all non-GAT HCAAs will cease to exist by 30 June 1993, as all assessments for entry to hostels will by then be made by GATs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The provision of clause 3(2)(b)(i) of 10F Conditions, by which the Secretary may accept or reject a recommendation by a HCAA, originated at the time when all assessments for hostel entry were undertaken by people associated with hostels, who often did not possess specific assessment skills. It was intended to allow the Secretary to intervene where the criteria contained in the Conditions were not applied correctly in the hostel's assessment of a resident. Under the current arrangements this power is used where review of a recommendation by either a GAT or other HCAA is requested by an aged person. There have not been many cases of such action to date.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I acknowledge the Committee's concern in this area and propose that a more formal process for review by the Secretary of HCAA assessments and subsequent appeal to me should be provided. Such changes would also ensure that hostel admission arrangements are brought in to line with those for nursing home admission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The revised provisions would include reference to the criteria to be applied in reviewing the assessment and considering an appeal, a requirement for an authorised form to be used, and a requirement to give the reasons for a decision in writing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I will arrange for the above provisions to be introduced in the forthcoming consolidation of hostel General Conditions formulated under section 10F of the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, I agree that there is value in ensuring that AAT review is also available for people wishing to challenge decisions resulting from assessments by HCAAs. AAT reviews are provided for the nursing home admissions, although to date there have not been any applications for such reviews. However, the introduction of AAT review may well require an amendment to the Act rather than merely to the Conditions. If this is necessary, I will pursue the making of suitable amendments to the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The CACAA is composed of an organisation's own staff who assess a person for the higher level of services which a care package is to provide. This is analogous to the eligibility assessment of an HCAA (although at a different level) and, therefore, the same considerations apply.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Similar arrangements to those outlined above for review and appeal for hostel entry will be also be pursued in regard to assessments for Community Aged Care Packages.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">PERSONAL CARE ASSESSMENTS</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Personal care assessments are undertaken to enable determination of funding levels for hostels. The role of PCAAs is analogous to that of Directors of Nursing rating nursing home residents on the Resident Classification Instrument ("RCI").</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As indicated, PCAAs, who are hostel supervisors or other staff responsible for provision of personal care, assess the degree of care need of their residents. The result of such assessment is used by the Secretary, on the basis of the organisation's application, to classify residents. This process amounts to a ranking of residents of all hostels in order of their requirement for care, relative to other residents. Classification to a level of personal care determines the amount of subsidy payable in respect of each resident to a hostel.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">PCAAs have to undertake their assessments in accordance with provisions in clause 3(3), which include using the authorised form (Personal Care Assessment Instrument&mdash;PCAI), and carrying out the assessments over a specified period, in most cases 21 days.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The intent of clause 3(3)(f) of the 10F Conditions is not so much to enable a rejection of an application per se, but to ensure that only correctly completed applications (i.e. those completed according to clause 3(3) and following specific instructions, as indicated in clause 3(3)(b)) for classification to be accepted. Once a correct application is received, clause 3(4) will apply, and a resident will be classified to one of three levels of personal care. No discretionary power applies to this process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I agree that to more accurately reflect this situation, the relevant clauses (ie. clauses 3(3)(f) to 3(3)(h)) should be amended. This will also be done in the consolidation of the hostel General Conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The arrangements for reviewing personal care assessments and for appeals to me where such a review is disputed are consistent with provisions for RCI classifications in nursing homes. Under those arrangements assessments made by PCAAs are verified by delegates of the Secretary (who are appropriately qualified) who periodically visit hostels to establish whether the existing assessments, upon which subsidy is being paid, were made in accordance with clause 3(3).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where an organisation disputes the review results, it can appeal to me pursuant to clause 3(7). My powers under that clause are not delegated to officers of the Department as I consider it important that organisations have this recourse to me available. An appeal would be investigated on my behalf by appropriately qualified staff, who would use the same guidelines and apply the same criteria as were used when the assessment in question was made, and report to me.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A final point of clarification which relates to PCAA reviews and appeals is that personal care funding is not specifically attached to each individual resident. It is pooled by hostels and, together with other income contributes to the general provision for the care needs of hostel residents. The review and appeal in question therefore is not in relation to funding specifically attached to an individual resident but to an effect on the hostel's overall income at the margin, which may be affected both positively and negatively by review of different clients.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given concerns expressed earlier as to the appropriateness of merits review on decisions which affect allocation of finite resources and the indirect connection to the funding of care for individual residents, I do not think that AAT reviews in respect of PCAAs assessments would be appropriate. However, as indicated above, I am prepared to pursue amendments to clarify the decision making processes in the General Conditions on these issues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your letter also raised two more specific concerns of the Committee related to personal care reviews and their results.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One relates to the date of effect of those reviews. I would like to clarify that the review process under clause 3(6) establishes whether the claim on Commonwealth subsidy made by organisation through their assessments of the care needs of residents have been made correctly in accordance with sub-clauses 3(3)(a), 3(3)(b) an 3(3)(c). The Review Officers have regard to the condition of a resident at the time when the assessment was made (ie. during the 21 days, or other period as appropriate under 3(3)(b)). Therefore the adjustment of the payment, which will be either a recovery of money or additional payment, will reflect the actual entitlement of the hostel to that level of subsidy. Accordingly, I would submit that this could not be properly regarded as offending the prohibition on retrospectivity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The other aspect of this concern was that this clause might seek to affect decisions made before the making of the conditions which brought in this review powers. If such an interpretation were given to the administration of this clause, subsection 48(2) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 would apply so that the clause would have no effect. I can assure the Committee that this clause does not have any element of retrospectivity as this review process will only be in respect of decisions made under the amended section 10F Conditions, which can not be made any earlier than 29 April 1992, which was the date of implementation of those new arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second point relates to provisions for repayment of monies</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">following review or appeal in clause 3(8). The wording used indicates a discretionary power, however overpaid subsidy will be recovered in all cases, which reflects the Commonwealth obligation to recover debts. This clause will be amended to reflect this and make it clear that no discretionary decision making process on the Secretary's part is involved.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are a number of other areas where you suggest the need for AAT appeal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 9 of the 10GI Conditions sets out the means by which continued breaches of the Conditions will be handled. This involves a process of discussions, actions identified and, if required, financial sanctions of varying severity upon future payments to the organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By using this process the Commonwealth can seek to ensure that funds are appropriately used without resorting to my power under the Act to revoke an organisation's approval.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where an organisation considers that no breach has occurred which permits a sanction to be imposed, it has recourse to the Federal Court under such provisions as the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977. Since the issue of whether a breach has occurred or not, given the nature of the Conditions, is clear cut, I do not see that it is appropriate or necessary for merits review of a decision to impose a sanction.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I need to make clear the provisions in clause 6 of the 10GI Conditions. While through this clause the Commonwealth regulates the fee charging policies of provider organisations, it does not set the fees, nor does it in any other way get directly involved in the fee charging process. Clause 6 requires the provider to reduce the fee where a recipient of a care package demonstrates to the organisation that they are being charged too high a fee (as defined in the clause). The only role the Department may play is where an organisation did not reduce a fee as required and the recipient complains. The Department would then investigate the complaint and make use of the powers under Clause 9 discussed above where a breach of the Conditions is identified.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 3(5)(c) of the 10F Conditions hostels relates to the transition to the new personal care arrangements which were introduced from 29 April 1992. According to those new provisions hostels have 56 days to assess existing residents to receive a personal care subsidy for them from 29 April. This clause allows for extension of the transition period only in cases of substantial difficulties, where a hostel is prevented from assessing its residents in the required time frame due to circumstances clearly beyond a hostel's control, such as illness of staff responsible for undertaking assessments. The test to be applied to the granting of an extension of time is deliberately spelt out in detail in the text of this clause and is, therefore, clear in referring to an</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">exceptional situation. It may be that no hostels apply for this extension, but I felt it was important to provide for some exceptional circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You also raised another point not related to AAT review provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The indemnity provision in clause 10(8) of the 10GI Conditions is a standard clause used by the Department with funded organisations to make clear that while the Commonwealth provides subsidies, the provision of care and the way in which it is provided is the organisation's responsibility. Given this, it would not be appropriate for the Commonwealth or its representatives to be held accountable for the organisation's actions in delivering care services for which funding is provided.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe that the changes I have committed myself to pursue respond to the most significant concerns of your Committee and that clarification of provisions contained in the amendments to the General Conditions should allay the Committee's remaining concerns. I thank your Committee for its comments. If you wish to pursue any further matters of detail on the General Conditions or the programs which they regulate I would offer Mr Robert Griew (ph. 289 5475) as a contact officer in the Department.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yours sincerely</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable senators would recall that the Committee was established on 5 June last year with terms of reference so comprehensive that virtually all aspects of superannuation, and retirement incomes policy generally, came within their orbit. The subject matter was, and still is, both topical and controversial. Indeed, the Government announced major policy changes in the area even before the Committee had held its first meeting. Some of these changes are the subject of legislation now before the Senate. The subject area is replete with great complex legal and taxation matters&mdash;so much so that even the experts on occasions are confused.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It soon became apparent that the Committee would be unable to do justice to the subject if it were to attempt to cover all the ground with the necessary thoroughness and complete its task by the original deadline of 28 May 1992. This became more obvious with the reference to the Committee of the superannuation guarantee legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accordingly, and with the indulgence of the Senate, we decided to report in three stages. We further decided that, in view of the rapid build-up of the sums available for investment by superannuation funds and the elevation of superannuation to a major component of personal savings, the highest priority should be given to those parts of the terms of reference that deal with the regulation of superannuation, in the interests of minimising exposure to risks of mismanagement or fraud and of maximising members' rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report contains 48 recommendations which, if implemented, will go a long way towards the achievement of these objectives. They point to a way of widening the constitutional base of the Commonwealth's power over superannuation, giving more teeth and more resources to the Insurance and Superannuation Commission as the primary regulator. One of the recommendations we make is that the Insurance and Superannuation Commission should have active interventionist power in some circumstances to take control of superannuation funds, given prima facie evidence of theft or fraud. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They advocate the spelling out of trustees' duties and responsibilities in much greater detail than at present and the introduction of a wider range of prudential controls. They call for the specification of who may and who may not become trustees; for improved education and training; and for measures designed to improve trustees' ability to act independently in the interests of all fund members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report also covers the vexed question of the accumulation and ownership of fund surpluses, which has recently been the subject of legal disputation and remains one of controversy. We take a strong line against in-house investment and support measures to ensure that fund managers are properly qualified and accredited. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not, however, support the compulsory direction of investment toward so-called national interest projects, nor do we advocate restrictions on investment overseas. One member has, however, submitted a minority report on these matters. In terms of this issue we recognise that there are a number of problems, particularly regarding the ability of trustees to make objective and long term decisions, especially decisions in relation to spreading investment into some of the more innovative capital development areas. However, we believe that those objectives can be fulfilled and met by broader education requirements for trustees and by broader goals and objectives being set down, rather than compulsion at this stage. We recommend that in three years a review of this issue be undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report contains recommendations for the stimulation of competition in the provision of superannuation in order to guarantee `value for money' and for the establishment of an ombudsman to resolve certain classes of disputes in a way which will minimise the need for action through the courts, thus saving extensive time and legal costs. These matters are highlighted by two case studies that are illustrated in the report. All of the recommendations are quite specific in setting out what we believe ought to be done, who should do it and, where appropriate, when. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee has dealt with a huge workload and its task is far from complete. I pay tribute to my Senate colleagues, who have worked tirelessly towards its completion. I also pay tribute to the staff of the secretariat, who have worked in a similar manner. The Committee has worked very largely in a non-partisan way, as testified by the unanimous endorsement of all but two of our 48 recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report covers some areas that have recently been the subject of recommendation by the Law Reform Commission in terms of prudential control. I believe the report will play an important role in leading to some finalisation of the various `big picture' issues which have been the subject of much discussion over the last decade and which, in many respects, have been unresolved for the last 80 years. I am pleased to say in a partisan way&mdash;this is the only partisan comment I will make&mdash;that the Government of which I am part is working very actively towards resolving all of the big picture issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very difficult to ensure overnight the resolution of the big picture issues. Some of the almost frightening aspects of superannuation are its enormous complexity, its breadth and the difficulty of ensuring the resolution of all outstanding issues on superannuation in one big hit with one piece of legislation. Personally, I hope that the big picture issues which are the subject of much discussion and controversy are resolved in the not too distant future, say in the next six to 12 months. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation is a very important report. I commend the efforts of the Committee's staff. I have been particularly impressed by the quality of their work. Having been involved in a number of Senate committees over the last six years, I would say that the output of this Committee is better than that of any other with which I have been associated. I also pay tribute to my colleagues on the Committee. In particular, I think Senator Sherry has chaired the Committee very effectively and this has enabled us to operate in a very cooperative spirit. The Senate ought to be very proud that we have a report that goes to the heart of some very important issues. It is one that will make a major contribution to ensuring that we have more effective regulation of superannuation in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is clearly an urgent need for one port of call when it comes to regulation. Therefore, we recommend that the Insurance and Superannuation Commission be a sole regulator of the industry. The Commission needs to be properly resourced. It currently has a budget of $17.3m. We recommend that that be reviewed and that there be a greater degree of formal and informal liaison with the other regulatory bodies which have an interest, at the margin at least, in the superannuation area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, it is essential, on the one hand, that we avoid perceptions that the ISC is the poodle of the industry and, on the other hand, that we avoid falling into the trap of its becoming captured by the populists. Therefore, one of the most important recommendations we make is that there be a panel of commissioners who are independent as far as possible, who have proven expertise in superannuation, and who are not simply the mouthpiece of vested interests. I think that will go a long way towards assisting the ISC in ensuring that it does play that pro-active role as regulator, that it does carry out effective random audits, that it is in a position to replace trustees where there is a need to do so, and that it operates very effective early warning systems. Otherwise there is a very great risk that there will be a massive loss of confidence from ordinary Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, with the ever increasing growth of assets of superannuation funds, currently $130 billion plus, whichever government is in power is going to have to confront the ever increasing risk that the fast buck merchants will be drawn like moths to a flame. Australia cannot afford to do a Maxwell, and I hope that we will be anxious to act as urgently as possible to ensure that proper regulatory systems are in place and that investors or contributors are guaranteed that they will get their money back in the event of fraud. We simply cannot afford to have the punters left lamenting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we do go down this path, one of the most important watchdogs will be the media. Therefore we recommend that the ISC establish a national database, which hopefully will allow virtually instant access for quality journalists who will then be in a position to report to the masses. In many respects that is a much more desirable approach then spending ever increasing numbers of dollars and expecting all manner of regulators to publish all sorts of pieces of information which can often simply be a vehicle for patting the Government on the back. I would much prefer to put my trust in those in the media who do take a specialist interest in the subject and to ensure that they are fully informed of the facts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One other area to which particular attention ought to be drawn, in view of the comment of some out there who talk longingly about the need for bipartisanship, is that whilst the industrial relations element bedevils superannuation it will be very difficult to achieve the sorts of reforms that are necessary. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry, I will use that term. I was, in fact, invoking what had been said by others about the need for bipartisanship, but I take Senator Kernot's point. Multipartisanship is what we ought to be aspiring to. Let me give you one critical example of an area in which I think we will run into very big problems unless we can separate out the industrial relations debate, and that is in the area of preservation. A very important recommendation is contained in 10.4, where it says that there will be a significant cost to revenue unless we move to take action on that front.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> As recently as last night, the ACTU again made it clear that it will continue to veto any increase in the preservation age. The Government again seems locked into doing whatever the ACTU asks of it in this area. The immortal words of the current Prime Minister (Mr Keating) that raising the preservation age is too difficult politically and industrially is a classic example of an abdication of responsibility. Clearly, he recognises the need to move but is constrained by those who pull the strings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If ever there was a graphic illustration of a need to get rational debate into the system on a multipartisan basis, then raising the preservation age ought to be it. I call on the Government to address that issue urgently to avoid the substantial cost to revenue. I urge the Government to avoid falling for the sophistry peddled by the ACTU that somehow we need more information and more research and more anything else but action on this front, and to bite the bullet as the Opposition has already done. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is true. I support the Chairman's remarks and the work of the Committee in handing down this report in such a short time. I would draw attention to what we understand about the complexity of the whole superannuation debate, and how the report&mdash;especially in its opening chapters&mdash;will assist in educating a wide cross-section of the population on superannuation. This is something which is long overdue. We have seen so much evidence of the naivety of consumers who trustingly hand over to some agent the whole future of their retirement income, no questions asked.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report goes a long way towards addressing the need for public education. It addresses two of the so-called black holes in the superannuation debate. The first is that of trustees, including the very complex law which governs their operations. The second black hole concerns funds managers who handle billions of dollars, but who are not known either personally or in a corporate sense by the millions of contributors who have joined one of the 100,000 superannuation funds responsible for investing over $140 billion. If the SGL is to go through, that will rise to an amount of something like $600 billion. This is why we should be very serious about what we do with the supervision and regulation of superannuation funds in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of trustees, the law needs codifying to ensure that superannuation trustees are operating on the basis of a common national standard vis-a-vis their obligations to members. We believe it is essential that all arm's length funds have equal employer-employee representation. This principle is an essential ingredient of any good watchdog system. We have seen evidence of the need for this in the Byrnwood case. Trustee education is a prerequisite to funds being operated in a way which maximises a fund's assets, and pays due regard to the returns which long term investments can bring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of the second black hole, the funds managers, the top five fund managers control 44 per cent of superannuation funds. That is why we believe the ISC and the TPC&mdash;the Trade Practices Commission&mdash;will need to monitor this characteristic of superannuation to ensure that it does not stifle true competition. That is why Parliament needs to maintain a watching brief on this. Funds managers and their performance do need to be the subject of close community scrutiny in future years. Such scrutiny requires an informed community, and this report, as I said, goes a long way towards assisting an informed community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have made some minority recommendations, but before I touch briefly on those, I want to say, from the point of view of the Democrats, that it is essential that the Government gives a very clear and specific commitment to act on the recommendations of this report. We have talked about the big picture. Here is one part of it that is able to be filled in. I agree with Senator Alston that not only is this important but matters such as preservation are, indeed, essential parts of the big picture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have touched on two areas. One is investment direction, and the other is a limit on offshore investment. I will not go into those in detail except to say that I really challenge the underlying assumption that it is not in the national interest to stimulate overall economic performance by direction of a small amount of investment, because it conflicts with a trustee's duties to provide maximum return for members. I contend strongly that if we can maximise overall economic performance, in the long term returns can be maximised as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to spend the last minute commending the special secretariat. I think they are a special secretariat, and I want to mention them by name: Richard Gilbert, Lyn Curran, Michael Game, Rod Power and Heather Hibbitt. I thank them for their harmonious and professional approach. They are a wonderful team. They have provided members of the Committee with consistently first-class research material and assistance&mdash;not just research but assistance to us. They deserve special commendation. I commend my colleagues on the Committee. We have, I think, behaved very professionally, but I wonder how we will go on the next Committee report, where we already know of obvious areas of disagreement.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of the Sugar Cane Levy Amendment Bill is to amend the maximum rate of levy on sugar cane, to 15 cents per tonne, as provided for in section 7 of the Sugar Cane Levy Act 1987. The Bill has been prepared following a request from the Australian raw sugar industry. The request was made by the Australian Cane Growers' Council, represented by Canegrowers, and the Australian Cane Farmers Association on behalf of sugar cane growers and the Australian Sugar Milling Council on behalf of the millers of sugar cane.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Sugar Cane Levy Act 1987 provides for an industry levy on sugar cane, produced in Australia and accepted for processing at a sugar mill, to provide funds for the activities of the Sugar Research and Development Corporation. The Act provides for a maximum rate of levy which is currently set at 10 cents per tonne of sugar cane.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government provides funding to match industry levies up to 0.5 per cent of the annual gross value of production (GVP), in line with established policy of encouraging increased rural productivity and profitability through research and the commercialisation of research findings .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is generally recognised that research and development in the sugar industry is underfunded at present when compared with Commonwealth funding of research and development efforts in other rural industries. Currently about 0.17 per cent of GVP is being matched in the sugar industry when compared with an estimated 0.5 per cent in the wool, meat, wheat and oilseed industries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The sugar industry is committed to industry funded research and wishes to increase this commitment to the Commonwealth scheme through an increased levy in order to maintain its competitive export and domestic marketing position. The current rate of levy is 6 cents per tonne. However the sugar industry has indicated its wish to increase that levy to 14 cents per tonne for the 1992 season. The current maximum levy rate of 10 cents per tonne is thus hindering this increase and so preventing the sugar industry from utilising the full potential of the Commonwealth R&amp;D scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's rural research and development policy, which encourages increased contributions by primary industry, was established by the Government in February 1985 and reaffirmed in the May 1989 Government statement, "Research, Innovation and Competitiveness" .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The sugar industry is one of Australia's most important agricultural industries. Sugar is Australia's third most valuable export crop, after wheat and cotton, and 75 to 80 per cent of raw sugar production is exported. Production in 1991-92, was 3.2 million tonnes of raw sugar from a drought affected crop of 21.3m tonnes of sugar cane, with a gross value of production estimated at $585m. This is well below the record level of 3.8 million tonnes of sugar produced in 1989-90, but production is expected to rise again, with increases in the area of land under cane.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">About 95 per cent of total Australian sugar production is based in Queensland with the remainder drawn from Northern New South Wales .</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today to debate the Taxation Administration Amendment Bill 1992. This Bill will seek to amend the Taxation Administration Act 1953 to provide royal commissions with the same authority to seek information that is available to specified law enforcement agencies under section 3E of the Act. The Bill will now allow the Western Australian Royal Commission into Commercial Activities of Government and Other Matters and future royal commissions access to relevant taxation information under the Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition's position is not to oppose the Bill. But our concern is about the amount of access which has been given, with which we disagree. The Government is proposing that access will be available only where it is necessary to  prove a serious offence. The definition of a serious offence is normally taken to mean one that attracts a prison term of more than 12 months. The coalition regards this as too high a barrier, particularly in the case of royal commissions. Therefore, I should be stating clearly a case for the different treatment of this access being provided to royal commissions by the Australian Taxation Office in relation to certain tax files. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill has arisen from a specific request from the Royal Commission in Western Australia to the Federal Government that the law be amended as necessary to ensure that the Western Australian Commission has full access to the information it needs to pursue the terms of reference of its inquiry in relation to Western Australia Inc. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Templeman, counsel assisting the inquiry, was quoted in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sun-Herald</EMPHASIS> newspaper on 13 May 1992 as stating that he wrote to the Commission requesting the same access as was given to the Queensland royal commissioner, Tony Fitzgerald, in 1987. In particular, in the opinion of the Commission, the Government's original refusal for investigatory access to tax files has helped to make impossible any conclusive findings on corruption in the so-called Western Australia Inc. scandals. Further, consequent requests from all associated with the Western Australian Royal Commission have been for the same powers as the Federal Government extended to the Fitzgerald Royal Commission in 1987. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Western Australian Premier, Dr Carmen Lawrence, demanded in her press releases that the Royal Commission be granted these same powers. The Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives, Mr Ron Edwards, from Western Australia, also reiterated that call. We all know the original government position was that the current level of secrecy should not be disturbed. The Bill before us today is evidence that the Government has reversed its stance on the matter. It does not mean that the Western Australian Royal Commission will get exactly the same level of access to the information that this Labor Government gave to the Fitzgerald Royal Commission. I cannot understand this Government's refusal in the first place not to give the Western Australian Commission its request. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1982 the Government empowered the Commissioner of Taxation, under the Income Tax Assessment Act (No. 2), to pass tax information to the Costigan and Stewart royal commissions and to any other Federal royal commission that the Governor-General declared should have access in its terms of reference. In 1982 the law was changed to provide full access to a royal commission for the purpose of conducting its inquiry. That was the clear, legislatively stated policy position of the Commonwealth for royal commissions. This policy was continued with the Fitzgerald inquiry. Yet the moves contained in this Bill fall significantly short of the provisions on tax file access given to the Fitzgerald inquiry into corruption in Queensland. Today the Opposition will aim to rectify this, and I foreshadow an amendment, which will be moved in the committee stage of this debate, to effect this change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1987 the Commonwealth Attorney-General appointed a senior officer to assist the Fitzgerald inquiry's dealings with the Commonwealth after the Hawke Government speedily acted to ensure special legislation to give the inquiry access to Australian Taxation Office information. Note that I said, `speedily acted'. Note the fuss that has surrounded this particular Bill compared with the Fitzgerald inquiry. This has created enormous concern. Mr Tony Fitzgerald, QC, documented the arrangements in his 1989 report. The Fitzgerald legislation was specifically written for the broader requirements of a commission of inquiry rather than those of a law enforcement agency, to which section 3E of the Tax Administration Act relates and to which this Bill relates. Yet section 3E is the avenue this Government has suggested the Western Australian Royal Commission use to gain access to Tax Office information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to respond to the needs of the Queensland Fitzgerald inquiry, this Parliament enacted the Crimes Legislation Amendment Act 1987. This not only inserted the Fitzgerald legislation, section 16A, into the Income Tax Assessment Act but also amended a number of Commonwealth Acts to give statutory assistance to the Queensland inquiry across a range of Commonwealth agencies and departments. The legislation written for the Fitzgerald inquiry allowed the Queensland inquiry to communicate or pass on Tax Office information to a range of authorities for follow-up investigations or prosecutions. In several cases, a test required was whether it indicated a serious offence or related to a possible tax offence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, under section 3E, which is the vehicle being used for the Western Australian inquiry&mdash;I remind the Senate that section 3E was inserted in 1989&mdash;the Commissioner of Taxation may communicate confidential information only if he is satisfied that it is relevant to establishing a serious offence or a proceeds of crime order that may arise from any serious offence. Section 3E, unlike the Fitzgerald legislation, requires that a stringent test be applied by the Tax Office to requests for information, and the use of tax information, once obtained, is precisely limited. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, unlike the Fitzgerald legislation, section 3E of the Taxation Administration Act, as opposed to the Income Tax Assessment Act section 16(k), does not specify the right to divulge Tax Office information before public or private hearings of an inquiry. Section 3E does not specify that the Tax Office information can be communicated to the Governor, which is the equivalent of a written report to Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the powers to both inquiries are analysed, it is very apparent that there is a great disparity between the two. One would have expected to find certain even-handedness, but this is not the case. The Bill we have before us this morning does not give the Western Australian Royal Commission the same freedom to pursue the complex money trails under which corruption is hidden as was available in Queensland to Fitzgerald. The Government has inferred that if the same power is given to the Western Australian commissioner, and other royal commissions, a broad fishing licence approach would be undertaken. The `fishing approach' metaphor refers to the Government's own words. I do not think the coalition would use such an insult to this Royal Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Senate that royal commissions are limited by their terms of reference. The essence of a royal commission is that it should inquire more widely than the police. Where financial scandal is involved charges are unlikely unless the investigators can follow the money trail. The need to re-establish trust in the institutions of government is paramount when questions of public propriety, such as the Western Australian situation, are involved. The public needs to be reassured that investigators of such scandals are willing and able to pursue the trail wherever that trail might lead. Denying such full access would not give the public the assurance that I believe they require. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, what I regard as the `fishing' expedition insult is not only directed to this Royal Commission but to the previous Stewart Royal Commission, the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union and the Fitzgerald inquiry, all of which have been provided with far greater powers. To claim that the provision of information and the extension of power of access to the Western Australian commission would somehow be a breach of privacy and that the commission was not following its terms of reference is an insult to the commissioners of the Western Australian Royal Commission, including Sir Roland Wilson, a former High Court judge and a person whose integrity and authority should really not be questioned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the first occasion on which the access powers of a royal commission have been limited. The wording of section 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act was inserted in 1982 and, by its reference to other royal commissions, clearly indicates that it is an intention that such bodies should have access for the purpose of their inquiries. The subsequent insertion of a limited access arrangement, that is, section 3 of the Taxation Administration Act, simply reinforces our argument. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I point out that my argument today for the extension of access powers is not at odds with our previous calls in  chamber for the maintenance of confidentiality of an individual's tax information. I firmly hold to the view that the confidentiality of tax files should not lightly be breached. However, the cause of justice occasionally demands a qualification of such liberties, and the Western Australian commission certainly seems to constitute such an extension. Further, granting access to royal commissioners is not to be compared with releasing tax files publicly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why has the Western Australian Royal Commission not received the same status as the Fitzgerald inquiry? The only reason and sense that the coalition can make out of the situation is that this Bill before us is merely a tactical backdown on the most inadequate position of refusing access to tax files, which had been taken by this Government previously. This has been stated in the lower House during the debate on this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only conclusion one can really draw from this fairly analytical review of the facts is that the whole exercise has been tainted by a certain degree of political bias. For example, when it came to the Fitzgerald inquiry in Queensland, the Government was prepared to open its doors to information with respect to tax files so that the Royal Commission could comprehensively follow its terms of reference and, in particular, follow the money trails which are so often characteristic of inquiries into corruption. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect to the situation in Western Australia, the reality is that the request was the same, yet it was denied. Having looked at all the arguments for refusing access, one can only conclude a degree of political bias, which is regrettable. Since Mr Templeman, counsel assisting the Royal Commission in Western Australia, made public his comments concerning the Government's refusal to provide access, discussions have occurred between this Government and officers of the Royal Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consequently, the commission, through its solicitor, has provided a letter to the Government, which has accepted the amendments that are now before us. The coalition, however, has no information upon which to judge the manner in which the Royal Commission has formed this view. The only information on the public record is that the Royal Commission specifically asked for access on the same basis as was provided to the Fitzgerald inquiry; but this has been denied it. So we have a limited form of access through this legislation here today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only explanation the coalition has arrived at in respect of the Western Australian commission's attitude, following a comprehensive review of the evidence, is that it has a fair amount of material on which a case could be based that a serious offence has been committed. In that event, the Commission has probably acquired as much as it currently needs to proceed further in its reference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we have before us a very complex Bill&mdash;far more complex than that which is really required. However, the Royal Commission in Western Australia does appear to be happy. The Bill picks up the prescribed royal commission standards for both the Commonwealth and the State. However, the Opposition is concerned that there is not the same degree of access. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition is also concerned that there is some confusion or some overlap between section 16(k) of the Income Tax Assessment Act which seeks to deal with these issues and the extension of section 3E. During the committee stage, we would like the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan) to give some explanation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the Opposition, while not opposing the Bill, will be introducing in the committee stage a number of amendments so that access will be the same as provided to the Fitzgerald inquiry. This, we believe, will correct the definite Government political bias and present a much fairer and better Bill. With those qualifications, we support the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Watson indicated, the history which leads us to this piece of legislation, the Taxation Administration Amendment Bill, is indeed a very sorry one. We had in the case of the Fitzgerald inquiry a government which was very keen to provide access to relevant tax information. I understand that in that situation the legislation passed through the Parliament in as little as three days and that access was provided, as Senator Watson indicated, under the Income Tax Assessment Act, section 16, and was made specific to the Fitzgerald Royal Commission.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When, however, the Royal Commission into Commercial Activities of Government and Other Matters in Western Australia sought access to the relevant tax information, that access was denied on several occasions. That, in our view, clearly indicates that there was a political bias built into that decision. It was a decision made by the then Treasurer; it was not in any way made by the Taxation Commissioner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When, later, the former Treasurer, now the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), sought to hide behind the decision of the Taxation Commissioner we found that to be completely despicable. The Taxation Commissioner was clearly giving a decision that he had to give in the light of the legislation that must guide him. He was acting in full accord with that legislation. I believe it was with great impropriety that the Prime Minister sought to hide behind the Commissioner of Taxation in relation to the denial of access to the Western Australian Royal Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, I think the Prime Minister was most blameworthy when in his celebrated press conference he described the access that the Western Australian Royal Commission would get as tearing the lid off the Taxation Office in the way one might tear open the lid of a can. That led me last week to ask a question of Senator Button, which honourable senators will remember, to which Senator Button replied that only 110 records were released to the Fitzgerald inquiry as a consequence of the section 16 amendment to the Income Tax Assessment Act. That is hardly tearing the lid off the privacy provisions that are correctly built into the secrecy that surrounds tax information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The section 16 amendment which was provided to Fitzgerald was itself guarded by the discretionary power of the Commissioner of Taxation. It was not open slather at all. The Fitzgerald commission had to apply for the records&mdash;I understand that a small group was set up within the Taxation Office to assess the request&mdash;and only when sufficient grounds were established were records released. We now have firmly on the record that only 110 records out of many millions in Australia were released to the Fitzgerald inquiry. However, when the Western Australian Royal Commission sought similar access in about May last year it was denied by the Prime Minister, who was then the Treasurer, and later in the year when access was sought again it was also denied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now have before us a belated amendment to the Taxation Administration Act which, as Senator Watson has pointed out, seeks to provide access that is different from the access given to Fitzgerald but similar to the access that is given to law enforcement agencies. While we have expressed great concern that a difference should be drawn between the two inquiries, we nonetheless have a letter on file from the solicitor to the Royal Commission, Mr D.F.

It is for that reason that we are supporting this change in the legislation, but we will not be supporting the amendments proposed by the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is, however, another matter which arises out of this whole sorry history: the fact that the Western Australian Royal Commission had been denied access only came to light extremely late in the day. It came to light only in the closing stages of the Commission when Mr Templeman said that the Western Australian Commission had been inhibited in its ability to pursue certain matters because of lack of access to tax information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we are seeking to insert an amendment into this amending legislation which will ensure that when a royal commission applies for access to tax information, under this new amendment a decision must be given. Furthermore, that decision must be made public. It must be revealed that a request has been made for release of that information, and that the Government has given a determination&mdash;whether it is in favour of release or against release.

First of all, I refer to DFAT document No. 13. The language of paragraph 5 of this particular cable may on its face suggest that there was some reluctance on the part of the Australian Government to put in place an extradition agreement with the Republic of the Marshall Islands Government. I have been advised by the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) that this was in no sense the case. I seek leave at this point to incorporate in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> a full response from him to that effect.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The document referred to must be seen in its context as one step in a chain of events. The process of reaching agreement on a basis for extradition between Australia and the Marshall Islands had been continuing since the extradition without treaty to Australia of a person from the Marshall Islands in September 1989. In August 1991 the Australian post at Pohnpei had been asked to put formally to the Marshall Islands a proposal for Australian legislation to be applied to the Marshalls so that extradition could take place pursuant to the standard terms and conditions in the Australian Act. As at 10 April 1992 no reply had been received to that proposal. The purpose of the cable on 15 April 1992 was to ascertain whether the proposal had in fact been formally put to the Marshalls and what reply, if any, had been received.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am informed by my Department that the reason for the cable was the raising by the Marshall Islands Attorney-General by telephone on 10 April 1992 of the possibility of an extradition request in the near future from the Marshall Islands for extradition from Australia. In that conversation, the status of the Australian proposal to establish a basis for extradition was not raised because, on the Australian side, it seemed necessary to find out what had happened through the formal channel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am informed by my Department that there were two reasons for asking our post at Pohnpei not to put the proposed extradition arrangement to the Marshalls if that had not been done already. The first reason was that it might have been desirable to explain the Australian legal requirements in more detail if the Marshalls authorities were under the wrong impression that Australia had already taken the necessary action to put itself in a position to extradite to the Marshalls. The second reason was so that consideration could be given to submitting the question of application of the Act to the Marshalls to the Australian Attorney-General for his decision on how the application of the Act should be handled if it was to take place with a particular extradition in prospect i.e. for the apparent purpose of facilitating a particular extradition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the result, the cautious approach adopted in the cable proved to have been unnecessary.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating the Taxation Administration Amendment Bill, which is a rather belated, after the hour move from the Government and which has only been brought about by pressure from the Western Australian Royal Commission and the public generally&mdash;and of course the Opposition. Unless this Bill is amended to give to the Western Australian Royal Commission into Commercial Activities of Government the same access to taxation information as was given to the Fitzgerald inquiry by legislation in 1987, it will serve as nothing more than an exercise in double standards and a clear rebuff to the resolution of the Legislative Assembly in Western Australia, as tabled in the Senate last week.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I made some comments at that stage about the resolution moved by the Western Australian Legislative Assembly, and the fact that it too wished the Government to give exactly the same rights, the same access, to the Western Australian Royal Commission as was given to the Fitzgerald inquiry. What this resolution calls for&mdash;no more and no less&mdash;is a repeat of the action taken in December 1987, when the Crimes Legislation Amendment Bill amended both the Income Tax Assessment Act and the Taxation Administration Act, to enable access to taxation information on the same basis as applies to Commonwealth royal commissions, that precedent having been set in 1982. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The then Attorney-General stated on 8 December 1987 that there was genuine public interest in the provision of Commonwealth assistance to the Fitzgerald Commission. We can only ask why this same public interest does not apply in regard to Western Australia, when the Bill allows only the more limited access provided to law enforcement agencies under section 3E of this Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, what we really have to look at&mdash;I do not believe that this is being cynical in any way, shape or form&mdash;is that, when it came to the Government looking after its mate in the Western Australian inquiry, the door was firmly shut, slammed clean in the Commissioner's face. When it came to getting stuck into the National Party in Queensland, the present Prime Minister&mdash;who was the Treasurer at that stage&mdash;was quite happy, probably deliriously happy, to give the Fitzgerald inquiry all the access that  it needed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a great shame that the Democrats today, in the amendments that they plan to move, are now toeing the Government line. I have to say, as a Western Australian, that I was relieved to hear Senator Coulter, at the time when this was raised, say that he was wishing the same access to be given to the Western Australian Commission as was given to the Fitzgerald inquiry. I would hope that Senator Coulter today would see the difference between the Democrat amendments and those which we are moving. Those which we are moving are directly in line with the access which was given to Fitzgerald. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government well understands that a royal commission, by its very nature, has a far wider purpose than the investigation of a serious offence. The Prime Minister certainly knew this when, on 14 May, he poured scorn on the Commission for engaging in a fishing expedition. He made a personal attack on leading counsel assisting the Commission, describing his submission as offensive and self-serving. At the same time, he advanced the spurious excuse that the 1989 legislative changes would have allowed police attached to the Commission to seek information from the Tax Commissioner. Quite clearly, those police were not available for the same type of investigation. If the police attached to the Commission had sought and received that type of information, they would have been running the risk of being slammed in gaol. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has not been any fishing expedition whatsoever. It is a bit like Senator Evans&mdash;and the Prime Minister&mdash;talking the other day about the Opposition going on a fishing expedition in relation to the Marshall Islands. You, Mr Acting Deputy President, as a Tasmanian, may have seen a cartoon which I think really summed that one up well. One section of it showed the Prime Minister saying how disgraceful it was that the Opposition was going on a fishing expedition about the Marshall Islands affair; the next section of the cartoon showed Dr Hewson with a great big fishbowl, with Senator Richardson swimming around in it. Quite clearly it was no fishing expedition: the results were there. There was the fish in the bowl. We now know that the fish has got a hook firmly caught in its mouth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So this exercise is not a fishing expedition. It is a very serious matter. The people of Western Australia are deeply concerned about the ramifications of the Royal Commission into government activities, and with the passage of every day they are becoming more and more concerned as they see key players in it having more and more evidence stacked up against them. But, as Senator Coulter mentioned a little while ago, the Royal Commission has a great problem in tracking the money trail, because the money trail has mysteriously wandered overseas. Therefore it is imperative that we come back to the point of why the Government would do one thing for one royal commission which was attached to the National Party, and do completely the opposite for another royal commission which is just as significant but which is associated with the Labor Party. As I said before, the police attached to the Royal Commission did not include the Commissioner and therefore did not have the seniority to request or, indeed, pass on such information. Once they work with the Royal Commission, the four police officers become royal commission investigators and have absolutely no entitlement to seek taxation records under the Taxation Administration Act. Ignoring this fact, the Prime Minister sought to erode the public standing of the Commission by alleging that these officers were feuding with the Commission's staff and accused the Commission of provoking political controversy for having the temerity finally to make public a major impediment to its investigations nearly 12 months after he had, as Treasurer, denied their request. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister backtracked on 15 May by at least conceding that this legislation would be coming into the Parliament; but there has, of course, been no apology for the very deliberate political attack on the distinguished Australians who are conducting an inquiry that is causing well-deserved embarrassment to the Labor Government. I might add that I do not believe this lack of apology is any accident, because neither can this inadequate Bill gloss over the fact that on three occasions over the last year this Labor Government has refused the Commission the access that it sought. The Government has, indeed, been very consistent in its clear, underlying objective of protecting Labor mates by stonewalling, by misrepresenting the provisions of section 3E, by attacking the credibility of the Commission and, finally, by disregarding the express wish of the Parliament of Western Australia through a piece of inadequate legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is for those reasons that we will be moving in the Committee of the Whole a very different set of amendments to those which the Democrats are moving. I certainly hope that the strong line that Senator Coulter took at the time of the exposure of this is conveyed in the vote of the Democrats today, because I do not believe that we can now set a further precedent whereby we water down access to any royal commission when the precedent has already been set by Fitzgerald. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it would be dangerous to start going down that track, because we really need to make sure that the Western Australian Royal Commission has every access possible to be able to make sure that justice is not only done but is seen to be done. I repeat: it is certainly of great concern to Western Australians that the refusal took place in the first instance; but then, of course, it took place with subsequent requests. I believe that a request to Mr Kerin, in the brief time that he was Treasurer, was not even acknowledged. Therefore I think it is very important, and we will be moving these amendments in the Committee of the Whole. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are, of course, debating the Taxation Administration Amendment Bill 1992. I will be brief, because I understand that there is a sense of urgency about this matter and the quicker the Bill can get through the better. That in itself has a nice touch of irony about it, because the Government has taken since May 1991 to do anything about this legislation, but I heard Senator Coulter say it took only three days in the case of the Fitzgerald inquiry for there to be a response from the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One might speculate as to why we are debating this Bill and not a further amendment to section 16A of the Income Tax Assessment Act, which would simply mean adding the Western Australian Royal Commission into that section. That would have the effect of providing the Western Australian Royal Commission with the same powers that were made available to the Fitzgerald inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The distinction between this legislation and the Fitzgerald inquiry legislation is startlingly obvious. In respect of this matter, there is a stringent test at the discretion of the Commissioner placed on the availability of information, because section 3E says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Notwithstanding any taxation secrecy provision, the Commissioner may disclose information acquired by the Commissioner under the provisions of a tax law to an authorised law enforcement agency officer if the Commissioner is satisfied that the information is relevant to:</PARA>

<PARA>In the case of section 16A, Fitzgerald was virtually given carte blanche. He was given open access to information. As Senator Coulter said, he made 110 requests. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Coulter" NAMEID="TF4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TF4">Senator Coulter</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There were 110 released.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XF4">Senator CRICHTON-BROWNE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, 110 were released. One can assume that under the criteria there would have been 110 applications, but one cannot be certain about that. I take it that these commissioners employ great diligence and take great responsibility in seeking information of this nature, sensitive as they are to the information to which they are gaining access. One can only assume that the Western Australian Royal Commission, given the difference of references, would be requiring considerably less information than the Fitzgerald inquiry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the distinction between the Fitzgerald Royal Commission and the Western Australian Royal Commission? There are two distinctions, and not too subtle ones at that. One is an inquiry into corruption in a police force, and the other one is an inquiry into corruption in a government. The other distinction is that one was an inquiry into activities that may have been relevant to a conservative government, and the other one is an inquiry into the conduct of a Labor government. That is the distinction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further difference is that we got this piece of legislation with the amendments to section 3E for Western Australia and section 16A in the case of the Queensland Royal Commission. On that occasion, there was a great deal of cooperation. In fact, there was unbridled enthusiasm on the part of the Government in accommodating the requests of Fitzgerald. The truth of the matter is there was political mileage in it and political gain in it. If the same access were provided in Western Australia, one can assume there would be political damage, and therefore we have got political decisions. This inquiry in Western Australia is not about corruption of a law enforcement agency, it is about the potential corruption and impropriety of a government of the day. That information is not available, yet we are told by counsel from the Commission that they are now satisfied with these amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find that curious, although there is no doubt a very simple explanation. I find it curious because the initial request&mdash;and I am sure it was not an ambit bid, because I trust these commissions to make responsible requests&mdash;was for powers similar to those of the Fitzgerald inquiry. One can only take it that, after an enormous amount of work and endeavour, the Royal Commission has been able to define and refine its levels and directions of inquiries and that they can now satisfy the commissioner within the terms of section 3E. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have grave reservations, and I always do, about widening the ambit of those that can have access to taxation information or any other information which goes to the heart of privacy or that impinges, or has the potential to impose, upon the right to secrecy and the right of access to people's personal and private information. One of the fundamental cornerstones of the taxation Act is that people believe that access is not available and, therefore, they are likely to be frank in their disclosures. In any democracy the giving of information, notwithstanding the penalties, will very much depend upon the levels of people's integrity and honesty. If people feel that there is unfettered access to that information, it will no doubt in some respects inhibit the level of compliance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not stand here as somebody who calls for open access, but I am here debating that there ought in this case to be equal access. I might well have disagreed with Fitzgerald's request. In the political environment and the political climate prevailing at the time, if any Liberal or National Party senators had got up and opposed the legislation, they would have been painted as corrupt and as supporting corruption. They would have been painted as frustrating and inhibiting proper inquiry into the conduct of the law enforcement agencies of Queensland. Such was the political climate created by members of the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is always difficult in these circumstances to have rational and reasonable debates. Yet we now have the circumstance where, without concern or regard, the Labor Party is prepared to be seen to be inhibiting the proper inquiries set up to investigate potential corruption in the Government of Western Australia. That inquiry was set up in the face of violent and</PARA>
<PARA>bitter opposition by the Labor Party and the Labor Government of Western Australia. I have myself heard in recent weeks the current Labor Minister for Police violently opposing the Western Australian Royal Commission. It was not set up by the Liberal Party as some political act or for some political advantage; it was ultimately set up by a Labor government because of the enormous pressure from society, the enormous pressure from the community, demanding a certain standard of accountability of the Government. Already it is apparent that members of a previous Labor government were tainted to some degree. If the public cannot have confidence in the functioning, the systems, the management and the manner of government, the very system of democracy is threatened. Of course, that is why in Australia we have open government to the extent that we do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is of no credit to this Government that it draws distinction, by way of this legislation, between the Commission of Inquiry in Queensland and the Royal Commission in Western Australia. I can only suspect that it is something to do with `mateship', that Australian colloquialism that Neville Wran said had been tainted and tarnished by the Liberal Government and by the Liberal Party when they pursued previous matters. This is not about Anzac mateship. This is about special favours and special protection, and special treatment of special people, known in the Labor Party as mates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this Government wanted to be seen to be fair, to be equal, to be balanced, to be doing the right thing, it would have been introducing legislation today identical with that for Fitzgerald. This sort of information is, as Senator Coulter said, more germane, more relevant to the Western Australian inquiry than it was to the Queensland inquiry. That was about corruption of police officers. This is about the potential of senior members of a government to accept bribes. Ultimately, as the National Crime Authority now accepts and understands, the very best way of establishing whether or not a crime has been committed is to follow the paper trail, to follow the money. Crimes of this nature are committed for reward, and the reward itself manifests itself in a financial benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A corrupt politician is not going to go down the street and open a bank account under the name of Johnny Smith. The money invariably will go offshore. With electronic transfers and private jets these days, it is not difficult to get money offshore, but it is difficult to trace it and so access is necessary. That means, regrettably, access to taxation files. Prima facie evidence of corruption may well be sudden and unnatural wealth held by a decision maker, which seems to be contrary to his known forms of income. For that reason access is required. We find that the Treasurer of the day&mdash;the present Prime Minister&mdash;said yes to Fitzgerald but no to the Royal Commission in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth of the matter is that we know about that only because, not for political reasons but in summing up, counsel for the Royal Commission noted that it had been inhibited and, as I recall, that it would be unable to make certain findings in respect of certain matters without access to certain information. That was a submission put by counsel assisting the commissioners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When that information was made public, but 12 months after the request was declined, the Government felt under some pressure. Notwithstanding that pressure, the Prime Minister of the day took the unusual step of calling a press conference, to pour a bucket over the Royal Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We would all remember the incremental steps that Tony Fitzgerald took when he expanded his terms of reference, where for the very first time access to Cabinet documents was made available. Not once did Mr Keating call a press conference to criticise Tony Fitzgerald. He was applauded for expanding his terms of reference. In this case, the Prime Minister of the day called a press conference to sledge and pour a bucket over a royal commission that was investigating the affairs and the conduct of his mates. He was not even politically sensitive enough to close his mouth and hope the matter would go away. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In spite of his attacks on the Royal Commission and its competence, ultimately public opinion prevailed and we have the legislation that we have today. I take some comfort from the Commission saying it will provide adequate information. I hope that it is adequate information. For my part, I would want no more access than adequate information for the Commission. I take it that, when it made its first bid in May 1991, it knew the level of access it required. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In case Senator Crichton-Browne thinks this is some stunning revelation he has come up with, I am not pretending that the catalyst was not the request from the Western Australian Royal Commission. What I am simply saying is that what we are doing is setting a framework into the future. Nobody knows into what those subsequent royal commissions may be inquiring: it may be the activities related to governments of any political persuasion. We cannot say in the future, `This is a Bill that is only going to be allowed to look at people of this persuasion or that'. Perhaps we could, but we do not. I am not quite sure how we would do it if we set out to; but, anyway, the Bill does not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the first thing to say. If we are going to do that, we have to look at the question not of what happened in the past but of what should happen in the future. The past may be a guide but it cannot be a master. What we need to do is to say, `Are we setting up an adequate framework?'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Notwithstanding that I disagreed with nearly all the later comments that Senator Crichton-Browne made, I thought he very validly highlighted his&mdash;and, I think, widely shared&mdash;reservations about any access to tax information. Once you raise that question, I think we all have to say, `My first reaction is no; persuade me why it should be otherwise'. I cannot speak for everybody but I think it is pretty well the shared view of everybody who has ever been associated with, or aspired to be part of government: firstly, because of the fundamental question about the right to privacy; secondly, and very closely related, because of the need to preserve the credibility of the tax system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once again, Senator Crichton-Browne said this in different terms, but made substantially the same point: the capacity of a tax system to operate in a free democratic society fundamentally depends upon voluntary compliance by individuals with the system. If there is massive failure to comply, either there are massive adverse social and economic consequences or there are significant civil liberties consequences in the steps that are needed to be taken to enforce the tax laws. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are very powerful arguments. They are very strong reservations. But, also, we all know that that cannot be absolute. It has never been absolute and we need, therefore, to strike a balance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the Parliament accepted in the past that the balance that is struck here was appropriate with regard to a wide range of law enforcement authorities. We are providing here the access powers that are available already to a wide range of bodies. The Royal Commission in Western Australia, to which particular attention has been given, and obviously it would be, is the one to which this measure will have immediate practical application, although until the legislation is amended it will have application to all royal commissions&mdash;and so it should. Obviously people will focus their attention on this one because that is where the legislation will have effect from the day the Parliament passes it, although it is a broader framework. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am prepared to accept that the people involved in the Royal Commission felt the need for this information to pursue the matters before them. I cannot judge whether they are right or wrong, but I am not surprised that they had that view. They have accepted this framework, which I think strikes the right balance for the long term. What we have to ask is, `In striking the right balance for the long term can we satisfy the reasonable requirements that are before us immediately?'. I think the Royal Commission itself has said yes. We should not be in any doubt about the capacity of the people involved to be forthright in saying that they disagree with us, if they do, because they have not been so reluctant at other stages in this debate to say that they disagreed with us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to say only two other things, one very briefly about royal commissions in general. I have made some long speeches here about royal commissions in general. I do not think the Western Australian Royal Commission existed at the time I made the speeches but they certainly were not in relation to it. They were actually in relation to a proposal to have a royal commission into banks, which I disagreed with then and I disagree with now. But that is not the point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have very severe reservations about Australia's enthusiasm for royal commissions. It is a two-edged sword politically. Over the long term, it does not advantage anybody. We all take hits from time to time. This is not an attempt either to make this argument in terms of political partisanship immediately or in the long term or to refer to a particular case. Too often we resort to the royal commission process when the proper democratic processes are the most appropriate way to resolve matters before us. That is not to say there is never a case for royal commissions. Some of them have been outstandingly valuable and some have done work that could not have been done otherwise. But I think there are far too many, at far too great a cost to the taxpayers, with far too little benefit. It is one of those soft option responses to difficult issues to say, `Let us have a royal commission into this and then the rest of us do not have to apply our minds to it; we will let some independent umpire resolve it'. I have severe reservations about that. </PARA>

<PARA>I will pick up the point Senator McMullan has just made because I do not think it can be allowed to pass without some comment. In that absolutely incredible press conference that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) held, he was indeed attempting to hide behind the Commissioner of Taxation. He said that the Taxation Commissioner had advised him that information could not be released and that, therefore, he was not releasing it. The fact of the matter was that in the application made by Fitzgerald he, with great alacrity, inserted a further section by amendment into the legislation so that Fitzgerald could get access. It was a political decision and it was inappropriate for him to use the advice he got from the Taxation Commissioner, which was absolutely correct. The Commissioner behaved impeccably. The Taxation Commissioner, of course, could not release the information because the amendment was specific to Fitzgerald. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Democrat amendment is quite a simple one, yet it is a very important one. The whole saga which led to this legislation arose because of the refusal by a succession of Labor Treasurers to change the law to allow access to taxation records for the Western Australian Royal Commission into the Activities of Government and Other Matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Parliament and the public heard about this matter only because of a remark in a submission by one of the barristers to the Royal Commission. The public furore developed when the Government's decision to cooperate fully with the Fitzgerald inquiry was compared with this hindrance to the Western Australian inquiry. Mr Keating then attempted to bluster his way through, basically by denigrating anyone who dared to question his decision. Finally, as we can see in this legislation, he saw the good sense; and we now have the legislation which is before us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment seeks to ensure that this sorry episode will not happen again. Accordingly, we are seeking to insert a new provision which will force any future government to notify the Parliament of any request by a royal commission or other board of inquiry to be prescribed as an eligible royal commission so as to allow access to taxation records. The request must be considered by the Minister and a decision made within 28 days. The Parliament must then be informed of the request, the decision made by the Minister and the reasons for the decision, either in favour of or against the granting of access. I emphasise that this amendment does not relate to any decisions on the access to particular taxation information, merely as to whether the particular inquiry is to be treated as a prescribed royal commission under the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to put on the record again that the Democrats do not think that Mr Boucher, the Taxation Commissioner, has acted other than properly in regard to this matter. The Prime Minister initially sought to blame the Commissioner for his refusal to grant access. The Commissioner acted properly in defending the secrecy of his files. It was the Treasurer who made the policy decision&mdash;this is the point&mdash;to not grant access. The policy decision in regard to the Fitzgerald inquiry was that of the Treasurer and would have been made irrespective of the advice of the Commissioner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats believe that this amendment satisfies the principle that the Government should be accountable for its decisions. We are not seeking to make the decision formally reviewable by the Parliament. That would introduce a political element, yet again, into what should not be a political matter. The possibility of such a procedure was raised by Mr Willis on 5 May 1982 in relation to the Costigan Royal Commission. We do not think that would work well in practice. However, the public are entitled to know the reasons why access is or is not granted. I would like to foreshadow the Opposition's amendment very briefly. In the second reading stage the Opposition pointed out that I had made statements in relation to access by the Western Australian inquiry. I will quote a few words in connection with this from a press release which I issued on 15 May:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The WA Commission is at present satisfied with the Government decision to amend section 3E of the Taxation Administration Act. Our concern is simply to assist the Commission in carrying out its terms of reference.</PARA>
<PARA>I accept what Senator McMullan has just said: that this is a prospective piece of legislation, so it lays down appropriate conditions for future royal commissions and commissions of inquiry. To continue with the press release:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the Commission is happy then we are satisfied.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the Commission is not happy with the final amendments, then we will introduce a Fitzgerald style amendment in the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Democrats have consistently stated that the WA commission should be treated in exactly the same way as the Fitzgerald royal commission, given the serious nature of the matters under investigation.</PARA>
<PARA>Honourable senators will remember that at this time I was even suggesting that if it was necessary to recall the Senate to get this access through we would be prepared to do that, if it had the agreement of the Opposition. It looked as though the Western Australian Commission, at that time, would not be able to get the access in time to take that information into account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the amendments were first foreshadowed by the Prime Minister, the section 3E amendments which are now before us, I recall&mdash;and I point this out to the Opposition&mdash;that Mr Fischer, the Leader of the National Party, said that he was completely satisfied with the 3E amendments. I think it was the same day that Mr Reith, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, said that he was not satisfied. So there was some confusion in the Opposition ranks as to whether they were or were not satisfied. All along our position has been that if the Commission was satisfied, we would be satisfied; if it was not, we would seek to move the sorts of amendments that the Opposition is seeking to move. I commend the Democrats amendments to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Veterans' Entitlements (Provision of Treatment) Amendment Bill 1991 and the Repatriation Institutions (Staff) Bill 1991, together with the repatriation private patient principles, represent the legislative machinery associated with the transfer of repatriation general hospitals to the States.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys), in his second reading speech in the other place on the Veterans' Entitlements (Provision of Treatment) Amendment Bill, said that the Bill would `set in train the most significant changes to the administration of veterans' benefits in the history of repatriation in Australia'. In that he is absolutely correct. The importance of what is proposed by this legislation cannot be overstated. Implementation of these Bills will set in motion fundamental and irreversible change to a central and long-standing element of the repatriation system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The present veterans' health system has its origins in the aftermath of World War I. At that time the Repatriation Department assumed responsibility for providing medical treatment for discharged soldiers suffering service related disabilities. At the end of World War II the Department took over the much larger and more modern Army hospitals built during the war to meet immediate and postwar needs, and it was these institutions which became repatriation general hospitals. They have since been progressively modernised to the point where the mainland hospitals are all high quality teaching hospitals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation before us now proposes to facilitate the transfer of these hospitals from the Commonwealth to the States. Given that these Bills effectively provide for the single biggest change in the history of the repatriation system, there is a crucial need to ensure that the interests of veterans are properly protected. Also of paramount importance is the need to evaluate and assess this change on the basis of full and complete information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In considering the effect of this legislation on veterans, it is useful to take stock of the repatriation health system as it exists. Entitled veterans and war widows have unrestricted access to repatriation general hospitals. The number of entitled veterans and war widows in 1991 was 347,745. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Veterans in the metropolitan region of each State capital are required to attend the repatriation general hospital, unless approval is obtained from the Department to attend another public hospital or a private hospital. Non-metropolitan veterans can enter a public hospital without requiring prior approval. They may also enter a private hospital with which the Department has an arrangement without prior approval, as long as elective surgery is not the treatment required. Prior approval is not required for emergency admissions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the central issues in assessing how integration will impact on veterans is priority of access. The Government no longer refers to priority of access when talking about the repatriation general hospital system as it stands. The constant refrain we receive from the Government is that access to repatriation general hospitals is and always has been on the basis of medical need and that integration will not change this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not dispute that it will be the treating specialist, as it always should be, who will decide the clinical necessity and urgency of proposed treatment. What I do object to, however, is the Government's attempt to diminish and play down the priority of access currently accorded to veterans and war widows by virtue of a dedicated hospital system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Community patients do have access to repatriation general hospitals; but their access is restricted, not on the basis of medical need, but on how it effects treatment for veterans. Thus the Repatriation Commission's own treatment principles state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commission may provide treatment in a Repatriation Hospital for community patients if its capacity to provide treatment to entitled persons is not effected adversely.</PARA>
<PARA>The Commission may set limits on the levels of community patients admitted to its hospitals. And this is confirmed in the Department's 1990-91 annual report, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The number of beds available in Repatriation General Hospitals for treating community patients is restricted to ensure the ready availability of services to entitled veterans and war widows.</PARA>
<PARA>So, in a very clear sense, veterans and war widows can be said to have priority of access as the system currently stands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the absence of that dedicated hospital system, this will no longer be the case in the future. Following integration, veterans and war widows will, if this legislation is passed, be covered by the private patient principles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must put on record the deep misgivings which the coalition has with the Government continually referring to these principles as a private patient scheme. The Minister has often trumpeted the so-called private patient status which will be available to veterans and war widows, without emphasising enough the strict associated conditions. For example, veterans will not have the hospital of their choice as does a real private patient. In the first instance they will be required to attend a public hospital. The veteran or war widow will not get to a private hospital if he or she can get into a public hospital within `reasonable time'. Explicit and prior departmental approval will be required for entry into a private hospital. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Veterans and war widows will not necessarily have the doctor of their choice. The veteran's doctor would need to have visiting rights to the hospital attended by the veteran, whether public or private. Of course this is true of any private patient. However, in this instance it is the Repatriation Commission which decides whether a veteran can attend a private hospital, not the so-called private patient. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not real freedom of choice, where the choice of hospital, and therefore the choice of doctor, is restricted by the Repatriation Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another concern is with the timing of integration. The Minister would be well aware of a study commissioned by the Department of Veterans' Affairs on projected demand for in-patient care for entitled veterans and war widows. This study was completed by the Australian Institute of Health in August 1990.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The study suggests that from 1988-89 to the year 2005-06 there will be a decline with respect to in-patient separations of 30.27 per cent. It also projects that occupied bed days will decline by 13.09 per cent over the same period. But that is not the whole story. Crucially, the study found that the declines will not be constant over the projection period. Total in-patient separations will not peak until 1992-93 and even more dramatic is that occupied bed days are projected to continue to increase until 1995-96. That is, it can be said that veteran demand for hospital beds by veterans and war widows will not peak&mdash;just peak&mdash;until 1995-96. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason for the increased bed demand is that despite an overall decline in the entitled treatment population, average length of stay will increase from just over 8 1/2 days in 1988-89 to nearly 11 days in 2005-06. We are not talking about long term aged care here. These figures reflect the fact that, as veterans age, they will require longer periods of in-patient recuperation from any serious illness or operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Interestingly, the same study considered the impact of policy changes on its projections, since any changes will modify demand trends. One of these policy changes was to alter the proportion of veterans and war widows treated in the repatriation general hospitals. The study suggests that even if the Government were to transfer as many as 15 per cent of the repatriation general hospital population to non-departmental hospitals, this would result in only a marginal improvement of resource utilisation. It is in this context that the Minister and the Government have been relentlessly pursuing integration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given this, it would be useful for the Senate to be reminded of a promise made by the Minister, in the other place, on 10 November 1988:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The integration of the repatriation hospital systems will not take place until all of the concerns of the veterans' community are dealt with. That is an unequivocal guarantee that is given by this side of the House.</PARA>
<PARA>That was stated by the Minister, Mr Humphreys. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Until the decision of the RSL, taken only in April, that it would support integration in principle, the Minister must have regretted terribly his `unequivocal guarantee' because on all of the occasions when I have highlighted this notorious promise he has never once defended it. He has continually  run away from it, and therefore he has run away from the veterans' community. This is because he and his Government were in reality seeking to impose integration with or without veteran support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the recent change in attitude by the RSL was a case of recognising the Government's steamrollering campaign for what it is, coming to realise that come hell or high water the Government was going to transfer the hospitals. It realised that rather than making a futile fight against this, it should accept integration in principle and try to obtain the best deal it could on each of the transfers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Senate of another infamous promise made to veterans about the repatriation general hospitals. This time the promise was made by the previous Prime Minister to an audience of veterans at Repatriation General Hospital, Concord. Perhaps he just thought they were more `silly old buggers' and that he could tell them anything and get away with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 7 March 1990 he promised them:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">. . . no Repatriation General Hospital will be transferred to a State until a satisfactory agreement has been reached on matters such as priority of access and quality of health care for veterans and war widows, and unless the interests of hospital staff have been adequately safe-guarded; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">. . . no final decision will be taken if the RSL has reasonable cause for dissatisfaction with the proposed arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA>The former Prime Minister committed himself further when he said also:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">. . . there is nothing unequivocal about these guarantees and no secret agenda underlies the initiatives. I stand firmly behind these guarantees.</PARA>
<PARA>It can be imagined just how hollow those words now ring in the ears of veterans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The crucial element of this promise was that no final decision would be taken as long as the RSL had reasonable cause for dissatisfaction with the proposed arrangements. That promise was never kept. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Negotiations between the Commonwealth and Tasmanian State governments were signed well before the decision of the National Congress of the RSL in April. Negotiations on the transfer of Concord were also virtually completed before April. The long, brawling and costly campaign that the Government is engaged in with the veteran community on the issue of integration, and the many Government promises that have been broken along the way, will not be readily forgotten by the veteran community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When these Bills were introduced into the Parliament last November, the coalition indicated that it would be opposing the legislation. Our decision was based on two factors. First, the Government had failed to keep its promise that integration would not occur unless the ex-service community was satisfied. The second factor was the total unwillingness of the Government to provide to the Opposition, or to the ex-service community, details associated with the transfer of the hospitals. The coalition has consistently argued that integration should not occur without the support of the veteran community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier in my speech I alluded to the need also for a sound information base on which to make decisions on the issue of integration. Facing the prospect of defeat of its legislation in the Senate, the Government has, since November, been more forthcoming in providing information to the Opposition and the ex-service community on the details of the transfer in the States where it is imminent&mdash;namely, New South Wales and Tasmania. For too long the Government was not even prepared to provide the Opposition with details of what the relationship of the repatriation general hospitals would be with the ex-service community in each of these States following integration. This included information such as whether Concord, for instance, would remain a teaching hospital or, at Hobart, what palliative care arrangements had been agreed to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was not until April that the Government publicly released summaries of the agreements for New South Wales and Tasmania. Accompanying the release of this sort of crucial information has been a change of attitude by the National Congress of the RSL. In April it decided not to oppose integration per se. Instead, it suggested that it should be up to the ex-service community in each State to undertake negotiations on the transfers. In the light of a changed government and ex-service community attitude, the coalition announced publicly last week that it would not oppose the legislation if, and only if, the legislation were strengthened to properly protect the interest of veterans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that the legislation fails to do two important things. First, it does not provide accurate monitoring of the impact of integration on veterans' health care. Yet it is adequate monitoring that will be crucial as integration proceeds. It will also be crucial that the Government be held accountable to the Parliament for any reports or recommendations that might arise from the monitoring process. The Minister in his second reading speech in the other place said that inclusion of the private patient principles in the legislation reflects `the Government's determination to ensure the Parliament as a whole remains committed to the health care of entitled veterans and war widows'. Unless adequate monitoring provisions are in place, this will not be enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has indicated that a peak national monitoring committee, known as the Repatriation Commission's National Treatment Monitoring Committee, will monitor veteran access to health services, and the range of these services, after integration. On this committee will be a member of the Repatriation Commission, the Department's national health program director and six veteran community representatives. State monitoring committees are also to be established along broadly similar lines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems that the national committee will be able to consider reports from State treatment monitoring committees, as well as reports from DVA and State health departments on aspects of the private patient scheme. This all sounds very promising, but the crucial question is: what standing will the national committee have? What authority will be accorded to it? Will it be anything more than a token gesture on the part of the Government in a cynical attempt to placate the veteran community?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the proposal stood, the monitoring committee would report only to the Repatriation Commission. The Opposition regards it as being very important for these reports to be presented to the Parliament. In this way the reports of the Committee and the effects of integration on the veteran community would be subject to ongoing parliamentary scrutiny and could never be buried in the Repatriation Commission. It would go some way towards making the Minister, his Department and the Commission more accountable to the Parliament on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my press release of 27 May this year I called on the Government to address this concern by amending its legislation to ensure that the reports of the National Monitoring Committee were tabled in the Parliament. I wrote a letter to the Minister the same day, setting out the Opposition position. I seek leave to incorporate my letter in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Minister,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I write in relation to legislation currently before the Parliament concerning the transfer of Repatriation General Hospitals to the States.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As you know the Coalition in November of last year announced that it would be opposing the Veterans' Entitlements (Provision of Treatment) Amendment Bill 1991 and the Repatriation Institutions (Staff) Bill 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We were concerned that the Government was proceeding with integration in breach of promises made by you, and the former Prime Minister, The Honourable R J L Hawke, not to do so until the reasonable concerns of the RSL had been met. We were also concerned at your unwillingness to provide information to the Opposition and the ex-service community on the details of the agreements being struck between the Commonwealth and the States. A final concern was the adequacy of the legislation in ensuring accountability of Government to the ex-service community and the Parliament once the legislation had passed the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since last November there have of course been important developments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">More detailed information has been provided on the nature of the agreements with New South Wales and Tasmania, and the National Congress of the Returned &amp; Services League of Australia has resolved to accept integration in principle.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In light of these developments the Coalition has decided that it will not oppose the legislation provided two outstanding concerns can be addressed by amendments to the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first concern is the blanket nature of the legislation. In recognition of the different issues to be resolved in different States, and in order to ensure greater Government accountability in negotiations with the ex-service community in each State, the Coalition believes the intention to transfer a hospital should be the subject of a disallowable instrument.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I had Opposition amendments drafted which could meet this end if the Government refused to accept this responsibility and I sent those to the Government for its consideration. I am glad to say that the Government has now amended its repatriation private patient principles to ensure that the Committee must report to the Repatriation Commission at least annually and that, its having passed this report to the Minister, the Minister must table the report in Parliament within 15 sitting days. I welcome this change of heart and the recognition of the rightness of the coalition's position on this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other failure of the legislation relates to the lack of recognition that different issues and problems will need to be resolved in different States before the transfer of any particular hospital. In my press release and letter of 27 May I also called on the Government to amend its legislation so that the intention to transfer a particular hospital would be the subject of disallowance in the Federal Parliament. This would mean that the Parliament could prevent the transfer of a particular hospital if it considered that the concerns of veterans in a given State had not been properly addressed by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has, strangely, not been prepared to meet these quite reasonable expectations of the veterans' community, and so I have circulated amendments which the Opposition will be moving to ensure that no hospital can be transferred without the Minister first notifying the Parliament of his intention to do so, with the Parliament having the power to prevent the transfer, if it becomes necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These amendments recognise the different circumstances and concerns in different States. Importantly, they would make the Government accountable for negotiations which must take place on a State by State basis with the veteran community before the transfer of any hospital. I have discussed these amendments with members of the ex-service community and they have expressed their support for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A draft copy of the amendments was also sent to the Australian Democrats for their consideration. They have now circulated their own set of amendments. They are different from those of the Opposition in two important respects. Firstly, they effectively exclude the transfer of Repatriation General Hospital, Concord, and Repatriation General Hospital, Hobart, from parliamentary scrutiny. They cover only the other four general hospitals and the auxiliary hospitals. The transfers of Repatriation General Hospital, Concord, and of Hobart will not be subject to disallowance. They still have details outstanding in their negotiations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the amendments effectively contain a sunset clause in that they have effect only until 1 January 1995. This means that if any repatriation general hospital were still not transferred at 1 January 1995, the Minister would not have to inform the Parliament of his intention to do so after that date. He could transfer Daw Park, for example, or Hollywood, despite the objections of the South Australian and Western Australian veterans, or the Parliament. This effectively removes parliamentary scrutiny of the decision to integrate any repatriation hospitals which are not transferred by January 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government will tell us that all hospitals will be transferred by then, so the clause does not really matter. However, how can we say in 1992 that there will not be hospitals yet to be transferred by 1995? The Government's timetable on this has been sadly out all along. I can well imagine situations where negotiations could break down and the Government could simply wait until January 1995 and do what it liked. I find it strange that the Democrats are proposing such a clause, especially when their spokesman, throughout the months this legislation has been before the Parliament, claimed that their one and only concern was the protection of veterans and their health care. I know that the veteran community would certainly be disturbed by the effects of that clause. Perhaps we could be kind and suggest that the Democrats got their amendments from the Government's draftsman and did not fully realise the implications of that 1 January 1995 date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The inclusion of a sunset clause can suit only the Government's purpose, not the veterans'. I urge the Democrats to look very carefully at the lack of protection for veterans that they could directly cause if they proceed with that amendment. I urge them to remove the date from their amendment. If they are not prepared to do so, I shall be obliged to move an amendment to their amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I repeat that throughout this whole sorry saga of the Government's imposing its will on the veteran community, the coalition has consistently sought to ensure that the legitimate concerns of veterans were addressed. The veterans have now grudgingly accepted integration in principle and have indicated that they are prepared to accept the passage of this legislation. We have forced the Government to agree to modify its own legislation so that, as integration occurs, there is a close assessment of its effect on veterans' health care and that the Parliament is informed of this assessment. But due to intransigence on the Government's part, the Opposition will be seeking to move amendments ensuring that no repatriation hospital, not only the RGHs, can be transferred without parliamentary approval in the form of a disallowable instrument. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This whole exercise has once again highlighted why the veteran community has become so disillusioned with the Labor Government over the last nine years. Its promises have only been made to be broken. There is no getting away from the fact that the veterans do not trust this Government. The long, high-pressure, costly and dishonest campaign by the Government to hand over the repatriation hospitals to the States is but the latest in a long and sorry saga of Labor's treatment of our veterans. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A year ago I attended a dinner of the Australian Society for Medical Research, which was addressed by Professor John Coghlan, the Director of the Florey Institute in Melbourne, one of Australia's leading groups in medical research. It was interesting that the highlight of the speech that he gave was that there would be more scientific developments in the next 20 years than had occurred in history. I was a bit taken aback by this and I went over to him afterwards and said, `That was an extraordinary statement. How do you come to that conclusion?'. He took one look at me and at my grey hair, and said, `There have been more scientific advances in your lifetime than have occurred in history. All I am saying is that developments are occurring so quickly that it is halving in time'. He was talking about genetic engineering.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last night I attended the dinner of the Australian Society for Medical Research and the same theme came through: genetic engineering is going to be of greater importance to this country than practically anything else that has occurred in history. It is a subject that I think we are not completely aware of, yet I was pleased to see that Parliament itself had a committee inquiring into it. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology produced a report in February this year entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Genetic Manipulation: The Threat or the Glory?</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Genetic engineering does not just affect medical research; it affects a whole spectrum of development both in industry and in fibres and food and animal production of food. Gene manipulation is the subject of an ongoing and often acrimonious debate. There is certainly a need for wider discussion of the implications of this science. However, it is hard for me to understand the justification for the grant to the Australian Conservation Foundation to establish the `Australian genethics network'. It is difficult to see this generous donation of public funds meeting its stated objective, to efficiently promote and encourage and inform public discussion on genetic engineering. My judgment is that this grant-in-aid does not serve the very worthy aim of furthering informed public debate but is merely a further extension of this Government's practice of using public funds to promote the activities of politically sympathetic special interest groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, the ACF and its members have made some valuable contributions to environmental management. If they approached the issues of gene manipulation responsibly, they could play a valuable role in allowing some of the concerns and disquiet that are felt about some of the issues to be addressed by those who are proposing the work. But those in the ACF are hardly likely to provide the Australian public with impartial and accurate advice on gene manipulation ethics, because they are aggressive campaigners against all aspects of modern gene technology and they have no special knowledge or training about genetics, or about the ethics for that matter. Their genetic engineering campaign officer, Mr Phelps, in his zeal to pursue his role as a professional anti-genetics activist, has a record of making inaccurate and misleading statements on the topic. For example, he has repeatedly made the incorrect claim that genetic engineering has not contributed any benefits to society. Unbelievable!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Minister has so cleverly observed, the ACF will twist arms, bend knees, even kick ankles to get results. It has not, however, seemed to have considered whether or not it is ethical for the Government to pay a special interest group to inflict this damage on other sectors of society or whether twisting arms or kicking ankles is conducive to helping the general public come to informed and wise decisions on such complex issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I contend that the Minister has made the very basic mistake of supporting a group that has a flawed policy on genetic engineering. The flaw is a simple one, obvious to any student of history: while they enthusiastically correct the injustices they readily perceive being perpetrated by the rest of society, they seem blind to the injustices of their own policies. In short, they are keen to see their own approach to social engineering being forced on all members of the community but seemingly place little value on the personal rights of the targets of their criticism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Their policy is to delay or stop genetic engineering and it disregards the needs of those who require genetically engineered medicines. They are disregarding the welfare of all those who may benefit from disease resistant crops and other improvements in agriculture. They are disregarding the intellectual and creative rights of scientists who want to contribute to society by their inventions and who, in the case of genetic engineering, have to spend many years of effort and millions, if not hundreds of millions, of dollars in going about these goals. They are denying the right of a reward for honest effort due to all those commercial concerns and public agencies, such as the research and development corporations, which are willing to put up huge amounts of risk capital for expensive biotechnology research. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ACF anti-genetic activists group, by actively campaigning to abolish all biotechnology patents, are disregarding the rights of the general public to purchase the results of this effort, since their misguided patent policy undermines the basis for obtaining risk capital for new products. This policy would cripple most biotechnology research, and indeed the pharmaceutical industry, if enacted. It displays a complete absence of realistic understanding of the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will just mention one specific example of the valued new products which consumers get because of patent protection and which were not produced in countries such as the former Soviet Union, where patent protection was weak. The example that I give is the genetically engineered anti-cancer treatment Neupogen, which the National Health and Medical Research Council has just approved for use in this country. According to ACF doublethink, this drug does not exist; even if it does exist, it represents a socially unjust abuse of human rights by a greedy transnational corporation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Bolkus, who is the responsible Minister, might care to reflect where, for example, CSIRO's gene shears invention would be without patent protection or corporate participation. My guess is that it would be probably largely unused and be bringing no return for all the Australian taxpayers' dollars that have been invested. Senator Bolkus saw no need to discuss his funding decision publicly, or to call for applications from alternative educational groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He has got a rich range of options. CSIRO is already mounting a colourful travelling road show on the topic and he could have avoided conflict with funding guidelines and simply let it get on with the job; or he could have chosen from well-informed, impartial or highly ethical and scholastically scrupulous groups&mdash;Ms Loane Skene of the Victorian Law Reform Commission, Professor Peter Singer of Monash University, or other ethics specialists, a religious group, perhaps. It seems to me that the Minister must have had other things on his mind than the interests of the general Australian taxpayer when coming to his extraordinary decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I looked through the April <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gene Report</EMPHASIS> newsletter produced by the ACF with Senator Bolkus's gift of public funds, I realised that my concerns about his decision were fully justified. I could find no mention at all of any positive aspects of the science: no mention of new vaccines for diseases in the Third World&mdash;anti-hepatitis vaccines, anti-cholera, anti-diarrhoeal, anti-malarial vaccines; no mention of benefits for agriculture, such as the bollworm resistant cotton and the virus resistant wheat that our own CSIRO has recently developed, or disease resistant potatoes and tomatoes, or of any new efforts to develop disease resistant yams, cassava and sweet potatoes, for farmers in non-industrialised countries; no mention of the crucial importance and wide-ranging application of genetic engineering in almost all branches of biological science; in fact, absolutely no evidence of a balanced viewpoint from which the average man and woman in the street might gain helpful insights.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The title of the column establishes the tone and intent of the newsletter: <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Troubled Helix</EMPHASIS>.

It talks about a hypothetical group of scientists, not identified by name or affiliation, who supposedly want to work outside the regulatory guidelines.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the Minister would like to try repeating that statement to the great bulk of CSIRO, university or medical researchers who do not work for industry, especially those who are being pushed to get money from industry even for their own salaries. </PARA>

The fact that this new product replaces the killing of calves to obtain enzyme is not deemed worthy of being mentioned. These red herrings divert effort from resolution of some of the more serious and thorny ethical issues that could have been canvassed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to end by drawing the chamber's attention to recent events in Europe, particularly in Germany, Denmark and Switzerland.

Green activists are, by their own admission, being deliberately obstructionist in using the legal system to hold up patents and prevent building of factories. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"What if pigs can fly?" is a very clever choice of a theme by the CSIRO's travelling exhibit on genetic engineering. Some groups in our clever country are expending a lot of energy and money getting concerned about the damage that will be caused by flying pigs. My viewpoint is that far more common-sense, and certainly some old-fashioned wisdom is needed. We should concentrate on bringing home the bacon.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The main group involved in keeping a focus on hypothetical hazards of genetic engineering alive as a public debate is the Australian Conservation Foundation led by ACF Genetic Engineering Campaign officer Bob Phelps (now associated with the ACF offshoot Australian Genethics Network). He has been involved in a highly emotive campaign including demands for a genetic engineering moratorium which would affect most biological research in Australia. His largely environmentally oriented campaign stands in contrast to the carefully researched and responsible report of the Victorian Law Reform Society on this topic, and the quietly reasoned comments by human ethics experts such as Nicholas Tonti-Filippini, research officer for the Catholic Bishop's Conference.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These stone-walling tactics of the ACF and other Green groups, and especially their legal challenges to key medical patents, will have tragic consequences world-wide. The credibility gap between their claim to be acting in the public interest and the actual consequences of their anti-genetic engineering propaganda is wide. As a consequence, the Federal Government's recent financial sponsorship of the ACF on this specific issue raises serious ethical concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In coming to a realisation that one can disagree with Greenies and still be a decent citizen, I keep on remembering a conversation with a Green friend. The topic of discussion was pens. I have taken to using, whenever possible, a good old fashioned fountain pen rather than a disposable plastic biro. It makes me feel good when I write because of the smooth flow of ink and its subtle smell. Also, I can avoid the guilt associated with adding to the mountain of plastic on our rubbish dumps. The remark, however, that has echoed in my brain since this conversation, in which I revealed my inner feelings about fountain pens, is that she was glad I was ideologically correct.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ideological correctness (American version: political correctness) is a term which applies to all sorts of actions and attitudes which fit in with a particular philosophy of life. From the Green perspective, for example, it implies rejection of plastic in such forms as kitchen wrap and hamburger cartons, a strong dislike of disposable consumer goods, belief in biodiversity as a guiding principle of life, and acceptance of conspiracy theories involving the CIA and Wall Street. From other perspectives ideological correctness could require agreement with feminist view points and acceptance of the level playing field concept and the power of free-market forces. In even more extreme forms it can involve rejection of anything proposed by Uncle Sam or multi-national corporations, or, on the other side of the political fence, a deep suspicion of Russian political motives. Unfortunately, ideologically correct viewpoints avoid the need for critical thinking about the merits of particular issues, and can be dangerously mis-applied if they rest on flawed assumptions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ACF's treatment of genetic technology issues in the past has been dominated by the use of ideologically correct catch-phrases. It displays a totally superficial understanding of the scientific, social welfare and ethical issues involved, and generally lacks careful discussion of specifics, or careful weighing of the pros and cons of particular courses of action. Most disturbingly, it contains a plethora of misleading written statements combined with exotic cartoons designed to create an awful image of danger, but at the same time calls for something more than simple rhetoric to inform the general public, so that an atmosphere of trust can be developed(1).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ACF's stance on genetic engineering emphasises risks and costs. They argue:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`The assessment of risks and costs should include ecological, social justice, ethical, consumer, animal welfare and other legitimate concerns. They should be fully investigated, assessed, understood and widely discussed by the whole community before we decide on a case by case basis whether to accept Genetic Engineering and its products.' Bob Phelps, for ACF in Farrago, (Melbourne University student paper), 1990.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At first glance this may seem a reasonable approach to contentious technology, given that all participating groups are acting in good faith, and may be willing to accept trade-offs in the interests of community welfare. However ACF's actions make it clear that many hypothetical hazards of low probability, akin to the dangers of being hit by flying pigs, are included in their concept of a legitimate concern. Their concept of social justice ignores many of the legitimate interests of society, and their proposal is a recipe for indefinite delay for any development that the ACF deems ideologically unsound.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first deliberate release of genetically engineered organisms in Australia was for control of bacterial disease in fruit trees. It involved a product developed by Australian researchers at the Waite Institute in South Australia, and now marketed as No Gall'~. This first experimental release of No Gall was used by the ACF as a political issue to dramatise a supposed need for special legislation in this area. ACF seems proud to have delayed the introduction of this product in Victoria as compared to more rapid licensing in New South Wales, but the facts remain that genetic engineering made this particular product environmentally safer than the one it replaced. The development of this product involved the use of simple genetic surgery which was well understood by the scientists who carried out the experiments. There are no legitimate concerns about its effect on the environment, and the ACF opposed its introduction for nonscientific reasons. Any student of the No Gall debate should ask themselves the question "Which, if any, specific environmental concerns about this product were articulated by the ACF?"</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The level of private financial investment in new technology is very sensitive to perceptions of delays and regulatory problems. The high financial costs of excessive regulatory zeal also result in postponed or delayed projects and lack of new investment. A good illustration of this relationship has been the recent relaxation and simplification of US FDA procedures to allow new AIDS therapies to receive a fast track approval. Nothing will completely destroy Australian private investment in biotechnology more effectively than acceptance of the ideological stance of the ACF. It is because the economic damage caused by ACF's ill-considered rhetoric may be so far reaching that their genetic engineering statements and their ideological basis must be exposed to rigorous criticism.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Genetic engineering is used in a huge range of biological research and biotechnology applications ranging from AIDS and cancer treatment to agriculture.

Although medicine is only one area of biology in which it is used, ample illustration its importance in this discipline alone can be got by quoting Sir Gustav Nossal:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Inevitably, people who don't know anything about the subject assume that it involves scientists tampering with their genes. At least 99.9% of medical research on genetic engineering has nothing whatsoever to do with fiddling around with human genes. The media don't seem to understand that. It is the kind of ignorance that creates newspaper headlines and is the stuff of tabloid high drama. But nothing could be further from the truth.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(The Bulletin, December 3,1991)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Research in genetic engineering has moved at breathtaking pace, but it is only recently that genetically engineered products have started to be used on a large scale in medicine, due to the need for lengthy process development, extensive testing, and highly demanding regulatory requirements. In the US, for every one major genetically engineered medicine on the market there are about ten that have recently completed clinical trials, and so there will certainly continue to be a massive increase in sales in this sector of the US economy. This process of therapeutic product development is enormously expensive (at approximately $200,000,000 per product) and the last year or so has witnessed as massive a raising of US venture capital in biotechnology as in any period of the biotechnology industry. To me it is an impressive demonstration of the power of the free-market system to enrich our lives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any general review of genetic engineering would be incomplete without mention of how the technique has allowed the invention of several safer ways of making natural drugs and vaccines. Regrettably, naturally occurring starting materials for drugs or vaccines are sometimes at risk of contamination with dangerous infectious organisms, obviously introducing complications to the process of making safe medicines from these natural products. Nowadays genetic engineering technology allows the starting materials to be changed to a fresh source that is free of this risk, which is a tremendous boon to human welfare. Quite typical examples of this idea are the newly available genetically engineered vaccine for hepatitis, and another vaccine, for cholera, following it in the research pipeline. These two examples alone (and others readily come to mind) represent very tangible benefits of biotechnology for all of us, but particularly for third-world peoples.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The idea allowing an increased assurance of safety is simple&mdash;it hinges on the concept of simply deleting dangerous genes by genetic surgery, or transplanting selected genes to a safer host cell&mdash;but it is of extreme value in medicine since it allows chances of infection with dangerous organisms to be minimised, and is now being widely applied. Hopefully in the future, because of genetic engineering, we will hear fewer and fewer stories of tragic cases of accidental infection by viruses during medical treatment. Recent news stories on CreuztfeldJakob Disease are just one example.</PARA>

As yet, no-one has properly addressed the social justice issues associated with patented genes and the possibilities they hold for monopoly control of the food supply. Until all the problems of genetic engineering are clearly defined and resolved, and an open national system of laws is in place, we must learn from past experience and delay its deployment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Bob Phelps in Conservation News, 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ACF treatment of genetic technology continues to lack an objective review of the progress that has been made in biotechnology and continues to put forward hypothetical hazards as more worthy of debate. Suffice it to say that the Australian Genetic Manipulation Advisory Committee s approach to ensuring adequate safety provisions for this work is carefully considered, well respected, represents input from different sectors of society, and is efficiently administered .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The extent to which genetic engineering may affect the environment remains to be seen, but I challenge the view that it will necessarily damage the environment to any significant extent. Unthinking acceptance of ACF-type rhetoric may add needless delays and extra costs to the introduction of new treatments for diseases such as haemophilia and cancer, and may cause losses to Australian farmers in the future if we fail to follow through with our excellent research efforts in plant and animal biotechnology. It is not an exaggeration to say that all biological research in this country could be affected adversely by their proposals. It is thus crucial to challenge ACF for specific explanations of their concerns, and particularly their concerns about corporate involvement in biotechnology, which display a naive view of the profit motive as a force in society. Certainly in Australia, we do not suffer in any sector of the economy from a problem with overly massive investment in new technology development driven by greedy corporations lusting after monopoly positions. Quite the reverse, the Government has to offer a 150% tax break to encourage any activity of this sort!</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Patenting of biological material is a complex issue meriting an article on its own. It does however provide a mechanism for allowing those who wish to risk money in developing new technology some assurance that they will reap a reward for their labours. The Greens who protest against the patent system for human genes because it supposedly is an exploitation of human rights need to have well explained and compelling reasons for interfering with a very effective, equitable and efficient financing mechanism for life-saving new drugs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A short comment titled Greens versus genes by Laurence Chipman in a recent Melbourne Herald-Sun (February 24, 1992) however goes quickly to the heart of the matter. It describes recent legal action by European Greens attempting to block a patent for a genetically engineered drug relaxin, used to assist childbirth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Greens are ideologically opposed to the idea that anybody might enjoy a commercially profitable monopoly based on reproduction of a constituent part of the human body.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One suspects that their real reason is their deep-seated opposition to commercial development and profit in general. In any case to claim that an abuse of human rights is involved [in patenting a method of reproducing the human hormone relaxin] is laughable. It is actually the very reverse of the truth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unless patents such as those relating to relaxin were available, its life enhancing and indeed life-saving benefits would simply not be available."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One can further add that the international biological patent system is of special value to Australia. Large amounts of public money have been invested over the years in biological research, yielding discoveries such as relaxin (in Melbourne) and the well known Gene-Shears idea by CSIRO in Canberra. Unfortunately the proper further development of these discoveries requires huge amounts of further investment (hundreds of millions of dollars) which is beyond the resources of a small industrially under-developed country like Australia. Fortunately, because of the protection to intellectual property afforded by patents, it is possible for Australian organisations to enter into business arrangements where we get a real dollar return for our investment. The international Gene-Shears consortium negotiated by CSIRO is a fine example of what can be achieved.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By raising the idea that patenting of plants may result in a monopoly of the food supply, Bob Phelps is creating a wonderful hyperbole, but not a very likely scenario. For one thing, patents have a limited life-time. With biological inventions long delays in testing and meeting regulatory hurdles reduce the effective patent-life further. At least the statement implies acceptance, in principle, that this kind of research has the potential to give plants that are so greatly superior that everyone will want to grow them, which is one of the reasons for investing in genetic engineering research! The ability to patent plants, however, in no way guarantees a monopoly of the total food supply, but it certainly promotes research investment and we can all gain from this in a competitive market.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Genetic engineering technology is one technological revolution that Australia has a real chance of participating in, after missing out on the computer micro-chip revolution. We cannot remain unaffected by it. If we disadvantage any further our industries (including agriculture) involved in this technology&mdash;they already have enough problems&mdash;they will simply wither away or move overseas. As other countries, certainly the US and Japan, continue their efforts in this area, we will end up being economically clobbered on the trade balance front by both imports and exports. That is the economic reality that the ACF do not seem to be concerned about, but which all Australians should be aware.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A common claim of the ACF is that we have incomplete knowledge of the consequences of genetic technology and therefore it should not be used until community understanding of all the complex issues is essentially complete. This is abject nonsense. Intellectual understanding of almost every field of human endeavour, including ecology and management of the environment, is incomplete and yet ecologists and environmentalists make recommendations regarding the management of ecosystems. In Physics we have even a celebrated uncertainty principle which puts a limit on what we can know about the behaviour fundamental particles, and still experimentation continues. With a little common-sense we can even get involved in all sorts of theoretically hazardous occupations, such as driving cars, eating and having children. The point is, that we should use good judgement in how we carry out these activities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Political Activities of the ACF:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Political support given by the ACF to the Labor party in the last election is being repaid by financial support by the current government through the ACF-offshoot, the Australian Genethics Network. This has severely compromised the independence of the ACF organisation. Most analysis of the effects of this relationship has centred on the effects of the Hawke Government's decisions on the mining industry&mdash;notably the Coronation Hill debate. Recently the Leader of the Opposition, Dr Hewson, has responded to ACF political activities by refusing to meet with Phillip Toyne, and has shown a welcome perceptiveness in referring to "A different agenda" of that organisation to that of the Liberals. Although Dr Hewson's decision is probably based on issues other than those discussed here, consideration of the ACF's compromised stance on genetic engineering adds further weight to his argument.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe Frank Devine (The Australian, February 10, 1992) made an important distinction in discussing this rebuff of the ACF. Certainly a Prime Minister has an obligation to discuss environmental issues. It does not however inevitably follow that a Prime Minister has an obligation to discuss Green issues. Or for that matter, I should add Red-Green alliance issues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The development of Australian industries, and particularly emerging "Sunrise" industries is being damaged, probably intentionally, by the ACF's ill considered and extreme policy viewpoints on genetic engineering. Most surprisingly these ACF activities are now sponsored by the Commonwealth Department of Administrative Services, which certainly gives a confusing signal about Federal Government's support for the Biotechnology Industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ethical considerations demand that DAS give full public justification of its selection of ACF officers to establish the Australian Genethics Network and particularly, full disclosure of the extent of such financial support, in light of the political activities of the ACF in the last election. For example, I would like to ask what was the peer review process used in funding the ACF on this issue? Was there a requirement for the recipients of this grant to have advanced training in ethics and genetics? What other recipients were considered and why wasn't a less doctrinaire group selected for government funding as an agency to supply ethics advice to schools and the general community? Was any consideration given to the grave ethical implications of the antigenetic engineering campaign pursued by the ACF? Maybe I'm being old fashioned but I expect those who nominate ethics and social justice as the issues for debate to set high standards of conduct, and to demonstrate a balanced understanding of their actions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The road to hell is paved with good intentions.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Two incidents will prove to be a watershed in the fight for the protection of the Australian environment and its protection&mdash;the <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Nufarm issue </EMPHASIS>and the <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Monkeywrench </EMPHASIS>affair. The attacks by Greenpeace on the Nufarm factory in Altona led to much needless expense for the Victorian public&mdash;each assay for dioxins cost many thousands of dollars&mdash;and the end result of an expensive public inquiry was the finding that levels of dioxin release were of no significance for health.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Monkeywrench affair involved implied support for Earth First! ecoterrorist extremists by selling of the book Ecodefense: a Field Guide to Monkeywrenching authored by Dave Foreman, in various Green bookshops, accompanied by uncritical reviews of this publication in a Green newsletter. Monkeywrenching refers to sabotage of supposedly environmentally unsound industry operations&mdash;by spiking of trees for example, to damage logging operations. We have yet to see an Australian report of sawmill accident caused by spiking, but a report alleging spiking appeared in Tasmania&mdash;after the state elections.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The point of these incidents is that they are changing public perceptions of the ethics and intelligence of the environmental lobby groups involved. The way in which the ACF has conducted its genetic engineering campaign so far bodes for a similar course of events occurring with genetic engineering issues. Possibly the relaxin patent issue will be the breaking point. Unfortunately, because of the technical nature of genetic engineering, it may take some time before the general public catches up with the situation, and in the meantime a lot of damage may be done.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My suggestion is that the ACF should change direction on genetic engineering. They currently adopt extreme viewpoints on issues on which they display a simplistic understanding. This is possibly a negotiating tactic, but more likely the true agenda is to bring as much of this work to a halt as long as possible by whatever tactic seems available. This is not consistent with its demands for a balanced discussion of the merits of genetic engineering.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The organisation should be more constructive in its approach to the issues, inform its members more accurately about the status of biotechnology, and focus criticism on the areas where there are real ethical or biohazard concerns. Another way in which the ACF could take a positive lead is to support the use of genetic engineering methods to improve management of the environment. This is currently an active research field, and several Australian groups, including the CSIRO and the Waite Institute are at its forefront.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ACF could well take a leaf out of the book of Monash University's Prof. Peter Singer, whose concerns about animal experimentation carry a lot of force, or from Nicholas Tontini-Filippini. It should seek input from a wider range of professional scientists, economists, and different sectors of the general public. It should re-develop a balanced vision for the future which is economically rational, for without more realism than offered by ACF's current prescriptions our environment will be pretty bleak.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For some time now the Australian Labor Party has been running a fairly ineffective campaign to denigrate the Fightback package proposed by Dr Hewson on behalf of the Liberal and National parties. The campaign has mainly been one of lies and misinformation, but I am pleased to say that it has not been working. I point out, for those people that do not know, that in a couple of South Australian State by-elections a couple of weeks ago the Labor Party actually ran on a campaign of, `Use this by-election to express your opinion on the GST'. It even issued its how-to-vote cards with that on them. The results of those by-elections are well known. In both instances the Labor Party lost votes and came in after the Democrats.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With all respect to Senator Lees, she knows what my opinion of the Democrats is, and to come in after them just shows how pitiful the Labor Party has become. Labor members campaigned wholly and solely upon this point of using the by-election to lodge a protest vote against the GST. So when I say that the campaign by the Labor Party has been ineffective, that demonstrates that point very clearly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The campaign by the Labor Party has gone through several stages. Two or three weeks ago, it seemed to be local government's turn to bear the brunt of the misinformation by the Labor Party on the GST. I will take a few minutes today just to point out how much better councils around Australia will be under the coalition's Fightback package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Local Government, Mr Simmons, has been given the unenviable task of roaming around Australia trying to say to local authorities, `Look, you are going to be worse off'. It is unenviable, because I think even Mr Simmons now understands that it is simply wrong to suggest that councils around Australia will be worse off. In fact, I challenge Mr Simmons to find one council in Australia that will not be cheaper to run under the coalition's Fightback package. He has been sent out, no doubt on the direction of the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, to raise the problems. I challenge him to find one council that will not be cheaper to run under the coalition's Fightback package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason why he will not find any council that is not cheaper to run is that, under the Fightback package, councils will no longer have to pay the fuel tax which this Government currently imposes upon them; they will no longer have to pay the payroll tax that some councils around Australia do pay; they will no longer have to pay the training guarantee levy; and, in spite of what Mr Simmons said on the Gold Coast last week, they will continue to be in the position of not having to pay the wholesale sales tax. Councils do not currently pay it directly, but they do, of course, pay it indirectly. Our policy is not to bring back the wholesale sales tax&mdash;it still will not be payable&mdash;and, what is more, no GST will be paid by councils, either. So with all of these savings that councils will make, they will be able to produce their services at a cheaper base cost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another way in which councils will save is that, because a lot of their existing services are done by private contractors, those private contractors at the moment pay sales tax, fuel tax, payroll tax, the training guarantee levy, and all the other taxes that this Government has imposed upon them. Under our policy, these private contractors will no longer pay sales tax; they will no longer pay fuel tax; they will no longer pay the training guarantee levy; and so it goes on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Acting Deputy President, as you have had a long and distinguished career in local government, you will understand. I will pick an example, say, of a water truck that might be contracted to a local authority. Currently, the man who owns his own water truck has bought that truck for $60,000, $70,000, $80,000, or $120,000, and he has paid 20 per cent sales tax on it. Every time he blows a tyre, every time he smashes a windscreen, he pays an extra 20 per cent sales tax on top of the cost, and that is what he pays now. Every time he fills up his truck with fuel, he pays 26c a litre more than he should; it is a fuel tax that this Government imposed upon him. Under our policy, all of those taxes will go, so a man who owns his water truck and contracts to councils will be able to provide his services to councils at a much lower tendered cost. That is just one very small example of how this will benefit councils around our nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Councils will not pay the GST, for two reasons: either the activities will be regulatory and non-commercial, which we have said in our Fightback package will be zero rated so there will be no incidence of GST on the way through, or for the commercial activities they will attract a GST but, as it is a business, the GST on those inputs will be refunded in full, as it would be for any other business. So councils themselves will not be paying GST for either of those reasons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As opposed to councils, ratepayers may have some incidence of GST on part of their rate bill, but it will not be on the part of their rate bill that relates to the council's regulatory or non-commercial services, and that is a substantial amount of what councils do. They will pay a GST on that part of the rate bill which is related to the council's commercial activities. What is going to be regulatory and non-commercial and what is commercial will be defined by us in legislation. As our package says, those matters are being looked at and worked over at the moment, and we will be making further announcements on those. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly there are many activities of council that will be regulatory and non-commercial. In our package we use the example of maintenance of parks and gardens. That is just one example of the sorts of things that are classed as regulatory or non-commercial. For that aspect of a ratepayer's rate bill which relates to regulatory or non-commercial activities there will be no GST on the rate notice. For those activities that are commercial in nature there will be a component of the rate bill that relates to that and there will be a GST on that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I emphasise again that the addition of the GST will be on a much lower base cost, and it will be a much lower base cost because of the complete abolition of the fuel tax, the complete abolition of the training guarantee levy, the complete abolition of the GST on inputs to businesses and the other savings that I have mentioned. There may be a small effect of the GST on the final rate bill but it will certainly not be 15 per cent, as the Labor Party is trying to say. In fact the Municipal Association of Victoria, the independent body that represents most municipal associations in Victoria, has done some calculations and has come up with some figures that show that in Victoria, on average, the increase in the rate bill would be less than 2 per cent. I am not quite sure what an average rate bill is in Victoria because I do not come from there but, if the average rate bill around Australia is $1,000, a 2 per cent increase would be about $20. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have always said in our Fightback documents that the cost of living will increase, but not by 15 per cent. We have said it could be about 4.4 per cent. The Federal Treasury has said we are wrong and that it is only 3.6 per cent, which is much less. Let us take the Treasury figure of a 3.6 per cent increase across the board. The municipal organisation in Victoria says that for rate notices it will be less than 2 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Fightback package we have indicated that any increase in the cost of living will be more than compensated for by a range of specific benefits. That is the most important aspect of our proposals. Those specific benefits are led by massive cuts in personal income tax, by the abolition of the fuel tax for private motorists, and by increases of 8 per cent in the case of people who are pensioners or 6 per cent in the case of people receiving other government assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A ratepayer earning $20,000 will be making a saving of about $15.60 per week and a ratepayer earning $30,000 will be making a saving of $30.40 per week. It does not need me to point out to you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that that $30 a week saving made as a reduction in income tax will more than cover the increase in rates that the Municipal Association of Victoria has estimated might apply. Every time a ratepayer fills his motor vehicle with fuel he will be saving something like $11. So he needs to fill the tank only twice or thrice to cover any impact there might be, on the estimate given by the Municipal Association of Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is why I say that for all Australians the Fightback package will be a great boost for the country. It will achieve the two million jobs that we set out to create by the end of the century, and it will do very positive things for all aspects of Australian industry and endeavour. But as far as local authorities are concerned, as far as councils are concerned, their current costs of operation will be cut. They will be less because of the fact that we are making all of these savings&mdash;the taxes they currently pay, which will no longer be payable. I repeat my challenge to Mr Simmons: go out and try to find me one council in Australia which would not be cheaper to run under the coalition's Fightback package. The campaign by Mr Simmons and his colleagues is typical of the campaign that the Labor Party has run everywhere, full of lies and misinformation. If Mr Simmons thinks that he can meet my challenge, I would be pleased to hear from him. Find me one council that would not be cheaper to run: that is his challenge&mdash;I await his response. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am rising today to ask my colleagues in the Senate to ask those people who work around Parliament House and support us in the way that they do through the long hours that we work, to make an early Christmas purchase. In particular, I draw my request to the attention of Senator O'Chee, as a young person, and to Senator Meg Lees, as the mother of an adolescent family. Only last week the Australian Paralympic Federation launched a CD featuring the 19 top Australian rock groups. The proceeds of this venture will assist in a fundraising appeal to send members of the Paralympic team to the winter Paralympics and the other Paralympic events. I commend them for initiating the project of putting this CD together, and also for setting up an appeal, which was also launched last week, to raise money. The Federation asked every athlete, every sportsperson&mdash;man and woman&mdash;to donate $1.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why has it had to do this? It has had to do it because there is an inequality between the funding for our Paralympic team and our Olympic team. We should all be aware of that and we ought to think about whether that is proper and equitable. Why should our top disabled athletes, who are competing in the Paralympics, receive less funding than able-bodied athletes going off to the Olympics? It might be because they do not get as much press coverage. It might be because the Government cannot get the same kudos out of supporting those who are disabled as they can out of supporting our able-bodied athletes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But that is no excuse for the inequality in the distribution of taxpayers' funds. The disparity is not only in dollar terms, it is in percentage terms as well. If the percentage disparity were right as the difference between what an able-bodied athlete gets and what an athlete with a disability gets, it would still cost the Government less than a third as much to fund the disabled athletes as the non-disabled athletes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an issue that I believe the Government ought to be addressing. Senator Reid was talking to me today. She is on a Paralympics fundraising committee in Canberra. She told me that she wanted me to speak on her behalf on the importance of the Senate's taking note of this discrepancy and of doing everything in its power to address it. This morning I gave a notice of motion calling on the Senate to address the concerns that I am raising here today at lunchtime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Reid was telling me that the able-bodied Olympic team is totally fitted out with their uniforms, their blazers and so on. The Paralympic team is fitted out with less equipment than that, and if team members want an Olympic blazer they have to buy it themselves. There is no proper place for that sort of discrimination in this day and age. One wonders what other sorts of discrepancies there are in training grants, scholarships and other sorts of facilities to promote sportsmanship amongst people in our community with disabilities. Is it that the Government thinks that they are one-third less deserving? That is how much less they get in terms of support to represent Australia. Our Paralympic team was very successful at the last winter Paralympics. They are athletes of distinction and they should not be discriminated against. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is ironical that I should be speaking on this today, when only a couple of days ago the Disability Discrimination Bill was introduced in the House of Representatives. You can bet your bottom dollar the Government will lord it around the place saying, `Look what we have brought in: the Disability Discrimination Bill 1992'. I will read from the second page of that Bill, clause 3:</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i)work, accommodation, education, access to premises, clubs and sport.</PARA>
<PARA>It seems crazy to me that we have a Bill brought into the House of Representatives specifically to legislate against discrimination, while what we have in the funding arrangements is discrimination. That is two-faced hypocrisy. Those on the other side talk about duplicity all the time, but that is the ultimate in duplicity. The Bill will get publicity and the Government will say, `Look what we have done for people with disabilities', but it is what people do that counts. Actions count louder than words. It is no good having this legislation unless it is followed in practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is exactly the same thing as when the Government says, `All people with disabilities should be out in open employment'. We went through in the Chamber in this session looking at how well various Government departments have done in employing people with disabilities. Appallingly! I cannot remember the figures exactly, but something in the order of 40-odd departments and authorities had decreased the number of people in their employment with disabilities, some had stayed the same, and a few had gone up&mdash;a precious few. Another example of not practising what they preach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some might say, `Senator Patterson, you are asking for more money'. I am glad Senator Calvert is in the chair. I do not want to implicate him, because he should be impartial in that role, but one only has to go through the rorts and the waste of money that he has identified in the Waste Watch Committee. In 1990-91 Foreign Affairs spent $100,000 designing a new passport form that was never used. What is the order of the money that we are looking for? We are looking for about an additional $700,000 to have our Paralympic team funded at the same level as our able-bodied Olympic team. There is $100,000 of it&mdash;a seventh of it&mdash;wasted on designing a new passport form that was never used. The Australian Industry Development Assistance Bureau wasted $11m on a botched aid program to the Solomon Islands. Dr Edwards, a consultant to Mr Keating when he was Treasurer, received an $80,000 pay-out after four months work. </PARA>

I note that in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>: it was 10c, not 10 per cent. The Government wrote to them all, and it cost $100,000 to tell them that they got 10c extra. I am sure every one of those pensioners would have said, `Give that money to the Paralympic team. I do not need to be told I have got another 10c'. I am sure I would have every pensioner in Australia behind me in  saying, `That money&mdash;that postage and all the effort from Social Security&mdash;could have gone into supporting our Paralympic team.' I bet there is not one pensioner who would disagree with me on that, and say they needed to be told they would get another 10c. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What did the Government spend on pot plant hire in 1989-90? Senator Calvert has shown us that it spent $1.07m on pot plant hire, but we cannot outfit our team for the Paralympics; we cannot support it. We have stories of families struggling to support their disabled sports people to ensure that they can execute and put into place at the Paralympics all the training that they have gone through to represent Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have said before that how we treat the aged in our community is a reflection of our society. How our society treats people with disabilities in our community is also a reflection of our society. It could be any one of us tomorrow or tonight. All it takes is a stroke or an accident, and fate does not discriminate; all it takes is that split second and any one of us could be in that situation. It is not a very good record and I hope the Government can justify this Bill when its practice does not reflect what is in this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today is the third anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre in which the Chinese authorities butchered thousands of defenceless men, women and children, whose only crime was to protest for the democratic freedom which we in this country take for granted. Unfortunately, the sense of outrage expressed by all the civilised world at that time is too quickly forgotten as similar outrages are perpetrated by other governments and in other places. Despite their apparent differences, however, these dark regimes have one thing in common&mdash;they use the dark hand of tyranny to crush the aspirations of their people for peace and democracy. The power of a barrel of a gun overcomes the longing for a more just world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How should we lucky few in Australia and elsewhere deal with China as the years pass by and the sense of public outrage declines? How should we treat the People's Republic of China as a sovereign state in the international community? To forget what happened on that morning in Beijing and on subsequent days throughout China would be to dishonour the memory of those who laid down their lives for principle. To isolate China from the world at this stage would arguably do little to further the cause of reform in that country. In this context, I believe it is incumbent upon us to end the economic isolation of the People's Republic of China and actively to encourage better trade links between the mainland and the nations of the free world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also appropriate for us to call upon the Government in Beijing to implement with all haste the necessary economic reforms which will improve the living standards of ordinary people and bring them as far as possible in line with those in the Western world. The inexorable march for better prosperity, which is at the heart of every nation and which indelibly stamps the actions of every legitimate government, cannot and should not be impeded on the Chinese mainland. Further economic sanctions against the Government of the People's Republic of China will not serve those goals and will in fact only delay the introduction of much needed reforms to eradicate poverty and hardship. This does not mean, however, that we should in any way legitimise the many repressive actions of the current Government, whether they were perpetrated then or in the intervening period. The world must make it perfectly clear that it will not tolerate the use of force for political repression, the banning of free speech or the imprisonment of people for their ideals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just the other day the Government in Beijing banned laughter in Tiananmen Square for fear that it might be used as a form of protest. It banned laughter! That the Chinese Government should go to such lengths is a measure of just how isolated it is in a political sense, both from the international community and from its own people. This is a government which is afraid of the strength of the human spirit which survives repression, torture, and tyranny and which is sustained by a belief in the fundamental rights of man. I believe, therefore, that our duty must be to offer light in the darkness, succour to the suffering, and hope to the hopeless that one day the freedoms which we in this country enjoy as rights will be available to the people of the Chinese mainland, as it will be available to people everywhere, and may God speed that day. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Sports Drug Agency Amendment Bill will amend the Australian Sports Drug Agency Act, following the recent case of Australian cyclist Martin Vinnicombe, who tested positive for anabolic steroids in the United States through tests carried out at the request of the Australian Sports Drug Agency by Canadian authorities. However, Mr Vinnicombe subsequently avoided sanctions on a legal technicality, despite admitting to using the drugs. I announced on 27 April, on behalf of the coalition, that we would move to close the Vinnicombe loophole should the Government fail to do so, and I commend the Government for seeking to close that loophole.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I do have some problems with this legislation. This is the third time in something like 15 months of operation that the Australian Sports Drug Agency Act has had to be amended in one way or another. It does not really give us a great deal of confidence in the people drafting this legislation in the first place. It does not seem that they are enormously aware of the problems that this sort of legislation faces or that they are aware of the sort of legislation that is required to make the whole program of opposing the use of drugs in sport work properly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill contains a large number of amendments and makes provision for a coordinated national approach through the States and Territories to eliminate drugs in sport following an agreement between State and Territory sports Ministers last year. It will enable the Agency to test a wider range of athletes, both in Australia and overseas, for the presence of prohibited drugs. The Agency will also be allowed to enter into contractual arrangements with overseas governments and other anti-doping authorities to arrange for the collection and testing of samples. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The central thrust of the Bill will enable the Agency to recognise procedures adopted by foreign anti-doping authorities which conduct tests on its behalf, even if those procedures do not precisely mirror those set out in the Australian Sports Drug Agency regulations. The minimum standard will be that provided for in the International Olympic Charter against doping in sport. The Agency will now be able to act on those results. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian standards are currently stricter than, and slightly different from, those in the Olympic charter but, in our view, basically no threat to the rights of Australians will emerge from allowing Australian athletes to be tested overseas under the Olympic charter requirements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also gives athletes the opportunity to make a challenge to the validity of a positive test result if procedures relating to, first, the sealing of the container holding the sample and, secondly, testing of the sample by an accredited laboratory are not complied with; or if, thirdly, there is evidence of tampering with the sample. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Should the Agency decide that the test is valid, the competitor will now be entitled to apply to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to have the decision reviewed. The Agency must verify that all the three above procedures were followed before validating a positive test result, even if there is no appeal by the competitor. Written notification to approved sporting and anti-doping organisations of a positive test result or of a refusal to provide a sample is now required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The name of the register will be altered to `register of notifiable events', to remove any implications that the entry of a person's name on the register necessarily implies guilt. The question of guilt and the application of sanctions is the responsibility of the sporting organisations, not the Australian Sports Drug Agency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to protect minors, the Bill also makes allowance for the removal of a minor's name from the register once the period of any sanction imposed by sporting organisations has elapsed, provided that at the time of the request to provide a sample the person was under the age of 18. The Agency will also now have the power to approve foreign anti-doping bodies which adopt at least standards provided for in the Olympic charter and to request such bodies to take a sample from a competitor who is an Australian citizen or permanent resident when the competitor is overseas. The Agency will also be required to keep the list of such bodies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be no additional financial obligations imposed on the Commonwealth by this legislation because any additional costs arising from contracts with overseas organisations will be fully recovered and any additional costs arising from the complementary legislation passed by the States and Territories will be borne, of course, by those States and Territories. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do have a couple of problems about the way the Government has gone about this. As I said, we fully support the Bill&mdash;in fact, we announced that we would initiate such legislation&mdash;but it is extraordinary to me that this legislation was not referred by the Government to such organisations as the Australian Olympic Committee who have a clear and significant interest in this matter. The only way the Australian Olympic Committee found out what this legislation was all about was when I sent it a copy last week. Frankly, that is not the way to run a government. I am quite astounded that there was clearly a lack of consultation with the people most involved&mdash;at least consultation at the point when the legislation was presented. One would have thought, if one were running a department or an organisation which is seeking the cooperation of bodies like the Australian Olympic Committee, that that kind of action&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Panizza" NAMEID="JI4">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If it is the ACTU lot, they will confer with them.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator MICHAEL BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Exactly. As Senator Panizza says, if it was the ACTU, the Government would confer with it to find out what it was allowed to do. In this case, it does seem to me unfortunate. I do not know to what extent there was any other consultation&mdash;I was not advised of any; there may have been some&mdash;but it would seem to me just basic courtesy to say to the Australian Olympic Committee, `Have you got any feelings about this legislation? Are we covering it properly? Have we covered all angles?'. In fact, I think there are still some problems with the legislation. I expect more amendments to the Australian Sports Drug Agency Act, because there are problems.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose that one of the problems we cannot really deal with in the Act itself relates to the problems that emerge when an admission from someone such as Vinnicombe&mdash;who cheated and admitted that he cheated because he thought he had been caught out by the test&mdash;is not regarded as a positive test for the purposes of action being taken against him. We discussed this in the appropriation debate the other day. It was put to me that penalties are up to the sporting bodies themselves and therefore it is up to them to determine whether an admission of having taken drugs should carry the same weight as a test by the Australian Sports Drug Agency. What I would like to see is appropriate legislation introduced in this place by the Government to make it a requirement, if sporting organisations are to receive government funding grants through the Australian Sports Commission, that they accept admissions of guilt along with these other test matters. I hope the Government will take some kind of action on this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is as well, however, a basic problem that has been put to me relating to this Act: it requires too many procedures. The amendments here today do not address those problems. There are 58 procedures to be followed when doing a test. Therefore, it is possible to omit a procedure and void a test, as in the Vinnicombe case, even though it is clear and evident that the person has tested positive. With 58 potential slip-up points, surely there are ways of condensing the escape hatches for people who have cheated by taking drugs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are four basic elements to be dealt with when testing. The first is selection of the athlete, either in or out of competition. The second is control of the sample when it has been given, to ensure there is no substitution. Thirdly, one must be able to show that it is the proper sample. Fourthly, the sample must be properly tested. They seem to be four relatively simple and basic propositions and I would hope that the escape hatches would be significantly reduced to fit in with those four basic objectives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a problem that, after these amendments, foreign athletes are still unable to be tested in Australia if they are here for training only and do not use government facilities. I mention this as a matter of some significance, because Vinnicombe claimed he was in the United States for training only and so, without our approval, the Canadian drug testing people could not have tested him. The reverse is equally true: that foreign athletes are still unable to be tested in Australia if they are here for training only and do not use government facilities, or are not in international competition, and they do not agree to be tested. In those circumstances they can be tested only if their controlling body agrees to the testing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What this means is that, if it is clear and evident to ASDA as a result of information that there is clearly some international athlete taking drugs&mdash;and, one may fear, encouraging other athletes, Australian athletes with whom he is training, to take such drugs&mdash;no action is to be taken without the controlling body of that organisation agreeing. I believe that it is worth examining that situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also a view around that we should not be saying that this Act is being changed to follow IOC procedures, but that it will substantially follow them. I understand that that is a significant difference and that the Act means that we will be substantially following but not actually following them. There is no requirement, by the way, for the Australian Olympic Committee to be notified if an athlete tests positive&mdash;only that athlete's sports body. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason I raise that as a problem is this. Suppose the Australian Olympic Committee is to have its funding dependent on its following the rules and requirements for the penalties that would emerge from positive drug testing but a constituent body&mdash;say, the Cycling Federation, because that has been in the news&mdash;does not tell the Australian Olympic Committee that one of its members has been found positive. The AOC may then suffer. The sins of one of its associate members could well be visited upon the Australian Olympic Committee without its knowing what the problem really is. So there are further changes that need to be made, particularly in view of the Government's failure, it seems to me, adequately to consult with the bodies involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nonetheless, I conclude by saying that the coalition strongly supports the Government's actions in trying to close the Vinnicombe loophole. We condemn those people who have sought to excuse or justify Vinnicombe's cheating on his colleagues. As I mentioned the other day, I have had some people writing to me saying how disgraceful our actions are. A couple of people from Tasmania, actually, Mr Acting Deputy President&mdash;I know that that will shock you&mdash;have written saying, `Why are you hounding this poor innocent man who has served his penalty for drug taking?'. The fact is that he has not and did not, and that was the disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An innocent person who was suspended for drinking too much coffee&mdash;and, thank heavens, at last has been exonerated&mdash;had to serve a penalty of two years, but Vinnicombe, who admitted to taking a performance enhancing drug and who, by the way, had been accused of being involved in these drugs for quite some time before this, was allowed because of a technicality to escape half his penalty. It seems to me to be extraordinary. Vinnicombe himself has accused me of hounding him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All I want to do is to make certain that drug cheats have to pay the penalty for their misbehaviour. I am glad to see that the Government strongly takes that view, with the result that it has introduced these amendments, which are the third amendments in 15 months of operation of this Act. I end by commending people in the Sports Drug Agency for their commitment to their objective. I suppose a slight family bias could be alleged in that my cousin, Professor Peter Baume, is Chairman of the Australian Sports Drug Agency. I commend the Sports Drug Agency for its efforts. I just regret that in this situation the Act has clearly been found wanting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that there is no prospect whatsoever of any loophole like the Vinnicombe loophole being repeated. I regret to say that I do not believe these amendments ensure that there can be no such escape, particularly because of the Government's failure at the moment to address in a legislative way the matter of admissions of guilt to drug taking even if a drug test is found not to have met exactly all the 58 required steps that have to be taken without slip-up for it to be able to be used as evidence of drug taking. The coalition supports this Bill and will support subsequent Bills that may have to come in to block the holes that we think still exist in this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As has already been noted, many of the amendments within the Australian Sports Drug Agency Amendment Bill have been made necessary by recent events both in Australia and overseas. In particular, a series of amendments have been made necessary by the events surrounding the Australian cyclist, Martin Vinnicombe, who tested positive and who admitted to being positive after using performance enhancing anabolic steroid drugs but who was able to avoid appropriate sanctions on a legal technicality. I believe the Government is to be congratulated on the speed with which it has acted to remove this technical loophole through which Mr Vinnicombe was able to escape. It is just 35 days since this chamber was given a guaran-</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>tee by Senator Collins that the Government would act and just some 51 days since the Minister for Sport, Mrs Kelly, issued drafting instructions to close the Vinnicombe loophole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That short timeframe indicates the seriousness with which the Government approaches the matter of drugs in sport, a seriousness which, I know, is shared by the Opposition, certainly by the Democrats and, I believe, by all within the community. It is particularly appropriate, with just 52 days to go to the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in Barcelona, that we should be sending to the world as strong a message as possible that Australians do not condone cheating in sport. Who knows how many Australian athletes, particularly swimmers&mdash;more particularly, women swimmers&mdash;have missed out on medals at previous Olympics and also at world competitions because they have had to compete against drug cheats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is somewhat ironic that the loophole through which Mr Vinnicombe was able to escape and avoid full sanctions existed because the procedures adopted by the Australian Sports Drug Agency regarding testing are somewhat more stringent than those adopted by other nations and even those in the international Olympic charter against doping in sport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Act has been amended to ensure that the Australian Sports Drug Agency can recognise procedures adopted by foreign anti-doping authorities testing on the Agency's behalf, as long as those procedures meet a minimum standard of those provided for in the international Olympic charter. That will consequently allow the Agency to make entries recording positive tests on the register of notifiable events, even if the procedures followed by a foreign agency did not mirror exactly those set out in the Australian Sports Drug Agency regulations. That was the main loophole in the Vinnicombe case. Some other features in these amendments provide for Australia to take a coordinated national approach to the elimination of drugs in sport, and provide for the Australian Sports Drug Agency to take a wider international role. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the national level, the Bill enables the States and Territories to confer testing powers on the ASDA through complementary State and Territory legislation. I understand that there has been a commitment from all States and Territories that such legislation will be introduced&mdash;and that is to be encouraged and commended. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the international arena, the Australian Sports Drug Agency is increasingly being recognised as having professional expertise in testing for prohibited drugs. The Bill includes amendments which will give the ASDA the power to enter into contracts or arrangements with overseas governments and other sporting authorities for the collection and testing of samples. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the flip side of the international equation, the Bill protects the interests of Australian athletes by making sure that the Agency actually monitors and approves the procedures of foreign anti-doping authorities with whom we have reciprocal arrangements to ensure that they are conforming to at least the minimum international Olympic charter standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of other amendments&mdash;and I will be brief, considering the time. These cover such matters as the appeal process for athletes challenging a positive test result; the notification of athletes and sporting bodies of test results; the change of name of the registrar from the `register of defaulting competitors' to the `register of notifiable events', to remove the immediate association with guilt of entry of a person's name upon that register; and the provision that minors have their names taken off the register once the period of any sanction imposed by the sporting organisation has elapsed, provided they were under 18 at the time of the request. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I state very strongly that the Australian Democrats fully support the measures taken in this Bill. </PARA>

Then the Government obviously decided to move after that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not go in depth into the amendments, but there are a large number of amendments in this Bill to coordinate the approach to cutting out drugs in sport. One of the main ones, as far as I am concerned, is the contractual arrangements that the ASDA will have with the governments of other countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other forward movement is an appeal to the AAT, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, if the person is found to have a positive case. I believe that, in anything where a person has been found guilty, this could be an avenue of appeal when before there was none. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now mention, briefly, the Alex Watson case. I was on the original inquiry into drugs and sport. We had a lot of witnesses before us, some of whom were less than convincing. In this case of Alex Watson, however, when I listened to his story and his case&mdash;not what I read in the newspapers about when he was banned and thrown out of the Seoul Olympics, and put on the next plane home without much explanation; I did not take any notice of that but I am talking about when he came in front of the inquiry&mdash;he was one that I wanted to believe, because he seemed genuine in what he was saying in comparison with a lot of less than truthful witnesses at the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Among the questions to Alex Watson, I asked him about Dr Fitch, from Western Australia, who is eminent in sports medicine. I asked, `Did you ever talk to him about it, or did he ever question you about it?' and he replied yes. When I asked what he had said on the matter, the reply was, `Listen, young fellow, you are over and you cop it!'. When he said that such an eminent, experienced person as Dr Fitch had told him that, I said that it must have been right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">History has proved that the caffeine that he took came from the sources that Alex Watson said it did, and he has now been exonerated. That shows that even experts&mdash;I am not being unkind to Dr Fitch, whom I have had the pleasure of knowing for 40-odd years&mdash;can make rather off the cuff, rash judgments that are not necessarily right. I was very happy to see Alex Watson exonerated. The AOF has now got to think whether other such happenings may occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that this Bill will make a better sports drug agency but we have already heard the criticism that, when this amendment Bill was prepared, it was not referred to the Australian Olympic Federation whatsoever for its input. That is akin to preparing a tax amendment Bill and not referring it to the Commissioner of Taxation, or indeed an industrial relations Bill without conferring with the ACTU&mdash;even, as Senator Baume said, contacting the ACTU to see what the Government is allowed to do. In this case the Government has failed badly in not referring the Bill to the highest organisation in sport in Australia, the Australian Olympic Federation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I would like to commend the efforts of the Australian Sports Drug Agency, headed by Professor Peter Baume, for the efforts it is making to stamp out drug use from Australian sport. I commend also the efforts that Dr Fitch and others throughout Australia put into getting the Sports Drug Agency going in the first place. I believe that it is starting to make progress and that, with these amendments&mdash;although there will be a lot more around the corner; we will probably be back next session amending it again&mdash;it will get to the position with drugs and sport that we are looking for in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Sports Drug Agency Amendment Bill 1992 introduces a number of amendments. It is prompted by the appeal which was upheld by arbitration by Bob Ellicott, QC, an appeal by Martin Vinnicombe, a well-known, notorious and self-confessed cheat, who has been riding against athletes who have been competing on their merits while he has been competing on anabolic steroids. He has shown absolutely no remorse, no apology and no regret for his conduct, save for his bitterness that he was detected.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The technicality was essentially that the authorities which tested him did not comply strictly with the provisions of the Australian Sports Drug Agency; therefore, the test was found to be invalid. By any measure it is a technicality in the sense that in no way is there any suggestion that he was not cheating. He was detected in Canada or America, as I recall, by another body. Mr Vinnicombe had learnt not to take anabolic steroids in Australia because of the efficiency of the Australian Sports Drug Agency. He refined his skills in taking drugs when he was overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can imagine the bitterness of all those athletes and competitors who have ridden against him in the past at the various venues and the various Olympic Games and Commonwealth Games, and who have been cheated out of a place by this man. They have probably given a lifetime of endeavour in their sport, not to succeed only because they chose to succeed on their merits. While this man is on a dais, taking gold and glory, they are forgotten names in the world of amateur cycling. Now, because of this technicality, Mr Martin Vinnicombe is going to be riding as a professional athlete in Australian colours&mdash;something about which neither we, nor he, ought to be proud. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to commend the Australian Sports Drug Agency for its diligence, and for the part it played in cleaning up sport in Australia. Steve Haynes, the executive officer, has done a magnificent job and so has the commission generally, headed by the eminent Professor Peter Baume. Without taking a partisan shot at the Government, can I say that I very much regret that it was not long ago that the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories (Mrs Kelly) was saying that we have gone over the top in this business of worrying about drugs in sport, and that there was too much emphasis on that matter. That has been found to be a misguided nonsense, at the very least, and a gross irresponsibility, at the very worst. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The facts of the matter are that the Committee inquiring into drugs in sport in Australia revealed an enormous amount of indiscriminate use&mdash;if there can be such a thing as discrimination in this respect&mdash;of anabolic steroids. One of the recommendations of that Committee was that there be an upgraded surveillance at the barriers by the Customs authorities, a recommendation which was adopted. As a result of the implementation of that recommendation, it has been subsequently disclosed that there is enormous trade in the sale of anabolic steroids for human use, including veterinary steroids. There have been recent revelations that they are used not only by elite athletes in elite sports but also by body builders, by weight-lifters and by young people. The tragedy of young people using anabolic steroids is the severe psychological and physical affect it has upon them. To date, there has been no prospect of that being stamped out, and we can only hope that in the future, with greater surveillance and greater activity, we will see some reduction in the use of anabolic steroids. </PARA>

Given that yesterday the Prime Minister confirmed the Government's support for the full ACTU national wages claim&mdash;meaning that the Government will not be supporting a discount to the claim on account of the superannuation guarantee levy&mdash;and further that Treasury Secretary Cole has said, `There is an implicit full offset to the SGL from reductions in other wages costs' in the One Nation wages growth projections, why is it not the case that these projections are now wrong and that there will indeed be a substantial rise in Australians out of work due to the introduction of the superannuation guarantee levy?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>subject and, indeed, is not aware of the employment implications as spelt out by Treasury to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation? In other words, if the full unit labour cost is borne by employers, there will be up to 100,000 jobs lost over the next five years and the only way to avoid that is to discount wages. Is the Minister telling us all of that? Further, I refer the Minister to evidence presented last night to the Select Committee by Mr Ian Ross on behalf of the ACTU that the additional cost of the SGL from 1 July will be of the order of 1 1/2 per cent aggregate wage costs on a national accounts basis. Is this simply not further evidence that, unless the wage claim is discounted by around the 1 1/2 per cent figure, there will inevitably be a very significant level of job losses? If the Minister is not able to answer that, I ask him why he bothers coming to Question Time at all.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been said in this dispute that the only thing that the company wants is to deal with its employees. I am amazed by that bland and, might I say, disingenuous statement because this is the company which has served writs on its own employees and their representatives. As many as 85 per cent of its own employees have signed a petition saying that unions of which they are members should be recognised by the company as their bargaining agent. This is the company which has sent notices of dismissal to all of its employees. This is the company which applied yesterday to the Tasmanian Training Authority to suspend the indentures of 80 apprentices in Tasmania. That leads me to the now bizarre advent of the `ninja turtles'. I am advised that ABC Radio and the Hobart <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mercury</EMPHASIS> are chasing a group of imported APPM security men, allegedly skilled in martial arts, who have been dubbed the `ninja turtles'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other jibe in this dispute is that it is a product of this Government's industrial relations system. Mr Henderson of APPM says that what is preventing settlement of this dispute is the writs that have been issued. Those writs have been issued under section 45D of the Trade Practices Act. John Howard, the shadow spokesman for industrial relations, claims to be the father of that section of the Act.

I am pleased to be able to assure the Senate that, according to some feedback I received this morning, the interest in proceeding with applications for the four transponder licences is very active indeed. In the policy that has just been announced, there is a balance in competition which, at the end of the day, will greatly benefit consumers. This policy is fundamentally designed to do that. Like our aviation policy, which is not to look after aviation interests, this policy is not designed to look after broadcasting interests but is designed to further enhance the opportunities that exist for Australians to have access to this technology. Australia is probably the last English speaking country on earth that does not have access to pay TV. That is not in fact strictly true: we do have pay TV here already for those that can afford it. If anybody wants to visit a few of the cattle stations in the Northern Territory, they will see how, if one has $5,000 to purchase the necessary equipment, it is possible to access pay TV.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A major research project has been undertaken by the Australian Institute of Criminology. It has identified fear of crime rather than the actual experience as victims of crime of the elderly in Australia. I believe the report, which I have publicly released today, seriously undermines the Opposition's current scare campaign, which is directed at those persons perhaps 60 years or over who have their fears aroused and are concerned about what they are led by headlines to believe is a real danger to them of being possible common victims of violent crime. In fact, those who seek to heighten the anxiety of the elderly in our community bear a very real responsibility. I am disgusted that the coalition media unit today has circulated in the Press Gallery a story in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Telegraph Mirror</EMPHASIS> headed `Mugger preyed on elderly&mdash;Court told'. In other words, the coalition wants to spread the word, spread anxiety and spread all this fear among the elderly in our community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The facts are to be found in today's Institute of Criminology trends and issues series entitled `The Elderly as Victims of Crime, Abuse and Neglect' by Mary-Ann Pinkerton-James. I ought to emphasise the timing of the release because of the very proper integrity of the Institute. This paper has been in preparation for four months. It was by coincidence available for publication today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The trends and issues paper covers a range of areas of crime, abuse and neglect and analyses the vulnerability of the elderly. It finds that, in the area of theft and violence in particular, the exceptionally high level of concern amongst elderly Australians is not supported by the figures. In fact, in both these areas the risk is relatively low. Honourable senators will know that I have pointed out on many occasions in this chamber that in relation to homicide the age group most vulnerable, most likely to be killed, in our society is infants between zero and one year of age. It is certainly not the elderly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A recurring theme of the report is the one word `fear'. It emerges over and over again. If we look at the actual statistics, in 1991, for example, 2,012 respondents in all were surveyed, of which 439 were aged 60 years or older. Only nine, 2.7 per cent, of the elderly respondents had received threats of non-sexual violence during the previous five years. None said they were actually hurt. Based on this sample, the elderly are therefore four times less likely than average to suffer threats and the risk of actual assault was too small to be measured. Only four, 0.4 per cent, of the elderly female respondents had experienced a sexual incident during the previous five years. Three described the incident as merely offensive behaviour, the other as an indecent assault. None described the incident as rape or attempted rape.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the overall sample, 12.8 per cent had experienced such crimes. Based on this sample, the elderly are therefore 32 times less likely than average to suffer sexual incidents and the risk of actual or attempted rape was too small to be measured. I put those figures down because I think it is important for the elderly in our community to understand that whilst their fears might be aroused&mdash;and quite clearly where one has a serial killer on the rampage through Mosman it is true, as I know from an elderly aunt of mine who lived in Manly, that they are very frightened indeed; those fears are real&mdash;the likelihood of their being subjected to violent crime is very remote indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the community does have to take steps to try to prevent any such incident of crime. The Australian Police Ministers Council meeting in July will be establishing an Australian program to deal with the prevention of crime and the social causes of crime and to try, even by way of urban structures and planning&mdash;for example, by the provision of well-lit thoroughfares and so on&mdash;to ensure that the elderly are not subjected to any violent attacks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a very important matter which ought not to be subject to propaganda but to trying to do the best we can to ensure that the elderly people in our community live in a way which is not fearful and which is certainly not subject to the real incidence of criminal activity.</PARA>

They appear in document 48 of the ones before Senator Hill&mdash;and I specifically mentioned that this morning so he would not have to ask me this question as it would be self-evident from the material in front of him&mdash;when Mr Lamb, in further discussion of this matter with an officer of my Department, agreed that his revised recollection was manifestly wrong to the extent that he said he thought he might have received the Sibraa letter as early as 5 or 10 November, and that it must have been a later date when he was out of Washington between 20 and 22 November.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The recent announcements made by the Government in respect of its aviation policy, of course, build on the One Nation statement made by the Prime Minister. As honourable senators know, just yesterday we announced the successful completion of an agreement between the governments of Australia and New Zealand to provide further competition on the trans-Tasman route. Of course, we will be introducing into the Senate later this afternoon or this evening legislation to establish a body that will give an impartial allocation of future international rights.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have no intention whatever of introducing a 15 per cent tax on air fares, as the Opposition is proposing to do. In fact, everything this Government is doing in respect of aviation policy is designed to produce&mdash;and in fact has produced&mdash;lower air fares. The GST, which the Australian tourist industry has described as being a `disaster' for the Australian tourism industry, would completely reverse and pull apart all of the gains that have been made by this Government over the last few years in aviation policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fascinating thing about the Opposition's stance on aviation policy, such as it has, is that even its front bench, not just its back bench, is flat out trying constantly to run away from it. Mr Jull put on the most extraordinary performance in the House of Representatives just a few weeks ago in respect of the recovery of charges for safety regulation in Australia. Thinking he was scoring a few cheap points, he congratulated a Caucus committee&mdash;that is, a Government aviation committee&mdash;for presumably pulling the Government into gear and reversing a decision to recover the cost of safety regulation from the industry. He congratulated the Caucus committee for reversing that decision when the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback</EMPHASIS> document says not only that the Opposition will recover that cost but also that it will not even phase in that recovery. The Opposition puts in a savings of $20m for doing it.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">SENATOR O'CHEE'S QUESTION</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Is the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service currently reviewing or monitoring import restrictions on pig semen and other breeding material banned because of the possible introduction of mystery swine disease [porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS)] which spread from North America to European countries that also want to export pig semen and other breeding material to Australia? Does the virus causing mystery swine disease survive freezing? Was the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service directed to undertake this review by the Minister for Resources, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy or the Prime Minister?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ANSWER</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yes. The Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) is currently monitoring and reviewing import restrictions on pig semen and other breeding material that have been imposed because of PRRS (mystery swine disease). This task is part of AQIS' ongoing responsibilities to monitor the international occurrence of, spread of and scientific knowledge relating to unwanted diseases, and to review Australia's import requirements in the light of significant developments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since PRRS is a relatively newly emerged disease of economic significance overseas, AQIS' monitoring and review processes have been intense. AQIS has, for more than a year now, been actively seeking up to date information from researchers and authorities in countries affected by the disease on a regular basis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An expert working party has been established at AQIS' request to periodically review developments and provide advice concerning the necessity or otherwise for further action. AQIS has been periodically providing updated advice to industry organisations and other interested parties concerning significant developments and new scientific information of which it has become aware.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The findings and recommendations of the expert working party have been provided to industry and interested parties for consultation and comment. AQIS has instigated several meetings with industry specifically to discuss international developments and its actions concerning PRRS.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yes. The limited scientific research that has been completed overseas to date has confirmed that the virus of PRRS (mystery swine disease) can survive temperatures between 4 degrees celsius and minus 70 degrees celsius for several months albeit with some apparent reduction in the level of infection. Recent evidence suggests that virus may be excreted in semen of boars for about a week after infection. This supports AQIS action in suspending imports of semen and breeding material from affected countries. The Minister for Resources and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy have been kept fully informed of developments and have supported and encouraged this review work.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The background to the conversation on 16 May was as follows. In September 1991 there was a meeting of South Pacific Forum country officials, including Australia, Fiji and the Marshall Islands, on extradition and other aspects of criminal law enforcement cooperation. That was at Sigatoka, Fiji. I was a member of the Australian delegation, which included David Tough, First Secretary at the Australian Suva Embassy.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 10 April 1992 when the Symons case in the Marshall Islands first came to the Department's attention, I had made an oral inquiry of the AFP whether there were on foot any proceedings or investigations involving Symons from an Australian police viewpoint.

<PARA>I believe that Senator Cook has attempted to mislead the Senate in his answers to questions both yesterday and today. He was referring to Mr John Howard in the other place interfering in the APPM dispute.

<PARA>This motion refers to my question today concerning a letter that the Minister chose to send to members of the legal profession and prominent members of the financial community, as described by himself, inviting them to a luncheon in Adelaide next week and making entry to the luncheon conditional upon a $45 payment to the ALP. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Minister's answers to my question and my supplementary question, and in the information he provided following Question Time today, he has in fact ducked the central issue at question. Senator Tate has some ministerial responsibilities, including the canvassing of government legislative proposals and seeking public opinion on them. There is no question about that. But the central issue is: does he understand the difference between his responsibility in that respect and his desire to raise money for the ALP? This responsibility is not to be flirted with and misused simply to raise money for a candidate that Senator Tate made a promise to some time ago, which is in fact what the Minister says is the reason for this lunch. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Acting Deputy President, it might throw some light on the matter if I give you an indication of what the Minister said in his letter. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I will be visiting Adelaide on Thursday 11 June and I would like to invite you to be my guest&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I'd love to be someone's guest at $45 a head&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">at a luncheon to be held at the Terrace Hotel.</PARA>
<PARA>Being a guest and paying $45 is a bit of a misnomer. The Minister goes on to say that a number of policy issues are of interest and that he will be making a certain presentation. In particular, he says that he will be canvassing a number of legislative issues, including the Privacy Act, the Cash Transaction Reports Act and the proposed uniform credit laws. He goes on straight after that and says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am particularly interested in hearing a wide cross-section of views on the proposed credit legislation.</PARA>
<PARA>On his ministerial letterhead he writes to people saying, `Come to this lunch; I am the Minister responsible. I want to canvass some government legislative issues and the Government wants to hear what you have to say about them'. But he does not have the stomach to say anywhere in the letter, `By the way, it is a fund-raiser for the political party that I belong to'. He let someone attach a little pink slip that says, `Senator Tate's luncheon, PO Box 508, Plympton', with the almost unmentioned words, `Please make cheques payable to the Western Suburbs ALP'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The crucial question that has been put to the Minister, on which he has made no comment at all, is: does he understand the difference between his ministerial responsibilities and his desire to make money for the ALP? Does he understand the risk when those two merge? Has he read anything from the Fitzgerald royal commission about the sorts of problems people get into when the difference between those two responsibilities is misunderstood or when they overtly seek to merge them for their own benefit or for the benefit of their Party? Does the Minister understand those things? He seems to have made no comment about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point I want to make is that the Minister, in seeking to derive some humour from events that came to the attention of the Fitzgerald royal commission, came in here with a brown paper bag from which he produced the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Yellow Pages</EMPHASIS>. He would have us believe&mdash;he would succeed only if people had half a brain or a quarter of a brain&mdash;that that is where the address list for the legal profession in South Australia came from. The Minister must know that that is not true; if he does believe it is true, he must not have practised law for too long. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The letters are headed `Managing Director'&mdash;in this case of Clelands, a firm of which my husband is a partner&mdash;`DX163'. I do not know whether Senator Tate has ever practised law. If he has, he would know that DX is a document distribution system run by a crowd called Ausdoc. One has to become a member of Ausdoc to use this system. Instead of posting this legal firm a will and that legal firm a title to property or whatever, one just addresses it to its DX box; it is like a pigeon hole system. But one has to be a member to use it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The letters that the Minister has sent are addressed to DX163. I do not think the legal profession puts the DX numbers in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Yellow Pages</EMPHASIS>&mdash;they are not useful to anyone other than members of the DX system.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ausdoc is a national system. The question is: whose membership of Ausdoc did the Minister use to send around this invitation to a party fund-raiser that he, on the face of it, would have everyone believe is an invitation to participate in ministerial consultations?

Tomorrow is World Environment Day, which is being observed by many environmental and green community groups throughout Australia. On 22 December 1989 the United Nations decided to convene a two-week long United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, referred to as UNCED, in Brazil to coincide with World Environment Day, 5 June 1992, by resolution 44/228.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must correct the wording of my letter to the President. Yesterday, not today, marked the opening of the Earth Summit, which will go for two weeks in Rio de Janeiro. Its agenda will include the following items: an earth charter, which will include the principles for sustainable development, now being referred to as the Rio declaration; agenda 21, which will be an action plan to implement the principles of the earth charter; the signing of an international convention on biodiversity; the signing of an international convention on climate change; and possible agreement on a statement of principles on management of the world's forests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is possibly the largest single gathering in world history. The two years of preparation have revealed the priority given to this summit by all major nations in the world. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has let this opportunity for Australia to take its place, and maintain its place, as a world leader on environmental concerns pass us by, due to pragmatic and political involvement at home. One hundred world leaders are attending this conference in Rio, but our Australian Prime Minister is not. Australia is one of 12 countries classified as megadiverse&mdash;the only one of these on the north side of the north-south debate. I will dwell on that point later when I refer to the biodiversity convention. Australia has a unique potential for influence and we are not using it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In October 1991 the former Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, announced that he was attending UNCED in Rio, but the present Prime Minister, Mr Keating, has decided against attending. The Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories, Mrs Kelly, announced that she would be leading the Australian Government delegation to the Rio summit, accompanied by the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development, Mr Kerin, and the Minister for Resources, Mr Griffiths. Sir Ninian Stephen, leader of the Australian delegation to the preparatory committee meetings, will be a senior participant. A large group of 50 delegates, including State government representatives and non-government members from industry, unions, ACFOA and non-government conservation bodies, as well as the Opposition spokesman on the environment, Mr Chaney, will also be attending the conference. It falls to this delegation to reflect the kind of leadership that I would have hoped our Prime Minister would have given to our particular delegation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Phillip Toyne from the ACF has pleaded that this delegation take note of certain things. He said in passing:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whilst unfortunately Prime Minister Keating is not attending the Earth Summit, Australia's delegation should drop the "we will only if everybody else does" rhetoric, and take the lead to ensure full advantage is taken of the unique opportunity to protect our world into the future.</PARA>
<PARA>There is abundant recognition of this unique opportunity. In relation to the participation within the delegation, I am sad to report that we have not, even symbolically, given the importance to it that the delegation deserves. I have already mentioned my deep concern that the Prime Minister is not leading this delegation himself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looking at the membership&mdash;and I have already discussed it&mdash;we see that there are 27 males, 15 females and seven of unknown ascription of gender attending in this delegation on behalf of Australia. At the most optimistic estimate that the seven unknown delegates are women, we find an imbalance even in our gender basis for representation at that conference. It would make it 27 males to 22 females. When Australia has acknowledged throughout the world that women's impact on development issues is crucial, I think this may well be a reflection on the lack of commitment we are showing to very serious environmental issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased that the opportunity has arisen to discuss the Earth Summit which is currently being held. As I have said before, this summit is by far the most important gathering of the peoples of this planet for many years. If successful, it will provide a framework which can be used to guide us to a more sustainable future. Unfortunately, self-interest and indifference may thwart the opportunities presented by this gathering. Phillip Toyne yesterday issued a media release entitled `Threat to Earth Summit Potential' which stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The United Nations itself has declared the world now stands at the crossroads with regard to addressing the crucial environmental and development issues. The very survival of the earth as we know it is at stake. Preparatory sessions over the past two years have established solid progress on a framework for international co-operation and action on major issues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But when it came to the crunch, richer developed nations have failed to make the essential commitment to change their ways, and to encourage and enable poorer developing countries to participate in efforts to protect our world environment and pursue sustainable development.</PARA>
<PARA>Even President Bush from the United States is making a token visit to the conference. This visit was referred to by Mr Toyne rather aptly as a photo opportunity. Mr Toyne also took the opportunity to make particular criticism of the United States, which is one of the richest nations on earth and also one of the greatest polluters. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This lack of commitment is demonstrated, for example, by the refusal of the United States to be bound into reducing greenhouse gas emissions, even though that country alone contributes 25 per cent of carbon dioxide emissions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Australian context, the apparent indifference of the Prime Minister to this crucial summit is disappointing. Whilst the leaders of all the major industrialised nations are meeting to discuss ways of saving the planet, our Prime Minister remains in Australia to sort out factional disputes within his own Party and push through some predetermined deals on the airline industry and pay television. When viewed in the context of the planet, and more particularly from the viewpoint of many people living in poverty, this can only be likened to Nero fiddling while Rome burns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Government in the past would have been far more ready to respond to and initiate positive actions in relation to environmental issues as reflected in the international treaty for the protection of Antarctica. Both President Bush and the Prime Minister have failed to appreciate the interconnectedness of ecological and economic issues. What is required is a fundamental reappraisal of our lifestyles and consequently a greater appreciation by policy makers of the link between ecological and economic imperatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other important issue that arises out of the Earth Summit is the relationship between developing and industrialised nations in the context of repairing environmental damage. It is ironic that at this time in the history of human development, when technology has effectively diminished the size of the planet, we are at the same time beginning to appreciate that our lifestyle and technology is causing global and environmental problems of great significance. Whether we are talking about greenhouse gases, ozone depletion or acid rain, the fact remains that no-one can escape from the consequences of our collective actions. The planet really is very small and fragile. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am in no doubt that the various conventions that are being discussed will be raised by Senator Coulter from the Democrats as he also pursues this topic. But I would stress that our involvement in a positive way in response to the climate convention is commendable. We still need to maintain our leadership status in that regard. The bio-diversity strategy, as I mentioned before, is one where we are holding back by not being properly represented. Mega-diverse status means that, with 11 other countries, we hold 60 to 70 per cent of the world's species; all other 11 countries are developing nations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has a very important contribution to make to the north-south debate on environmental concerns. As I stated at the commencement of this speech, I find it disappointing that, when the opportunity for progress towards the sort of international agreements referred to is being negotiated, our Prime Minister remains in Australia to work on what are, in context, relatively inconsequential and passing issues. I therefore urge the Prime Minister to reconsider his position to attend the Earth Summit and, if he does so, to take a lead in promoting the development of international agreements that will work towards a truly sustainable future for the planet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator Aulich)</EMPHASIS>&mdash;I understand that informal arrangements have been made to limit the time for the debate today and that the speaking times during the debate will be as follows: as Senator Chamarette had 10 minutes, Senator Loosely as the Government speaker will get 10 minutes; Senator Brownhill as the Opposition speaker, 10 minutes; and then Senator Coulter as the Democrat speaker, 10 minutes. With the concurrence of the Senate, retrospectively of course, I have asked the clerks to set the clock at 10 minutes per speech. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to take issue with the propositions advanced by Senator Chamarette in this debate on a matter of public importance, although there is much by way of the remarks she made earlier with which I am in very considerable agreement. If we look at the terms of the MPI as advanced by Senator Chamarette, much of what has been introduced in the proposition is fair comment. There is no doubt, for example, that the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro does enjoy overwhelming, very broad support internationally, and there is no doubt also that the conventions that are being discussed, the detail of the work, is of great significance for humanity. I have no disagreement with that at all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I make the point that the Earth Summit ought not to be seen as the end product of international effort and endeavour in regard to the global environment. It ought to be seen as a way station in that process. The fact that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is not able to attend in no way reflects a lack of acknowledgment, interest or commitment in the matters that are before the gathering. I therefore argue that Senator Chamarette's criticism of the Prime Minister in this regard is unfair, particularly when we judge the Australian Government's record in environmental protection, safeguards and, I think it is fair to say, achievement. I think it is also unfair, given the Government's considerable policy initiatives over the past few weeks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look very briefly at the record of the Labor Government over recent years in protecting not only the Australian environment but also the international environment, I think we will see that it stands the most rigorous analysis, and by that I mean the most rigorous comparative analysis by international standards. Let us look at the record in terms of moving towards ecologically sustainable development; what the Government has been able to achieve on the priceless question of World Heritage listings, such as not allowing mining at Coronation Hill, for example, and protection of the Kakadu National Park environments; what we have been able to accomplish as a government virtually down the east coast of Australia and in Tasmania; our achievements in protecting endangered species through the endangered species program; our establishment of the wildlife protection unit; our response on issues of land degradation; our move specifically to broaden and consolidate the protection of the Great Barrier Reef; the landmark achievement in cooperation with the French, in particular, on Antarctica; and a whole range of issues locally and internationally. From that record we can see that the Government has been very forthright in its commitment and has moved in the face of considerable opposition from our political opponents in the Liberal and National parties and from some sections of the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has not been an easy war that has been waged to protect the Australian environment and to move internationally. That is also true of moves to try to improve the urban environment through initiatives on greenhouse gases and the ozone layer, on waste minimisation, on recycling and on industrial chemicals and hazardous waste. The list, Mr Acting Deputy President, as you are aware, is very long and, indeed, impressive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been no failure on the part of the Prime Minister to acknowledge the significance of the issues that are being debated in Rio. As a matter of fact, I think it is fair to draw the Senate's attention to the fact that in the background to UNCED Australia has been very active in various international forums on climate change, both scientific forums and political forums. We are heavily involved in the climate change worker bodies such as the Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change, the IPCC; the international geosphere and biosphere program; and the World Meteorological Organisation. The record there speaks for itself. There is no question about the commitment of the Australian Government. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am always interested to hear the coalition talking about the environment. It reminds me of Leonid Brezhnev's speeches where he used to endorse peace. The coalition comes very late to the equation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition is not in dispute with this matter of public importance raised by Senator Chamarette. The UN Earth Summit has been hailed as the world's biggest and most important meeting on global environmental problems and ecologically sustainable development. One hundred and fifty other nations thought it of sufficient import to support it at the highest levels. Leaders such as US President George Bush, British Prime Minister John Major and the German Chancellor, Helmut Kohl, all feel that this conference is of such vital concern to the future of the earth that they have found the time to attend.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's former Prime Minister&mdash;maybe the one that Senator Loosley, who is now leaving, did not vote for&mdash;agreed with his world colleagues, because Mr Hawke endorsed the conference warmly, claiming it was a crucial forum for the development of greater international cooperative efforts in solving the world's environmental problems. He planned to lead Australia's delegation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, Australia's current Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is different. He believes he knows better and that his time is far too important to waste talking with these particular world leaders. So Australia is sending a delegation of 49 rather than 50. Obviously, what we lack in quality we will make up for in quantity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look down the list of just who is going, our sentiments range from fear to anger. In the same week that the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories (Mrs Kelly) has been forced to publicly admit that she actually had not got around to reading an environment kit she so warmly endorsed twice, she is leading this delegation to Rio where it is likely she will have the opportunity to not read the great stack of material that will be put in front of her. I suggest that, if she had difficulty finding sufficient concentration powers to read the schools kit, the agenda papers for this conference will leave her right out of the discussions. In fact, she will be way out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moving down the list, we see that the next delegate is John Kerin, the man who, when he was Treasurer, could not explain his own press releases. Then we have Alan Griffiths, the real friend of the foresters and forests who could not even get his views past his own colleagues in his Cabinet. So he would be as real a winner for us in Rio as we could ever get. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Next we have Mrs Susan Lenehan, the South Australian Environment Minister, known locally in South Australia as the mouth from the south. Her ability to apply herself to portfolio detail is on a par with that of Mrs Kelly. She too has a great ambition for self-stardom. They should be a pretty good combination, I would suggest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This caravan of revellers is off to Rio on the public purse, at a cost of $1m, to make decisions that could seriously affect Australia's standing in the world and its ability to be competitive in that world. If it were not so serious it would be funny. The reality is that this conference could result in conventions which affect Australia's competitiveness. It could result in a large transfer of funds from the North to the South without any real benefit. It could be an acrimonious contest between the developed and the developing world.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The convention on climate change is significant for Australia. As a major coal producer we are vulnerable to any change in international climate change policies. We are also sensitive to the need to address global warming issues. Cabinet has already agreed to the signing of this convention, which commits industrialised and emerging former communist nations to limit greenhouse gas emissions. The Opposition has expressed concern that we ought not to be committed to any convention in which we would disproportionately bear the brunt. We are concerned that the Government may well be locking us into an agreement that will impact on Australia's efficiency and competitiveness. In many ways we more closely resemble a developing nation than a developed nation but in international agreements we are regarded, of course, as a developed nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian business has expressed similar concern, and it needs to be listened to. ACIL Australia quite recently announced the results of two studies which suggest that the cost of Australia's commitment under this convention would be two or three times higher than previously estimated and more costly to Australia than to any other country. The report found that Australia would lose 10 times more in GDP than the United States, eight times more than the European Community, and 40 times more than Canada, which has a similar economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Too often people and groups fail to recognise the simple principle that it costs money to save the earth. If the economy is not sound, if business is not viable and strong, then environmental obligations cannot be paid for. The Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Button, who is at the table, said that himself. We have to be able to afford to pay to look after our environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Government of which Senator Button is a part has claimed that its endorsement of all proposals before the summit would be contingent upon domestic economic circumstances. That is all well and good, but does the delegation we have sent to Rio have the capacity or the clout to push that or any agenda for Australia? I suggest it does not have the clout; nor does it have the capacity to push those issues in that forum. How will our three go against the Bushes and the Majors of the world? If our people do not have the clout or the ability, why are we even bothering to send them?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not often endorse sentiments expressed by the Australian Conservation Foundation, but its Executive Director, Phillip Toyne, summed up the coalition's attitude very well when he said this morning:</PARA>

It is a logical stupidity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In moving a notice of motion today, I drew attention to the fact that last year the mala, the rufous hare wallaby, became extinct on the mainland of Australia. Australia has a shocking record of extinction of species, and for Senator Loosley to say that we have a good record in this sphere is not true. For seven years, successive Labor governments have promised to introduce national, comprehensive, Federal legislation to protect endangered species. It was promised again for this session of Parliament. We are yet to see that legislation. The amount of money being spent in that area is absolutely paltry. It will go nowhere to reverse the incredibly bad record that Australia has&mdash;in terms of the extinction of species it has one of the worst records in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to greenhouse gas reduction, Senator Loosley again mentioned Australia's membership of the IPPC. On two separate occasions the scientific committee of the IPPC has said that we need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 60 to 80 per cent as rapidly as possible; that is its recommendation. What have we heard from the Government? We have been told that it might reduce the greenhouse gas emissions from Australia by 20 per cent if it does not cost very much. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday, Senator Button sought to rubbish the suggestion that we might move more firmly in this direction by pointing to the coal industry and the aluminium industry. While the rest of the world will progressively demand less and less coal because of its concern about the greenhouse effect, this Government, aided and abetted by the Opposition, would lock us into a situation where we spend most of our energy research funds on coal. It would invest large amounts in mines for the exploitation of coal&mdash;a commodity which is attracting a lower and lower price per tonne on world markets&mdash;and lock us into further environmental damage and into a situation where most of our investment funds will go into industries that are not sustainable in the long run, even on economic grounds. The Government has failed to recognise that the economy is underscored by these environmental matters and that we must pay attention to environmental matters first and not afterwards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important for Australia to take a leadership role. We find a good example of that when we look at the actions of Senator Chamarette's predecessor in relation to the Antarctic. It will be recalled that when Jo Vallentine first moved in this place that Australia should not sign the CRAMRA agreement and should seek a World Park status for the Antarctic, the motion, which was supported by the Democrats, was opposed by both the Government and the Opposition. A few weeks later Mr Howard was up in Queensland and must have had some strange feeling that there were votes in being seen to be green, as he suggested that the Opposition might change its view. The Opposition came back about a fortnight later and suggested that the Antarctic might be saved. We had a further debate after which the Opposition, the Democrats and Senator Vallentine voted together. Again, the Government voted against the motion on the grounds that Australia alone could not do very much. Several weeks later the Government did a backflip and said, `Yes, we will try'. What has happened since? We now have a 50-year agreement in relation to the protection of the Antarctic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia can play a very important role. I believe that Australia should play an even more important role, namely, a leadership role. It is simply untrue that we cannot meet the very, very modest greenhouse targets that have been suggested&mdash;the 20 per cent reduction in greenhouse gases&mdash;without damage to the economy. We can meet those targets and do better, and at the same time develop in Australia technologies and industries which the rest of the world will need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday we debated a Bill which seeks to amend the Ozone Protection Bill. In that debate I pointed out that we should be developing an alternative refrigeration industry and moving the technology quite aggressively into Asia and many other under-developed countries.

This provided an excellent reference point for monitoring the changes which are occurring so rapidly in the region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The delegation met the leaders of each country&mdash;in most cases the President, Prime Minister and Foreign Minister. In Poland we met President Lech Walesa, leader of Solidarity, and a leading figure in history as the man who began the fight  against communism which led to its downfall. The success of Solidarity encouraged public expressions of opposition by dissident movements in the other countries of the region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The political and economic problems facing each of the countries cannot be over-estimated. Lech Walesa put it succinctly when he told us that he much regretted that there was no historic blueprint for the conversion from a communist command system to a market economy. Each country now faces a catch 22. Without a stable political environment, foreign investors will be discouraged: without foreign investment to assist in the funding of economic recovery, political instability is bound to continue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The evidence of a depressed economy is nowhere more evident than in Lodz, a large industrial centre in central Poland. Incidentally, Lodz is the birthplace of Senator Spindler, who I am sure will want to contribute regarding the delegation's visit there. In Lodz we saw block after block of factories which had closed down. Unemployment exceeds 30 per cent. The social and political consequences of such high levels of unemployment weigh heavily on the country's leaders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lodz used to be the main centre in Poland for the processing of Australian wool. Our market in Poland for wool has collapsed. The city is perhaps typical of the plight of industry throughout eastern Europe. Its manufacturing plant and processes are outmoded and inefficient. Without substantial investment in new plant and technology, there is little prospect that Polish industries can successfully compete in world markets. Without investment, there are no funds to purchase raw materials or to provide jobs. It is a downward spiral.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the disastrous legacies of the communist regimes has been the destruction of the environment. The promotion of heavy industry&mdash;fuelled mainly by the inefficient burning of brown coal&mdash;has caused high levels of polluted air and has poisoned rivers. Forests have been destroyed by acid rain. However, there does seem to be a commitment by the current governments to try to solve these problems. For example, in Hungary the delegation visited the regional environment centre for central and eastern Europe, which is dedicated to this purpose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The safety of the Soviet-built reactors in the nuclear power stations dotted throughout eastern Europe is cause for great concern. For example, still operating in Bulgaria is one of the world's&mdash;if not the world's&mdash;most dangerous nuclear power plant. The authorities are aware of the danger, but, such is their desperate need for electricity, the reactors simply cannot be closed down unless there is massive Western assistance in the provision of alternative sources of energy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In all the countries there is a general commitment to the development of a market economy. However, there are significant difference between political parties and the countries themselves regarding the nature and pace of such change. There is no doubt that economic reforms are, and will continue to be, painful. There is concern that loss of faith in the benefits to be won from reform may result in the return to power of the communists. This is not an unjustified fear. After recent elections in Poland, the renamed communists are the second largest party in the Parliament, and in the second free election held in Bulgaria the communists were only narrowly defeated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The disintegration of the Soviet Union has had a marked impact on east and central Europe. Most of the former Soviet satellites were dependent on the Soviet Union for more than 50 per cent of their trade. That trade has now evaporated. Not only have the countries to change their political focus, but also they have to change their trade relationships. Those we met in each country were strong in their conviction that they must gain full membership of the European Community as soon as possible. While Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary have been granted a phased associate membership of the EC, it is likely that full membership will not be granted quickly or easily. There is certainly no shortage of countries wishing to be members of the EC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The long years of communist domination served to contain simmering nationalist rivalries among the various ethnic groups in each country. With the downfall of the communist governments and the lifting of social repression, ethnic tensions have come to the surface. In some cases those tensions have boiled over&mdash;as has occurred in Yugoslavia and several former Soviet republics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Hungary's interest in the Hungarian minority in Romania continue to strain relations between those two countries. Czechoslovakia is threatened with partition by calls for Slovak independence. Elections to be held throughout Czechoslovakia this Saturday will indicate the future direction of the country in this respect. Ethnic tensions throughout the region make the implementation of political and economic reforms all the more difficult.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On a brighter note, I was amazed by the obvious benefits of the changes since my previous visit. Three years ago in Prague, for example, there was a general air of repression, despondency and resentment. The change in the meantime has been remarkable. Shops are open and well-stocked, tourists are everywhere and the pervading atmosphere is of a city coming back to life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With so much to offer, tourism will certainly play a major role in the recovery of the countries we visited. It will bring benefits both as a direct source of foreign exchange and by encouraging foreign investment in tourist facilities. It will also provide employment in the construction and operation of hotels and other tourist services. Strangely, however, many of those to whom we spoke seemed not so impressed by the potential of tourism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In all places we visited, Australia was well regarded. Our reputation as a destination for migrants and as a haven for displaced persons following the Second World War and subsequent political crises is well known. Australia's assistance thus far has been small, but I believe well-targeted. Australia is a member of the OECD Group of 24 which co-ordinates economic assistance to eastern Europe to sustain the momentum of the reforms. We have taken a one per cent shareholding in the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, representing a grant of $45m over 5 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1990 we also established a $5m training program for east and central Europe under which participants from several countries undertake training in Australia in management and related areas. The success of this program has led to its expansion this year with a revised budget of $9.5m.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will be important for exchange visits by parliamentarians, Ministers, officials and business groups to continue to ensure that the good relations are maintained. To ignore the plight of east and central Europe during its current difficulties will be to our long term cost. I believe we are on the right track in this regard. As honourable senators would remember, only last week we received visits from delegations from Poland and Romania. Amongst others, we have also received visits from Chairman Dubcek, the President of the Polish Senate, the Polish Foreign Minister and the Hungarian Minister for Education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to acknowledge the valuable contributions made during the visit by all members of the delegation: Senator Panizza and Senator Spindler, and our colleagues from the House of Representatives, the Deputy Leader of the delegation, the Hon. Michael MacKellar, the Hon. Laurie Brereton, Dr Richard Charlesworth, Mr Noel Hicks and the Hon. Stewart West. During a very full and tiring program&mdash;so ably arranged for us by the parliaments of each country, assisted by their diplomatic representatives in Australia&mdash;we were fortunate to be accompanied throughout the visit by Mrs Brereton, Mrs Hicks, Mrs Panizza, Mrs Spindler and Mrs West.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On behalf of the delegation, I express our appreciation of the assistance in planning the visit by the Parliamentary Relations Office, particularly Keiran Schneemann and Dalma Dixon, and during the visit by the Australian Ambassador in each country and his staff&mdash;despite the difficulties of small posts and limited resources. My thanks also go to the delegation secretary, Rob Alison, and to my own staff members, Fred Peppinck and Julie Hatcher.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA>I wish to comment briefly on the report of the parliamentary delegation to Poland, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria and Hungary. I felt privileged for two reasons to be a member of that delegation. Firstly, we are certainly aware of the momentous changes that are taking place in eastern Europe at the moment as the countries in that region are struggling to emerge from the long years under a socialist regime and to move towards an individualistic and free market economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, as the President has mentioned, it gave me an opportunity to see Lodz again, the town of my birth. More than that, due to the courtesy of the leader of the delegation and Polish officials, it was possible for me to actually find the house in which I was born and visit the factory that my grandfather occupied decades ago as part of the textile industry in Lodz, which was established 200 years ago by German migrants contracted by the King of Poland to do just that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That leads me straight away to the issues we were considering. When we visited a textile factory, after looking at the cloth they produced, which was superb in quality, we engaged some of the staff in questions on marketing. We found that they were almost totally ignorant of markets in the West, how to handle exports and what prices they could obtain. I certainly came away with the view that they had a long way to go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the thoughts that was in my mind throughout the visit by the delegation, and which took hold even on that first day, is that I wish them well in those endeavours, in particular in finding the right balance between a market economy and the human values of social support, without which a civilised society cannot exist. As I watched them, they were talking about and sometimes acting as though they were going helter-skelter into a totally deregulated community, and I thought of the debates in this Parliament to find just such a balance. I hope that they will not throw out the baby with the bath water. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also recall our meeting with the Chairman of the Parliamentary Committee of Foreign Affairs in Poland, Mr Geremek, who forecast that there would be a multi-party model in existence in Poland before long. I note in the report some concerns expressed by the members of the delegation about the electoral system to be used&mdash;the proportional system. I do not share their concerns. I commend this system to the Senate and, indeed, to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two national treasures in Hungary that I would like to name. One of them is the refurbished Parliament House, which is a superb example of architecture and decoration. The other is a person, Mr John Charody, who is an Australian of Hungarian extraction and our Austrade representative in Hungary. Watching Mr Charody operate in Hungary and listening to the comments offered about him, I could not think of a better person to represent Australia's trading and economic interests in Hungary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One other person I wish to mention is Mr Imre Pozsgay. Mr Pozsgay was a politician during the socialist regime, but was instrumental in opening the borders to people who wanted to cross them within Europe. I think it was this action of opening the Hungarian borders which precipitated the falling of the wall in Berlin. Mr Pozsgay is a survivor. I was glad to see him there. It is individuals such as Mr Pozsgay who are prepared to take risks who will lead Europe into a better future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Bulgaria it struck me that, while it was certainly the most backward country economically, it had an interesting political process. Bulgaria had three different governments in almost as many years. It did not happen as a result of a revolution or elections. What happened was that people took to the streets, those in government got the message and resigned, and other people took their places. Bulgaria will be one of the most vibrant countries in Europe soon. One of the highlights of the trip to Bulgaria was our trip to Plovdiv, an ancient town where we saw recently excavated Roman ruins and, on the way back, we visited the Bachkovo Monastery, which gave us the message that one does not need a lot of money to be happy and lead a worthwhile life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Czechoslovakia gives the indication even now, after a long period of stagnation, of being a nation that can uphold with a degree of vigour its cultural and intellectual tradition&mdash;a position it has occupied in Europe for many years. The fact that the Czechs can elect a philosopher and writer, Mr Havel, as their President, gives some idea of the orientation of the population as a whole. Our visit to the university in Prague bore witness to that. Also, I had great pleasure in greeting again here in Australia the present Ambassador, Her Excellency Yara Mozorova, whom we met during our trip to Czechoslovakia. It should be noted that she, too, is an academic and, apart from being a surgeon, a translator of some note. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also worthwhile noting that in Slovakia, the other part of the Czech Republic, we saw and heard that the large armament factories geared up to produce thousands of tanks were trying somewhat desperately to turn weapons into ploughshares, but not finding it particularly easy. In fact, on one occasion they had been urged by a delegation of Americans&mdash;and I am not sure whether they were businessmen or representatives of the Government&mdash;to continue with their production of tanks. Personally, I have great confidence that the Czechs will have more sense than that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, at this stage I wish to pay tribute to the sensitive leadership and the insistence on organisation that you brought to this delegation. Without that leadership and sensitivity, and without your contacts in Europe, we would not have had the access to the top levels of government that we had which made this trip worth while at that, and also the social, levels. Even my old sparring partner, Senator Panizza, and I got on famously after the first day or two, and the feeling of cooperation and good sense prevailed throughout that delegation's visit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would be remiss if I did not mention Rob Alison, Fred Peppinck and Julie Hatcher who supported us well at all times, as did the ambassadors and the staff of our embassies. As you said, Mr President, the embassies are somewhat under-resourced, but they never failed to provide us with the services that we need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I close by adding two comments. I have already made one comment&mdash;that a balance needs to be found between social concerns and a market economy. The second concerns the depth of environmental degradation, and solutions must be found for that. I look with some hope to the future of Europe, particularly as I read last week that France and Germany had created a joint army corps. That augurs well for the future of Europe and we can look forward to a future that is not as blood drenched as was the past. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I will speak briefly to your report of the parliamentary delegation to Poland, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria and Hungary. I will deal with the points of interest that I found in Eastern Europe. All the other points relating to the new-found democracy have been covered by you and Senator Spindler, so I will briefly state my interest in the fields of agriculture, transport and housing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, you know, but others may not, that I was surprised at the differences between the state of agriculture of the four countries we visited. Having spent 45 years under communism, one would think that the advancement of agriculture, secondary industry and any other industry in those countries would be roughly the same. However, they were as diverse as the numbers of places we visited. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was surprised to see how advanced the agriculture of Poland is and what a fertile country it is. Perhaps I was neglectful in not reading up on a lot of that stuff before I went. I was very surprised that, having had 45 years of communism, the Polish have developed agriculture to where it now is&mdash;and that is allowing for the fact that they have run mostly communes, state owned farms or whatever term one chooses. Wheat growing is fairly well advanced, with modern varieties and, surprisingly, modern machinery and methods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We visited a state farm not far from Warsaw which employs 115 people in all. While talking to the experts that day we could see what they were producing. They were productive&mdash;they had modern varieties of cereals and other horticultural products&mdash;but they would not have been making a great profit from the place because of its overemphasis on labour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was also surprised at the level of education of farm workers and farm operators at that place. Even under communism, the Polish have made a certain advancement. One thing I did find throughout eastern Europe is how educated the people are compared to what I thought they might have been under 45 years of communism. Communism probably supplied employment to those countries&mdash;everyone seemed to have a job. That is part of the dogma of communism. Communism also provided a fair share of the advancement of education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Poland was well up with current trends in agriculture. There is also a big swing back to privatising the land. Families that used to own land are encouraged to reclaim their old holdings, if they are interested in them, and restart private enterprise farming. They are very interested in doing so and are, in fact, doing it. In Czechoslovakia the advancement of agriculture is not quite as great as in Poland. There is not the great interest in returning to private farming that there is in Poland. The Czechs' attitude is, `We have the big government farms, what's the use of breaking them down?'. Nevertheless, their production seemed to be quite okay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The delegation then moved to Bulgaria, which was like moving back 60 years in terms of agriculture and almost everything else. Strip farming was still the norm and donkeys were pulling carts. There were 30 or 40 people working together on strip farming the fields. To me it was very depressing. Probably 50 or 60 years ago the Bulgarians were reasonably advanced in their agriculture, but they have obviously let it go backwards. For example, just driving along the highways one could see that those farms must have lacked fertiliser for the last 45 or 50 years under communism. Fences were disappearing or non-existent. The farms were totally backward and it must be very depressing to work in such an environment. The last country we visited was Hungary. I believe that agriculture there is pretty well advanced in terms of modern methods and modern machinery. As you pointed out, Mr President, Hungary is almost a westernised country and there are plenty of well-stocked shops in the cities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other area which I am very interested in is housing, whether it be single housing or condominium housing. In Poland, Bulgaria and, to a certain extent, Czechoslovakia I found big concrete housing blocks which were nothing but pigeon holes. From memory, each was 10 to 15 stories high and 100 to 200 metres long. Such structures, three or four deep, continued for many kilometres. That would be a very depressing environment to live in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were told a story about children starting school. The teacher told them to draw a car, but they drew it as a plan&mdash;in other words, looking down at it from above. Unfortunately, without open spaces for these children to play in before school days, they are only able to view such things from above, in their homes. That is the sort of concept that came through. It was very depressing. I certainly hope that it will not be too many years before they have different housing from what they now have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Spindler pointed out, while we were in Poland we visited a wool mill. Even though the most modern piece of machinery was at least 30 years old, it was putting out a good product. The Polish do not have the money to set up new factories. However, I can see an opportunity for joint ventures between, for example, Australia, which has the wool and a big stockpile; Poland, which has the willing labour to work those factories; and Japan or Italy, which have the technology to build a modern wool factory. We could get together in a tripartite joint venture and set up something like that. That certainly could develop as a result of the trip. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We spoke to members of the governments of these countries and they all told us that they would get their economies going again when Russia can buy again. A lot has happened to Russia in the last 12 months, so it is not really in a position to help out these other countries. After 45 years of communism I just could not believe that they still want anything to do with the USSR. One after another, they said, `If only Russia can start buying again, our economy will pick up'. I am afraid that with events in Russia over the last 12 months, they will have to look in other directions to get their economies going. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I appreciated the cooperation amongst the eight delegates and their wives and the back-up advisers from the President's staff. Relationships could have become very strained, but in a delegation like that it is marvellous how much common ground people can find. Senator Spindler and I could not be further apart in ideology, but we found some common ground. I appreciated it as I appreciated the company of all other delegates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would especially like to thank you, Mr President, for the way that you headed the delegation. As Senator Spindler said, if it was not for your presence as President of the Senate leading such a delegation, we would not have been able to get doors opened to the places that we visited. I thank you and your staff, including the Black Rod, Fred Peppinck, who has had a few mentions in despatches lately, and Julie Hatcher. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also thank all those posts in the countries we visited that helped us to the utmost, especially the post in Poland that is badly in need of new housing. Perhaps the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Evans) could take that on board and provide something. There are many emigration applications in Poland and I understand that, even in winter, people are queuing up in the streets for their appointments. I urge the Minister for Foreign Affairs to look at the idea of upgrading that post. I also thank the post in London that welcomed us at the airport and despatched us back on the plane home. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report I have just tabled presents the results of an examination of the financial and administrative relationships between Medicare and Medibank Private.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee undertook the inquiry in response to ongoing criticism, particularly by representatives of voluntary health organisations, of the joint administration of these functions by the Health Insurance Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Concerns have often been raised about the extent to which the current system fairly and accurately apportions costs between the two functions. Questions about the division of assets and possible cross subsidisation of Medibank Private by Medicare have also arisen.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The inquiry was brief. Only two submissions were received by the closing date&mdash;one from the Health Insurance Commission and one from the Australian Health Insurance Association. Each was subsequently invited to comment on the other's submission and the input of the Australian National Audit Office was also sought.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Having considered the evidence presented, the Committee was persuaded that the current cost apportionment system meets the requirements of predictability, administrative simplicity and equity in the distribution of total costs between Medicare and Medibank Private. While some preciseness at the lowest level of cost may be sacrificed, the Committee is satisfied that the present system accurately and fairly distributes total costs between the two functions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee was not persuaded by the evidence presented to the inquiry that cross-subsidisation occurs. It noted, in this regard, that the Health Insurance Commission, Medibank Private and Medicare are subject to regular audit by the ANAO. The auditing process includes scrutiny of the cost apportionment and asset rental systems. If instances of cross subsidisation were noted by the audit process they would be reported by the ANAO to the Parliament. In the absence of such reports the Committee was unable to substantiate allegations of cross subsidisation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee notes, however, that this inquiry did not consider the broader questions raised by the AHIA. These include the viability of Medibank Private and the extent to which it complies with the requirements of the National health act. Similarly questions of policy, such as whether Medicare should reimburse the Commissioner for Taxation for collection costs fell outside of the scope of the present inquiry. A separate inquiry could address these issues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Despite the brevity of the inquiry and the report, the Committee considers that the process has been a valuable one, as it has provided a forum in which these long standing concerns could be aired and counter arguments presented.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I was saying before the debate on the Repatriation Institutions (Staff) Bill 1991 and Veterans' Entitlements (Provision of Treatment) Amendment Bill 1991 was adjourned earlier this afternoon, the problem relating to this issue has been one of timing. My first reaction was that the Australian Democrats should oppose this Bill. However, I discussed the issue further with a large number of people who got in touch with my office. I then sought, as is usual, views from the community and particularly from those organisations throughout Australia which are most interested in this&mdash;the veterans' organisations. It quickly became obvious that this was not a black and white issue; it was not a yes or no issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was no uniformity in the opinions expressed to me by these people; there was a wide range of views and concerns, even within individual veterans' organisations. Some members were in favour of integration, others were vehemently opposed. However, when all of this was put together, one common thread emerged. The deciding factor had nothing to do with the organisation or the interests of the veterans but, rather, with the State they came from. Where they lived made the difference as far as their opinions were concerned. In my State of South Australia the veterans groups strongly opposed the integration of Daw Park, while the greatest majority of submissions I received from New South Wales urged the Democrats to urgently support the legislation so that the integration of Concord hospital could go ahead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I therefore proposed to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys) late last year that the transfers take place on a State by State basis; that hospitals other than Concord and Hobart be specifically written out of the legislation. I understand that that is where we would have ended up in that the negotiations have to proceed with the State governments. My State did not want anything to happen until 1995, which is the generally agreed date when negotiations can proceed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With this in mind, I began to look at some of the problems. Obviously, one of the biggest problems was that the RSL was still not prepared for any integration anywhere. I set about a further lengthy round of consultations with veterans' organisations and a number of individual veterans. Consultation continued through late 1991 and into the early months of 1992. Since November 1991 I have been in constant discussion with the TPI Association of South Australia and have spoken on quite a number of occasions now to the members of the Consultative Council of Ex-Service Organisations in South Australia, which represents 21 ex-service organisations in that State. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In February and again in April this year I visited New South Wales to talk to the veterans groups there, including the Vietnam Veterans Association. Throughout the year I have had discussions in my Parliament House office with representatives from ADVASC, the War Widows Guild, the Regular Defence Force Welfare Association and the RSL. I also spoke to officers from Concord hospital. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very surprised at some of the comments Senator Newman made earlier suggesting that somehow the veterans are being pushed or railroaded or moved against their will into these arrangements. As early as February this year, I think it was, the New South Wales RSL told me that it had already negotiated 20 of the 21 points that were of concern to it before it moved towards agreeing to the transfer of Concord repatriation hospital. I did not detect at any stage, particularly in New South Wales, even the slightest hint that this was going ahead against its will. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The RSL went through many of the problems in New South Wales specific to Concord, including issues such as the length of time veterans had to spend travelling if they needed to go to the hospital and particularly the inconvenience for family and friends of veterans who had to go to Concord, in some cases from as far away as Gosford and the Blue Mountains. From a hospital executive I heard how essential it was that Concord be integrated into the State system if it was to remain comparable with other teaching hospitals in New South Wales and if the standard of veterans' care was to be maintained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Professor J.A. Young, Dean of the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Sydney, wrote to me of the major role Concord plays in undergraduate teaching at the university because of a particular case mix which offers a different and particularly valuable educational environment for undergraduate students. He assured me that the university considered that the transfer of Concord into the State system was the only way to guarantee the long term sustained existence of the clinical school within the hospital, the maintenance of its present high standards, and the delivery of health to the inner west of Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have also received a copy of the signed staffing agreement between the hospital-based staff, the unions and the staff association at Concord and the Commonwealth of Australia in relation to the transfer. I have had the opportunity to discuss this issue at length with a union representative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of this is quite contrary to what I found in South Australia. It is directly opposite to the situation in South Australia, in that we have a small State&mdash;one where veterans already have ready access in country areas and outer metropolitan areas because there are so many veterans who still live within easy reach of the Daw Park Repatriation Hospital. They are more than happy to continue going there for their treatment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As for the other States, there seems to be absolutely no interest on anybody's part in Western Australia and that includes the Government. In Queensland, I detected some interest in transfer but certainly not enough to move in that direction at this time. In Victoria, I have had only opposition from those people who have contacted me. All of these discussions further highlighted the different needs in different States. So it was obvious that we could not go ahead in any way other than a way that made it very clear that the only hospitals to move at this point were the two that were ready&mdash;Hobart and Concord in Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the legislation is blocked in the Senate, New South Wales and Tasmania will be severely disadvantaged. If we were to accept Senator Newman's proposed amendments&mdash;with which I am quite familiar because they are the same as the amendments that I had drawn up and circulated on 6 May and which proved to be unsatisfactory&mdash;this would delay the transfer of Concord and Hobart until further negotiations could get under way with the State governments in terms of anything being signed before October this year. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8U4">Senator LEES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome that interjection. The hurry is that the veterans in New South Wales, and certainly in Tasmania, wish to proceed to the next stage now. This involves the actual formal arrangements, as we are so close, particularly in Tasmania, to getting staff agreement and staff involvement. I do not think the veterans there would be very happy at all with a further delay. In fact, my advice is that the New South Wales RSL contacted Senator Newman as late as yesterday assuring her that they wanted the process to go ahead without further delay.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just to go back a couple of months, even though it had become very obvious to us that we had to go on a State by State basis, our problem was that the RSL did not agree with that. Even though individuals and branches were saying one thing, the national body still had a motion on its books. Every time the proposal went to the national body it had been turned down. We recognise the RSL as a peak negotiating body for veterans. We believed that our hands were tied. We certainly could not vote, as we will today, unless the RSL was happy. Therefore, I took it upon myself on 27 February to write to the National Secretary, Captain Robert Ray, setting out our proposal to transfer the hospitals on a State by State basis. I asked him for the views of members on this at its national congress, which was to be held the following week. I seek leave to table a copy of my letter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Unfortunately, at this particular meeting the issue was not able to be discussed. However, within a week or two of my letter being received, the South Australian branch of the RSL proposed that an extraordinary national congress be held on 21 April 1992 to specifically discuss this matter. The outcome of this extraordinary national congress meeting was that the RSL accepted the principle of integration of RGH hospitals into the State health system on a State by State basis, with State branches being authorised to negotiate satisfactory settlements with their own State governments and Federal Government representatives in the States, providing that there was a guarantee by the Federal Government and each State government about priority of access given to the State and private health systems for veterans and war widows. That all relates to whether that priority is medically justified. I would also like to table a copy of that letter from the RSL informing me of results of that special national congress.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I intend to move amendments when we reach the committee stage of this Bill proposing that the transfer of the repatriation hospitals in Concord, New South Wales, and the RGH effectively go ahead because they have been taken off the list of repatriation hospitals. I have also listed repatriation auxiliary hospitals as they will also need some time to discuss and debate their future and to have involvement of the veterans' communities in their States.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am aware that some people still have concerns&mdash;that is quite understandable&mdash;in particular about the private patient principles, but I believe that we have reached the point where we really are as close as we can possibly be at this time to fully satisfying the requirements of the veterans in the various States. The monitoring committees will be set up to effectively oversee the transfer of these two hospitals and will quickly identify any problems which may be developing. In addition, the veterans' organisations in all the other States will be watching very closely what happens in New South Wales and Tasmania and will put further pressure on their governments, on the Federal Government and on the hospitals themselves to make sure that everything goes 100 per cent according to plan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I stress that the private patient principles are a disallowable instrument. I believe that the Parliament will be able to exercise sufficient control to ensure that veterans receive the best possible deal they can on the issue of integration. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we are finally debating the Repatriation Institutions (Staff) Bill 1991 and the Veterans' Entitlements (Provision of Treatment) Amendment Bill 1991. As you, Mr Deputy President, and those of us who have been waiting for this debate to come forward are aware, these Bills come to the Senate after a very considerable delay&mdash;a delay which has been caused by the failure of this Government to adequately take into account the needs of the veterans in our community. I was very interested to hear about not only the amount of travelling and talks that my colleague from Tasmania has had&mdash;I was well aware of that&mdash;but also the amount of work that Senator Lees has done. Whilst I have not consulted as widely and at as much length as Senator Lees, I have certainly had discussions with RSL members in Tasmania and members of the TPI organisation over a great period and I can assure Senator Lees that their concerns were just as great as the ones that she has been made aware of.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These Bills were originally listed for introduction into the Parliament in June of last year. In fact, I had a speech ready which I have had to change because there have been a lot of changes since June last year. The Bills did not reach the House of Representatives until November. They were pushed through the House of Representatives in a great hurry on 12 November and were listed for debate in the Senate before the end of last year. However, as a result of the predictable cry of the outraged veteran community, the Government was obliged to reconsider its original legislation. The actions of the Government up until then were a distinct contradiction of the promise it had given the House of Representatives on 10 November 1988 by the Minister, who indicated that the integration would not occur until all the concerns of the ex-service community had been resolved. My colleagues Senator Newman and Senator Lees would also have to agree that up until that date there was plenty of concern by the ex-service community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister further claimed in 1988 this was an unequivocal guarantee from the Labor Government. These sentiments were subsequently endorsed by the then Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, who made a similar promise to the veterans during the last election campaign. Unfortunately, as is the case with a lot of these promises made by the Government, these words proved to be empty rhetoric and the veterans' community had to spend many months experiencing considerable concern about their future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Newman pointed out, the coalition has put forward two amendments to the present legislation which we believe will go further towards meeting the needs of the veterans' community. I remind the Government and members of the Senate of the coalition's position on repatriation general hospital integration as expressed in the Fightback package:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are . . . committed over time to the transfer of all Commonwealth repatriation general hospitals to the States. We will ensure that this process now under way does not diminish the quality of health care, nor the priority of access granted to veterans. This policy will be implemented in full consultation with the R.S.L. and other veterans' organisations.</PARA>
<PARA>This is, and always has been, the coalition's position. As I said earlier, we have now reached the point where the Government has decided that some means of discussion and consultation with the veterans' community is appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition indicated in November last year that we would oppose the Bills as they stood, as I think Senator Newman said earlier today. That opposition was based then on the unwillingness of the Government to provide either the Opposition or the ex-service community with details associated with the transfer of the hospitals. I remember that I had great difficulty trying to get some answers out of the Department of Veterans' Affairs in Hobart. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also believe that the Government failed to keep its promise that integration would not occur unless the ex-service community was satisfied. I can speak from personal experience after discussions with Mr Ken Alexander representing the RSL organisation in Hobart. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Definitely. I also had discussions with a former local government colleague of mine, former Alderman A.V.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thanks to the cooperation and discussions I had on Anzac Day with Mr Alexander and John O'Connor, who is well known for travelling around different services on Anzac Day, I received some information by fax today which will support the comments made during Senator Lees's speech when my colleague Senator Newman said, `What's the big hurry?'. I think Senator Lees is under the impression that things are moving very quickly in Hobart. Having read a copy of the letter from the Minister, Roger Groom, to Mr Humphreys, I can tell the Senate that they are not moving quickly at all. In his letter, Mr Groom said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You would be aware, however, that the transfer is subject to agreements on staffing, property transfers and leasing arrangements being in place.</PARA>
<PARA>He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Crown Solicitor is currently examining draft agreements on staff and property matters negotiated by DOH and DVA representatives. When this progress has been completed and those agreements have been signed by the State and the Commonwealth I agree that a joint press statement be released.</PARA>
<PARA>We know how things work between governments. This letter was dated 28 May. Quite frankly, I will be very surprised if all these matters are concluded before the October date that my colleague Senator Newman was talking about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the present Government has frequently underestimated the value of the contribution the ex-service community has made to our way of life. The provision of first-class health care services to the veteran community remains a national acknowledgment of the sacrifices made by our military personnel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that from time to time we should remind the Government, particularly one or two of its members, including the Prime Minister, of the promises that were made by former Prime Ministers Menzies and Chifley about veterans never being disadvantaged. We are also aware that since the First and Second World Wars, Australian service men and service women have also seen action in Korea, Malaysia, Vietnam and only last year in the Gulf. Even today our Government has committed Australian military personnel to a highly sensitive military environment in Cambodia. I heard on the radio yesterday that a United Nations peacekeeping force under the command of an Australian officer, which was endeavouring to deliver humanitarian supplies in Bosnia, came under attack from Serbian militia. As a result, one member of that force was killed. These are the sorts of risks that Australian armed service men and service women are experiencing, and no doubt will continue to experience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure that we in the Senate would agree that throughout these engagements our three Services have continued to display a standard of dedication to their duty which has become symbolic of our nation. All this means that unfortunately, as we live in a world which seems unable to exist without military turmoil, it is likely that there will be a need for repatriation services for some time to come. From information I have received&mdash;I took note that my colleague Senator Newman also used the same figures&mdash;the number of veterans and others entitled to medical treatment at repatriation general hospitals will not peak until 1995. It is likely that this predicted peak will not begin to fall until the year 2000. There is no doubt that there will be no great diminution of services until that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposal for the integration of repatriation health institutions with State health systems had its origins in a report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Review of the Repatriation Hospital System</EMPHASIS> which was conducted between March 1984 and June 1985. That review recommended major changes to the repatriation hospital system, including immediate increases in staff and equipment spending, extensive rationalisation and incorporation into the State hospital system. The Government forced the recommendations of the review in 1986 and further clarified its position in 1988. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a press release dated 14 August 1988, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys) gave an assurance that no final decisions would be taken if the RSL had reasonable cause for dissatisfaction with the arrangements proposed. It is a pity the Government did not see fit to honour those previous commitments. As a result of the RSL's concerns throughout the nation at the Government's legislation, which passed the House of Representatives in November last year, as I have already said, Brigadier Alf Garland, the President of the Returned Services League of Australia, was obliged to write to Minister Humphreys on behalf of the Australian veterans' community outlining 21 concerns in the existing legislation. That was in November last year. I note that Senator Lees said in relation to the Concord case that 20 of those matters had been cleaned up by February this year. Those 21 concerns were a clear indication that the veterans' community had not been consulted as was promised and had not been kept informed of the Government's actions. I think it is a disgrace that the veterans' community was obliged to contact the Minister with 21 concerns after the legislation had passed the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It appeared that the Government had realised that unless it were more forthcoming in providing details to the ex-service community, the legislation would have been lost. It was well known then that the Opposition intended to oppose the Bill. I believe Senator Lees also had made it pretty well known that unless things changed, the Democrats would be combining with the coalition to stop this legislation. As a result of the feeling that was around the community, we had a belated effort of cooperation from the Government which saw that more information should be provided to the Opposition and the ex-service community about the details of the transfer. Quite frankly, finding out what was going on was like getting blood out of a stone. As Senator Lees has said, it was important to the veterans in New South Wales, and particularly to those in my own State of Tasmania because we were being set up once again. As an island State, Tasmania is somewhat isolated and tends to be used for the testing of pilot schemes or as the guinea pig. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The integration of the repatriation general hospitals in Hobart and Concord, as has been said, is expected to occur this year. It is therefore imperative that this Parliament provides veterans and war widows in both Tasmania and New South Wales with legislative provisions to support the repatriation private patients scheme. Many people in Tasmania have come to me in a private capacity because they are very concerned about the integration of the repatriation hospital in Hobart. No doubt Senator Tate also has had thousands of people knocking on his door. Ignorance was bliss and a lot of the veterans were fed some sort of information along the way that was not correct. People of that age tend to be more fearful than younger people. Therefore, parliamentarians were at the receiving end of many of these concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I notice that the national executive of the RSL at last has recently decided not to oppose integration. I believe that it has even convinced Bruce Ruxton that things are okay; I suppose if he feels happy with it, obviously the Minister must have solved most of the problems that we have been concerned about. The RSL has instead suggested that individual ex-service communities in each State should be responsible for undertaking negotiations on the particular transfers, as they are in the best position to reflect the needs of their State members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be understood quite clearly, though, that although there is now greater acceptance of integration in the veterans' community, many veterans are still concerned as to what effect the loss of repatriation general hospitals will have on their future health care. The coalition believes that it is the responsibility of the Parliament to ensure that veterans' interests are fully protected by this legislation. As a result, the coalition is proposing two sets of amendments, which my colleague has already spoken about. These amendments will make it possible for the intention to transfer a particular hospital to be the subject of a disallowance in the Federal Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments will also make sure that the national treatment monitoring committee, which is the body set up by the Government to monitor the impact of integration on the health care of veterans, is open to public scrutiny. We believe there are different circumstances in different States and that the Government should be accountable to the Parliament for any negotiations which take place on a State by State basis with the veteran community before the transfer of any hospital occurs. This will provide the State veterans with the opportunity of having their concerns discussed in the Parliament should they wish to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second amendment concerning the national treatment monitoring committee is very important, given the Government's previous record in keeping veterans aware of proposed integration changes. If there is to be an informed debate on the impact of integration on veterans' health care, it is essential that the reports of that committee should be made available to both the public and the Parliament. This will provide a forum for monitoring the progress of integration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the main concerns expressed by Brigadier Garland to the integration package was the secrecy with which the Government handled this matter. In correspondence dated 6 March, Brigadier Garland expresses that concern to the Minister. An extract reads:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Item four is the linchpin of all negotiations as secrecy has been our main objection to the whole package. By secrecy I mean we have no indication as to the attitudes of State health authorities in relation to the acceptance of the many facets of integration contained in the package you have presented to the ex-service community. Nor are we privy to the contents of the Federal State agreements or proposed agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we require is a copy of any final draft agreement to be made available for perusal and comment prior to the signing of the same by State and Federal authorities. As in other matters we will respect the commercial in-confidence content cannot be disclosed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is unreasonable to expect the R.S.L. or other ex-service communities to accept many points on integration which you have put forward without us knowing they have been accepted unreservedly by State health authorities.</PARA>
<PARA>This quotation from Brigadier Garland details the overwhelming concern of the RSL and the veterans' communities towards ensuring that secrecy is removed and the veterans have full understanding and input on integration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concern is also reflected by both amendments put forward by the coalition. It is therefore dependent upon the Government to support those amendments. Not to do so would be further evidence of the real lack of commitment to the veteran community by the Government. It will then be dependent upon this Parliament to attend to the concerns of veterans as they arise through the integration process. As a coalition, we have always been concerned to ensure that it is the needs of the veterans' community which are considered the most important aspect of this protracted debate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think my friend and colleague Senator Calvert has just finished his speech on the correct note, which is to emphasise the focus on the needs of the veteran community for health care, in particular, and medical treatment. I believe that if we, as politicians in the Federal Parliament, keep that focus clearly in mind, then we will understand that the needs of an ageing veteran community are changing and that there is a desire amongst many of them to be treated in a hospital which is closer to their homes and, therefore, closer to their families and friends and the normal support of the communities in which they live.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is an example of the phenomenon that we are trying to deal with by this legislation. I believe it is very good that the Senate, after many months&mdash;maybe it is years&mdash;of dealing with and grappling with this particular matter, is coming very largely to a tripartisan support for the Bill before us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that is important for another reason raised by Senator Calvert, that is, that the ageing veteran community is naturally fearful and easily led into concerns and anxieties. Perhaps it is a bit unfair to say that it is easily led; but by misinformation, partial information or lack of adequate information, its concerns and anxieties are raised. The concerns of the veteran community would be emphasised or exacerbated if it thought that in the future this arrangement could be undone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, it is very important and very gratifying that in the chamber this afternoon we have had expressions of acceptance anyway of this proposal which should therefore give a firm foundation for the matter to go ahead. It is, in any case, in accordance with the policy over time, I agree, of the Opposition parties and of the present Government. I think `acceptance' would be the word to use also in relation to the Democrats in this matter. But that acceptance is important and will give a confidence to the ageing veteran community in this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Acting Deputy President, as you will know, these Bills and the proposed repatriation private patient principles provide continuing Commonwealth responsibility for the arrangement of veterans' health care, an unequivocal requirement on the Repatriation Commission to provide for timely hospitalisation based solely on medical need, effective monitoring arrangements, and a range of staff guarantees agreed with the ACTU and DVA unions. Of course, that is spoken in very general terms. But, as has been pointed out by all the contributors to the debate this afternoon, each State will have its own emphasis and differences, and integration should only occur when local arrangements and sufficient understanding is reached between the governments, Federal and State, and the veterans' community concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why the noting in the repatriation private patient principles of the composition and role of these monitoring committees&mdash;the national treatment monitoring committee, for example&mdash;is very important. I believe it is very important that the committee have on it persons of high status, two representing the Commonwealth&mdash;being a member of the Commission, who is the Chair, and the National Program Director Health of the Department&mdash;and, representing veterans, a representative of each of the Returned Services League of Australia, the War Widows Guild of Australia, the Australian Veterans and Defence Services Council, the Australian Federation of Totally and Permanently Incapacitated Ex-servicemen and Women, the Legacy Coordinating Council and the Regular Defence Force Welfare Association. I believe that the State committees will of course mirror that particular arrangement. I think, once again at the State convention or congress of the Returned Services League of Australia in Tasmania, Mr Ken Alexander, the esteemed President already mentioned by Senator Calvert, indicated that the committee was already at work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no doubt that that is why the Returned Services League of Australia, by virtue of the resolution held at the extraordinary national congress on Tuesday 21 April, has been able to agree:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That notwithstanding any other Resolution which may have been passed at a National Congress on the question of RGH Integration, that the RSL accept the principle of integration of RGH Hospitals into the State Health systems, providing there is guarantee by the Federal Government and each State Government, priority of access to the State and Private Hospitals for veterans and war widows, where that priority is medically justified.</PARA>
<PARA>It has also agreed:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . That State Branches be authorised to negotiate satisfactory settlements of as many as possible of the RSL's minimum requirements on RGH Integration, with their own State Governments and Federal Government representatives in their states.</PARA>
<PARA>I believe that the sentiment expressed by the national secretary that we now need to work closely together to make sure the integration process proceeds without detriment to the welfare of the veteran will be the guiding principle for the work of the national committee and certainly of the State committees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand from what Senator Newman said that it is agreed that the principles are an adequate vehicle for incorporating the composition and task and functions of the national treatment monitoring committee. The Australian Democrats have circulated proposed amendments which require the Minister to give notice to the Parliament prior to signing any agreements for transfer before 1995 of the repatriation general hospitals, other than Concord or Hobart, or the repatriation auxiliary hospitals. The coalition would go further and make Hobart and Concord subject to that disallowance process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government does not accept the coalition's position. The arrangements for Hobart are well in hand. Over 300 job offers have been issued to RGH Hobart staff to work in the hospital as State staff after integration, and it should proceed on 1 July 1992. The integration of Concord has strong and widespread support amongst ex-service organisations in New South Wales. I think Senator Lees indicated that that was certainly her impression from conversations she has held as recently as yesterday. The New South Wales Government, I understand, is very keen for transfer to occur, as are staff at the hospital. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Insertion of a requirement to bring forward a disallowable instrument would set back a process which is already endorsed by both the New South Wales and Tasmanian governments. As I understand it, the ex-service organisations are involved in the process too. So the Government will support the Democrats' amendments, including the change in the long title. I understand that there is also a sunset clause to come into operation on 1 January 1995. I think that is part of the Democrats' amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ongoing viability of the RGHs is critical and is contingent on their integration into the State system as this provides them with a continuing role. Since 1988, with the first announcement of the proposed transfer of the RGHs, the year 1995 has been embedded in RGH and State health planning as the latest date on which sensible planning can be based. It does not mean that the Government or future governments would bulldoze the transfers. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys) believes that integration of the RGHs in Queensland, South Australia and Victoria will be successfully settled with the support of veterans, staff and State governments well before 1995. It would have to be said that the outlook for RGH Hollywood in Perth is less clear at this stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth, through the Repatriation Commission&mdash;this cannot be emphasised too much&mdash;will continue to be responsible for the health care of veterans and war widows. This legislation enshrines that responsibility. The repatriation private patients scheme will mean greater health care options for all veterans and war widows, and this Government will continue to work towards the implementation of these benefits in all States as soon as possible. With the support of all major ex-service organisations, medical staff and the unions, the stage has been reached, I believe, where Parliament as a whole should support these Bills. As I have indicated, the Government will support the amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After at times acrimonious and understandable controversy concerning this proposal, we have reached a stage where the Senate can in good conscience support this legislation underpinning and giving guarantees concerning the integration process. That would be of great comfort to veterans and to the general community, which wants to ensure that those who have served in the armed forces receive the best treatment possible within our society in relation to their medical and health requirements. </PARA>

I do not intend, nor would you permit me, to make a second reading speech in a committee debate.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because it appears to me, in the final analysis, that something of a fait accompli has been imposed&mdash;I suppose that is the only word I can use&mdash;on the veterans community and, indeed, on the unions involved in staffing repatriation hospitals, we are faced with a difficult circumstance. I know and everybody around the chamber knows that these negotiations have been taking place, certain undertakings have been given, and at last we are virtually requested by this legislation to rubber stamp what has been taking place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My view is that there is still a very strong argument that special arrangements need to be made for the health care, et cetera, of veterans. In so far as these veterans live within relatively close proximity to the repatriation hospitals, then those are the places, and I believe should still be the places, where they continue to be catered for, and solely catered for. Obviously, for those who live a greater distance away from repatriation hospitals, other circumstances may well be desired by individual veterans, and those desires should be accommodated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I realise that negotiations have been going on with the organisations, the unions involved, and also with the veterans' communities, including the RSL.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition is not entirely happy with this amendment. It is for that reason that I was hoping that we might have been able to take the Opposition's amendment prior to that of the Democrats because our amendment, although wider, covers the same area. Perhaps I can explain why I believe that our amendment is preferable to the one which the Democrats have moved. Senator Lees, in speaking on the second reading debate, outlined, as she saw it, the position in each State. I do not suppose I have a great deal of disagreement with her. She said there was opposition in South Australia; there was opposition in Victoria; no interest in Western Australia; and not much interest in Queensland. She gave a different impression about Tasmania. As Senator Harradine said, Tasmania was steamrollered. It is a little State with few people and it was just run over the top. Even there, the details are not complete. So it is incorrect to give the impression that Tasmania is ready to go and that the veterans are satisfied with it. It is quite a false impression.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Lees said that around Australia some people are vehemently opposed to it. That is also the situation in New South Wales. It is a pity that Senator Lees seems to have not heard that. Her former colleague Senator McLean was on the same platform as me in New South Wales about 18 months ago when something like 1,000 veterans crowded into the Sydney Town Hall to protest strongly about just this proposal. Last year at the RSL Congress in New South Wales, by a very small margin, the RSL there agreed to the hand over of its hospital. But it does not mean to say there is not a sizeable body of veterans in New South Wales who are unhappy. In addition, not all the details are ironed out there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did ask by way of interjection on Senator Lees, `What is the hurry?'. Why is it that her amendment to this legislation means that it has to go through now? We are perfectly prepared to let the legislation go through now provided the proper protection is in place for the veterans. Why is it that her list of hospitals which can only be transferred by way of a disallowable instrument does not include Concord and Tasmania? What is the hurry for those two hospitals? What is the difference of another couple of months or three months? If they are to be transferred, let it be done fairly and squarely, taking into account the details that have to be ironed out and the remaining concerns of those veterans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the answer is that the Government is scared that there might be a last minute hiccup. I am sure that is the reason and the Democrats are prepared to go along with that. I cannot understand them not giving the same protection to the veterans in Tasmania and in New South Wales as they are prepared to give to the veterans in South Australia, Victoria, Western Australia and Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Lees lives in South Australia, so she obviously speaks with considerable authority of the veterans there. She knows their concerns. Those concerns are also very evident in my home State, as they are amongst many veterans still in New South Wales. Why is she not prepared to extend that same protection to the veterans in the other two States?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not trying to suggest that those things will not go through. I am just saying they should be given the opportunity to see that the deals that are done and the provisions that are put in place do protect the veterans in those States. I find it hard to understand how she can justify not including those two States in her list. Senator Lees has obviously been trying to go in the same direction as we have with our amendment; that is, to give the Parliament the power to protect the veterans in any State where the arrangements are not satisfactory to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Tate mentioned the acceptance by the Opposition and the Democrats of this legislation. I say to him: yes, we do accept it, but I have to qualify that and say that it is pretty grudging acceptance and it is very wary acceptance. That reflects the views of our constituents, the veterans communities, in each of the States, whose acceptance is also extremely grudging and very wary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment of the Democrats is nearly there. I implore the Democrats to expand this measure&mdash;to amend their own amendment, if they care to do it that way&mdash;or to support the amendment which has been tabled by the Opposition. Perhaps the Government can explain to us why it is prepared to accept that amendment as drafted for the Democrats but is not prepared to accept the amendment as sent on 27 May by the Opposition to the Minister. The protection of all veterans is guaranteed by our amendment. The protection of veterans in New South Wales and Tasmania is not. Why not? Is it only a question of timing? As I asked before, what is the difference of a couple of months? I imagine it would be a couple of months at the most. I can only see that the exclusion of those two hospitals is provided by the Democrats for the Government's convenience. It certainly has nothing to do with the veterans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second part of the Democrats' amendment relates to the date. The disallowable instrument provision is to end in January 1995. Once again, this seems to give protection to the Government rather than the veterans. If there are any States which are holding out&mdash;and the Minister has just acknowledged that Western Australia is very likely to be in that position&mdash;it is quite possible that Daw Park will be in the same position, if not Victoria or Queensland. So there are four States still quite a long way from being ready to hand over their hospitals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Lees pointed out that there will be further pressure on the Government as the veterans watch how the New South Wales and Tasmanian handovers proceed. If those veterans do not like what they see in New South Wales and Tasmania, if they find the negotiations they are undertaking unsatisfactory, and if they hold out until January 1995, the Government will win under the Democrats' amendment because it gives the Government a gun to the heads of the veterans. The Government only has to sit around and wait until January 1995 and the hospital transfers will fall into its lap. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not understand why the Democrats' are not prepared to leave it open-ended&mdash;not that the hospitals will go on forever; we all agree that they will not. But why put something in the legislation that limits the protection when there is no need? That is why, as I said a little prematurely a minute ago, we have an amendment which would remove the date from the Democrats' amendment so that the protection of having a disallowable instrument on the handover of each hospital would go on, even if there were some unfinished business by January 1995. I move:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not support Senator Newman's amendment. I will deal firstly with the other two hospitals, and I refer Senator Newman to what I outlined in my speech. It was the Democrats who initiated the idea&mdash;in a way, putting it into the Government's head&mdash;that this legislation should let only two hospitals go. That was not because we thought that somehow it might be a good idea; it was because of the overwhelming pressure we were put under by the veterans, particularly in New South Wales. I did not simply take the views of one or two; I visited organisations and spoke to several of them. Eventually, it became very clear that there was a little opposition, and I believe that that will be so even after the transfer goes ahead. But, overwhelmingly, the feeling and belief in New South Wales is that 20 of the 21 points were met back in February&mdash;not just recently; they were happy back in February to go ahead. Without this legislation they cannot finalise any of the arrangements and understandings that they were coming to with the State Government. Therefore, we will proceed as we planned to do.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to Tasmania, I have a letter dated 28 May from Mr Roger Groom, the Minister for Health in Tasmania&mdash;and I can incorporate the letter, if need be, so people can see that I am not being selective&mdash;which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am advised by the Department of Health that there is agreement with the unions concerning employment arrangements to apply beyond the 1 July transfer date. The ex-service community in Tasmania has advised me that they are not opposed to the concept of integrating the RGHH with the State's public health system. Now that the matters referred to above are settled the Tasmanian Government is prepared to commit itself to the transfer of the RGHH as provided for in the arrangement negotiated by the former Labor Government and the Department of Veterans' Affairs. You would be aware, however, that the transfer is subject to agreements on staffing, property transfers and leasing arrangements being in place.</PARA>
<PARA>It continues with matters relating to the Crown Solicitor. Adding the position stated in that letter to the functioning of the State Monitoring Committee, which has already been mentioned, we have, I believe, a proper basis for the implementation as soon as possible of the arrangements with Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As for New South Wales, I understand that the New South Wales Minister for Health Services Management, Mr Ron Phillips&mdash;who I think has the task of the day to day management of the New South Wales health system, as opposed to Mr Hannaford who has more of a general policy role&mdash;said that the transfer envisaged is `the most important health project confronting New South Wales'.

I think that gives some indication why it is important for it to go ahead.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In concluding my remarks I wish to touch on one further amendment to the Bill, and that relates to the list maintained by the Australian Sports Drug Agency. Because of a decision in respect of privacy matters, ASDA is not entitled to publish the list of athletes who test positive. It has been held that the national sporting bodies themselves ought not disclose athletes who test positive.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect, that is something of a nonsense, as I was moved to observe on another occasion. If six of the Broncos tested positive, were found guilty, were banned from playing, and suddenly vanished from the field, it would forever remain a mystery as to what happened to them. It seems to me that if athletes test positive and the positive test is found to have been caused by the use of an illegal drug or a banned drug, that ought to be published. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the problems we seem to have in Australia when dealing with banned substances, such as anabolic steroids, is that there has been a notion amongst law enforcement agencies&mdash;and perhaps not an unreasonable one&mdash;that if athletes are silly enough to take these drugs exclusively for the purpose of enhancing their performance and do themselves a damage, well, that is their business and nobody else's. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I contacted the Western Australian police force on one occasion and drew their attention to a clear outlet of anabolic steroids in that State, I was told by senior officers of the Western Australian police force that the last thing they would be concerning themselves with would be the illegal use of anabolic steroids, because at that time they did not have sufficient police to monitor commercial crops of marijuana. Perhaps it is only in more recent times that the state law enforcement agencies understand the implications of this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by saying that I hope in due course the Government will reconsider its position in respect of an appeals mechanism of some sort. Perhaps if there were a proper appeals mechanism of the type recommended by the drugs in sport committee, cheats like Martin Vinnicombe would not be able to ride for Australia in spite of his positive test. It also means that people like Alec Watson, who was found guilty on a basis which was without foundation, may not have gone through the pain and suffering that he experienced. To the extent that the Bill goes as far as it does, I support it.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;Like you, Mr Acting Deputy President, I have taken such an interest in this Australian Sports Drug Agency Amendment Bill that I do not need to have a written speech, because I can take up the sentiments already expressed in the chamber about the great importance of this measure. It  is an indication by the Government, but even more by the whole Parliament, that we are determined to ensure that athletes do not cheat on their fellow competitors, their sport and its international reputation in Australia, or cheat on themselves. Senator Crichton-Browne made an important observation about the damage they could be doing to themselves. They should not be able to escape the sanctions that the community thinks they deserve, and these amendments are designed to ensure they do not escape them. They follow the recent publicity concerning an Australian cyclist who tested positive for anabolic steroids and who subsequently, on a legal technicality, was able to avoid sanctions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All senators would agree that there needs to be a coordinated and national approach to the elimination of drug abuse in sport. Considerable discussions have taken place between State and Territory Ministers and officials. Obviously it is important that we have an Australia-wide approach to this matter and that the state boundaries do not impede or frustrate what should be a national viewpoint expressed in legislation by the whole Australian community concerning these matters. The relevant sections in this Bill enable the Commonwealth to play its part in ensuring that that is the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has already been acknowledged by various speakers that Australia is taking the lead in international developments in the fight against drugs in sport. As Minister for Justice, I find that very encouraging. I believe that a change is occurring in society as far as the view taken of the use of drugs is concerned, be they drugs which have for generations been legally available in society or those, due to more recent legislation or development, which are proscribed. I believe that the need for that sentiment&mdash;which is so important particularly amongst young Australians&mdash;to be fostered is extremely important. To let those who are in positions of great influence as role models and heroes and heroines in a sporting field to be associated in any way with drugs as a method of enhancing their competitive edge in a particular sport or to permit, countenance or allow that to go unchecked in our society would be to send a very wrong message to young Australians. As you, Mr Acting Deputy President, would be aware&mdash;though I might need some assistance with the name&mdash;a member of the Australian test team a couple of years ago from Tasmania&mdash;</PARA>

He performed a very good role in that regard, being a very good role model and a person whom the youngsters in Tasmania, particularly those interested in cricket, looked up to for advice in this respect.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating here tonight the Ministers of State Amendment Bill, which is primarily a housekeeping Bill. Section 66 of the Constitution provides for a maximum annual sum for the payment of Ministers, unless the Parliament provides otherwise. I suppose that, with the thought of mischief that runs through one's mind, one would have to wonder whether these Ministers were worth an increase in pay. But we will not pursue that at this stage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Remuneration and Allowances Act 1990 links the base salaries of parliamentarians at the top of the Senior Executive Service band 1 in the Australian Public Service. Similarly, there is a proportional increase in the salaries of Ministers of State. Therefore, Ministers' salaries are increased at the same rate and at the same time as are salaries of members and senators.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amount of increase appropriated equates to the 2.5 per cent national wage increase, effective from 15 August 1991. Ministerial salaries are to be adjusted in accordance with that increase. As I said earlier, I am not sure that Ministers are worth it, but that is the way it has to be under the Constitution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth noting the following remarks of the Remuneration Tribunal in its 1992 review of salaries of members and senators, which said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The total remuneration package of Members of the Parliament is no longer assessed objectively on a "work value" basis or according to its essential worth from time to time. The base salary of Members is now by statute equated to that of a Member of the Australian Public Service at the lower end of the Senior Executive Service scale. In addition, the remuneration package is, as to its main part, no longer reviewed or fixed by an independent and impartial body. As long as the Parliament maintains the present statutory provisions: see Act No 71 of 1990 section 6 and clause 1 of Schedule 3; the basic salary component of that package rises or falls with the award or wage agreement made from time to time with relevant members of the Senior Executive Service through their union.</PARA>
<PARA>We have made it quite clear in the past that we supported the independent tribunal making its determination, because we thought it was quite improper that Parliament itself should decide the salaries and conditions relating to the members and senators in the Parliament. We are equally opposed and offended by the fact that the only way that the remuneration or salaries of members and senators of the Parliament of Australia is determined is by the union of the Senior Executive Service. Frankly, we find that offensive. We will not oppose the Bill, but we will be looking at this carefully when we get into government next year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The ACT Supreme Court (Transfer) Bill 1992 transfers the Supreme Court of the ACT from the Commonwealth to the ACT Government. In theory, the Supreme Court was transferred at the time that ACT self-government was established but the actual transfer was deferred for two years. That is the period that we are now dealing with. The Supreme Court is set to become part of the ACT Government on 1 July this year. The Supreme Court of the ACT was established in 1933 and has been administered by and paid for by the Commonwealth since then.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition supports the Bill which we have before us, but there are several matters that I wish to refer to which have come up in discussions since the Bill emerged. The Law Society was concerned about certain aspects of the Bill. These matters have been looked at by the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy), the Australian Democrats and me. The Attorney-General has written a letter to me, dated 4 June 1992, in which he deals with the matters which I took up with his office. I will seek leave to incorporate a copy of the letter in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. I think that is the most appropriate way of doing it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was concern over the wording of clause 48A(1) of the ACT Self-Government Act. The Attorney-General has dealt with that in detail. Concern was also raised about the amendment to subsection 7(6) of the Supreme Court Act. Hopefully, what is now said in the letter will clarify any misunderstandings which may have existed. The incorporation of the letter in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> will enable it to become a useful part of the record should there be any queries about this in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other matter which was of particular interest to those of us in the ACT was the funding of the Supreme Court. Given that one judge is owed 37 weeks leave and another is owed 18 weeks&mdash;which, at the present rate will continue to escalate&mdash;it was a matter of concern that those who were responsible for the judges' salaries during the time that the leave accrued should pay for it. The Attorney-General's letter indicates that that will be the case. The judges have accumulated so much leave&mdash;if one of them took it he would be away for a very long time&mdash;because there have not been sufficient judges in the court to cope with the work there has been. The ACT is being left with the matter of establishing another judge in the court and dealing with the Commonwealth's failure to maintain the court properly and see that it was adequately staffed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Supreme Court of the ACT hears about the same number of criminal cases as the Northern Territory, with half the number of judges. The distances that people may have to travel in the Northern Territory may create some differences, but not that many. We have to take into account the fact that the ACT Supreme Court, being in the national capital, gets caught up with national and political matters which would not normally occur in a court of this kind. For example, cases arise from things such as the AIDEX exhibition which occurred last year and the incident which occurred at the Iranian Embassy just a short time ago. This puts extra pressure on our court which means that it needs more space and more facilities than it has been given by the Commonwealth Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The buildings are inadequate. I lay this at the door of the Commonwealth because in the early 1980s there were proposals for a new Commonwealth courts building, so no-one can say that it is not that bad. The Commonwealth has known for a long time that the building needed to be replaced. A master and a registrar have been added to the court but the same amount of space is available now as was available when I came to Canberra in the 1960s. For that reason, I say that the Commonwealth has treated the ACT fairly shabbily. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to other questions of funding. The Commonwealth has spent a lot of money on technology&mdash;as senators would know from being on Estimates committees&mdash;in establishing computers and things of that nature everywhere else in the Public Service. The Supreme Court of the ACT is still well in the nineteenth century as far as records are concerned. The records are not computerised&mdash;they are still kept on cards&mdash;and statistics have to be produced manually. Again, this is something that the Commonwealth has quite cheerfully allowed to continue to happen. The citizens of the ACT, the taxpayers of the ACT, will have to pick up the costs which were clearly the responsibility of the Commonwealth Government. The Commonwealth Government has not taken the trouble to see that modern technology was put into this court. There are other matters I could refer to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I feel concerned about the way the Supreme Court has been left to the ACT&mdash;I am on strong ground in suggesting that the Commonwealth has been fairly negligent&mdash;because of what happened when the hospital system was left to the ACT. Millions of dollars are required just to maintain the hospital system in reasonable order as we discovered when we got it and found what had been done over the last few years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I received a report only the other day, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Environmental and </EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Process Audit May 1992 of the Lower Molonglo Quality Control Centre</EMPHASIS>. The report tells us neatly on the last page that $91m is needed for the lower Molonglo waters sewerage works. That is a lot of money in a community the size of the ACT. I agree that some of that relates to the future, but some of it relates to the past&mdash;things that clearly should have been done before the sewerage works were handed over to the citizens of the ACT. When I know that about the sewerage works, and when I know what I know about the hospital system and I see the court being handed over as it is, I am inclined to wonder. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other aspect which attracted my attention was the explanatory memorandum which says, `no financial impact to the Commonwealth'. Is it any wonder I raise the question of who will pay for the accumulated leave of the judges and some of these other things? The document, which the Attorney-General presented to the Parliament, says, `no financial impact to the Commonwealth'. We have seen what other Ministers have done to the ACT and, with good reason, we are concerned about what is happening with the Supreme Court. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator Reid</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to correspondence from the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the ACT, the ACT Bar Association and the ACT Law Society about the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the outset, I should indicate my view that there appears to be some misunderstanding about the purpose of the Bill. As you will be aware, it is not necessary for the Commonwealth to enact any legislation to facilitate the transfer of the ACT Supreme Court to the ACT Government because the Self-Government Act already provides that the ACT Government is to have power to legislate in relation to the establishment of courts from 1 July 1992 when the ACT Supreme Court Act becomes an enactment of the ACT.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You will recall that when self-government was under consideration, in 1988, the Government proposed that the ACT Government should not acquire power to legislate in relation to the establishment of courts. However, the Government agreed, after a discussion in the Senate of a proposal by Senator Hill, to include a provision for the transfer of legislative power in relation to the courts by 1 July 1992. The current Bill will modify the intention previously expressed by Parliament, in order to provide the judiciary with protections that were not provided when the Self-Government Act was enacted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What the legislation does is to provide the ACT judiciary with entrenched tenure and remuneration protection by providing&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. for the retirement ages of judges,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. for the establishment of a judicial commission to deal with the removal of judges,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. that remuneration and allowances will not be diminished while the judges hold office, and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. that a judge holds office on terms no less favourable than those applicable to a Federal Court Judge.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislation does not seek to direct the future structure of the ACT judicial system because the Federal Parliament has previously, in the Self-Government Act, indicated that the ACT should be treated as if it were a State to the greatest extent possible. The purpose of the legislation is to ensure that the current jurisdiction of the Court remains with it and to permit the ACT Government to add to that jurisdiction.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In respect of jurisdiction, a question has been raised as to the meaning of the phrase "that is necessary" in clause 48A(1) of the ACT (Self-Government) Act. The purpose of these words is to enable the ACT Government to expand the jurisdiction of the Court. The Court's present jurisdiction is guaranteed by both clause 48A(1) and proposed subsection 11(1) of the Supreme Court Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The effect of the proposed amendments of the ACT (Self-Government) Act is that the ACT will have, in its constituent document, a provision dealing with the jurisdiction of the ACT Supreme Court, which the Assembly will not, itself, be able to amend. I consider that the provision provides the ACT Supreme Court with a level of protection from Executive interference that is not available in other States and Territories. You have expressed your concern that the Bill does not expressly prohibit the repeal by the ACT Assembly of the Supreme Court Act. Although I accept the theoretical possibility that the Supreme Court Act could be repealed there are many practical reasons that I consider reduce the significance of that particular concern. Not the least of those considerations is the power of the Governor-General to disallow any ACT legislation, which is contained in subsection 35(2) of the Self-Government Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I note, also, the concern that amendments of subsection 7(6) of the Supreme Court Act relating to the removal of Judges are ineffective because no reference is made to the Judicial Commission. The amendment provides that a judge may be removed on an address by the ACT Assembly to the ACT Executive, rather than an address by both Houses of the Commonwealth Parliament to the Governor-General. This remains the case when the Court is transferred. However, the amendment must be read subject to the other provisions of the Act. In particular, it must be read subject to new section 48D of the Self-Government Act, which provides that an ACT enactment providing for the removal of a judge must make provision for a judicial commission. Subsection 7(6) is inoperative until the judicial commission legislation is in place.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was considered unnecessary to amend the Supreme Court Act to include the procedural provisions as these will be included in the ACT's judicial commissions legislation. It is inappropriate for the Commonwealth to provide the detail of that legislation. I have been advised that the Judicial Commissions Bill will be tabled in the next session of the ACT Assembly and that no amendment of section 7(6) of the Supreme Court Act will be required once the ACT Assembly has passed its judicial commission legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In recent days a number of matters in relation to the finances of the Supreme Court have been raised. The following comments address the concerns that I have been made aware of.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Judges of the Federal Court who act as additional Judges of the Supreme Court will be paid by the Commonwealth. Remuneration for Judges who are Judges of the Federal Court on long leave will also come from the Commonwealth. The financial arrangements made with the ACT Government ensure that there will be no added costs for the ACT Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the question of funding for the Court, my Department is responsible for maintenance, cleaning and security costs until 30 June 1992, and about $315,000 will be spent this year on air conditioning and Stage 3 of the refurbishment of the Court. Since the commencement of self-government the Commonwealth has upheld its commitment to maintain the courts buildings, and has expended more than a million dollars on the maintenance of the Court. In addition further amounts of $165,000 for court reporting and transcription costs and $75,000 to cover increases in jury fees were provided in the additional estimates for the 91/92 financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth has not provided new court premises in Canberra. The construction of court premises depends on national priorities and it has been determined that greater priority exists in Melbourne and Adelaide for future court construction.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Upon transfer of the Court on 1 July 1992, the entire operational costs of the Court will be transferred to the ACT Government in accordance with the agreement reached with the ACT. After that date, funding levels for the ACT Supreme Court will be a matter for the ACT Government to determine.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator Spindler</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your discussion this morning about the arrangements made for the payment of salary and accrued benefits of the Judges of the ACT Supreme Court.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current Judges are also Judges of the Federal Court of Australia and the Commonwealth retains a constitutional obligation to pay their salaries. For that reason an annotated appropriation will be made to the Federal Court for the salaries of those judges. This arrangement has been negotiated by my Department, the Commonwealth Department of Finance and the ACT Treasury. If, at some future time, there are Judges of the ACT Supreme Court who do not hold federal commissions the funds for their salaries will be included in the ACT's general revenue grant and the Federal Court's annotated appropriation will be reduced accordingly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In principle agreement has been reached by my Department and the ACT Attorney-General's Department that the Commonwealth will accept full responsibility for the accrued judicial pension entitlements of Justices Miles and Gallop. In relation to Justice Higgins, the Commonwealth will retain primary responsibility for his pension entitlements, but arrangements for the ACT to contribute to those entitlement will be made. The precise detail of those arrangements has not been finalised.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to long leave, the ACT has, in principle, accepted responsibility for all long leave entitlements after 1 July 1992. Of course, in relation to the current judges the Commonwealth will be paying the Judges salaries while they are on long leave. An amount to be transferred to the ACT Government has been agreed with the ACT Treasury in relation to long leave payment obligations.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill 1992 should more properly be entitled the small business union conscription Bill. It is a Bill which gives the Industrial Relations Commission absolute jurisdiction over the use of contracts, contractors and the terms of contracts, and would give unions monopoly powers to represent contractors in the Industrial Relations Commission. What it all means in practical terms can be broken down into two categories: first, the unions now, more than ever, will be able to force small business people who do not want a bar of union membership to pay union dues and to be subject to control by power-mad union bosses; secondly, the union monopoly powers to represent contractors in the Commission will mean that individual employees and their employers will be forced to join a union.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill provides, for instance, that contractors may be members of a union. Although innocent enough looking, the clause will give open slather to unions such as the TWU and the Building Workers Industrial Union, represented very ably here by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook). Using the example of the TWU, in the past owner-drivers who did not wish to join a union were able to argue that they could not do so because of their status. There were numerous cases of this occurring in my home State of Queensland. They used that argument because they did not want anything to do with the union. That escape hatch has now been removed in this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What bugged the closed shop union militants was that owner-drivers could turn up at wharves, building sites, printing houses and so on where the no-ticket, no-job rule applied. They were appalled that non-union owner-drivers were not bound or owned by the union, that they worked harder and made a lot more money. No union delegate could instruct them to slow down in order to maintain featherbedding or reduce productivity. It is for this reason that contractors have always been a source of great annoyance to the trade union movement. A series of subcontractors are doing additions to my home at the moment. I was speaking to my wife on the phone this evening and she told me that the subcontractors turned up at 6 o'clock this morning in the dark and were still there in the dark tonight at 5.30. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KI4">Senator PARER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is a good interjection. It is an excellent thing. One of the most productive elements we have in Australia today is the cottage industry&mdash;the people who build the little homes for everyone in Australia. It has been estimated that if those people are now coerced by the BLF in Brisbane, or the BWIU in any other State where the BLF is deregistered, into becoming part of the union, first of all the earnings of those subcontractors will drop off substantially but, more importantly, the cost of building an average home will go up by about 20 to 25 per cent. That will add anything up to $20,000 to $30,000 to the price of a new home. It is hard enough for the ordinary person or young married couple to buy a house today without having that added impost. Anyone who believes that that threat has gone away with the proposed amendments to this Bill is having himself on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this stage there is no recognition in the Bill for employees to reach agreement with their employer without union involvement. This is particularly relevant to Metway Bank in my own State. The legislation will force union coverage on Metway, against the wishes of the employees and the employer. I understand that the Australian Democrats intend to move an amendment to the Bill which will enable organisations such as Metway to get through the gate, but for anyone coming after Metway it will no longer be available. I think that is illogical; it does not make any sense at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is important to run over the history of Metway because it is indicative of so many other organisations in this country who, if allowed to go down this route, will end up with agreements that are beneficial not only to themselves, to the employers and the employees, but also to the community as a whole. Metway was formed in 1959, more than 30 years ago, and became a bank in 1988. It is currently the largest bank headquartered in Queensland, with assets of nearly $3 billion and offices throughout Queensland, northern New South Wales, Newcastle, Sydney and Melbourne. It has a staff of more than 1,300, many of whom are shareholders in the company. Its core business these days is banking, whether it be retail, business or funds management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are no restrictions in Metway on whether a person should or should not join a union. My understanding is that there are some 50 or so members of a registered union and the rest are members of the staff organisation of the Metway Group. Prior to converting from a building society to a bank, the staff were covered by the Federated Clerks Union from 1976. The staff petitioned management against union coverage, but threats by the union to stop supplies to their computer centre resulted in the staff joining under protest. That is the sort of coercion we have had in this country for so long. If this Bill is allowed to pass, it is the sort of coercion that will be exacerbated to such an extent that individuals will lose their freedom altogether. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the bank conversion was announced, the ABEU&mdash;the union normally covering banks, now the FSU&mdash;said it would seek coverage and the FCU said it would seek to maintain coverage. We had the old demarcation dispute, the headhunters, with one union trying to get enough heads simply to get the money. They said, `To hell with the employees, to hell with the people who work there, let's build it up in a head-hunting exercise'. As it was felt that the Australian Bank Employees Union would be the most appropriate, an agreement was reached on mutually acceptable terms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here we had an organisation that became a bank, reached an agreement with the Bank Employees Union, and two days before conversion to a bank the union advised that the agreement was no longer satisfactory and the negotiations totally disintegrated. After conversion, the Bank Employees Union and the Federated Clerks Union continued to argue over representation. They were arguing over the body. It was unsettling for the staff, who finally acted on their own initiative to form a staff association. This is a very interesting case history. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This process led to an agreement with staff on wages and conditions which was registered under Queensland law as a voluntary employment agreement. The new State Government, the Goss Government, abolished VEAs, and Metway's VEA was replaced by an interim State award, which has been extended on a number of occasions and continues to apply. This award is union free. The union has proceeded to pursue claims in the State and Federal commissions and a number of matters are currently part heard or pending. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the old tack: coerce and force people into becoming members of an organisation against their will. We on this side of politics have made it very clear over and over again that we are not opposed to trade unionism but are opposed to compulsory trade unionism. We think that everyone should have the right to decide whether they wish to be a member of a union and of which union they wish to be a member. We would fight equally as hard for people to join a union as for them not to join a union. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is often thrown up, even by some philosophers on the other side such as Senator Cooney, who quotes papal encyclicals on the matter, that people should join a union. Nothing could be further from the truth. Back at the turn of the century when these philosophical arguments were used, it was almost impossible for people to freely get together and form a union. Of course, that was the basis of the strikes that occurred back in those years. We have a different climate today, but to force people to join an organisation against their will is absolutely no different from not allowing them to join together of their own accord. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what happened under this staff agreement with which, from my own discussions with the staff of this bank, as far as I can see, everyone is extraordinarily happy? The staff ended up with more flexible working hours. The ordinary hours were 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. for a 40-hour week. They now work 38 hours a week and those 38 hours can be worked at any time from 7.30 in the morning. That can be of benefit to mothers with young families, for instance, who want to be home either early in the morning or towards the afternoon. They can adjust their working hours. No more than 9 1/2 hours in one day or 38 hours in one week is worked. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The salary structure moved away from age and years of service to grades and pay on performance. In other words, people were paid on merit, on their ability to do the job better. Is that not what this country needs today? It is crying out for this sort of thing. We do not want mediocrity. We want people to be rewarded for the type of work they do. The bank introduced part time employees as well as casuals. There was time off in lieu of overtime. It is very sensible sort of stuff but impossible to get through under the structured union system and the centralised wage fixing system we have in this country. There was cash in lieu of one week per year annual leave; casual loading was increased to 20 per cent; a higher duties allowance was paid after five days; there was a branch restructure; and there were skills based training programs&mdash;all things that are required in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is interesting to ask what the effect was on the bank and its staff. The bank moved totally to an in-house enterprise agreement with the parties. They had a personal stake in the agreement and did the negotiating. There was not some remote person 1,000 or even 100 kilometres away. They had an interest in the agreement. There was an ownership of the employee relations program. The bank and the people who work there took total responsibility for their own future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the sort of philosophy we have seen in successful countries in Asia such as Japan. I spent many years going to Japan and I never got used to the idea of the incredible attitude: `If the organisation with whom I work is successful, I will succeed and I will do better; if it fails, I will fail, I will lose my job, my family will not have a breadwinner'. I often recount the story of being in Japan over a decade ago when one of the major companies in fact had a strike. It would not be the case today. When I asked what the strike was about I was told that it was very embarrassing. I said, `Well, it might be embarrassing, but why are you having a strike?'. I was told, `We have cut the working week back from six to 5 1/2 days. The workers believe we will lose our competitiveness on world markets, we will become less competitive; therefore, they are objecting to our doing something which might affect their long term livelihood'. What a different attitude. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The enterprise agreement at Metway&mdash;which is an example and why I am quoting it in detail&mdash;is the sort of agreement we could copy throughout Australia. Sure, it would destroy the power of these union moguls at the top of the union movement, but if they only thought it through they would find that they would still have a degree of influence within the enterprise itself. That is where it counts; that is what matters. I have heard union people say over the years that they will not give up certain restrictive work practices. The phrase one hears all the time when they say they will not give up work practices is `giving up hard-won gains'. They do not want to give up hard-won gains because they think it will have some sort of domino effect across the board as a result of the centralised wage fixing system. It is the flow-on domino effect. That is exactly what is wrong with it. The enterprise agreement removed all barriers between `them and us'. That is very important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my own working life before coming into this place we never had a `them and us' syndrome, but I recall a valiant attempt by militant union leaders to build it up, to create this artificial `them and us'. This is not a Kipling society of `East is East, and West is West. . . '. We are all Australians and we should all be moving in the same direction and working as a group to enhance our own productivity, profitability and, of course, standard of living. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The line managers in Metway are managing; they are leaders and accepting much more responsibility. Communications have improved; people discuss how to make ideas work to increase quality and productivity. They have eliminated most of the small complaints. This is very important because it is often small complaints that are built up out of all proportion that cause industrial problems. If those things are done in an atmosphere of an enterprise agreement, they are more likely to be sorted out than by one party rushing off to a third party and the other one rushing off to another one. It becomes almost like a divorce situation in which there are a couple of lawyers who have a vested interest in keeping the fight going. That sort of thing disappears in an enterprise agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Metway, complacency has gone; the staff association understands the business decisions and understands the rationale of thinking. I have tried to indicate all through this that enterprise bargaining is all about making a genuine attempt to improve competitiveness and, in so doing, to work with staff on enhancing their wages and conditions on the basis of real and demonstrable gains in productivity, efficiency and flexibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bank, which was only launched four years ago, has been extremely successful. It is not one of those that got into difficulties. It did not take big risks, so it did not have a lot of non-performing loans. In other words, it played within its own class and I think this has been shown by the benefits that have flowed through. I can say from my own personal experience that dealing with that bank is a joy. It is like going back in time&mdash;not that everything back in time is good&mdash;because one gets that personal treatment that there used to be. One is no longer like talking to a computer, which I know is the feeling we get today when dealing with the larger organisations. One is dealing with people. That is what has come out of this special arrangement at Metway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have not gone into the Metway example to single it out and say, `Here is one sitting up there'. There will be Metways all around Australia if they are permitted to do what they want to do. When I say `they' I do not just mean the employer organisation, the shareholder owned part of an organisation; I mean the people who work there. A lot of points have been made about what people call sham agreements. I am aware of sham agreements in quite a number of industries. I am aware of $2 companies set up as employment groups that hire off their labour back to themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They do it because the employees also want to do it. They do not want to walk out the gate. They want to get in there and be productive and they want to be paid for their output and their increased productivity. They do not want everyone to be dressed up in Chairman Mao tunics where all the work is the same, where there is no such thing as good or bad and where there is no such thing as a good worker or a bad worker. People who apply themselves to a particular job know that the results of their hard work will show and that they themselves will end up being more productive. We have to get away from featherbedding and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Towards the end of last week I had the opportunity to speak to a builder&mdash;a good builder. This person had been apprenticed many years ago. One of the things that this builder taught his son, who had also decided to become a builder, was to be efficient. As an apprentice, he taught him that he must be able to do things in the shortest possible time without affecting the quality of the job. This is a very important requirement, particularly in the home building side of the industry. If a builder does not do a good job, his mistakes will come back to haunt him. The builder told me that he can recall telling his son that if the son could not do a certain job in half an hour he should stop being a builder. The son then challenged the old man and said, `Well, you show me'. The father said that he did it in 15 minutes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The father then told me that in the last six month his son has been working in a closed shop organisation. The son rang up his father and said, `Listen, these fellows have told me to slow down. When they told me the first time, I slowed down a little bit. They said, "You don't understand mate. You've got to cut it right in half because unless you do so they might find out that there is more work we can do within the given hour. Some of us could lose our jobs"'. That is old fashioned, archaic, Luddite mentality which is exacerbated by a centralised system and by a Bill which, if allowed to go through this place, will make this country less productive at a time when we are crying out for increased productivity to ensure that not only are we equally competitive with the rest of the world but that we are more competitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be the aim of all people from the day they go to school to be the best at what they attempt to do. They do not have to be the best and I do not think anyone should expect people, even their children, to be so. But all that can be asked is for someone to work at being the best. There is no greater shame than for a person with ability to work below his capacity and not do very well. Such a person deserves to be the subject of extreme criticism. People without ability who work hard to achieve what they can are to be praised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Industrial Relations is responsible for this Bill. Senator Cook is often referred to by people on this side of the chamber as the Minister for the BWIU and the Minister assisting the President of the ACTU. Before he came to this place, Senator Cook was the Secretary of the Trades and Labour Council in Western Australia and also, I think, an official in the BWIU. Even though his membership is common knowledge and was disclosed by him, for some strange reason last week in debate it took him two hours to admit that he was a member of the BWIU. Senator Ray, in an attempt to defend Senator Cook, kept interjecting on me with such profound words as, `so what?'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have to say to you, Mr Deputy President, that if ever there were a conflict of interest, it is in this instance. Here we have a person committed to the trade union movement, committed to the BWIU, bringing in a piece of legislation that will make it easy for the BWIU itself to recruit people within its ranks who do not want to be members of that union. In other words, as I said at the beginning of my speech, this Bill should more correctly be called the small business union conscription Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why is this matter so important? Everyone is aware that the Labor Party is made up of two arms&mdash;the industrial arm, which is the unions, and the political arm which is represented by people who come into parliament. I do not know about the preselection process of the Australian Democrats but I know that our preselection process covers a very broad range of people. Labor Party candidates who do not have the unions on side will not gain preselection. I understand that 60 per cent of people on Labor Party preselection panels come from the trade unions. The branches do not matter. So, individual Labor members and senators are in fact owned by particular unions. And Senator Cook is the BWIU man in this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have made it quite clear right from the word go that we are opposed to this Bill. Obviously, the Minister has brought in this Bill in an attempt further to entrench his trade union mates in one of the few areas in Australia&mdash;and I think this is the sad part&mdash;which is really productive. Everybody knows that once these people are unionised, they will become less productive. Not only will they become less productive, which is bad for the country, but they will earn less money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot of Opposition senators want to speak in this debate because they feel very strongly about the Bill. I am aware of some of the amendments that will be put forward by the Government and the Democrats. Although some of the Democrat amendments would certainly improve the Bill, I should point out that the Bill is not accepted by the business community. I know that some members of the business community have come out and said that the Bill is better than what is in place at the moment. But when one talks to them one finds that they oppose the Bill altogether. They think that maybe the Labor Government and the Minister for Industrial Relations have achieved the best they can. In other words, they have compromised on the basis that nothing better can be achieved. But if given the opportunity to do so, those people will make it quite clear that they are opposed to the whole Bill. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is desperately needed in this area is the creation of a contracts tribunal&mdash;an independent arbitrator either as a separate entity or attached to the State or Federal Industrial Commissions. In this regard, your support would be most welcome.</PARA>
<PARA>The letter continues with a couple of other niceties, but the central point was the last paragraph. As far as I am concerned, such matter as was raised in that last paragraph is certainly the subject of this legislation. As I interpret it, this legislation provides an essential part of the answer to the problems being faced by independent contractors working as log hauliers in Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other examples of the need for legislation in this area abound in our community. Several of them have been brought to my attention in recent weeks, not that I did not previously know of some examples. I brought to this chamber an example of one which I had been the subject of some 20-odd years ago. Good examples of this very same need can also be found in New Zealand, the place which is often quoted as being `the' place to go to observe industrial relations, individual contracts, et cetera, in application in real life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have an example of the real life situation that applies today in New Zealand, as it was obtained just a few days ago by Senator Powell on her visit to New Zealand. She has provided me with a copy of an actual contract which was `negotiated'&mdash;and I use that term in a very serious manner; I may come back to that in a minute. This contract was negotiated between truck drivers and the company that they were working with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think one of the most important things to see in this contract is the lack of opportunity for negotiation; rates are spelt out. Section 3 of this contract reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the first 12 months of employment with the company, including the three month probationary period, the employee&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>note the word `employee'&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">shall be paid an hourly rate of $12.50 an hour.</PARA>
<PARA>That is $NZ12.50. At the current exchange rate, $NZ140.76 equals $A100, so that particular person would net somewhere between $A8 and $A9 an hour. At the expiration of the first 12 months, the ordinary rate would be increased to $NZ13.50 an hour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At that point I would just like to take up one of the things that Senator Parer was mentioning. In some way, the term `contract' was associated somehow, perhaps by osmosis, as guaranteeing sort of payment for productivity. Here we have an example of a so-called contract in which, after 12 months, the pay rate would be increased by a dollar, with no mention of a test for productivity, skill or any other qualifications that would bring that result. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I worked my way through this contract, it became immediately apparent to me that it is an employment agreement to disguise the operator of the company vehicle as a contractor. In no way does this person have the capacity to negotiate terms, to talk about productivity, to vary the nature of the employment, to pass any of the tests which would normally be applied to determine whether somebody was a contractor or not. We find in part 11(c) of this so-called contract, there is the requirement that the person work exclusively for the company, except with the prior written consent of the company. To me, that shuts the gate as far as the definition of the person being an employee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree with Senator Parer and many of the other commentators who have talked about the advantages of being an independent contractor. One of those advantages is, in fact, the capacity to exercise that independence and to engage in contracts with a variety of principles. There is no doubt that that is an advantage, one which is exercised by many people and which contributes to the effectiveness and efficiency of, for example, our housing industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The document brought to me from New Zealand by Senator Powell is one which should terrify us. It is a document which exemplifies the sort of attitude that prevails in that country now. In essence, it is saying to an employee, `We are going to rearrange your employment status; here is your contract&mdash;like it or lump it'. In fact, that is what the negotiations consist of. Senator Powell told</PARA>
<PARA>me of the style of negotiation used. It involved the principal of the company lobbing up to the truck, sitting in the cab next to the driver and suggesting, in a one-on-one conversation, that this was the only option that the person had because the remainder of the work force had signed the contract and some people would have to leave the employment of the company. It was a case of saying, `So there it is; do you want to sign it now?'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That sort of negotiation seems to be recommended by those who espouse freedom and the opportunity for individuals to make choices on their own behalf. But I have said in public, and I repeat for this particular debate, that no matter how big, strong, noisy, fat and ugly somebody might be, that person is not necessarily qualified as a negotiator. Some of the wisest of these people have been able to recognise negotiation skills and elect others to do that on their behalf. This is a process which has taken 100 years to evolve. We now have recognised within our society the right to delegate, the right to elect, the right to appoint others to negotiate on our behalf. The old concept of the law of the jungle and the survival of the biggest and the strongest is not the concept which belongs in twentieth century Australia, much less in twenty-first century Australia, which is approaching. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leaving that and returning to the idea of deciding whether a particular person is an employee or a contractor&mdash;because I think it is germane to this debate&mdash;I point out that the Australian Taxation Office uses similar terms to those I have used already in discussing the New Zealand contract. The Taxation Office uses those terms to identify whether a person is a contractor or an employee. Although the Taxation Office's tests are to determine the liability for PAYE payments, I believe those tests are relevant to this debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I quote from part of the CCH Digest, the digest of Australian income tax rulings which is commonly used in taxation law. This ruling is dated 19 March 1985, and the ruling number given is IT 2129. I quote from it because it is instructive:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The presence of a right to control how, where, when and who is to carry out particular work points very strongly and usually conclusively to employee status.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the result of the "control" test is inconclusive, the "integration" test may be used. A person may be an employee if he is part and parcel of the principal's business organisation. A person satisfies the integration test if the relationship with his principal is a continuing one, or if his activities are restricted to providing service to one principal, or if the benefit arising from his work flows to the principal rather than to himself.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A contract that disguises what is really a master and servant relationship will not avoid the requirement for instalments to be deducted.</PARA>
<PARA>I know that we are not talking about whether PAYE instalments should be deducted, but I am still making the point that it is a relevant part of the test which should be applied to determine whether somebody is an employee or an independent contractor. I continue quoting from the Taxation Office's decision:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Timber workers, fruit and vegetable pickers, mining and exploration field workers and shearers are regarded as employees where their work is performed under the direction and control of the owner or principal contractor. Fishermen who work under the direction and control of the owner/operator of the fishing vessel are also regarded as employees even if they are paid on a "share of the catch" basis. Where in such cases a master and servant relationship does not exist tax instalments are still considered necessary in most instances because the payments are considered to be wholly or principally for the labour of the person.</PARA>
<PARA>The next passage is under the heading `Payments for labour'. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A payment made wholly or principally for the labour of the payee is subject to tax instalment deductions by virtue of the extended definition in para. (a) of the definition of "salary or wages" in sec. 221A(1). The purpose of the extended definition is to encompass payments to any individual who, although a contractor, is virtually in the position of an employee. In deciding whether an individual stands in this position, the following questions should be considered&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and this is where I think it is particularly relevant to this debate&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1. Does the individual perform tasks under general conditions similar to those applicable to employees? Whether he is paid in a similar way to an employee, whether he is provided with an office or workshop or other facilities, and whether he is expected to work towards an end preconceived and defined not by him but by someone else, are relevant considerations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2. Is the individual integrated in the business organisation of the principal, rather than being an accessory?</PARA>
<PARA>There is a little more on that, but I think the most relevant parts have been quoted. In those definitions there were examples, which may have sounded familiar to some honourable senators, of industries in which the question of designating somebody, a contractor, when they are really an employee has often arisen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The trouble is that in following that debate it is usually assumed that we are pointing the finger at the area of private enterprise. Lest it be assumed that these tests need to be applied only within the private enterprise sector, I think we should consider a letter from the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs. I think it is a damning piece of evidence of the inability of some sectors of the Government to understand exactly what the heck they are doing. This particular letter is signed `D.L. Westcott, Director, Language Services', and is dated 23 January this year. Part of it reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Interpreters and translators engaged by TIS are required to sign and abide by the terms as laid out in these documents as a condition of their employment with TIS.</PARA>
<PARA>The document referred to ignores all and every one of the tests that I have already quoted. In fact, section 5.1 on page 6 of the document reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the Language Service Provider is working as an Interpreter under this Agreement, he/she will not solicit work in a private capacity . . . </PARA>
<PARA>To me, that damns this document as a contractual agreement. The person signing it cannot possibly be considered an independent contractor because he does not have the capacity to make an agreement with a variety of principals; he is bound to this Department. As such, he really should be considered an employee. Essentially, being bound as an employee then brings with it the rights and obligations of being an employee and does not allow the freedoms and opportunities of being an independent contractor, able to solicit work from whomever that contractor might desire. A second test is failed by this document. Section 5.2 reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a Language Service Provider working as an Interpreter&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) must present himself/herself to clients in person; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) must not substitute another person to undertake the Language Services.</PARA>
<PARA>Again, the person who is supposed to become a contractor is suddenly denied the opportunity to subcontract that work out. Senator Panizza would know that one of the opportunities provided to all contractors is to pass down the work, if it is seen fit, to have the work done in any way that the contractor would choose to have done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people who are the subject of this document in fact organised themselves a little and wrote a letter to Dr Andrew Theophanous MP. In part, the letter reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some of the most fundamental issues of concern include:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1. Any "agreement" as the contract is termed, must have at least two parties; this "agreement" was totally unilateral without involvement of AUSIT representing the professional interests of interpreters and translators.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2. An amended form of the AUSIT Code of Ethics was attached to the contracts; such amendments were made without consultation or agreement of AUSIT.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the professional organisation had been ignored, and even its code of ethics had been altered without its consultation. Eight other concerns are spelt out. Even No. 6 of these concerns is most alarming. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6. While the contract enumerates at length the rights of DILGEA, the interpreters/translators are stripped of fundamental rights including:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">* intellectual property rights</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">* indemnity</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">* workers' compensation</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">* right to terminate the contract</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">* right to sub-contract</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">* right to refuse DILGEA's entry into their homes</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">* right to question DILGEA's "conflict of interest".</PARA>
<PARA>I do not enjoy presenting this to the Parliament. I would have thought that the Government would have been responsible enough to realise that such moves compromise the independence of people working for it and certainly do not set a good example. This is the very reason why such legislation is necessary, legislation which gives people who are subjected to unfair negotiation processes and unfair administration of their working conditions the opportunity to have their concerns addressed by the Industrial Relations Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation allows that to take place. The last contract I read to the chamber is very much the sort of contract which is far too common in our society. It illustrates the sort of negotiation which takes place and brings to us the sort of industrial chaos that we saw on our television screens only an hour or so ago: the sort of industrial chaos which comes from the unilateral declaration of a set of working conditions with little opportunity for the affected parties, the workers, to challenge the basis of what is being offered and to have the arrangements reviewed by an independent party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We could spend a fair bit of time considering that particular debate that is only too familiar to us.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part of the problem with this Bill is that before it had its first public hearing a campaign was wound up by those opposed to the concept of unions being involved in the industrial relations scene.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are debating this evening the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill 1992. In broad terms, this Bill, firstly, gives the Australian Industrial Relations Commission extensive new powers over independent contractors&mdash;whether they are prime contractors or subcontractors, I presume; secondly, replaces existing provisions relating to certified agreements; and, thirdly, confers specific duties on the new office of Vice President of the AIRC relating to union amalgamations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Parer said earlier, this Bill would be more aptly named the trade union subscription Bill. This Bill will have its greatest effect on the cottage industry, and I believe that that is what it is aimed at. It is designed to do nothing else but provide for trade union membership. It is not designed to force building workers or contractors or anyone else into the union; it is letting the union do that. It is designed to extend drastically trade union control over the cottage industry by recruiting contractors as union members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many people fail to understand that a lot of subcontractors especially are members of unions. They have the right to work as independent contractors, to work for a prime contractor or to work for a contractor who is building one house, two houses, or 100 houses. That is the relationship. They have a job to do; the contractor and the subcontractor sit down and come to an arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Does anyone in this chamber believe that if a subcontractor is asked to take on a contract that he does not think will give him normal wages he will sign that agreement? He absolutely will not sign an agreement if he sees that he will make less than normal wages out of the job; he will not make a living out of it. He will sign the agreement if he sees that he can do better than wages, otherwise he will go and get a wages job somewhere else. It is as simple as that.

I will talk mainly about the cottage industry because that is what I am interested in at the moment. I should declare my interest, just in case I am picked up later on; I build a few cottages and rental units and things like that. In the last 12 months or so the construction of high-rise buildings has stopped. That is where the union dominance was, and now the trade union officials have nothing else to do but interfere with the cottage industry, which has been working so well. The trade unions want to have a say in whether builders use subcontractors.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The builders claim&mdash;and I believe they are right&mdash;that if this Bill goes through as is it will put up the cost of an average Australian cottage by $25,000, and in a lot of cases by more than that. The average Australian cottage would cost about $90,000; $25,000 on top of that would make it a very expensive cottage. What does this do for the average Australian about whom Senator Bell is worried, the average Australian about whom the trade unions are worried, or are supposed to be? I am not a union basher; my father came out of the unions. If this Government wants to look after people, the first thing it can do is give them a reasonable wage and the chance of owning their own home&mdash;the great Australian dream. By forcing prices up by $30,000, housing will be beyond the level of affordability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even under this Government, interest rates have come down from their record high. One can borrow to build a house at interest rates of around 10.5 to 11 per cent, whereas 12 months ago the figure was up to 17 or 18 per cent. Just when Australian workers&mdash;young Australians, old Australians, anyone&mdash;are getting to the stage where they can afford to buy a house or upgrade their housing, the price is going to be forced up by 25 to 30 per cent. This will also drive up the cost of existing housing. Do not tell me it will not do that; it will. If a person cannot afford to build a new house, he will look at buying an existing house or he will continue renting, and prices will be forced up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot of property investors around Australia are laughing at this Bill. I asked an architect in Perth recently what he thought of this industrial relations Bill that was going to force up the price of housing. He was a fellow of around 50 or 55, looking towards retirement. He said, `At my stage of life, I'm laughing'. I asked him why. He said, `Because everything I own will be pushed up by 25 to 30 per cent'. He is right; that is what this Bill will do. Young people who are battling in this recession to get their first home will not be able to do so. Even existing buildings will be less affordable. There will be pressure on rentals and the cost of renting will rise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are in the worst depression we have had in 60 years, or probably in Australian history, and we are not coming out of it now, even though this Government thinks we are. In the worst part of this recession or depression or whatever it is, the vacancy ratio in Perth went up to only about 4.4 per cent to 5 per cent. Because of the downturn in new housing, that figure has already gone down to 2.2 per cent. If the cost of building or buying an existing house or of renting goes up by 25 or 30 per cent, the person who owns the house needs a better return and the vacancy rate will be wiped out. That is great for the people who hold rental properties, but it does not do anything for the average Australians whom these unions pretend they represent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this situation continues, I fear for the young people of Australia. We all have families to worry about, whether or not the unions worry about them. This is the result of Senator Cook's actions, when he pretends to represent the Australian worker. Whilst Senator Cook admits the cost increases, he insists that we will get better quality housing. Most Australians are more concerned about being able to buy their first house than about getting better quality. What is the point of getting better quality housing if people cannot afford it? Mr Acting Deputy President, if you want to trade in your Falcon or whatever it is in on, say, a Mercedes, while it would be a much better quality car to drive, it is not much good looking at a better quality car in the showroom if you cannot afford it. So it is a stupid argument for Senator Cook to say that we will get better quality housing. I do not believe we will. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said before, I have had a bit of experience in construction and real estate and I have found that some houses are better quality than others because of the fact that certain subcontracting teams specialise. Roofers, plasterers, grano workers and electricians specialise and work as a team. A team generally comprises two or three tradesmen and an apprentice. Roofers generally have three tradesmen on a team; an electrician works one for one, that is, a tradesman and one apprentice; and grano workers generally have three members in a reasonable sized team and five in bigger teams. They specialise and that is why there is better quality housing. That is better than employing one fellow here, another fellow there on each job and trying to bring those workers' efforts together in the completed job. A team working on a site has to be just that&mdash;a team. Subcontracting teams work together because they like working together. They may be mates and know how to complement each other. But when one man is recruited here and another here on each job, they do not necessarily work together. The specialisation occurs in the subcontracting team rather than the other way around. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned grano workers and would cite them as an  example. If grano workers are working on high-rise buildings and are ready for a pour at lunchtime, under the usual regulations on the day labour system they knock off at 12 o'clock and they let the cement go off the mix. Worse still, if they have just done a pour, the union fellow may come around and tell everyone to get off the job. That used to happen, and still does, on the big sites. Senator Cook knew a lot about that in Western Australia in the 1970s. If Government members do not believe me, I will give them a few quotes later on. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He was secretary of the TLC, I think. I know that employees have no incentive to work as a team or produce a well finished product. Their incentive is to pick up their wages at the end of the day. If employees do not want to work for the money that is offered, they are free to go somewhere else.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why are Australians the most efficient cottage builders in the world? The answer is that Australia not only has the most efficient cottage building industry but it has the best building codes. Incidentally, some States have better building codes than others. At the same time, we have the most inefficient high-rise building industry in the world. The Gyles Royal Commission explained the situation in its report only last week. The royal commission outlined the rorts that have been operating in the building industry by the union and by the master builders. That is where the problems in the building industry are to be found. They do not exist in the cottage industry where subcontractors work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far I have only addressed the building industry, and that is why Senator Cook is pushing the hardest for this Bill, but effect of the Bill does not finish there. The reason this Bill is before us in the Senate at present is that the advent of high-rise buildings is now at an end. The cranes have disappeared, most having been exported to Singapore where a lot of work is going on. High-rise building around Australia is ending&mdash;with one exception, and that is in Canberra. The high-rise building industry is ever expanding in this city because of the ever expanding Federal Government's civil service. We saw the deal that was done last week between the Labor Party and the Government on the building for the Australian National Audit Office, but time prevents my going into that matter further. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the end of high-rise buildings, the union dominance on those sites will move to other areas. As I said before, it is not limited to any particular industry or organisation, and most definitely not to the building industry. The contracting system is used in the mining, rural and transport industries. The transport industry is very important and the largest number of letters I receive relate to the transport industry. For example, a prime contractor takes on a reasonable sized contract and engages subbies who have the use of one vehicle. The contractor came to an arrangement before he looked for that contract. If the subcontractors did not agree to that, they did not offer their services. If they thought they would not get a reasonable return with one vehicle, whether large or small, they would not have gone into it. They came to an agreement with the prime contractor and the prime contractor got a contract. Now Senator Cook seeks to interfere with subcontractors. The result will be that the prime contractor will go broke and the person he is working for will have problems as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Industrial Relations Commission will be permitted to vary, or even set aside, agreements freely entered into between an employer and an independent contractor. The important thing to bear in mind is that a less than honest contractor can cut his price to get a job. He can cut the price down to the minimum and get the job ahead of others who charge higher prices. Once he has started the job, he can then run to the IRC. Government members need not tell me that that cannot be done. At the end of the job the contractor could say, `I have not made enough at this. Now you tell me what I should have made and I will have to be paid'. There is no appeal. The amount set down will have to be paid without appeal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am involved in the farming industry, an industry that  uses many subcontractors. I have in mind the shearing industry, contract harvesting, fencing and so on. </PARA>

But he has never been inside a shearing shed and should stick to the liquor trade, a trade that he is more used to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point is that the subcontracting system exists in the rural industry and subcontractors work very well with shearing, ploughing and fencing contractors. One particular person could take on a fencing contract. I could give a fencing contract for 12 kilometres of fencing to a subcontractor, supply the material, peg out the line and tell the subcontractor to go for his life. I could go away&mdash;perhaps come here for a fortnight because there are others there to watch what is going on and at the end the subcontractor could say, `I did not make enough out of this, so I will go to the Industrial Relations Commission and get more'. One has to pay up without any rights of appeal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill is all about union power. As well as union power, it is about Senator Cook's ideology as part of an agenda that, to my knowledge, he commissioned way back in the 1970s in Western Australia. I used to watch him on television night after night, the little bounce that he was. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JI4">Senator PANIZZA</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a pity Senator Sherry was not around in those days to see how Senator Cook went on, but he went quiet after a while. He was skiting how he was going to cause further strikes and hold-ups on construction sites. Now he is a Federal Minister, and any Federal Minister in this place or in the other place should be working for the good of all Australians and not just for the BWIU, or any other favourite union that the Minister used to belong to. That applies to anyone in this place. The Minister has his own agenda which is not necessarily for the good of the average Australian worker, let alone for anyone else. Obviously there will be higher and higher costs and more and more unemployment. But Senator Cook does not worry about that. Australia has one million unemployed and yet the Minister is putting forward this sort of legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, subcontracting is an opportunity for subcontractors to get into business themselves. Even Senator Foreman might recognise that fact. They start off as subcontractors, but the enterprising ones generally work towards a building ticket. They attend night school or something similar. They may be plumbers, electricians, granos or brickies and they get their building ticket at night school. So they then become prime contractors themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is going to be done now? Day labourers and people without hands-on experience in the building industry are going to try to get into business; the result will generally be disaster. That point is very important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned Senator Cook and how he used to carry on in the 1970s. I will quote some of the relevant statements of the time. I will only selectively quote, otherwise I will be here all night:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After the 5 1/2 hour ACTU meeting, Mr Cook conveyed the resolution by telephone to TLC officers in Perth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Ban would halt the export of iron ore, bauxite, mineral sands, wood chips and nickel. There would also be a later move to extend the ban to include all key exports from Australia, including coal from Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA>This was supposed to be good for Australia. It occurred on 20 June 1979. Do not tell me Senator Cook was not a big little boy then! His idea was that cutting off all exports was good for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A newspaper article written before Senator Cook came to Federal Parliament said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He enjoyed the role of industrial fireman&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>not an industrial hoser down, but an industrial fireman&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">but now wants to be a "long-term builder"&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I do not think he will be a long term builder the way he is going&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">with hopes of acquiring a better understanding of what causes the conflict.</PARA>
<PARA>He has not learned much since 1979. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He enjoyed being at the centre of the major disputes in WA&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>he enjoyed causing them&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">in recent years&mdash;the long stoppage at Mt Newman in 1977; the 11-week strike at Hamersley Iron in 1979; and the two-year battle for the 36-hour week at Alcoa.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He said: "Certainly one reason was the alliance that we had&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>this was at the time of the big Noonkanbah dispute&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">with the Aboriginal people&mdash;they took the decisions and we carried them out.</PARA>
<PARA>So Senator Cook even interfered there. He certainly came out second best. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will summarise what is wrong with this Bill. Independent contractors are the backbone of the housing industry of Australia. That is why so many Australians can afford houses. I know that many more Australians, especially young Australians, but also older Australians, would like to own their own houses; But, by comparison with world standards, the number of people who own their own houses in Australia is fairly high, especially for people of foreign extraction. If this Bill is carried, that number will be cut back. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Independent subcontractors are the backbone of the housing industry, which is a shining example of flexible labour marketing operations. Senator Collins is always telling us how flexible the waterfront is. It is certainly inflexible when one thinks of how those involved in it carry on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why does a subcontractor, previously a tradesman, abandon a day job? He abandons it because he thinks he can do better. Builders are abandoning the security of company jobs and industrial awards for the satisfaction of relying on their own ability to succeed. I have already said that their earnings depend on establishing a reputation for quality and reliability. People will employ someone with a track record to build a house for them; they will not employ someone who comes from one job on a single building site, especially if it is a high-rise building site. I would not look at such a person a second time. After these tradespeople have done their share as subbies, they go on to establish their own businesses. Bringing self-employed contractors under the Industrial Relations Commission is certainly the wrong way to go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is ironic that, at a time when Australia must achieve more flexible arrangements in the labour market&mdash;Senator Collins claims to have flexible arrangements on the waterfront; he seems to be leaving Mr Sharp alone these days because Mr Sharp has moved out of that portfolio&mdash;the Federal Government is trying to erode one of the best examples of enterprise bargaining in the national economy. Senator Bell mentioned how employees are given contracts which they are forced to sign; they are told, `Sign this&mdash;or else go down the road'. We are in a deep recession; it was a depression. It was not so long ago&mdash;just before this Government came into power and in its early years, before it sent us to the depths of despair we are in now&mdash;that things used to be vastly different in the building industry. There was no call for union domination then because tradesman could demand what they liked. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember building in the country in 1984. One had to pay twice what is paid now to get a brickie team. That is supply and demand, as far as the economy goes. When there is a boom, subcontractors, like other building workers, demand and get big money. When there is no boom, the genuine ones&mdash;the ones who do not want this industrial relations Bill&mdash;are prepared to take less until things turn around. Otherwise, the only alternative is to get a waste job or go on social security. A lot of teams have stayed together knowing that, when we get into government, times will improve. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">BROADCASTING SERVICES BILL 1992</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill is the culmination of a long effort to bring the 50 year old Broadcasting Act of 1942 up to date. It gives effect to the Government's 1987 election commitment, reiterated in 1990, to establish an appropriate regulatory framework for the broadcasting industry that will serve Australia into the 21st century.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's micro-economic reform agenda has already achieved landmark reforms in telecommunications, aviation, the national rail system and the waterfront. Now it is time to turn to the antiquated, even nightmarish, legislation that regulates the broadcasting industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senators will recall that the Hon Kim Beazley, when Minister for Transport and Communications, tabled a draft Broadcasting Services Bill in the House of Representatives on 7 November 1991 as a basis for public consultation. That consultation process has been wide-ranging and comprehensive. Considerable change and improvement has been made to the original draft as a result.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The final form of the Bill balances the diverse, and often conflicting, aspirations of those interested in the broadcasting industry to develop a regulatory framework that serves public interest in all its dimensions&mdash;social, cultural and economic&mdash;while also meeting the needs of a changing and growing industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Let me outline for the benefit of honourable senators the reasons behind the need for change and the regulatory philosophy that underpins the provisions of the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Need for Change</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since 1983, there have been some 20 substantial amendments to the Broadcasting Act 1942. Further ad hoc amendments will only add to its complexity and the potential for more loopholes to be created and exploited.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We need new legislation capable of allowing the broadcasting industry to respond to both the complexities of the modern market-place and the opportunities created by technological developments. Continuing to inhibit the natural development of this industry through outdated and cumbersome regulation will disadvantage consumers and be detrimental to the longer term prospects for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The limitations of the current Act have constrained development and structural adjustment of the broadcasting industry, and thus diversity of choice for consumers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has blinkered us to the technologies looming on the horizon, resulting in a slow take-up of technologies that have been available for years elsewhere.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We cannot and must not continue to ignore new technologies such as Digital Audio Broadcasting and compressed digital video. If we do, we run the risk of missing out altogether on development opportunities for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Regulatory Philosophy</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill before you provides a coherent regulatory framework based on a need to accommodate future developments. It continues to recognise that broadcasting is integral to developing an Australian identity and cultural diversity. It is vital to the operation of a democratic society. While this means that there must continue to be obligations placed on broadcasters, the Bill has nonetheless been developed in the context of the Government's broader micro-economic reform agenda. Every effort has been made to avoid unnecessary regulation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Underpinning the whole framework is the intention that different levels of regulatory control apply across the range of broadcasting services according to the degree of influence that such services are able to exert.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill incorporates objectives and policy guidelines. It sets out the categories of service, describing them by their nature rather than by their technical means of delivery&mdash;it should thus not need constant amendment as technical conditions change. It provides for: new types and greater numbers of services to emerge;  greater public access to the regulatory processes; a continuation of obligations on broadcasters in relation to program standards; and ensures that Parliament's objectives about diversity of ownership are effectively delivered. It provides for far more accountability, while retaining a suitable measure of statutory independence for the regulatory agency.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At a more general level, the Bill seeks to set rules and requirements that are consistent with wider commercial regulation such as the Trade Practices Act and Corporations Law, except where industry-specific regulatory requirements have been pre-determined by Government policy. The processes proposed for program standards and industry codes of practice for programming, particularly the commissioning of robust research, seek to ensure that these standards reflect widespread community views. The rules, processes and enforcement provisions have less potential for abuse and delay and should ensure that both the letter and the intent of Government policies in these areas are delivered.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Provisions of the Bill</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, let me now briefly outline for the benefit of honourable senators key provisions of each part of the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Objectives:  The objects at Part 1 clearly state the outcomes we believe this Parliament seeks from the regulation of broadcasting. They focus on the need to provide a regulatory environment that will encourage an industry that is efficient and responsive to its audiences. The need for objects was widely supported in the consultation as necessary to clarify the outcomes for the industry expected by the Parliament. It is recognised that there are some inherent tensions between the objects that will need to be balanced by the regulator and the courts. Individual objectives emphasise the audience/consumer focus of the Bill and the desire to promote services which develop and reflect a sense of Australia's cultural diversity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Regulatory Policy:  The regulatory policy at Part 1 is a key provision of the Bill, building on the objects by outlining the philosophy to be pursued in administering the Act. It emphasises the need to deal with each type of service in a consistent, but not necessarily uniform, fashion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Categories of Broadcasting:  The categories of broadcasting service contained in Part 2 are the fundamental building blocks of the Bill. This is where we start to see the philosophy at work. Different degrees of regulation apply to each category of service based on an assessment, against listed criteria, as to how influential the service is. The categories are: national broadcasting services; commercial broadcasting services; community broadcasting services; subscription broadcasting services; subscription narrowcasting services; and open narrowcasting services. "Pay TV" would come within the subscription broadcasting category. Narrowcasters would include niche services like information services for tourists in hotels and the sports services to pubs and clubs. There was general acceptance of this industry structure during the consultation phase, as it better groups service types according to their market role and power to influence. Thus it allows differing degrees of intervention to ensure that the regulations imposed are only those necessary to meet Government objectives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the Bill acknowledges that, as a general principle, the ABC and SBS services are appropriately governed under their own Acts, the conditions of the Bill apply where they provide services that come within the ambit of the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Planning:  The planning provisions will give greater industry certainty, and allow public input to key decisions about the introduction of new services in the broadcasting services bands. A significant reform in the Bill gives the new Australian Broadcasting Authority responsibility for planning of the broadcasting services bands. Section 23 lays out criteria to use in performing these functions based on the need to promote the economic and efficient use of spectrum and having regard to a range of factors including social and economic characteristics, technology, and demand for new services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is significant in that the ABA, the regulator of the broadcasting sector, will hold responsibilities for planning, licensing and program standards. Bringing these together will give it the scope to bring to bear the full range of technical, social, economic and public interest considerations in the critical judgements it has to make.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ABA planning is only required for services using currently scarce radiofrequency spectrum. In the first instance these will be bands used for AM and FM radio and UHF and VHF TV. Priorities must be established for the provision of new services and planning processes must be public. The Minister for Transport and Communications will retain responsibility for high level policy planning decisions and reservation of broadcasting spectrum capacity for the ABC, SBS and community broadcasters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To prevent waste of a valuable public resource, there are provisions to allow temporary release of radio frequency spectrum for alternative uses when not required for broadcasting purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill contains a legislative requirement for a review, before 1 July 1997, to assess the national benefits if more than three TV stations were permitted. The review will take into account the state of the entire broadcasting industry at that time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Licensing of Commercial Broadcasting Services:  Licensing provisions for commercial radio and television, at Part 4 of the Bill, have been streamlined. The new arrangements will allow automatic renewal in most cases and there will be no requirement for formal, regular, financial reporting by licensees. The Bill also establishes a range of requirements to be observed by licences as enforceable conditions on a licence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Licences for all new commercial services will be allocated according to a price-based competitive allocation mechanism in which economic rents can be garnered as a one-off payment and returned to the public. This approach is consistent with the precedent already set in the recent allocation of radio licences.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The regulatory authority is no longer required to hold public inquiries before allocating or renewing every individual licence. This is unnecessary when planning is  done through a public process. The ABA has a clear role  to monitor the industry. It also has powers to intervene at any time during the currency of a licence to act on breaches of licence conditions or this Act. The complaints process and the option to conduct random audits for regulatory compliance will also act as a disincentive to breaches of the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Control of Broadcasting Services: Control provisions at Part 5 are another key reform of the Bill. The provisions focus on the important concept of control of a licence in which the level of equity holding is only one factor. In recognition of the increasing complexity of corporate structures, they move from the rigidity of attempting to describe every possible ownership or control structure to laying down unambiguous conditions and limits that must be observed by licensees. They empower the ABA to investigate and act on any suspected artifice or arrangement that may seek to contravene them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The existing cross-media limits for commercial radio and commercial TV and newspapers have been retained in the Bill to encourage diversity of media ownership. Foreign ownership limits for commercial television have also been retained to ensure Australians have effective control of these services. The audience reach limits for commercial television licensees has been increased from 60% to 75% recognising the economies of scale that can be reaped through use of modern communication technology and the potential for diversity and choice of additional program sources that can be offered if existing services can be extended.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Definitions and exemptions have been tightened to clarify the treatment of relationships between licensees and lenders.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The limitation on the number of radio stations controlled by a person in a licence area has been increased from one to two. In metropolitan areas this will allow licensees to experiment with different formats within a single market. In regional areas, this two-to-a market rule enables an operator in a single station market to take up a second licence, thus increasing the range of services on offer. A second licence in single service markets will only be issued where there is another unused frequency available for any future entrant.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All ABA decisions related to control are required to be included in a register to provide better public access and accountability.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Community Broadcasting Services: The public broadcasting sector's role in Australia's broadcasting system continues to be recognised. This sector has been renamed "community" broadcasters to better reflect its important role in local communities. Community broadcasting licences for services using reserved spectrum will continue to be awarded by a comparative merit selection process within guidelines laid down in the legislation and any directions issued by the Minister for Transport and Communications. Restrictions have been placed on the nature and extent of sponsorship announcements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Subscription Television Broadcasting: Part 7 provides for a competitive, more market-driven, approach to the introduction of these services, colloquially known as Pay TV, and for their continued regulation. The arrangements will realise greater diversity in ownership and program types and provide a wide choice of services to subscribers. They offer unlimited scope for commercial and technical innovation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The technological neutrality of the Bill is no more apparent than for subscription broadcasting services. Licensees are encouraged to use whichever delivery mechanism suits their commercial needs. This will contribute to the commercial modernisation of Australia's communications infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This after all will be the most significant and largest scale new entertainment service that we will see in the next few years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These services must be customer-driven to survive. They are subject to the ultimate test that if people don't want them, they won't pay.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a blanket prohibition on X-rated material and R-rated material can be accessed only by using a PIN number, smart card or equivalent secure device in recognition of community concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Satellite is the only technology that allows immediate access to 94% of Australians. The delivery capacity is scarce and an equitable, price-based process is included to allocate transponders on the Optus satellites. Optus will be the only supplier of transponders for licensed services until 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Industry development criteria will ensure that Australian manufacturing has the opportunity to participate in the provision of the hardware. The selection process will also be used to ensure that the new in-home entertainment equipment selected by the first service will be accessible for use by later operators, with benefits to consumers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our film and television production industry will also benefit from the new demand for programming. An Australian content requirement for drama channels on all satellite broadcasting services has been set. Licensees will be required to spend at least 10% of program expenditure on these channels on new Australian programs. This will make a significant contribution to the development of the Australian production industry in providing jobs and developing creative Australian product,  with potential for export. The Government's aim in setting Australian content regulation for subscription satellite services is to send a signal to the industry that it has a role to play in the development of the Australian film and television industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Once we have some experience of Pay TV and it becomes an established industry, there will be a review of the operation of the condition relating to Australian content on satellite subscription television broadcasting licensees. This would be done by mid 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The review will look at how licensees have met Australian audience needs and whether further regulation is needed to address any shortcomings. It will examine how the 10% expenditure requirement has been used in practice and the opportunities which have been generated for Australian creative talent and also the nature of Australian programming in non-drama areas. It will need to take account of the prevailing environment of all television services free-to-air, subscription broadcasting and narrowcasting.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A number of ownership conditions apply to the four transponder service. Ownership rules set for this service should see the emergence of a new player in this industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No free-to-air television equity is allowed. The telecommunications carriers and large newspaper groups have also been excluded. Foreign ownership on all subscription television services is restricted to 35% aggregate, with a 20% limit on any individual.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although the more restrictive ownership limits on the initial four transponder licence will reduce the number of Australian companies which are able to participate in its operation, the advantages provided by being the first multi-channel operator gives it significant value.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The commercial television networks, national broadcasters such as the ABC, and telecommunications carriers such as AOTC will be able to wholly own a single transponder licence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No one will be able to control more than one satellite licence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Subscription Broadcasting and Narrowcasting Licences: Part 8 provides a sensible licensing regime for the least influential of the broadcasting service categories, subscription radio broadcasting and subscription and open narrowcasting. These will be regulated as "class licenses".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Examples of such services are those which are currently operated pursuant to the Video and Audio Entertainment and Information Services Guidelines. Once the provisions in this Bill are fully in place, the guidelines (tabled by the former Minister for Communications, the Hon Michael Duffy on October 17 1986) will no longer have effect. Instead, the class licence conditions set out in Part 7 of schedule 2 will apply.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Class licences are an open, standing authority for anyone to operate a service, provided it complies with the conditions of the particular class licence relevant to that service type. Thus, before offering a service, intending providers will need to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) satisfy themselves that the intended service falls within a class licence category; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">b) obtain access to an appropriate delivery mechanism through the necessary transmission licences to deliver the service, (for example by obtaining a radiocommunications licence).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Services not complying with the conditions of the class licence are subject to a range of enforceable sanctions including fines, with the ultimate sanction of turning off the service.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Class licence services are subject to the Trade Practices Act 1974, which prohibits anti-competitive behaviour and unfair practices.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The class licensing regime is expected to facilitate the emergence of innovative services, catering to specialised interests which are not well served at present. This is another aspect of the forward looking and pro-competitive approach reflected in a number of parts of the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Program Standards are at Part 9 of the Bill. The approach in the Bill balances cultural objectives and community standards of taste and decency with the commercial realities of service provision. Since different types of services have varying degrees of influence, according to their ready availability or accessibility, they require different levels of direct regulation. The Bill therefore provides for a greater degree of regulation of free-to-air commercial television broadcasting services than for other services. Standards for Australian content and for children's television are mandatory requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For the first time the onus is strongly placed on broadcasters to develop appropriate industry codes of practice. Guidance is given in the Bill on matters that codes can deal with. The ABA's research will be an important aid to the industry in developing these codes. Where industry codes are not developed to meet community concerns, where they fail to meet those concerns, or where they fail to be implemented adequately, the ABA is empowered to step in.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is significant public access and accountability in the standard setting process. The legislation specifies that the ABA must determine standards for Australian content and children's programs on commercial television; there is a requirement that the ABA must seek public comment when setting or changing standards; and the ABA is required to satisfy itself that members of the public must be given an adequate opportunity to comment on industry codes of practice before they can be registered.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is the Government's intention that codes of practice are regularly reviewed by the ABA to satisfy itself that they continue to meet community needs. The Minister has a power to direct such action if it does not occur. The area of advertising time standards will be of particular interest. The standard recently set by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal in response to a clear failure in this area by the industry will continue in force for two years or until the industry determines its code or practice. No doubt this standard will be reflected in that code.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The inclusion of a requirement for a code of practice for Australian music on radio reflects the need to promote Australian character, identity and culture through this medium and to continue to foster a vibrant and successful Australian music industry. I urge the industry to fully investigate opportunities for increasing Australian content on radio.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Codes of practice will be required from the television industry for captioning of programs. This recognises the importance of these services in providing equity of access to television for the hearing impaired.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part 10 provides the enforcement regime for remedying licensing and other breaches of the Bill. Breaches of the control regime are separately provided for in Part 5. In drafting Part 10, the criticism of the Broadcasting Act 1942 that it provided the regulator with too limited a range of redressive measures was addressed and a wider range of remedies provided to the ABA.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is an offence to provide a service without an appropriate licence. This offence can attract fines commensurate with their ability to influence community attitudes. Penalties for individuals range from a maximum of $2,000,000 per day for providing a commercial broadcasting service without a licence to $5,000 per day for providing a community radio broadcasting service without a licence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The magnitude of the penalties is consistent with the Telecommunications Act and changes proposed in other commercial legislation. They will act as a disincentive to service providers to push the regulatory boundaries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When a service is provided without a licence, the ABA can either brief the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) or issue a notice to cease providing a service without authority. Failure to comply with a notice is itself a breach with the same penalties as the direct offence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Breaches of licence conditions are likely to be the most frequent offences, with many being minor breaches. It is an offence to breach a licence condition with maximum daily penalties ranging from $200,000 to $5,000.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ABA has the following range of remedies available to it:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) discussions with the service provider with a view to rectifying the problem;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) imposition of a licence condition, such as requiring compliance with a code of practice;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) briefing the DPP on the breach, with the possibility of Court imposed fines;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) issuing a notice to take a specified action to remedy a breach in a specified time or to cease providing a service;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(e) briefing the DPP on breach of a notice, with the possibility of Court imposed fines;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(f) for licensed services, suspension or cancellation of the licence; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(h) for class licensed services, seeking a Federal Court order that the person cease providing the service.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To avoid "double jeopardy" the ABA is limited to undertaking action under only one of (c) and (d) at a time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Prosecutions for offences with maximum penalties exceeding $50,000 may only be brought in the Federal Court.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This range of remedies allows the ABA to take action commensurate with the seriousness of the breach. For the regime of monitoring, investigation and enforcement to be effective, it is important that the ABA is active in informing itself and responding to emerging problems.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mechanisms for Complaints to the ABA are provided for at Part 11. It is important in all industries that consumer protection mechanisms exist where consumers can seek redress for any perceived wrong-doing. In broadcasting, where a consumer is not satisfied with aspects of a service or is concerned about a particular program, there needs to be an effective mechanism to handle complaints.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Each sector of the broadcasting industry other than the  national broadcasters will be required to develop a code of practice, in consultation with the Australian Broadcasting Authority (ABA), relating to complaints mechanisms. The code is to be registered with the ABA only after it is satisfied with the contents of the code and that there has been adequate public consultation. If the code fails the ABA may introduce a standard, which also must involve public consultation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Complaints about offences or breaches of the Act may be made directly to the ABA. Members of the public may complain directly to the ABA about breaches of codes of practice. In this instance, the ABA is likely to refer them to the industry sector for resolution through mechanism developed as part of the code of practice. A complainant may also take a complaint to the ABA if there has not been an industry response within 60 days or if the complainant is not satisfied with the industry response.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A similar mechanism applies to national broadcasters as an independent complaints handling mechanism of last resort.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australian Broadcasting Authority: Parts 12-15 of the Bill deal with the Australian Broadcasting Authority (ABA) that will be formed by merging the broadcasting planning elements of the Department of Transport and Communications with the licensing and program monitoring resources of the ABT. This will create a single body responsible for the regulation of all aspects of broadcasting, and should lead to an integrated and resource efficient approach to regulation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Members of the ABA will be appointed by the Governor-General, and will include a Chairperson, a Deputy Chairperson, and not more than 5 Members, each appointed for fixed terms. The Minister may appoint associate members for particular investigations or hearings or for investigations or hearings of a particular type.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The appointments to this body will be crucial to its effectiveness and it must be adequately resourced if it is to discharge its responsibilities effectively.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Broad discretion is afforded the ABA in the conduct of its functions, but this does not extend to all areas of its work. The range of powers which ABA Members may delegate has been restricted to less substantial powers. Decisions which must be made by Members include licence allocation; cancellation or suspension of licences; determinations of suitability; determination of class licence categories; determination of program standards; determination of licence conditions; the provision of opinions on licence categories or control issues; giving prior approval for breaches of the Act; the issuance of notices; extension of time for compliance with notices; and, the issuance of warrants to seize documents not produced when requested by the ABA.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ABA has wide-ranging information gathering powers at Part 13 to enable it to effectively perform its functions, including</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&mdash;consulting with persons, bodies or groups, and forming consultative committees as appropriate;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&mdash;calling for submissions from the public; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&mdash;conducting hearings and investigations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All information gathering powers are to be used in a manner which is the quickest and most economical in the circumstances, and which promotes the due administration of the Act. Various notification provisions will ensure the ABA is informed of changes to the ownership or control of broadcasting licences.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An investigation is the more informal means by which the ABA can gather information. The procedural conduct of investigations will vary in every circumstance and is left to the discretion of the ABA.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some people have raised concerns about the use of these powers in relation to uncovering journalists sources of information. This Bill does not impose any new powers in this area that are not present in other legislation. It makes no specific mention of journalists in relation to powers of investigation. Journalists perform a valuable role in discovering important information that may otherwise remain hidden. Protection of confidentiality of sources is part of that role.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The provisions in this Bill are intended, among other things, to allow the ABA to obtain crucial information to uncover major breaches of this Act. However, I would expect it to take a prudent and reasonable approach in exercising these powers in relation to journalists gathering information for news and current affairs reports.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ABA can hold public hearings into any matters relevant to the administration of the Act. Hearings can be held whenever necessary, and the ABA will accept submissions from the public. People can be summonsed to answer questions or produce documents.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister retains an over-riding responsibility for broadcasting policy issues and specific powers are given to the Minister in the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister will have the power to direct the ABA to conduct investigations or hearings into matters affecting the development of broadcasting in Australia and make recommendations to the Government. The Minister can direct the ABA to reserve channels for the provision of national and community broadcasting services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister can determine price based allocation mechanisms for the allocation of licences, and can also direct the ABA in the manner in which it gathers information.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Parliament has an overriding power to disallow directions given to the ABA by the Minister. It could also disallow regulations developed by the ABA, such as variations to categories of services or licence conditions for certain classes of broadcasting. The ABA is required to report to Parliament annually.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When it is first established, the various elements comprising the ABA will stay in their present locations. This approach will minimise disruption in the initial stages. Ultimately however, all elements of the ABA should be co-located.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are important miscellaneous provisions in Part 15 of the Bill. It is made clear that fees determined under the Act must not exceed the costs of processing the application or doing the thing to which the fee relates. It provides special provisions relating to the retransmission of programs, to enable programs to be retransmitted outside a licence area with the permission of the ABA.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As it is the Government's intention that there will continue to be widespread consultation with consumers and the industry over future developments in broadcasting policy, provision is made for the establishment of Ministerial consultative and advisory bodies. The Part also introduces an important provision which allows "time sharing" on a single frequency, with each licensee being responsible for each portion of the broadcast.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Financial Impact</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Full funding implications cannot be assessed until decisions are made on licence fees for commercial broadcasting services, and on the detail for the price-based competitive licence allocation processes. Staff savings, in both the ABT and those parts of the Department of Transport and Communications which are to be merged into the new ABA, can be expected but these may be offset by having to employ specialist skills as the need arises. Savings will accrue to the broadcasting industry from reduction in reporting requirements, and in the costs arising from regulatory intervention. Greater competition and a wider range of broadcasting services will improve the efficiency of the broadcasting industry. Facilitating the emergence of new broadcasting and other communications technologies, together with the anticipated increase in the range of services available, are expected to generate considerable economic activity relating to the supply of equipment and programs for broadcasting services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, in conclusion I wish to thank all of those who have participated in the consultative process that led to the finalisation of this important piece of legislation. The Bill is better for the input of so many people.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will serve Australia well and allow the broadcast media to carry out its important role in our society in a responsive and effective way.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the Bill to the Senate and present the Explanatory Memorandum to the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">      BROADCASTING SERVICES       (TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS AND </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In introducing the Broadcasting Services Bill a few minutes ago, I pointed out the substantial differences between the Broadcasting Services Bill approach and that of the current Broadcasting Act. Whenever we change from a highly regulatory, hands on system to one focused on matters of real concern and stressing flexibility of approach, there is obviously a need to move current services from the old system to the new, with a minimum of disruption. There is also a need to provide for the completion of matters being considered and to ensure effective interaction between the new Act and other legislation. In addition, there is a need to ensure that the legislation does not unwittingly place people in breach of the new Act if they are currently complying with the law and their circumstances remain the same.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is the purpose of this Bill. To ensure a smooth transition to the new Broadcasting Services Bill regime.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill is complex, but it deals with complex issues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clauses 5 to 9 deem current broadcasting services which will be subject to the regulatory regime of the Broadcasting Services Bill to be licensed under that Bill (either on an individual or class licence basis) and will fix the terms, licence areas and conditions of those deemed licences. This approach gives the Australian Broadcasting Authority the same degree of control over those licences as it will have over licences actually granted by it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 10, and related amendments to the Radiocommunications Act 1983 in Schedule 2, will ensure that access to the radiofrequency spectrum is preserved on the same conditions as before. Under the proposed section 24B of that Act, radiofrequency licences for commercial and community broadcasting services will remain in force while the related broadcasting service licences are in effect and have not been suspended. That section will apply to current commercial, remote, supplementary and public broadcasting services, whereas limited licences and retransmission permits will be deemed to have licences under section 24 of the Radcom Act for the remainder of the period of their licence or permit. After that, narrowcasting and retransmission services will have to obtain Radcom Act licences. This includes retransmission  services which may not currently hold permits under the Broadcasting Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clauses 11, 12 and 13 allows uncompleted Australian Broadcasting Tribunal licensing inquiries to be completed. Applications for renewal of what will be commercial or community broadcasting services will, under clause 11, be deemed to have been granted immediately before the commencement of the Bill. This will give the services the maximum renewal period (in most cases, 5 years), but will not prevent the new Australian Broadcasting Authority from exercising its powers to investigate and hold hearings if it is considered warranted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the case of applications for the grant of what will, under the Broadcasting Services Bill, be commercial or community broadcasting services, clause 12 will allow the ABA to complete ABT licence grant inquiries under the current provisions of the Broadcasting Act as if it were the ABT. Any licence granted by the ABA under the Broadcasting Act will be dealt with under clauses 5 and 10 and will thus be translated into the new scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of course, there is no reason why applicants cannot withdraw their applications under the Broadcasting Act if they prefer the simpler and more expeditious Broadcasting Services Bill approach. I suspect that may happen in a number of cases.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Applications for what will be class licences under the new scheme will be dealt with under clause 13 as applications for a licence under the Radcom Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Non licensing inquiries by the ABT will cease to have effect on commencement of the Bill. This will not prevent the ABA taking up the work already done by the ABT, but it will ensure that the ABA can set its own priorities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has no intention of reneging on its commitment to ensuring additional services, both under Stage 1 of the Metropolitan Radio Plan (which allows metropolitan AM commercial radio stations to convert to FM) and the Equalisation of Regional Commercial Television policy. Stage 1 of the National Metropolitan Radio Plan is substantially complete, but clause 14 will preserve the relevant provisions of the Broadcasting Act until the Plan is fully implemented.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Paragraph 9(1)(d) and subclause 9(3) will preserve the obligations of licensees who are in the process of implementing equalisation, whereas clause 15 will allow the policy to be implemented in Tasmania, where the proposed 2 service form of aggregation has not yet commenced.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I have already mentioned, one of the underlying principles of this Bill is that it should not unwittingly place people in breach of the new Act if they are  currently complying with the law and their circumstances remain the same. Clauses 16, 17, 18 and 19 ensure that, where the rules of the Broadcasting Services Bill vary from the current rules, persons who currently hold directorships or who are not deemed to control a service under the current Act will not breach the new Bill by virtue of their current position or interests.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Naturally, any significant change in personal circumstances will deprive people of the protection of these clauses. They will then have to comply fully with the requirements of the Broadcasting Services Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An issue of concern to a number of people is that of program standards for broadcasters. The Broadcasting Services Bill requires the ABA to maintain standards in the crucial areas of children's programming and Australian content, but only gives it the power to make standards on other topics where codes of practice fail or where no code of practice is made. Both the ABA and the industry need time to comply with these rules, but it would be undesirable for the industry to be totally exempt from program standards in the meantime.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 20 deems certain provisions of the Broadcasting Act and relevant ABT standards to be the ABA standards for children's programming and Australian content. They will remain in force until the ABA develops its own standards.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The remaining ABT standards will also continue as if they were standards adopted by the ABA, but only until a relevant industry code is registered or for 2 years, whichever is the later. This will give the industry ample time to develop codes of practice after full public consultation and also the incentive to complete their work as soon as possible. Naturally, if codes have not been registered within the 2 year period, or if they are inadequate, the ABA can adopt its own standards.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The clause also provides for the ABT standards, or parts of those standards, to cease in respect of particular sectors of the industry if that sector has developed and registered relevant codes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is considering the most appropriate method of recompensing the public for access by commercial broadcasters to a scarce public resource, the radiofrequency spectrum. The options include a one off payment on grant of a licence and ongoing licence fees based either on the value of the spectrum or, as is currently the case, on income derived from its use. Another option is a combination of both. This gives rise to complex issues, such as the assessment of the value of spectrum and what should happen in relation to current licensees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consequently, the Broadcasting Services Bill, which  provides for a price based allocation system for new commercial licences, while existing commercial licensees will continue to pay annual, income based licence fees under the Radio Licence Fees Act 1964 and the Television Licence Fees Act 1964, pending further Government consideration of the issue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 23 and the relevant consequential amendments to the Licence Fees Act will achieve this result.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clauses 22, 23, 24 and 25 will preserve the current right and obligations of the ABT and enforce current directions and orders.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The staff of the ABT are employed under the Public Service Act 1922 and will be redeployed under that Act. There is no need to make specific provision for them here.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ABA will be required to observe the secrecy provisions of the Broadcasting Act in relation to documents transferred to it by the ABT. The Broadcasting Services Bill has no specific secrecy provisions and we would not wish persons supplying information to the ABT to feel that its confidentiality would in any way be compromised under the Bill. However, a range of legal requirements under the Freedom of Information Act, the Privacy Act, the Public Service Act and the common law rules about disclosure during litigation of truly confidential material offer perfectly adequate guarantees under the new Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 26 recognises the fact that current technology standards under the Broadcasting Act must now be transferred to the Radiocommunications Act, the source of regulation of technical issues under the new scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 27 preserves the political broadcasting provisions of the Broadcasting Act. They are currently under challenge in the High Court and it is appropriate that they should not be touched pending the court's decision on their validity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 28 and Schedule 1 will repeal Acts which have no relevance to the new scheme and clause 29 and Schedule 2 make necessary consequential amendments to other Acts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Those consequential amendments are primarily formal in nature, but I should mention a number of points.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They include amendments to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983 and the Special Broadcasting Service Act 1991  which tie into the provisions applicable to the ABC and SBS in the Broadcasting Services Bill. The amendments in this Bill will require the ABC and SBS to develop codes of practice on programming matters and to notify those codes to the ABA. They will also allow the ABC to participate in subscription television broadcasting to the extent permitted under the Broadcasting Services Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have mentioned the licensing regime for services under the Radiocommunications Act. The initial planning for all services, broadcasting or radiocommunications, is also done under that Act, although a new subsection 19(3) will allow the Minister to assign certain parts of the spectrum to the ABA for planning purposes. The Minister will not plan for individual services in those bands and the licensing regime of the Act will only allow radiocommunications services to be licensed in those parts of the spectrum if the ABA allows the frequencies to "drop through" under clause 34 of the Broadcasting Services Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed section 92A of the Radiocommunications Act will also allow price based allocation systems to be determined in respect of the grant of Radcom Act transmitter or receiver licences. The system may apply generally, or in respect of specified areas or frequencies to licences of a kind identified for the purpose in the regulations. Price based allocation is likely to be used where there is substantial competition for available spectrum. Examples may well include subscription services. However, this allocation system will not apply to the broadcasting services bands except in respect of frequencies which the ABA has "dropped through" under subsection 34(1) of the Broadcasting Services Bill 1992. Details of successful applicants and the amount agreed to be paid to be published in the Gazette.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A proposed subsection 25(8A) of the Radcom Act will also allow conditions to be imposed on new entrants to the radiofrequency spectrum to require them not only to rectify interference problems caused by their entry, but to ask persons affected to approach them for that purpose.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the Bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">FINANCIAL IMPACT</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will continue the current licence fees regime for existing commercial broadcasters and thus will have no direct impact on revenue or expenses. It is likely that new services, particularly services provided under "class licences", will be licensed under the Radcom Act as a result of the new scheme and the consequential amendments made to the Act under this Bill. This should increase revenues from licence fees from those services. The extent of those additional revenues will depend on demand, a factor which will be hard to predict accurately until some experience of the scheme is built up.</PARA>

This is very interesting. The Democrats have stood on their dig for so long to make sure that there is a cut-off time for legislation being put into this chamber. Yet here we are, only a matter of days later, and they side with the Government to allow a Bill to come in. It is typical of the Australian Democrats.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased that the penny has dropped on Senator Collins. Tonight, before we were rudely interrupted by the introduction of unnecessary legislation for the rest of this chamber, we were debating the Industrial Relations Amendment Bill 1992. We will probably see the Australian Democrats siding with the Government yet again to increase the power of the trade union movement. Once again, this Labor Government proves beyond doubt that it is the lackey of the ACTU&mdash;its political master and the enemy of industrial relations reform.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us face it, the ACTU really runs this Government. This Government does nothing without the approval of the likes of Bill Kelty. The former Prime Minister did not even make the decision to hand over the prime ministership of this country to Mr Keating without the presence of Mr Bill Kelty from the ACTU&mdash;and let us not forget his other mate, Sir Peter Abeles. They were there as witnesses. Here we have another piece of legislation talking about the influence of the ACTU and the trade union movement in its entirety. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This total refusal to introduce real flexibility into the workplace and into the labour market by lessening the dead hand of compulsory unionism and de facto union control is costing Australia jobs and productivity. One in three young people in Australia today cannot find a job. What is the answer? Last Sunday the Prime Minister went on television and, when asked that direct question about the youth unemployment of this country, his simple answer was to keep them in education longer. While better education opportunities are desirable and tertiary education places are essential, that is not the answer to getting them jobs. The reality of it is that they still cannot get a job when they leave tertiary or secondary education. That is the real question, and that is what this Bill does not address in any way, shape or form. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When there are young people in this country facing the real prospect of not being able to find a job, that is tragic. That is why the Liberal and National parties have a very different attitude to the way in which employees can negotiate with employers to have satisfactory working arrangements that will not only create jobs but also sustain jobs, that will create productivity for Australia and make sure that there are long term jobs for young people not only for today but also for tomorrow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The central issue of this Bill is the subjugation of independent contractors in any industry to the rulings of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, allowing unions to challenge an employer's use of contracts, to vary these contracts, and to have the Commission forbid their employment. The Keating Labor Government has a clear intention to aid its political masters, the ACTU, and to attack the subcontract system without regard to the increase in costs to vital areas of the economy such as housing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleague Senator Panizza was talking earlier about the increased costs of housing that will result from this legislation. But does this Government care? Not in the slightest. It is of no consequence to the Government that one of the major ramifications of this legislation is that the cost of housing will escalate. The Keating Labor Government is making sure that it is favouring the bigger and bigger increase of unionism. The effect in Western Australia, for example, of eliminating subcontract labour from housing would be an increase of 25 per cent in the cost of a new home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Home ownership, I believe, is still the great Australian dream, but unfortunately, thanks to this Government, the great Australian dream is slipping further and further away. Here we have yet another piece of legislation tonight which makes sure that it goes away even further and faster. Labor's willingness to let the ACTU impose de facto unionism on contractors would mean that the median price of a home in my State would rise to $125,000. That is just the median price; that is not the price of every home in Western Australia, and let me make that clear. But it is the average person, often an employee, who pays the ultimate cost of this union driven policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We cannot be surprised, however, that a Minister who once served as the assistant secretary of the Building Workers Industrial Union, the instigator of this Bill, should be in sympathy with the union view that contracting leads to a breakdown of union organisation and membership. That is quite damning coming from a Minister, Senator Cook, who, as a former union leader, is obviously very concerned that there may be an erosion of union membership and control. Therefore he is ensuring through this legislation that there is no such erosion, and that in fact the union movement gets bigger and stronger and everyone else pays the price. It is becoming obvious that the supposed concessions announced by the Minister are nothing but a sham. The industry knows they are a sham and private individuals will very soon know that they are a sham because they widen, rather than restrict, the scope of this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Expert advice has confirmed that the Industrial Relations Commission will retain the discretion to review the contracts of independent contractors. That is not acceptable to the Opposition. The prospect of standard form contracts imposed by the AIRC looms large when section 127B remains intact and gives the right to review a contract thought to be unfair or against the public interest. How ironic that the concept of the public interest should here be included when it is removed from certified agreements between employers and unions under section 115. Clearly there will be a green light for union mischief and the AIRC meddling with 127B(4)(e), which includes that wonderful ambit phrase `any other matter that the Commission thinks relevant'. Section 127B(5) states that the AIRC `must record its opinion'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other provisions in this Bill are equally designed to strengthen the hand of unions in a rigid and outdated system. The supposed facilitation and promotion of certified agreements under section 115 entrenches the role of unions in this process, so that they are the arbiters, along with apparent moves for flexibility in enterprise bargaining. Really, they are the last people who can judge. It is not a matter of freeing up the system, as the Minister foreshadowed last year. That is just a whole lot of filibuster. It is just a whole lot of bluff that this Minister goes on with&mdash;the same kind of thing that Minister Collins goes on with about the waterfront. It is a whole lot of bluff; it is not happening. We have not seen any indication of a freeing up of the system. Rather, the system is to be tied up for the benefit of the unions who have the vested interest in preserving their own privileges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rigidity is confirmed by the prevention of the reduction of any award or legislative entitlement. So often in the real world, employees are anxious to trade conditions for higher remuneration or, in tough times, for job survival. Let us face it, we have seen example after example in this country. Of course, one of the most recently celebrated examples is the case of the Shepparton Preserving Company. All of those employees would be out of a job today and the company would have closed down if the trade union movement had had its way. Fortunately, it did not get its way and not only has the company survived, but also all the employees have their jobs. Presumably, they have been able to retain their commitments and their homes, keep their children educated and clothed and, at the same time, earn more money&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And got back pay, as Senator Walters quite rightly says, because they reduced their income to retain their jobs. Did this Government want them to do that? Not on your life. It wanted the union muscle to be exercised over the employees of the SPC so that the whole show would be shut down. Yet here is that company: the employees and the employers got together, came up with a system and the employees gave the concession of lower income. They have got it all back&mdash;and they also have their dividend checks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, of course, the Commission is required to ensure that an agreement is the result of consultation between unions and its members and includes all possible union parties. Even where an enterprise is not covered by an award, an employer must name a union party capable of covering its non-unionised employees. Union domination could hardly be more obvious. Every way we go down this path, we find that the union domination is getting stronger and stronger to the detriment of the employees and, of course, the employers. We are looking at a situation where unions have the right to muscle in on an agreement, despite the possible wishes of the employees, and to prevent employees from representing themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know whether this Government really believes that employees are so incapable of representing themselves that it simply will not allow them to do so, but I do not believe that. I have seen many situations in which employees have been quite capable of representing themselves and have come to a very amicable agreement with employers which suits both parties. But all of this is the complete antithesis of genuine enterprise agreement based on the principle of employee free choice, as the Liberal and National parties are advocating. Enterprise agreements under a coalition government would bring unions to their proper role as the servants rather than the masters of employees, able to act as negotiating agents if the workers so wished, but lacking the right of veto that this Labor Government is carefully enshrining in this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday, I happened to make reference to Senator Cook's constant misleading of the Senate with regard to the coalition position on industrial relations. He intentionally, willingly and deliberately&mdash;whatever adjective one could wish to imagine&mdash;says both in this place and out in the public arena that the workers are going to be worse off because minimum awards are going to be abolished. Minimum wages are not going to be abolished. He also says that employees will be victimised&mdash;`They will not be able to earn a cracker'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He also cited the New Zealand experience. We will continue to hear plenty of rhetoric from Senator Cook and his Labor cronies that they are defending employees from a New Zealand situation. I suggest that Senator Cook and his mates go over to New Zealand and see what is really happening over there. Mind you, those opposite have been deafening in their silence about New Zealand in the last few weeks because New Zealand's balance of payments is slightly better than ours. They are in the black and we are in the red. The more we learn about what is really happening across the Tasman, the less workers, as opposed to unions, need to fear. Sure, the union movement might have something to fear, because it will have less responsibility. But what is happening is not some free-for-all as is being touted by the Minister and his Labor Party apparatchiks, but a massive swing, I must say, towards the individual enterprise agreements and individual contracts such as those covering the 1,200 workers at the Comalco Aluminium plant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We learn that a clothing firm employing 50 staff abandoned standard wage rates for a piece rate system that resulted in take-home-pay arising from an award of $320 per week to $430 per week, and more staff being employed. That is what this Government want employees to miss out on&mdash;increased income, greater job security, and more jobs. That is what this Government is all about. This Government is not happy with one million people being unemployed. It wants more people to be in this situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Auckland brewery of Lion Nathan there is one enterprise agreement in place of 16 awards, there have been no strikes for five years, wage bills are lower and pay rates higher, and productivity just happens to be up by 300 per cent. Once again, this is something that this Labor Party does not want to see in this country. It does not want to see an increase in productivity, employees getting more money and greater opportunities right across the board.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The New Zealand experience shows that it is not workers who are losing out through genuine enterprise bargaining but the unions, which are becoming irrelevant and which have lost the monopoly power that this Bill seeks to reinforce in Australia. When staff in a national retailer were given freedom of choice to opt out of unions, 70 per cent did so. We will give employees the opportunity to opt out of unions. But if they are not happy with that, they will not be locked out forever&mdash;they can come back. According to the Government and the Labor lies that keep on being told, they will be locked out forever. That is simply not true. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is predicted that overall union coverage will reduce to 25 per cent of the work force. That is what the Government is worried about. It is this, and not the supposed exploitation of employees, that is the ACTU nightmare. People like Ferguson could not solve a bun fight in a bakery, let alone solve union disputes. Yet, once again, he is the key ear to this Labor Government. He and Mr Kelty are de facto members of the Cabinet of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The desire of this Minister to increase centralised direction of the AIRC is made clear by the appointment of a separate Vice-President's panel, without the duties being defined in this Bill. The President of the Commission thus loses the prerogative to allocate work, and the Minister will effectively be providing the direction, and we well know what that direction will be under this Minister and this Government. The cynical determination to set and control the national industrial relations agenda is obvious with the appointment of another ACTU representative, and one from the Metal Trades Industry Association, to the National Labour Consultative Council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recent royal commission in New South Wales has reminded us that some construction companies are equally happy to rely on cosy deals with militant unions. I can tell you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that the Liberal and National parties are not happy with these cosy arrangements and they will certainly seek to have them wiped out. The observation needs to be made in the context of the New Zealand experience that some of the more hidebound employers opposed change because they had a vested interest in protection from competition, feared the challenge of active work force management, and even complained that workers would get too much freedom of choice. That is exactly what the unions fear in Australia and it is exactly what this Government fears. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The same retail chain that saw 70 per cent of employees ditch the unions had to replace 20 per cent of store managers who found they could not manage an unregimented work force. This is what real industrial relations reform is all about. This Bill continues to thwart such reform and to entrench ACTU domination of the system yet further. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill just simply has to be rejected lock, stock and barrel. It is about time the employees and the employers of this country had a chance to negotiate real opportunities, a real future, real jobs and real progress. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the arguments that have been put forward by my colleagues. The Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill 1992 has two major impacts&mdash;one on contractors and the other on certified agreements. Of course, some of my colleagues have mentioned some other aspects of the Bill. Both of these impacts are designed to increase union hierarchy power by enshrining in legislation the power of the Keltys of this world. The hidden agenda of this Government is not, as has been claimed in this place, about sham contracts. It is about increasing union power.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make some comments about what has happened over the last month or so to employer organisations. The first point I want to make is that the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) has conned the employer organisations into believing that the changes he has accepted to this Bill will overcome their concerns. One must add that it is not to their credit that they have been conned. But in fairness to them, they had their first meeting three weeks yesterday at which they put their concerns to the Minister about the impact of this Bill. One must make the comment that, even with the proposed changes that have been put forward, not one of those employer organisations supports the Bill anyhow, even in its revised form. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although that meeting was held three weeks ago, the Minister did not respond until about 10 o'clock last night and give them notice that this Bill was to be brought on at about 11 o'clock today. Consideration of this Bill was subsequently put back to 8 o'clock tonight. In other words, they were given less than 24 hours to analyse the changes that the Minister had agreed to. Yet, the Minister talks about consultation, about being fair to all sides of the community in terms of this Bill. Of course, his own union mates have had a much longer time to consider the legislation and would have been involved in discussions about the changes that were made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to quote one paragraph of a letter from Reg Hamilton, who is the legal officer acting on behalf of the National Employers Forum. The letter says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to provide the Forum with a commitment that the detail of Government amendments to the Bill to implement any in principle agreement would be discussed and agreed with the Forum;</PARA>
<PARA>As I said, in effect the employers were given 24 hours to respond to this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the Minister is now trying to present himself as a reasonable person. He is claiming that he has allowed time in that the Bill will not be back in the chamber for consideration until some time in the next fortnight or so. The Opposition has moved that the Bill be sent to a committee for consideration. This is the reason its passage through this place has been delayed&mdash;not because of any action by the Government. As a result, employers will have the opportunity to put their case. Of course, anyone else who wants to make a submission and put a case will also be welcome to do so. So any claim by the Minister that he is giving employers the opportunity to put their case to a much more independent forum selected by this Senate is just absolute nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to deal with some of the details of this Bill. In doing so I want to re-emphasise the point that the Bill is about enshrining union power and union leadership. Let us look at the operative part of this Bill that is going to give so much power to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. I refer to proposed new section 127B(2). Considering that the public interest has been specifically removed from `certified agreements' legislation, why should it be brought into contractor legislation? My understanding is that it is concerned with the integrity of the industrial relations system pertaining to awards. What relevance does it have to contracting and how would it be used by unions and the AIRC? This is a very legitimate concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Proposed section 127B(4)(a) refers to relative strength. This is very emotive. It gives the AIRC a judicial function interfering with legal contracts based on the worker signing a contract to get work; therefore he is at a disadvantage. No contractor of any kind could resist this premise. Proposed section 127B(4)(c) refers to development of the skills of employees performing work of the relevant kind. The question to be asked is whether this could be used to eliminate contractors from any enterprise because providing a trained work force will reduce employees' opportunities to develop skills in the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under proposed section 127B(4)(d), total remuneration, the question has to be asked: does this mean that if an employee takes, say, 38 hours to do a job but a motivated contractor on a considerably higher hourly rate takes 20 hours to do the same amount of work the total remuneration for the contractor is less? If a contractor is hired for a four-hour task and is paid a high hourly rate for those four hours but an award worker can be hired for only eight hours at a time, then the total remuneration for the contractor is less. Of course, contracting is about increasing efficiency and productivity and getting a lower cost per unit of work produced. Through the contract system people can actually earn significantly more money, yet at the same time have a lower unit cost. This proposed section will put that in jeopardy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Proposed section 127B(4)(e) refers to any other matter that the Commission thinks relevant. The whole independent contractor legislation could be removed leaving only this section, and the AIRC could still do what it liked with contractors. In other words, this is an open door. Proposed section 126B(5) says that it must record its opinion. Why must the AIRC record its opinion, even if in the overview the arrangements are satisfactory? Some specific point must be recorded to build case law for further future interference by unions. This section will be used to enhance interference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Proposed section 127B(7) outlines the objects of the Bill. Are not the objects of this Bill to bring everybody within the industrial relations system&mdash;that is, on awards&mdash;or at the very least under the control of the AIRC? The objects of this Bill are to have everybody under the control of the AIRC, and that will be done with union involvement and union coercion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to proposed section 127C(2), dealing with an order, this eliminates any available flexibility under the contracting system and forces rigid award standards on to a more productive system. Once again, this is going to force up costs, create much higher costs for the final consumer. It will have very serious implications for the housing industry, the construction industry, the farming industry, the mining industry&mdash;just about any industry we care to name. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I shall now make some brief comments about certified agreements. Under this legislation we find that an agreement will not be able to be put in place unless employees are represented by a union, even if in that workplace there are no unionists. Another point, and this indicates once again the lopsided nature of this legislation, is that that union on behalf of the employees can seek before the Industrial Relations Commission to have the agreement altered half way through. The employer does not have that option. The employer is left having to run the full term of the agreement. It should be remembered that in Australia 85 per cent of the work force are employees, yet only 42 per cent of those are members of a union. If we take out the Public Service component, the percentage of unions in other workplaces is less than 30 per cent. That leaves 15 per cent as contractors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is a contractor?  Contractors are people who pit their wits against a job and quote a price to get it done. They do that because they believe they can do it more efficiently, more quickly and with higher productivity, and can thus earn more dollars and cents. People see contracting as an opportunity to be better off. Nobody forces anybody into the contract system. It is a matter of choice and it always has been a matter of choice. We will find now that a number of people who chose in the past and will choose in the future to be in the contract system will be forced out of it. One must make the point that the contract system has been an integral part of Australia's development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason for this legislation is that the Government wants to unionise contractors. The legislation is before us not for the reasons we have been given but because of the Troubleshooters case. The Troubleshooters case was successful in two aspects. Firstly, it created an employment arrangement in the contract system which left all parties better off. Many of the people who worked through Troubleshooters were  voluntarily members of unions but they chose to work through that system. The matter went before Justice Woodward of the Federal Court, where the legality of the arrangement was challenged; it was upheld. It then went before the Full Bench of the Federal Court; once again it was upheld. Leave was sought to take the case to the High Court but was not granted. The High Court upheld the position of Justice Woodward and the Federal Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reasons for that action are set out in a letter to Mr Bill Kelty from the Building Workers Industrial Union of Australia, under the signature of Mr Tom McDonald, National Secretary. It reads in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The consequences of the agreement between the BLF and Troubleshooters is an important matter for the trade union movement and trade unionists.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The agreement represents the first major breakthrough for the New Right in its efforts to take the Australian workforce out of the award and arbitration system and into the quagmire of contracting.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This development represents a serious threat to the future of the trade union movement because as history shows, contracting leads to a breakdown of union organisation and membership.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">BWIU have been in a long running battle with Troubleshooters and has incurred legal costs to the order of $200,000 and is currently facing legal action by Troubleshooters for damages against the union.</PARA>
<PARA>The letter very clearly spells out what this matter is about, and it is no credit to the Minister that he has accepted this argument. It is worth noting that at the time the High Court made its decision the reaction of the Minister for Industrial Relations was to call the law an ass. Since that time it has been on the Government's agenda to bring this legislation before us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These amendments will not do what the Minister claims. He has claimed that the housing industry will be quarantined. The fact is that we cannot quarantine any industry in legislation. If we tried to do that by legislation, it would not stand up to constitutional scrutiny. This Bill broadens significantly the power of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and, as I have already said, it further expands union power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I shall quote from a couple of legal opinions I have received. Amendment No. 2, which was dealt with by the Minister, involves the deletion of proposed section 122(4) of the Act. A legal opinion from Taylor Szekely Kelso states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The effect will be that the AIRC can grant preference to employees over independent contractors or vice versa.</PARA>
<PARA>The opinion states that this is not in the interests of any industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Proposed section 179(3) extends the definition of employee to include independent contractors. So we now have operating in this country a definition of employee which includes someone who is not an employee, but a contractor&mdash;a person who quotes a price to do a particular job. It is a very serious development in terms of turning back the clock in industrial relations in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to another legal opinion I have in terms of this particular Act. This has been done by Terry Chamberlain of Gallens Crowley &amp; Chamberlain. I want to quote a number of points he makes about the principal Act as it pertains to this amending legislation. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The result of this conclusion is that the removal of 127A from the proposed amendments may in fact widen the jurisdiction and powers of the AIRC in relation to disputes concerning the engagement of independent contractors as well as employees.</PARA>
<PARA>So that just reinforces the point that I made earlier in my comments. He continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the proposed amendments the jurisdiction of the AIRC to determine the consideration payable to independent contractors would be limited to the extent necessary to prevent the engagement of independent contractors on terms that are unfair, harsh or against the public interest. Despite the uncertain limits of these restrictions and, in particular, the criteria of public interest, it is still more limited than the power that the AIRC would have under the current Legislation if it were found to have jurisdiction to hear such disputes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In this light, I believe any challenge to be made in the High Court concerning independent contractors would or should seek clear answers to the following issues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.What is an independent contractor? If in fact the types of people which this Legislation is concerned to protect e.g. clothing out-workers,&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and we have heard a little about them in debates here in recent times&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">are in fact employees and not independent contracts, then there is no rationale for this Legislation.</PARA>
<PARA>That is one of the reasons that this legislation has been put in this place, I believe, by the Minister for Industrial Relations and certainly by Senator Sherry. He continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.Whether a dispute about the engagement of independent contractors rather than employees is an "industrial matter" capable of forming the subject of an "industrial dispute".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.Whether in reviewing contracts the AIRC is being called upon to exercise judicial power.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.The extent to which the Legislation is supported by the relevant heads of power under the constitution.</PARA>
<PARA>It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In this regard we note that the Federal Court has recently held that a corporation can be liable for misleading or deceptive conduct during employment negotiations. In this regard the proposed amendments can be seen as a logical extension of existing law and the provision of the Trade Practices Act. Indeed, they would seem to be as simple as provisions to the following effect:</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on. Finally it comes to the point that the way to handle unfair, harsh or unconscionable contracts is through the Trade Practices Act, not the Industrial Relations Act. That is a view that I hold very strongly, if in fact it is necessary. The amending legislation is misplaced legislation introduced for the very purpose&mdash;as I have said before, and I will keep repeating&mdash;of enshrining the power of the Bill Keltys in this country of ours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just want to give some practical examples of what is going to happen in the marketplace under this legislation. The first thing that we will see when people tender to do a job under the contract system&mdash;and it is a competitive business&mdash;is underpricing. We will see underpricing because whoever is tendering will know that once he has his foot in the door and has started work&mdash;he might be a quarter of the way through the job, he might be halfway through the job&mdash;that he can go running cap in hand to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission with union representation and have that contract reviewed. It is going to put many industries into absolute turmoil. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a farmer, I get quotes to have produce carted from the farm to the port or wherever it has to go&mdash;it could be to an abattoir. Under this legislation, particularly when it comes to the cartage of bulk commodities, I could never be certain that the quote would hold good. Whoever gives the quote will always have the option of a second string to his bow and will be able to put arguments. Not only will that cost significant amounts of money; it will also cost an enormous amount of time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at another aspect of the practical implications of this particular legislation. Under this legislation, a contractor, as defined, can now be legally a member of a union, which he could not be before. We will find a closed shop situation, as has happened before on the waterfront and in the activities of the Transport Workers Union. When subcontractors cart their product to the wharf, they will be given an ultimatum that if they do not join the union their truck will not be unloaded. That will be the practical application of this legislation. Once again, it will be coercion that will force these people to join a union against their will. They will have no choice, because they have to proceed with their work and get the truck unloaded, or complete whatever the task might be, if they do not want to be forced into bankruptcy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are just two practical examples of the types of things that will happen under this legislation. They are the types of things that even blind Freddy can see. In terms of the example I have given, in the past there was some defence because individual contractors could not legally be forced to join a union. Now they will be forced to do that, and it will undermine, as I have already said, the whole contracting process, both in the pricing and in the operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to mention one other example that we had just recently where the contracting system could have improved very significantly the efficiency and productivity across our wharves. It occurred in Fremantle with the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Jill Coast</EMPHASIS>. It relates to the loading of potatoes. The master of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Jill Coast</EMPHASIS> was not satisfied with the price he was quoted from the two stevedores: one was $30 a tonne with additional costs on it, which usually worked out to about half the price, which takes it up to about $45; the other one was $36 a tonne, with additional costs on it, which would have taken the price up to about $48 a tonne. He was not satisfied with those quotes, so he got a quote from some independent people. He was quoted $7.50 a tonne without any additional costs. Of course, in stepped the Waterside Workers Federation. The Potato Marketing Board fell into line because it did not have the gumption or the guts to stand up to it. In the end that ship sailed from Fremantle without a cargo. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation will make it even more difficult to get some real reforms on the waterfront, which would lower the cost of getting the product across the wharf and onto the ships. That is what waterfront reform must be about. </PARA>

The Government today gained 3 1/2 hours of Government Business time by backbench senators all around the chamber giving up their opportunity to discuss General Business and committee reports.

I simply want to remind senators on the other side of another occasion when people on this side did not query some ambiguity in what Senator McMullan had to say and we found ourselves caught out.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Those opposite can interject all they like; I am going to make my point. The more they interject, the longer it will take to get it out. It is as simple as that. The occasion that I was referring to was when there was a dissension from a ruling made by Senator Colston in his capacity as Chairman of the Committee of the Whole. Senator McMullan got up and made some generalised remarks containing an ambiguity, leading people on this side of the chamber to believe that a particular course of action would be followed. No-one picked him up on that ambiguity. Because of that, he acted on that ambiguity and took a completely different course of action. So I do not think it is at all unreasonable for Senator Reid to ask Senator McMullan to spell out exactly what he means. I simply use this opportunity to highlight why  those opposite have to say to people on this side of the chamber what exactly they mean, because if they leave any ambiguity it will be used for their benefit and not for the benefit of the whole chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>

To conclude my remarks on that matter, the Government should be facilitating the gains that can be made from that type of contracting, not knocking it off.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Finally, I highlight what I see as the worst features of the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill 1992. The Bill will grant preferences to employees over independent contractors or vice versa; it will extend the definition of employees to include independent contractors; and it will give unfettered discretion to the AIRC to review independent contractors' contracts. I have emphasised the impact of that. Another feature of the Bill relates to changes made to union domination of certified agreements.</PARA></TALK.START>

The Government has been working on this for over nine months and it has had plenty of opportunity to bring it into this place before, but it had to get a tick from Mr Kelty and others. That is why this Bill has not been in here before. There is no defence to that. That is why there are no Government speakers tonight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill is turning industrial relations policy backwards. It is a result, as I have already outlined, of the success of Troubleshooters&mdash;not sham contracts, as has been claimed. I emphasise that when the Troubleshooters case was brought down the Minister described the law as an ass. He is altering the law to facilitate his mates. The BWIU said to the Minister `jump' and the Minister has jumped. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must also comment on the Democrats, who are supporting this legislation. One must ask how they were bought off. They put themselves forward as the political party that represents small business in this country. They are selling small business down the drain. The contract system is an integral part of the small business community in this country and the Democrats, with the Government, are in the process of selling them down the drain. I do not think one could describe the Democrats of today as anything but the lackeys of the Left. </PARA>

Senator Cooney is always called upon when the Government is in trouble. He has come in here tonight to see what he can do for the Government. In his second reading speech, the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill now before the Senate is another significant step along the path of fundamental reform initiated by the Government since taking office in 1983: reform which is transforming Australia's industrial relations landscape.</PARA>
<PARA>Let us have a look at the present Australian industrial landscape. We have seen tonight on our television sets a scene that I did not expect to see in my State. It is a very conservative State. The workers and, indeed, industry have always claimed that it has the most stable work force of any State, yet under this Government's legislation we have tonight seen violence perpetrated by picketers of APPM blocking people from going to work. Indeed, the picketers were carrying out what this Minister for Industrial Relations told them to carry out&mdash;what this Minister for Industrial Relations foreshadowed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister demanded that the company meet with the unions and the Liberal Government in Tasmania. The whole thing fell through because governments and politicians should not get involved. He demanded the meeting and made a fool of himself. When the whole thing fell through, he came into this place and said, `There will be bloodshed'. He foreshadowed it. He inspired the picketers to carry on to the extent where they defied the police and today in my State there has been bloodshed at the Minister's request. I hope that all people in Australia realise that is exactly what has occurred under this Government's legislation and this stupid second reading speech which says that the reform is another significant step. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us get it perfectly clear what this significant step is, because it is very significant. For the first time in the history of this country it brings contractors under the Industrial Relations Commission. I will come to that in a few minutes. In the Minister's second reading speech, he makes quite elaborate statements, such as:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the existence of democratic organisations of employees and employers to represent the interests of their members, as in all truly free societies;. . . </PARA>
<PARA>Nowhere in this democratic speech or organisation is there the ability for the employees to come to an arrangement with their employer themselves. They must do it through the organisation. There is no voluntary organisation. They are closed shops&mdash;no ticket, no work. This is what the Labor Party calls democracy. There is no freedom to join the organisation or not to join the organisation. There are simply closed shops&mdash;no ticket, no work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the Government's legislation and picketers have been drawn up for weeks, refusing to allow those people who want to work to go through the picket line and work in their workplace, until we reached the position when the police had to go in and remove them forcibly. The Minister supports this sort of industrial relations. He inspires bloodshed and talks about bloodshed because he could not get his way with the company. This is the sort of democracy that this Government works under. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our policy is for voluntary unionism. Our policy is true democracy where if someone wants to join a union, then they may certainly do so. If they do not want to join a union, then equally they do not have to. In his second reading speech, the Minister also says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . consultation and cooperation between workers, their unions and employers as essential ways to ensure that industrial reform and workplace changes are best framed and implemented on a sustainable basis;. . . </PARA>
<PARA>All I can say is that our policy is choice. I will talk about the workers of APPM, because this dispute is occurring under this Government's policy, not our policy. We would say to APPM, `You must abide by the choice of those workers whom you employ who choose to ask the union or any other agent to negotiate on their behalf and you must abide by the choice of those who want to negotiate with you on their own behalf.' That is our industrial relations policy. Those people who do not choose to belong to a union can negotiate with the employer on their own grounds and those who do want to join a union, or choose some other agent, can do so. Our policy is a matter of choice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is frightened of giving the Australian people choice. It tells them, `No ticket, no work. You will belong to a trade union and if you do not, you will not get a job'. We are also told in the Minister's second reading speech that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we have applied a flexible accord wages policy responsive to Australia's economic circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA>We know what Australia's economic circumstances are. The Government is trying to bring contractors into the same position under the IRC as employees. In the middle of a recession, we have one million unemployed. Those unemployed are ignored by the union movement. I am not sure, Madam Acting Deputy President, whether you were a member of the committee under Senator Elstob that looked at superannuation. Bill Kelty gave evidence before us on the rights of employees to have superannuation. We asked him, `What about the unemployed?' He answered, `The union is not interested in the unemployed. The unions are only interested in the employees. They are our members'. That is the truth of the matter, of course. The union movement is not interested in the unemployed. It is only interested in employees because they are the union members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our policy, as opposed to the Government's policy of recession with one million unemployed, is our Fightback package which will employ two million people. There will be two million new jobs. As I said, this Government's alternative is to go back to the Dark Ages, as in Burnie now, where the picketers are lined up and the intimidation is unbelievable. Tonight we saw only 20 or 30 brave men being escorted by the police through the picket lines and being bashed by their co-workers as they went. It is a disgusting way to carry on and it is only under this Government's legislation that it can occur. Our policy is that the company must take note of the choice of the unionists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to the Bill. In the part of the Minister's second reading speech that I have been quoting from, the Minister had not yet got to the Bill. It all sounds so easy, because the Minister says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a fundamental revision of the provisions of the Industrial Relations Act 1988 to facilitate and encourage workplace bargaining. The parties to a dispute. . . </PARA>
<PARA>The parties to a dispute! Who in the heck are the parties to the dispute? Surely to heavens it is the employer and the employees. That is not what the Minister means. He does not mean the employer and the employees. He means the employer and the unions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me give just a few examples. My colleague Senator Knowles tonight gave the example of the SPC canning factory. She said that the employees there came to a decision with the employer, but the union would not have a bar of it. Eventually, it was forced into getting it up and agreeing with the employees before the Commission to have it ratified. Since then, SPC has done very well. At Christmas, Mr Corboy from the company said that 300 permanent workers at the plant had been told that they would receive all their accrued lost earnings in one payment. An amount of $600,000 was divided pro rata among the permanent staff and the large seasonal work force which took wage cuts in the last harvest. But let us look beyond that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The workers and management of a small sawmilling company in Queensland reached an agreement whereby, if the employees started an hour earlier on Monday to Thursday, they could have Friday afternoon off. That was the choice of the workers and the management. They came to an agreement that the employees would work an hour longer Monday to Thursday and then have Friday afternoon off. What did the union say?</PARA>
<PARA>The union said, `Not on your life'. The AWU intervened and claimed that if the workers started an hour earlier they had to be paid penalty rates. It did not matter what the employees wanted and it did not matter that the employer said it suited him and he wanted a happy work force; the AWU said, `No, we will not allow it'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another example involves a major service sector company. It enjoyed very little benefit out of the current restructuring and efficiency principles. But one area where improvements could be made was in relation to its RDOs. In the service sector, continuity of supply and of a particular driver are very important. So, when discussing possible ways that that organisation could make gains under the structural efficiency principle, a number of workers said that they would be happy to have their RDOs rolled up in a bonus type payment to be given to them at the end of the year&mdash;at Christmas, when everyone wants that bit of extra money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This deal would have suited the company, and obviously many workers wanted it. However, when it was put to the unions, guess who intervened&mdash;Bill Kelty. He intervened by saying that it was just not on. When it was explained to the ACTU Secretary that the employees themselves had put it forward, his response was, `We have to protect the work force from themselves'. It sounds like Senator McMullan's arrogance to me. That was Bill Kelty telling the workers that they do not know what is best for them but that he does. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The dispute in Tasmania was caused by the union movement. Martin Ferguson has been down there causing all the problems under the sun, and the Minister was here inciting violence. That is exactly what occurred because the unions have deliberately set about creating this situation in Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I say, the main purpose of the Bill is to bring independent contractors under the umbrella of the Industrial Relations Commission. The Government took this decision months ago, but then put it off. I wonder why. It put it off because at one stage the Democrats were going to agree to it; everything in the garden was rosy because the Democrats said that they would support the Bill. But the employer organisations would not. The employer organisations threatened that, if the Government did not alter its legislation, they would undertake a campaign of paid political advertising directed solely at the industrial relations legislation that we are debating here tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What did the Government do? It has been having a pretty bad time of late. Indeed, it has been having a disastrous time. Senator Richardson in this chamber proved that he was misleading the Senate and was forced to resign. Senator Evans is going down the same track. A motion has been passed in this Senate saying that there should be a judicial inquiry into what has occurred in his Department and in the Marshall Islands. So the Government has been having a pretty bad time. Mrs Ros Kelly in the other place has been telling Australia that she endorsed only the cover of a school kit&mdash;not its contents&mdash;that told the children of Australia that farmers were totally irresponsible in their land care. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has had to acknowledge that his family company, of which he has a 50 per cent share ownership, has never put in a tax return. So the Government has been having a pretty bad time of late. It could not withstand the CAI members undertaking a political advertising campaign against the industrial relations Bill that we are discussing tonight, so it crumbled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has suddenly decided that it was terribly necessary for 18 amendments to be brought into the Senate today because it just could not withstand a campaign against it by the CAI. The Minister promised that he would pass these various amendments to overcome the greatest problems. But I do not think that will be good enough. It certainly will not be good enough, because I can assure the Government that those amendments would not carry out what the Minister thought they would. Whether that is through ignorance or whether it is deliberate, I am not quite sure. But they certainly do not cover what Senator Cook has told people they cover. So there is still a fair problem ahead of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the Bill is being sent off to a committee following the second reading stage; we are told that some of the speeches on the second reading will be concluded by midnight tonight. The Committee will be looking at it at some future time. By the time that Committee looks at it, I am quite sure that there will be many more than 18 amendments to cut out of this Bill all the independent contractors, who should, as Senator Crane said earlier, be covered by the Trade Practices Act. We will see what happens. This Government really is having a pretty bad time at the moment, and it is not willing to make a fight of anything. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is time that the Government realised that it is under its legislation that we have scenes such as those in Burnie we saw on our televisions tonight. It is not our legislation; it would not happen under our legislation because the employer must abide by the employees' wishes. It cannot happen under our legislation; it can happen only under this Government's legislation. It is high time the Government realised that it must change its ways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not the only one who says that the Government cannot be trusted. I refer to Mr Turbet's letter to the Minister for Industrial Relations. We all know who Mr Turbet is; we are all well aware of that. I will read a few paragraphs of his letter so I will not be considered the only one who does not trust the Government. Mr Turbet's letter to the Minister stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I respond to your letter to the President, Mr Justice Maddern, dated 8 April 1992, by advising of my intention to tender my resignation, as a Commissioner of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, to the Governor General with effect from 10 May 1992.</PARA>
<PARA>He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reasons for my resignation after 14 years as a Commission member, which was preceded by 16 years service to the trade union movement and 20 years membership of the Australian Labor Party are three-fold. Firstly, the Government cannot be relied upon to keep its word.</PARA>
<PARA>That is from one of the commissioners of the Industrial Relations Commission. As I have said, I am not the only one who does not trust the Government. Mr Turbet believes that the commission is being heavied by the Government and is no longer independent. He says that his number one complaint is that the Government cannot be relied upon to keep its word. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is high time the Government realised that it cannot berate the commission in one breath, tell it off, decide to ignore it and do deals with its own employees&mdash;as it did when the commission did not accept its accord propositions&mdash;and then berate APPM for not abiding by the commission's request for it to negotiate with the unions. It is hypocritical and not acceptable to the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government will be forced to make more than the 18 amendments it has already been forced to make. It will be forced to accept some of the Democrat amendments, but that will not be good enough. Further amendments will have to be made following the Committee. It will be very interesting from this side of the chamber to see how many amendments the Government will be putting up. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill has been strongly attacked in its entirety by a number of employer groups ever since its real intent&mdash;that is, to rope contract labour into the Federal industrial relations system&mdash;was made public by the Government last month. In short, the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) wants to achieve through this legislation what the building unions could not achieve through industrial action. He wants to reverse the effects of the High Court and Federal Court decisions. Put simply, he proposes to restrict the rights of individuals to control their own working life as independent contractors. The battle to reform Australian industrial relations is beyond the courts. It is now a battle which has to be fought in this Parliament, in State parliaments, and indeed in national and State elections.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill has absolutely nothing to do with attending to the real needs of those who may be exploited in our system. It has nothing to do with migrant women who may be exploited as piece workers in the textile industry. It does not even have anything to do with the oppression of the factory worker. But it has everything to do with altering and transplanting the industrial relations conditions of the commercial building industry of Australia into this nation's home building industry. The Liberal and National parties are therefore obviously implacably opposed to the proposals contained in this Bill. We support the successful moves already made by employer groups to thwart the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Essentially, the most important provisions of the Bill are those relating to contractors and certified agreements. The Bill would give the commission absolute jurisdiction over the use of contractors and the terms of contracts. It would give unions monopoly powers to represent contractors in the Industrial Relations Commission. Indeed, it would also confirm the role of unions as opposed to employees in the certified agreement process. The Bill travels well beyond its declared intention merely to get rid of fraudulent contracts. It has profound implications for the contracting systems and for the industries which use it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the Bill's introduction to this place earlier this month by the Minister, we have been told that it has undergone some changes, with the Government's agreeing to withdraw its most controversial amendment relating to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission's powers over independent contractors and contracting arrangements which, in fact, were quite extensive new powers for the commission. As is by now well known, two days ago employer groups, following their threat to mount an expensive, concerted, well-planned television and newspaper campaign against the Government on this legislation, won significant concessions in discussions with the Minister Cook on the direction of the legislation. As a result the Government has agreed to make this change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that the Government believes that employer concerns are based more on misunderstanding than on fact. Nevertheless, it agreed to withdraw the relevant clauses, so one could well question the Government's claimed basis for the legislation. It is a sad reflection on this failing Government that it took the threat of the employers' campaign, rather than the undoubted logic of their arguments, to have some effect on its attitude. The Government claims that in law at least the Australian Industrial Relations Commission already has jurisdiction in certain disputes over the use of independent contractors, but that the extent of any jurisdiction in the High Court would need to be clarified. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regardless of the Government's bleatings over the refinements of the legislation, we have now seen the Australian Democrats enter the fray with some amendments of their own. This happened after they initially rejected the criticisms of the Liberal and National parties as an unwarranted scare campaign and accepted the Government's propaganda that it was aimed merely at sham contracts. It is not just about sham contracts. The sooner the Democrats pull their heads out of the sand, the sooner they will be aware of the ramifications of this insufferable legislation. We have seen the Democrats change their minds yet again, as is becoming their usual behaviour, in deciding that the monopoly position offered to the unions to represent contractors offended their sensibilities, such as they are, on voluntary unionism. They have offered a new definition of `a `contractor' which excludes the unions' monopolistic representation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would appear that the Australian Democrats are not aware of any inconsistency in their stance on the contractors provisions, nor of their acceptance of the proposed changes to certified agreements provisions, which will confine certified agreements to employers and unions and exclude employees who are non-unionists. Despite the Democrats changing their mind at every twist and turn, it has been the numerous employer groups&mdash;such as the Australian Small Business Association and a number of larger employer groups&mdash;which formed themselves into a national employers forum, convened by the Confederation of Australian Industry, and which eventually forced the Government's hand on this matter after some protracted negotiations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his second reading speech nearly a month ago, the Minister claimed that this Bill would transform the industrial relations landscape and that it was another step along the path of fundamental labour reform. He claimed, too, that this Bill exemplifies his Government's approach to industrial relations. He was only correct about his first point. Indeed, the Bill will transform industrial relations in this country, but it will be altered to a form not acceptable to industry, not acceptable to the Liberal and National parties and certainly not acceptable in any way to Australian workers or indeed the Australian people at large, who are desperate to see genuine industrial relations reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Industrial relations in Australia, should the Government's legislation be passed, will become even more of a sad joke than it is at present. This Government has no worthwhile relationship with employer groups; it has merely built a cosy intimate relationship with trade unions. It is not in any way interested in developing an industrial relations policy which will take Australia into a productive and competitive future. This was highlighted just the other day in the negotiations with the industry groups over this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill is perilous. It will not deliver the best and fairest economic outcomes for Australia and it has many more ramifications than this Government would have us believe. Both the Master Builders Federation and the Confederation of Australian Industry were quick to criticise the Bill, claiming that a major consequence of the legislation&mdash;that is, the displacement of contract labour by award labour&mdash;would be to increase the cost of a new house by an average of $25,000. The Master Builders Federation is right. This Government, with its original legislation, would have denied many thousands of young home buyers the opportunity of owning a home. It would have placed purchase beyond the reach of most of them. </PARA>

Either he fails to understand the goods and services tax or he deliberately and continuously misrepresents it. That is what we have come to expect from this failing Government, which is on its last legs and will plummet to defeat at the next election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the Minister: why is this Government so opposed to young people buying their own home? In recent years it destroyed their home ownership dreams with devastatingly high interest rates. Now, with interest rates lower&mdash;though still excessive in real terms&mdash;it continues to destroy their dreams with legislation like this, which would put the price of new homes beyond the reach of many of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Confederation of Australian Industry, as well as the Master Builders, also spoke out strongly against the Government's original legislation, also correctly believing that it could be too easily used as an avenue for the unions to extend their coverage to industries such as residential housing where most of the work is now conducted on a subcontract basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us hope that the Minister displays some commonsense and backs down on the relevant clauses in the original Bill which specify that a contractor has to be a union member before the Industrial Relations Commission can review a contract. What a load of nonsense! The only purpose this serves is to expand and make cosy the membership of the trade union movement. All too often government bureaucrats and bureaucracies do not consult with those closely and heavily involved in industry. This is yet another typical example. Let us hope that the Minister has learnt that he should not again ignore industry leaders, because it will be at his peril if he continues to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When some of the biggest and most influential employer groups in Australia, representing hundreds of thousands of employers, come out fighting and lambast this piece of legislation, one must ask why they are they doing that. The clear answer is that the Government has not adequately consulted them with regard to the ramifications of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has not listened, at least up until two days ago, to informed relevant industry expertise&mdash;a mistake which it has made repeatedly during its time in office, and a mistake which we have again seen as another recent example in the Government's relations and failure to consult adequately with the many thousands of Australians involved in the road transport industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill before us is a significant one&mdash;significant in that the Government would have used it as a vehicle to ensure further entrenchment of its myopic trade union principles into current industrial relations practice. The Bill will reshape institutional procedures to ensure the institutions themselves become less resistant and more compliant to the Government's industrial relations objectives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Employer groups are concerned, as they should be. Indeed, the resolution of the national employers forum on independent contractors, as it was resolved, was to oppose all provisions of the Bill which sought to give trade unions rights and the Industrial Relations Commission jurisdiction with respect to independent contractors. The Confederation of Australian Industry has been very concerned with the ramifications of the legislation and its press statement of 2 June reflects that concern. The CAI secured an undertaking from the Government that provisions similar to those which were agreed to be deleted would not be reintroduced during the life of this Government. The Government is on record now. I am sure that this undertaking will be monitored very closely by the industry, and it will most definitely be monitored very closely by the Liberal and National parties which remain in Opposition only until the next election. Even the Master Builders Association has branded what the legislation would mean:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The full unionisation of the housing industry and the end of the independent contract system.</PARA>
<PARA>The legislation has always been nothing more than a sell-out&mdash;a sell-out to the union campaign to unionise building subcontractors across the country. The Minister has not been able to convince any of the employer groups that his legislation is justified. The Confederation of Australian Industry has argued that the Minister never attempted to define sham contracts, which he claimed were the target of this legislation, and in fact when pressed to table any evidence of unfair contracts he could not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The common law courts are the appropriate venue to determine whether a person is an employee or an independent contractor, not the Industrial Relations Commission. Of course, that former location has indeed been the appropriate place for determining these matters on many occasions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation as originally proposed by this Government was nothing more than an outright attempt to attack the private sector and the opportunities which exist there for independent businesses. Its four key areas of amendment will replace the existing provisions relating to certified agreements. The amendments will confer specific duties on the new office of Vice-President of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission relating to union amalgamations, simplify procedures for the recovery of unpaid award wages and change the membership provisions of the National Labour Consultative Council by amending the National Labour Consultative Council Act 1977. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill then seeks to replace the existing certified provisions in the Act with a new division with additional objects to facilitate and promote certified agreements. The new division would, firstly, abolish existing requirements that an agreement inconsistent with existing wage fixing principles be referred to a full bench. Secondly, it would require the Commission to be satisfied that the agreement is fair, contains dispute settlement procedures and has been the subject of consultation between unions and their members, except on greenfield sites. Thirdly, if the certified agreement is a single enterprise agreement, the division would require that it include all possible union parties and that it has been negotiated by a single bargaining unit. Next, it would provide a fairness test that will effectively prevent the reduction of entitlements under any award or legislation and would remove the public interest test for single enterprise agreements and give the Minister discretion to seek the public interest test application. It would also remove the present prohibition on a certified agreement being based on the terms of another and provide the terms for variation, extension and termination of an agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While this new division would change the certified agreement process, it is not so clear whether the changes would simplify or promote certified agreements. They would, though, entrench trade unions. The Liberal and National parties' objections to the proposed amendments to the certified agreement provisions remain. The amendments would merely entrench unions in the process and preclude certified agreements between employers and employees who are not trade unionists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect to that section of the Bill relating to vice-presidential duties, the Bill seeks to create a vice-president's panel consisting of the vice-president and at least one other presidential member nominated by the President. I believe the position was originally proposed by the Gleeson committee which recommended a restructuring of the Commission and a revised salary structure breaking the traditional nexus between deputy presidents and Federal Court judges, and effectively imposing a salary cut on deputy presidents. The President and some other Industrial Relations Commission members successfully argued that the breaking of the nexus was unjustified and that there was insufficient work to justify the creation of a vice-president's position. Hence, the Remuneration Tribunal subsequently declined to set a salary for deputy presidents because of, among other things, the lack of defined duties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister claims that the vice-president and his panel will concentrate on work flowing from union amalgamations. But, in this Bill, the vice-president's duties are not at all defined, nor does the Bill stipulate who will allocate the vice-president's responsibilities to him. Traditionally, appointment of a presidential member to a designated task, an allocation of work through him, is the prerogative of the President. But proposed section 38 removes the prerogative. Hence, under this legislation we have a situation where the position of vice-president has been created contrary to the President's wishes. The President may or may not be consulted as to who should be appointed and the President will not have the power to direct the work of the vice-president or the way the vice-president allocates this work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister apparently will be expected to provide a duty statement. If this is the case, the new arrangements compromise the President's authority by transferring some of it to the Minister. They further compromise the Commission's statutory independence and must undoubtedly exacerbate existing tensions between the pro-ACTU and the anti-ACTU factions within the Industrial Relations Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the provisions relating to the National Labour Consultative Council Act, the principal amendment seeks to appoint a representative of the Metal Trades Industry Association to the National Labour Consultative Council. This will only compromise the authority of the Confederation of Australian Industry to speak as the sole employers' representative and will give to the Government two more votes within the Consultative Council&mdash;a clear indication of the Government's intended strategy to divide and rule as far as employers are concerned with regard to industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the Confederation of Australian Industry and its constituent organisations now favour rapid deregulation of the labour market and an end to compulsory arbitration, this proposal will produce a difficult situation since the Metal Trades Industry Association is aligned with the Government and ACTU approach to an inadequate incremental change to our industrial relations system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the area of simplified small claims procedures, the Bill would also make it possible for an employee entitled to a benefit from any award or order of the Commission to proceed with a claim in a magistrate's court for up to $5,000 under simplified rules of procedure, evidence and representation. But because of constitutional requirements, the proposal would proceed only in those States which already provide, or are prepared to provide, simplified rules of procedure, evidence and representation. Despite this being a quite sensible proposal, it is unfairly and unduly restrictive to the extent that it is limited to employees with an entitlement under an award or order of the Commission. Again, it discriminates against employees who do not operate under the award system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In totally opposing this legislation on behalf of the Liberal and National parties, let me say that the building industry in Australia can be divided into two sectors: the residential and the commercial industrial. This Government wants to impose the conditions endured by those involved in the commercial industrial sector of the industry onto the home building industry, but that will be a crying shame for this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple fact is that the home building industry in Australia is among the most efficient in the world. It is cost efficient, it is productive and it is relatively free from industrial strife and mayhem. And the reason for that is because it is built on independent contractors, on the honest sweat and initiative of small business operators. It is free of the type of union thuggery that the Minister wants to introduce so that he can wreak havoc in the home building environment across this country, similar to the thuggery and havoc that is very evident in the commercial industrial building sector, as revealed and highlighted by the Gyles royal commission report published only last week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australians will simply not tolerate building union officials levying their members to pay their $300,000 Federal Court fines and saying, as they do, `Don't worry, brothers&mdash;we have been promised that they will act to overrule the decision of the courts'. The unions should not have such power and, undoubtedly, under a Liberal and National party government&mdash;which will be elected within the new few months&mdash;that sort of power will be taken away from them.
