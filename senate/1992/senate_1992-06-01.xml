<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On the weekend the Premier of Tasmania and I called the parties to the APPM dispute to a meeting in Hobart. I table the press release we issued in our joint names summoning the parties there. Both parties attended the meeting; APPM attended reluctantly and issued a press statement before going in, I understand, saying that it would not change its position irrespective of the talks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we met with the parties we put a joint proposition, which was that the agreement between APPM and the ACTU, reached between them last week without interference of any third parties, be abided by; that the orders of Munro J. of the Industrial Relations Commission be accepted; that if there is a conflict between the agreement and the orders, the orders prevail; that we acknowledge that the issue concerning logging contractors has been settled and is to one side; and in the face of the parties agreeing to their own terms and accepting the order of the Commission, there be a return to work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now read the joint press statement issued by the Premier of Tasmania and me at about midnight last night:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We met with representatives of the ACTU and APPM late today.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The discussions lasted for more than 6 hours.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Regrettably no agreement was reached.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In our view the principal reasons for this were APPM's refusal to forgo their right to appeal the Order handed down by Munro J on Friday and the company's refusal not to proceed with legal actions under Sections 45D and 45E.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We put a proposal to the parties at the beginning of the discussions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ACTU accepted that proposal. The company did not accept it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further, the company no longer accepts the Understandings of Workplace Reform which it reached with the ACTU last week.</PARA>
<PARA>I table the rest of the press statement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Munro order falls into two parts. One part of it is a direction to the workers on strike at Burnie to return to work and, if they do not do so by 4 o'clock today, the penalties of the Industrial Relations Act will be applied to them. The other part is that, upon a return to work, the records about employees' conduct that have been kept by the company since this dispute began will be wiped clear; that there will be introduced a `no victimisation' regime in the workplace; and that the parties will be enjoined to negotiate to create an enterprise agreement within a given time span.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The company says of that order that it will reserve its right to appeal all of the conditions about the slates being wiped clean, the no victimisation part and the enterprise bargaining injunction; that it will be the beneficiary of an order directing people to return to work with the penalties being provided to them; and that, as to the agreement reached voluntarily with the ACTU not to proceed with and support actions for trespass by its own employees on its own plant and legal actions against union officials and employees of its mill, those actions will be waived. I now understand that those actions will go ahead and that, further, today APPM will issue more writs against union officials and workers at its plant under section 45D. That is an act of escalation in this dispute.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Actions by joint governments in this country&mdash;between a Federal government and a State government&mdash;are unusual, to say the least. Joint action by a Liberal government and a Labor government in an industrial dispute, in which we assume a united position and act together in the public interest and in the interests of the citizens of Burnie to bring this matter to a speedy conclusion, is unprecedented in my knowledge of industrial life in this country. This sort of joint action between Liberal and Labor governments has not happened before. When we do take that action in the public interest, we believe as joint governments that the parties are bound to listen to us because, combined, we represent 99.9 per cent of the Australian community. The ACTU said it would abide by it. APPM told us, in so many words, to go jump in the lake.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that today John Howard has bought into this dispute. A few weeks ago he said that politicians should butt out of this dispute, and I agree with him. He should keep out and Dr Hewson should keep out. But it is an entirely different thing for governments to keep out and, as a government, we have responsibility to the public interest and we will not surrender that responsibility to the public interest, no matter how convenient it might be to the Opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of questions that the conduct of the company raises. One question is: why will not John Howard now support the Liberal Premier of Tasmania? Where do Tasmanian senators stand&mdash;on the side of the Australian and Tasmanian governments or on John Howard's side? In the case of APPM, Mr Howard says that all it wants to do is talk to its work force. APPM made it clear to us last night that it is not prepared to talk to the governments of this country and that State without getting legal advice on everything it says. One assumes, therefore, that it will only talk to its work force through lawyers. That raises the question of what is fair; how do those workers have equal representation; and can we expect the outcome in those proceedings to be reasonable. Or is it a case that APPM wants to turn Burnie into an industrial relations gulag and the type of discussion is that sort of discussion that goes on between the warders and inmates in an industrial relations gulag?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other question is: is this the sneak preview of the big bang in industrial relations that the Opposition preaches? Of course, APPM needs to be more efficient as a company. Why does it not seek the cooperative way, the model way, the way that Australian Newsprint Mills at Boyer outside Hobart, in the same industry as APPM, has sought, and introduce the changes to make it world competitive by agreement with its workplace, because the unions are exactly the same?</PARA>

We, as governments, tried to avert this situation by our actions last night; that is exactly what we tried to avert. This company's intransigence in standing by its own agreements prevents that.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to Senator Button as Minister representing the Treasurer.

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3077" SPEAKER="Button Sen The Hon J.N." NAMEID="4F4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRY, TECHNOLOGY AND COMMERCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, there is a bit of good news in all of this; so it will be unpalatable to the people on the Opposition benches. The data made available last week, and also that made available today, do not enable one to draw profound conclusions about the state of the Australian economy, but they do entitle one to draw certain conclusions which are important in terms of the community as a whole.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, the current account deficit published today was $897m in seasonally adjusted terms, which is an improvement of nearly $100m on last month's result. So far, the average monthly deficit for 1991-92 is $938m, which is a 29 per cent improvement on the first 10 months of last year. I mention that because at Budget time the Opposition always wants to debate these issues and the Budget forecast which was brought down last year, as revised in the One Nation statement, is very much on track. The better current account deficit in April derived from an increase in merchandise trade surplus of $201m in March to $435m. Manufacturing exports are up 7 per cent in the three months to April, compared with the same period a year earlier. The March quarter current account deficit was published last Friday and net exports of goods and services are expected to take 0.5 percentage points from the expenditure estimate of GDP for the March quarter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, it is important to make the point that manufacturing export volumes continued to improve, rising 2.5 per cent in the quarter to be up 9 per cent on the equivalent quarter a year earlier. Another very important statistic is company profits, which rose significantly in the March quarter. Company profits before income tax rose 13 per cent in seasonally adjusted terms in March. That is not a one-off aberration; it follows a trend line. It is the third successive quarter of increases in company profits. The increase in profits is partially due to reduced interest costs, of course, as interest rates have fallen and some firms have been able to significantly reduce their debt levels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The manufacturing sector is showing a relatively strong and sustained improvement in profitability. Manufacturing profits have increased for the fourth successive quarter. Manufacturing company profits rose 21 per cent in the March quarter compared with 13 per cent for companies generally. I am pleased to say that manufacturing profits are 53 per cent higher than the level recorded 12 months ago. The improvement in manufacturing profits was accompanied by improvements in manufacturing sales, which rose by 1.1 per cent in the March quarter, equivalent to an annual rate of a 4.3 per cent increase in manufacturing sales.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are all statistics. Nonetheless, they were not the sorts of statistics which were available to us last year. They are encouraging statistics. Nobody is pretending that everything is rosy with the Australian economy. Many of the indicators in an economy such as ours are lagged ones. But the news is good and positive and shows that things are on the improve and will, I believe, continue to get better.</PARA>

As the Minister is aware, the extra $30 of the training component is paid to an unemployed young person who is undertaking additional training and is designed to cover the costs associated with that training. I ask the Minister: firstly, is he aware that, as late as last week and in direct contradiction of the AAT decision, young people were still being refused the additional training component and were being advised by CES officers that they were not eligible for the payment? Secondly, is the Government planning to continue to act unlawfully and deny young people access to the component?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to say that the National Committee on Violence report set the foundations for tackling the subculture, or even the prevalence, of violence in some areas of the Australian community. Of course, that Committee report was endorsed by the Prime Minister and all the Premiers in a non-partisan way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable senators will recall that the Chair of that Committee was Professor Duncan Chappell, the head of the Institute of Criminology. It is rather a paradox that the Opposition, which claims to be interested in violence in Australian society, has determined to abolish that Institute as the foundation for its Fightback approach to the question of violent crime in our society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also worth commenting that the Opposition, which has put out a scurrilous pamphlet concerning law and order matters, proposes to put a 15 per cent GST on security doors, locks, security lighting and all those things which sensible people would want to purchase in order to protect their homes against the distressing possibility of burglary.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Nought on security doors and locks; so there we are. The National Committee on Violence was also very interested in indicating that it is not the elderly who are most at risk from violent crime in our society. That has to be emphasised because the anxiety and the fears of elderly people can be very easily aroused by propaganda which is designed to unsettle them for some cheap political advantage. Young adult males are most at risk of violence in our society, though the age group which is most likely to be killed in our society are infants between nought and one year of age&mdash;certainly not the elderly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question of societies dealing with violence and crime is a very complex one. It has to be approached on a non-partisan basis. That is why the police Ministers have asked me to chair a special meeting in Melbourne on 15 July to set up a national community safety council in order to try to coordinate all those community activities which can assist a local community to itself help to prevent crime in the community. I believe that crime prevention community safety programs, under the auspices of this particular council, will assist in that regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is also very encouraging that, again in a non-partisan way, the Police Ministers Council has been able to shepherd through very strict rules relating to the availability of firearms and weapons in the Australian community, building on decades of very stringent controls relating to hand guns and pistols. Once again, the Opposition's pamphlet with a pistol on the front completely misleads the Australian public. Out of 350 homicides last year only 10 were committed with hand guns or pistols. It is not the weapon which is used by those who commit violent crimes in our society; it is part of the misleading, deceptive propaganda in this respect by the Opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that there has to be a non-partisan approach to dealing with crime in our society. I am prepared to pay tribute to the New South Wales police Minister, Ted Pickering, who has done a tremendous amount of good work in this regard. I am quite happy to pay that compliment to him because I believe that we have to put partisan politics behind us in this regard and, on behalf of the whole Australian community, deal with the problem of crime and violence in our society.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is clear that the authorities in Serbia and Montenegro are overwhelmingly responsible for the horrific conflict which continues in Bosnia-Herzegovina with its very devastating toll of innocent human life. On 15 May 1992, a couple of weeks ago, in response to this situation, the UN Security Council, through resolution 752, called on all parties to the conflict to immediately cease the fighting and to withdraw from Bosnia and Herzegovina. As the demands of resolution 752 were not complied with, the UN Security Council adopted unanimously resolution 757 at its meeting a couple of days ago, on 30 May, implementing a comprehensive list of mandatory sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The UN resolution comprises a trade embargo, excluding foodstuffs and humanitarian goods; an arms embargo; prohibitions on the flow of funds; an air embargo on flights to and from Serbia and Montenegro; a reduction in Yugoslav diplomatic representation; and suspension of sporting, cultural, technical and scientific links.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is well aware that sanctions will hurt not only the governments of Serbia and Montenegro but also their people. None of us take any joy in the hurt that these sanctions will inflict. But I think that all Australians now accept that the tough measures embodied in the UN sanctions are required from the international community in order to bring to an end once and for all the enormous suffering that has been created by this conflict throughout the region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The resolution places mandatory obligations on member states to implement measures which put this tough sanctions regime into effect. The Australian Government is moving very expeditiously to implement the UN decision. Ministers and departments are now working on the details of implementation, with decisions expected to go before the Executive Council tomorrow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Government's measures will include the following: the Yugoslav national airline, JAT, which flies out of Australia twice a week, will have its services suspended from this week; Australia has already downgraded its diplomatic representation in Belgrade and cuts to the Yugoslav diplomatic and consular presence in Australia will be introduced; and Australia will enforce a trade ban. Statistics for trade with the former individual Yugoslav republics are not readily available. However, we are aware that imports from Serbia and Montenegro in the first three months of this year totalled only $3.2m. So it cannot be suggested that this will involve a major impact on either side. Measures will become fully operative over the next few days as the necessary regulations and measures are introduced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, by acting under Chapter 7 of the UN Charter, the UN Security Council has opened the possibility of further action against Serbia and Montenegro, or any other party failing to abide by the earlier Security Council resolution, if sanctions do not bring an end to the violence.

An officer of the Attorney-General's Department was phoned by the Attorney-General of the Marshall Islands on Friday morning, I think; certainly, the morning of the 29th.</PARA></TALK.START>

For example, in New South Wales very recently, a survey was done which showed that the incidence of reported crime had gone up but the incidence of actual crime, by survey of households, had not markedly increased. Because people have greater confidence in a less corrupt police force, they are prepared to report these particular incidents.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;International comparisons are interesting and important and can be a goad to Australian law enforcement agencies doing better than they are at the moment to try to deal with the incidence of crime in Australia. International comparisons, for example, with the United States would indicate the very heavy use of pistols and hand guns in violent crimes and homicides in that society. In Australia, by contrast, out of 351 homicides last year, only 10 were carried out by the use of hand guns or pistols. Yet it is a pistol that appears on the front cover of the scurrilous pamphlet put out by the Opposition in an attempt to scare people to a level of anxiety which is not justified.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very important that we in Australia take such steps as are required in order to build community structures to prevent the incidence of crime in our community.

Australia will be able, with the assistance of the Institute of Criminology and the full backing of the Police Ministers Council, to help bring Australian crime statistics into line with those in the international community.</PARA>

Out of interest, Professor Chappell also pointed out some of the social, cultural and even urban structure reasons which lie behind these differences. For example, in relation to breaking and entering into households, the fact that Australians tend to live in isolated houses on small blocks in suburbs expanded out from city centres means that there is less awareness by the surrounding households of a possible break and enter being conducted, whereas in European countries, where people tend to live in apartment blocks and so on, there is a much closer surveillance of those households by the occupants or by neighbours.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">POSSIBLE QUESTION:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What is the Government doing about paying the training component of FTA following the AAT's ruling that the allowance should be paid to jobseekers under 21 years of age?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">INFORMATION FOR SUGGESTED RESPONSE:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The AAT has found that the relevant section of the legislation does not allow age to be a criterion in determining whether the training component is to be paid, and that some increase over and above JSA/NSA should be paid to participants in approved training courses irrespective of age.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government's policy since 1987 has been that persons under 21 should not receive the $30 per week training component to reflect the view that there not be a financial incentive for young persons to forgo long term secondary and tertiary educational opportunities in favour of short term training options. (Separate FTA ancillary allowances can be used to meet the additional costs of training for young people.)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The applicable legislation as it currently stands does not clearly reflect Government policy about the eligibility of under 21's to the training component, resulting in a number of successful appeals to the SSAT by under 21's seeking payment of the training component.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendment to the legislation to be introduced is explicit in making under 21 year olds ineligible for the training component.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CES staff have been told to receive claims for the training component from under 21's but not to process them pending the receipt of further instructions from the Department. Ancillary allowances remain payable, where appropriate, for under 21's.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, why was it that Mr Lamb saw it worth while&mdash;important, in fact&mdash;to return to the Department's headquarters in Canberra in November last year a copy of your letter on behalf of Mr Symons to Mr Lamb asking for the assistance of the Department, but not a copy of the memorandum from Symons to Richardson which evidences Senator Richardson's knowledge of the scheme? I find that incredible. I trust that the Minister has inquired of Mr Lamb as to why that was the case, in the light of the answer that the Minister has just given to us that the memorandum was not returned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wonder whether Mr Lamb has been asked to produce the sort of statutory declaration that Senator Evans sought and obtained from his own personal staff in order to try to keep the Minister's hands clean in this exercise. What opportunity will we have of hearing Mr Lamb's version of this matter as to why he apparently sat on that critical memorandum for all those months, even the month of April when questions were being continually put in this place as to the Department's, and particularly Senator Richardson's, knowledge of the matter?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why, during that period of questions and answers in this place, did the Department maintain this memorandum in the Embassy in Washington without bringing it to the attention of either the Department's headquarters in Canberra or the Minister concerned?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why it seems to me that the answer the Minister has given today raises as many questions as it answers. In particular, when Mr Lamb did get a copy of that memorandum, we are interested to know what Mr Symons purported to Mr Lamb in relation to it. Did he confirm the factual basis of it? In what circumstances did he give it to Mr Lamb? Was it designed again to demonstrate the role that Senator Richardson was playing, critical to the whole project? We know that he got a letter from you, Mr President, at the request of Senator Richardson. But here is another document that purports the involvement and the knowledge of Senator Richardson.

It is Senator Hill who owes this place an apology for the way he has behaved on this matter, not anybody else who has been associated with it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Hill has made no criticisms of and has cast no aspersions upon Mr Lamb. The criticisms are of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) and of his failure to fully give to this Senate answers about all the relevant matters. Senator Hill has set out specific questions that we are requiring the Minister to put to Mr Lamb so that the Minister can give frank answers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of Australian journalists have approached Mr Lamb over recent weeks. As a senior diplomat of this Government, he, I believe quite properly, has not answered those journalists.

Of course he would answer such an inquiry, and he would answer the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, rather than surmise that there was some inference of criticism towards this senior officer of his Department by members of the Opposition or Senator Hill, ought to give us the assurance that he will pass on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of Senator Hill's remarks and questions to Mr Lamb, setting out precisely the matters that we would like advice on, and for him to be able to give that through the Minister for Foreign Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I note that a number of honourable senators on both sides of this chamber are quite well known to Mr Lamb. I, for one, on a visit to Washington in May last year&mdash;just 12 months ago&mdash;was very hospitably, courteously and professionally conducted in the inquiries I was making of the State Department and the Pentagon and, indeed, in our Embassy. I could not have wished for better professional advice from our Ambassador and from Mr Lamb. Similarly, when Mr Lamb was visiting Australia on leave, because he is the officer in the Washington Embassy with special responsibility for liaison with Congress on behalf of both the Senate and the House of Representatives and because he has contact with visiting members and senators, he very professionally visited a number of senators of this chamber and, I presume, members of the House of Representatives. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things which remains unanswered is the memo and its origin which perhaps holds the key to much of this mystery. This memorandum which did not surface purportedly until 15 May, having been sent from the United States on 14 May&mdash;I guess that allows for the time difference and the date line&mdash;has to be compared with the statement which Mr Lamb made subsequently, also dated 14 May. Mr Lamb, in his statement, showed that he was aware that the success of the whole scheme depended on Mr Symons getting access to members of the Congress of the United States to change their legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Marshall Islands said that people who were not natural born citizens but subsequently became citizens would get the same privileges as attached to natural born citizens; that is, access to the United States for purposes of work and associated activities. It was indeed a frightful scam. The document between Mr Symons and Senator Richardson which has come to light shows that Senator Richardson had certainly been advised by Mr Symons as to the intent of the scheme. Mr Lamb had obviously been very careful and kept notes. His notes and the written statement are dated 14 May and the meeting took place on or about 25 November. He would not have relied upon his memory to write that note; he must have kept copious notes. We in the Senate would like to see Mr Lamb's notes of the meeting which took place in Washington on or about 25 November. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, as there is such discrepancy in what Mr Symons told Mr Lamb, I cannot imagine for a moment that it would not have at least occurred to him to say, `There is a difference in the sorts of things that this man is telling me and what he has apparently told Senator Richardson'. A prudent officer would have made some contact with the Minister's office and notified somebody that there was something very smelly about what was happening between a Minister of this Government and someone who calls him a friend. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, we have this other handwritten telex dated 3 December from Mr Peter Stanford to Kylie Oakes of DFAT in Canberra about the South Pacific branch.

They were given some United States officials' phone numbers to follow up in that respect. Very glib.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make two further points on the same issue. Firstly I would like to add to the matters raised by my colleague Senator Bishop. Last Wednesday, 27 May, Senator Evans outlined fairly extensively in this chamber the nature of the documents that his Department had. In answer to a follow-up question he promised that, subject to normal FOI criteria, that material would be listed in a schedule for honourable senators to see. Senator Evans came into the chamber again today and promised that this material would be available, but I point out to him that one of the matters which is causing great concern, not only in this chamber but also in the wider community, is the length of time that is being taken for the material to be tabled. We are waiting for it. We are also waiting for other things, such as the communication to Senator Evans's office on 21 April. A question was asked about that last Wednesday. That communication comprises one or two pieces of paper and it has not yet been tabled. We are still waiting anxiously to receive it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also another cable, referred to by Senator Evans on Thursday, 28 May, regarding the DFAT record. It was outlined in a consular cable of 13 April regarding the arrest of Mr Symons. We are waiting for that cable of 13 April as well. It is now some days since that matter was raised in this chamber and we are still waiting to receive it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other matter which I wish to raise briefly in the context of taking note of Senator Evans's answer is that Senator Hill mentioned the subject of an inquiry into this whole matter. That was pooh-poohed by Senator Evans; he then commenced a somewhat unpleasant attack on Senator Hill. I point out to Senator Evans that calls for an inquiry into this matter are not being raised only in this chamber. If Senator Evans had a chance to view the press reports from last Friday, he would have noted that there were also calls in the media for a full and proper inquiry. If he had read the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> this morning he would have noted an interesting comment from Mr McDiven from Multiplex. He felt that some type of inquiry into this matter would help clear the air and, in particular, give people or companies such as Multiplex a chance to answer questions which have been raised. It is interesting to note that in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> this morning Mr McDiven was quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I'd appreciate the chance for the truth&mdash;the full story&mdash;to be told.</PARA>
<PARA>Also in the context of the matter raised by Senator Hill this morning, I point out that Mr Bonney, whose clients have lost $US1 1/4m in this scam, has also called for a full inquiry into this particular matter. An inquiry might, amongst other things, help him to trace the money which has clearly been misappropriated from his clients. He has expressed the greatest concern that some of this money may have gone back to Australia and is very anxious, for very obvious and proper reasons, that this money be recovered. He believes that one of the things that an inquiry could do would be to focus attention on the matter and possibly provide information as to where this money may have gone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, there were two matters that I wished to raise. The first was the slowness with which Senator Evans is providing the information requested in this chamber. It is taking a long, long time for the material to be provided to us. We appreciate that some of it may be complex but some of it, particularly the matters relating to the cable of 13 April and to the communication from the Minister's Department to his office on 21 April, is, I would think, fairly straightforward, involving pieces of paper which could have been tabled after Question Time today. The other matter that I raised is that there are growing calls within the community for a full and proper inquiry into this matter, particularly from others who have been caught up in the whole unfortunate affair. I would urge Senator Evans to take those calls seriously. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on this matter because, as this is a broadcast day, people who may be listening should be clear about what is being called for. There is apparently a call for an inquiry into Multiplex; into Mr Bonney; into the slowness with which the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) gets his documents into the House; and into what is happening in the Marshall Islands. It is easy enough for any of us to get up and say that we want an inquiry into some sort of thing. But, first of all, there is a need to come up with terms of reference which are sensible to reasonable people. Honourable senators opposite have not come up with terms of reference for an inquiry.

I notice that the Australian Democrats, for example, want to raise a very important matter of public importance. This issue is taking up more and more of the time available on a broadcast day. No doubt the Opposition will continue to pursue Senator Evans. I hope that he has enough patience to withstand it; I doubt whether he will.

<PARA>It will be recalled that I asked for the full nature and extent of what I believed to be six official visits to Hong Kong. Today, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) provided an answer which indicates that Senator Richardson has visited Hong Kong on an official basis on no fewer than 12 occasions. All we are told about these official visits, which seem to suggest either that they are the only trips he ever made or that any other trip he made to any other part of the world had flights leading to Hong Kong, is that the assistance afforded to him by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in Hong Kong relates to the usual courtesies of booking accommodation&mdash;indeed, the Minister said `the normal courtesies'&mdash;and that on each occasion officers were notified.

So here we have quite extensive details being provided of people being visited on an occasion when it was not even in the course of business. If we look at the other 12 occasions when he was there on official business, the only office that seems to have been visited was the Tourist Commission. I find that extraordinary. Indeed, it demands further and better particulars on the part of the Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that those of us who have even a passing knowledge of what goes on in Hong Kong know that Mr David Combe has been there since 1989, or was until recently; that Mr Greg Symons had offices in Hong Kong; and that the firm of Robertson Double, solicitors, who were the recipients of the proceeds of the $250,000 paid by Taiwanese investors, is also located in Hong Kong&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Hill is right; $1.25m&mdash;$250,000 provided by one investor. Indeed, we know very little about that firm because it would seem that it is not readily traceable, although the firm named is in Hong Kong. If one takes the word of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> program, it is registered there as a firm of lawyers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What, therefore, was Senator Richardson doing on all of those occasions to deserve the title of official visit? Presumably the taxpayers are expected to pick up the tab on each and every occasion. It is somehow quite proper for Senator Richardson to go via Hong Kong, wherever he might end up. Whether it is transiting on the way to Japan, Korea, the Netherlands, in relation to a visit to the United Kingdom, or in relation to a visit to the United States of America, all roads, all flights, lead to Hong Kong. Why this peculiar fascination with the Orient? It is hard to believe that Senator Richardson is fascinated by the climate or indeed that he is a cultural aficionado who has discovered some very interesting elements of life in Hong Kong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know that it is a place riddled with fast buck merchants and wheeler-dealers. It is the very sort of place where one would think there might be a hive of commercial activity taking place. It would therefore be very relevant to the Australian taxpayer to know who Senator Richardson was seeing on those many occasions when we are expected to have paid for the trip.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I have to say that I regard the answer as totally inadequate. It provides only a glimpse of what presumably has really happened on all those occasions. For example, we had an answer provided some months ago which indicated that in the course of one visit Senator Richardson managed to spend in excess of $600 on food and drink in one night. We know, for example, that it is not difficult for Senator Richardson to get special treatment at the Hyatt in Hong Kong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, one would ask: what is the purpose of these visits? It simply cannot be rest and recreation. There has to be a lot more to it than that. Unless and until the Government and Senator Richardson are prepared to make a full explanation to the Senate, we are entitled to presume that not only are taxpayers' dollars being wasted but that also there is a lot more to this than meets the eye. Indeed, given the cast of players who inhabit Hong Kong, it is not at all surprising that Senator Richardson probably does not want to tell us what he has really been up to. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to the South East Fishery (Individual Transferable Quota) Management Plan 1991, considered by the Committee at its meeting of 30 April 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The definition of "SEF licence holder" in clause 3.1, clause 14.2(a) and clause 15.2 all refer to s.31(1) of the Fisheries Management Act 1991. There is no s.31(1); probably s.32(1) is meant.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 15.1(c) refers to paragraph 93(1)(d) of the Fisheries Management Act 1991. There is no paragraph 93(1)(d); probably paragraph 95(1)(d) is meant.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 21 deals with setting up the South East Fishery Quota Register. Clause 21.2 sets out in considerable detail information that the Register is to contain. Then, at the end, the Manager is given a discretion in 21.2(n) to include "any other information the Manager considers relevant". This is a broad power and, although there is AAT review of decisions of the Manager, the Committee would be grateful for the background to this provision. In this context the Committee noted that the new Register provisions inserted in the Southern Shark Fishery Management Plan (Amendment) do not include such a "catch all" provision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 7 deals with the setting of the total allowable catch, or TAC, for each species covered by the Plan, with the TAC for each species set out in Schedule 3 of the Plan. However, clause 7.2 provides that the Minister may from time to time vary the TAC for a specified species and must notify the variation in the Gazette. This power to vary the TAC has important commercial implications, as clause 9.2 provides that where a TAC is varied quotas are recalculated. Such a variation is legislative in nature. The present TAC are subject to tabling and disallowance. It would seem to be an oversight that variations are merely to be gazetted and are not required to be made by amendments of the Plan, which are subject to tabling and disallowance.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CANBERRA  ACT  2600</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator Giles</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your letter of 30 April 1992 concerning the South East Fishery (Individual Transferable Quota) Management Plan 1992. You raise three areas of concern, which I address below.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.The references to which you refer in clauses 3.1, 14.2(a), 15.1(c) and 15.2 are noted and will be corrected.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.You note that in clause 21.2(n) the Manager is given a discretion to include any other information considered relevant in the quota register. You asked the background to the inclusion of such a broad provision.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The main reasons for inclusion of this provision in the South East Fishery Plan is to ensure that there is some flexibility. This is a new and complex system and the operational requirements may need to go through some evolution in the light of experience. This provision enables some additional information to be added to the register if needed for effective management. It was not felt to be sensible to require amendment of the Plan to accommodate what would probably be very minor additional details. If major or controversial changes were made to the information required on the register, I would expect that a specific additional provision would be added to the Plan at the time of the next amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.You suggest that it is an oversight that variations to the TACs need only to be gazetted by the Minister rather than covered by an amendment to the Plan, which would be subject to tabling and disallowance.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I do not agree that this approach was an oversight but it was certainly not intended to disrupt the proper process of scrutiny by Parliament. As you note, the setting of TACs is a vital part of the arrangements and has a direct impact on the viability of an operator. The intention of putting the TACs in a Schedule and giving the power of variation to TACs to the Minister recognised the need to be able to act quickly for stock protection reasons. There is a consultative process which underpins this, however, whereby the Minister takes advice from all those involved with the fishery through the South East Trawl Management Advisory Committee (SETMAC).</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current Plan has been under intensive review since its introduction at the beginning of 1991. As you would be aware, the present Plan will cease to have effect on 31 December 1992 and will be replaced by a Management Plan developed under the Fisheries Management Act 1991. I anticipate that this new Plan will incorporate a number of the changes recommended by the reviews of the present Plan. A draft of the new Plan will be put forward in the next few months and a new Plan will need to come into effect from 1 January 1993.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I will see that your Committee's concerns about the process for amending TACs are fully considered in deciding on the content of the new Plan. This new Plan will, of course, go through the full process of Parliamentary scrutiny. I therefore see no purpose in any further consideration of this matter in relation to the current Plan. There is no intention to vary the TACs in 1992 and the TACs for 1993 would be set under the new Plan.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In these circumstances I hope that the Committee will agree to the lifting of the protective notice in relation to clause 7 of the Plan.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Minister,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to the Fisheries Management Regulations, Statutory Rules 1992 No. 20, considered by the Committee at its meeting of 2 April 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Regulation 21(1) provides that the fee in relation to a matter referred to in Column 2 of an item in Schedule 2 is set out in Column 3 of the item. This reference to Column 3, we suggest, should be to Column 4.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Similarly, the reference to Column 2 in r.21(2) perhaps should be to Column 3, the descriptions in Column 3 being narrower than those in Column 2.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On a more important point, the Committee is concerned about the effect of r.41, which provides fundamental safeguards for persons who pay a penalty in the nature of an administrative fine. Such persons' liability in relation to the offence is taken to be discharged, further proceedings cannot be taken against the person for the offence and the person is not to be regarded as having been convicted of the offence. These are entirely appropriate provisions. However, their beneficial effect may be undone because there seem to be no requirements for affected persons to be informed of these safeguards. The Committee regards this apparent defect as serious. Regulation 40, which prescribes what must be included in notices to those persons affected by the provisions, does not mention these safeguards. The Committee believes that the personal rights of such persons would be improved if an undertaking could be given to amend r.40 to include a requirement that all persons who are given a notice must be informed of the safeguards in r.41. In the meantime, it would be appreciated if you could ask the Australian Fisheries Management Authority to exercise its power under r.40(2) to include this information. This matter is particularly important because of the disparity between the penalties imposed by the administrative action and the possible penalties which may be imposed by a court. The administrative penalty is $200 while for offences in Part 9 of the Regulations a court may impose a fine of $1,000 in seven cases and $500 in one case. Under s.93 of the Act the penalty is six months imprisonment.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In Question Time last Thursday, 28 May, in response to a question by Senator Sherry, the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Button, amongst other things, said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When the One Nation statement was being prepared, there was an extensive process of community consultation which concerned a number of people, like Senator Short and Dr Hewson, who took it upon themselves to make fools of themselves by ringing businessmen around the country and telling them that they should not consult with the Government. This is a very sad fact, which Senator Short does not deny.</PARA>
<PARA>Later on in that answer, he said</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, there is no debate about Senator Short ringing up businessmen trying to talk them out of taking part in a process of consultation with the Government. There is no debate about that at all.</PARA>
<PARA>Those statements by Senator Button are untrue. The fact is that, on 14 January this year, just prior to the consultations that were planned to be held between the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and other Ministers with representatives from the business community, I put out, in my capacity as the then acting shadow Treasurer, a press statement entitled, `What Business Should Demand of the Prime Minister'. That press statement commenced with the paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In their meetings with Prime Minister Keating businessmen and their representative organisations should not be backward in their demands in telling the Prime Minister what is really needed to get Australia working again.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Hawke Government ignored the pleas from business to act to remove barriers to employment and investment and micro-economic reform.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the Keating Government is serious about sustainable mid to long term economic reform then it has to start listening and acting.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition's "Fightback" package provides a good starting point for businessmen when compiling their own list of much needed reforms.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator Giles)</EMPHASIS>&mdash;Senator Short, your explanation is becoming a little lengthy.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam Acting Deputy President, on the point of order, I wish to agree with you. Senator Short has referred to his press statement and probably the three or four relevant parts to it. But I think he needs to come very quickly to his personal explanation.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Madam Acting Deputy President, but I do need to say a couple more things to show how I have been misrepresented. I take Senator Bolkus's point; I do not propose to read the full press release. I went on to list in the press release the things that the businessmen should be speaking to the Government about. The press release concluded with the statement that:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Businessmen in their discussions with Prime Minister Keating and his Ministers must send a clear signal that the Government has to match "Fightback" with their own vision. Nothing less will do.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the end of the quote and the end of the press statement. I faxed that statement of 14 January to several of the business people who were to meet with the Prime Minister and other Ministers in the following days. At no time did I ring or indeed otherwise contact business people suggesting, as Senator Button has said, that they should not participate in the consultations with the Prime Minister. On the contrary, the whole thrust of the press statement that I faxed to them was on the very clear basis that I wanted them to meet with the Prime Minister and to make the points that were contained in my statement. Senator Button would have known that. He obviously deliberately misrepresented me and thereby misled the Senate. Therefore, I ask, through you, Madam Acting Deputy President, that Senator Button have the courtesy and the decency to publicly apologise and to withdraw the wilful, deliberate misrepresentation that he made of me.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition's "Fightback" package provides a good starting point for businessmen when compiling their own list of much needed reforms.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Examples of specific demands from business should include:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">*abolition of employment taxes such as payroll tax and the superannuation and training levies;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">*abolition of taxes on exports, in particular the ramshackled wholesale sales tax regime and excise duty;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">*deregulation of the labour market to allow employers and employees to freely negotiate contracts of employment, stipulating conditions and levels of pay;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">*reductions in personal income taxes to encourage savings and provide an incentive to work;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">*streamlining the approval procedures for new development projects, abandonment of the three mines uranium policy, the reversal of the Coronation Hill and Wesley Vale anti-employment, anti-development, anti-export decisions;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">*introduction of tax free savings accounts and greater flexibility in superannuation to encourage saving;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">*introduction of a goods and services tax (with necessary compensatory means) to tax all Australians when they spend rather than when they earn, export or save;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">*acceleration of micro-economic reform in tandem with reductions in tariffs;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">*alter the capital gains tax to make roll-over provisions for small business and encourage greater employee share ownership;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">*introduce training wages (AUSTRAIN) to encourage the employment of unemployed and disadvantaged labour force participants;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">*expenditure cuts to ensure that there is no blowout in fiscal policy and no new unfunded expenditure promises.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These measures would reduce the cost burden to business by $20 billion and make them more efficient and internationally competitive, thereby stimulating investment, economic activity and job growth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Moreover, the "Fightback" package has been endorsed by most peak business/employer organisations including the Business Council of Australia, MTIA, CAI, MTAA, HIA, VECCI, Australian Institute of Company Directors, ASBA, NFF and others.

<PARA>There are precious few areas on the Australian continent, large as it is, which have not suffered very severe degradation as a result of various human activities. One such area is Shoalwater Bay on the central Queensland coast which, through a variety of circumstances, almost by accident, has escaped the enormous damage which has occurred right up the east coast of Australia elsewhere from tourism, sandmining, farming and various other activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Shoalwater Bay was set aside in 1966 as a military area and that, fortunately, fell before the time when the extensive tourist development along the eastern Australian seaboard began. It is a vast area. It is 1,000 square kilometres in area and it includes a very long stretch of coastline but it runs back very extensively into the hinterland, incorporating not only the beaches, but also the very attractive and very important dunal system, perched lakes&mdash;inlets which run a long way in from the ocean&mdash;mangrove areas, forests, including rainforest, rocky outcrops and mountain terrain. Because of this wide variety of habitats, it is found that this area contains a very high proportion of Australia's indigenous flora and fauna. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the area of 1,000 square kilometres constitutes only 0.035 per cent of the total land mass of Australia, it contains 27 per cent of Australian mammals, 33 per cent of birds, 13 per cent of frogs and 12 per cent of reptiles&mdash;and, I believe, approximately one-third of all the vegetation which is found on the mainland of Australia. It is a very important reference area. It is one which links the tropical north and the particular vegetation which is characteristic of that tropical region with some of the more temperate species to be found further south. Because it has been under military control, there has been very little access since 1966. My understanding is that, while the military had built a road into the area, that road in recent years has been allowed to grow over and essentially the only access to the area has been by sea, by way of yacht or launch, and it takes approximately 24 hours to get there and 24 hours to get back again. Consequently the human impact on this area is quite restricted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The area is one of considerable natural beauty. The sandhills along the beach rise very steeply from the shoreline, in some places rising 400 feet and being stabilised by vegetation. One can only observe that, should sandmining occur in this region, there is no way&mdash;and I stress no way at all&mdash;that any sandminer could put those sand dunes back again, much less put back the important water holding characteristics which those sand dunes represent, or the vegetation which they carry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The area has, of course, been visited quite extensively by fishermen and, again, largely because of its protection from the land side, it contains a good variety of fish. A number of birds which are listed under the Japan-Australia migratory birds agreement also visit the area and they require protection under that JAMBA agreement. Similarly, birds listed under the CAMBA, or China-Australia agreement on migratory birds, also visit the area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sand dunes in themselves act as very important areas for the catchment of water and the area immediately to the south of the Shoalwater Bay, the so-called Byfield area, is one which is absolutely vital for a number of the smaller settlements to the south because of the importance of those sand dunes as water catchment areas. There is a great deal of concern in all of those communities that interference with the sand dunes by sandmining will interfere with the availability of clean water for those areas. I can tell the Senate, having visited and spoken at public meetings in those towns, that there is virtually universal rejection of the proposal to mine these dunes for mineral sands. There is a great deal of apprehension regarding the possible interference with the water supply of those local towns. Also, of course, for the reasons I have already outlined, the conservation groups in that area are adamantly opposed to sandmining. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may be that if one had such a pristine area as this&mdash;one which by all reasonable assessments should be free of mining&mdash;but that area contained a unique mineral of very high value without the exportation of which the country may fall into serious economic decline, one may still decide that one would go ahead and mine such an area. The facts of the matter are that the sandmining in Shoalwater Bay is of marginal economic significance at best, and probably is not economic at all. One is surprised as to why the Government at this time should be giving permission for those leases to be upheld and to proceed when the company is projecting forward to 1995 before it reckons that the price of the mineral sands may increase enough for the operation then to become marginally economically viable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, also there are likely to be significant consequences for the military use of this area. I have discussed this aspect with Senator MacGibbon. I hope that Senator MacGibbon will also uphold the valid argument that there should not be the intrusion of commercial operations involving large numbers of people moving in an area which is for military use. In passing, one must remark that at least in recent years the military has been exemplary in its management of the area as an environmentally important zone. It has taken into account extensive CSIRO studies which, incidentally, have argued very vigorously for the total protection of this area on the grounds of its very wide variety of plants and animals and its pristine nature. CSIRO has argued that way and the military has upheld its concerns. As I have said, in recent years, at least, the military has been extremely good in the way in which it has managed this area. There has indeed been very little damage and I understand that most of the use has involved bombing exercises in one very small and confined part of the total area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one is dealing with the economics of this, one is impressed by the fact that almost certainly these mining leases would not be profitable&mdash;they certainly are not profitable. One must raise serious questions about the figures used in the environmental impact statement as to viability. One can only reflect that the report by the Bureau of Mineral Resources said that there is a 98 per cent probability that the sandmining project proposed by Pivot Mining would show a zero or less rate of return. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can only repeat that, if one is dealing with an area of such high environmental value and at the same time one is expecting to get minerals of great national significance out of the area, one perhaps has an equation which honourable senators in this place should consider. When one has an area which is of probably the highest environmental value in Australia, and set against that there is a proposal to mine that area and the return from that mining activity will be nil or less than zero, then there is no equation at all. Then, of course, one does not mine the area; one leaves the area in the state in which it should be left. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Using limited information on the project provided by the company and making assumptions on financing, royalties and taxes, the report from the Bureau to which I referred a moment ago concluded that no profits would be foregone should the Government decide not to grant the mining lease. I have had further analysis done on the figures in the additional information for the final EIS document. The last two pages of section 12.0 entitled `Economic Assessment' contain summaries of financial projections of two schemes for sandmining and further processing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The document also contains a diagram which tracks through a mine at Port Clinton&mdash;Port Clinton being part of the Shoalwater Bay complex&mdash;and a dry mill at Yeppoon-Gladstone, which would produce rutile and zircon as end products and ilmenite which would be further processed to murutile at the Murso plant at Gladstone. The capital cost, cash operating costs and production levels, which are called `export sales' in the document, are included. According to my analysis, if costs go over budget and/or production levels are lower than anticipated, then these forecasts will overstate the returns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, revenues are estimated on the basis of projections of the price of rutile at $700 per tonne, zircon at $600 per tonne and murutile at $700 per tonne. On the basis of ABARE's analysis of the mineral sands industry contained in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Agriculture and Resources Quarterly 4(1)</EMPHASIS> March 1992, the price forecasts on which the EIS figures are based seem overly optimistic. ABARE's forecast 1992-93 prices for rutile, zircon and synthetic rutile are $600, $300 and $500 respectively. If these lower prices were used by the EIS&mdash;and assuming that the forecast price for synthetic rutile is the same as that for murutile&mdash;then the revenue estimate for the mine and the Murso plant would fall to $56m per annum, which is about one-third lower than the EIS estimate. One can only stress again that that EIS estimate had the viability of the mine as zero or very close to zero. At these lower prices, projected revenues would not be high enough above operating costs to justify the required capital expenditure. One would simply seriously and irrevocably damage this important area for no return whatsoever to the Australian economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The diagram mentioned earlier provides a financial scenario including a pigment plant at Gladstone to further process the murutile into titanium. This would require an additional $120m capital cost. Assuming that the forecast price of pigment has fallen similarly to the fall in price of the mineral sands which are its major inputs, and that revenues are down 30 per cent because of lower prices, it becomes clear that the project lacks economic feasibility. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The long production lead times in big projects means that they are vulnerable to shifts in market prices. This is particularly the case with this project. The sandmining industry is in a depressed state at present, and I note that already 200 workers have been laid off in the last 12 months in Australia in this industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of involvement with the local population, one must note that neither the Commonwealth Government nor the Queensland Government has involved the local community in discussions as to what those residents desire for the area. Residents and taxpayers have not been told how much they will have to contribute to infrastructure costs, such as roads, power, water and other services. As I have already mentioned, there are serious concerns about the impact of the proposed mining development on the area's water supply. These are very serious and justified concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just as importantly, many people do not want to see the development in an area that is very precious to them. I have sat on the beach in Pearl Bay with some of those people and observed the religious feeling that people have in such an important, pristine area. It was an absolutely wonderful experience to sit on the beach one morning and discuss with these people just exactly how they felt and responded, and see their emotional involvement with this beautiful area. The residents want the proposed development stopped immediately, but, as usual in these cases, their voice has been disregarded in favour of an industry bias by both the Commonwealth and State governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of unanswered questions with regard to the proposal to mine the sands of Shoalwater Bay. For instance, the proponent of the EIS and the company which has promised downstream development in the Yeppoon-Gladstone area is Pivot Group Ltd, a holding company for many other companies. However, as I understand it, the lease agreement has been signed by both Pivot Group Ltd and Pivot Mining NL. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that Pivot Mining NL is completely independent from Pivot Group Ltd. Pivot Mining NL will actually be responsible for the mining venture. Why is this other company involved in this matter? Secondly, why is the Government entering into a lease agreement with Pivot Group Ltd when this company, in its 1991&mdash;I stress 1991&mdash;annual return stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The group has entered into irrevocable contractual obligations to dispose of its interests in sandmining areas on Fraser Island and at Shoalwater Bay in Queensland. This transaction has been reflected in the financial statements.</PARA>
<PARA>This means that Pivot Group Ltd must have entered into a contract to dispose of its sandmining interests some time between 1 July 1990 and 30 June 1991, before the group received approval from the Government for these sandmining leases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been informed that the Government agreed to the waiving of stamp duty, provided that the companies, Pivot Group Ltd and Pivot Mining NL, complied with certain environmental conditions that have been written into the lease. How much stamp duty will be waived by this agreement? Why was such a deal entered into in the first place? That in itself suggests a marginal economic viability for this proposal. Why has the Government opened the way for sandmining in Shoalwater Bay when it has promised to exclude mining from other past and potential silica and mineral sand resource bases in Queensland, namely, Fraser Island, Moreton Bay and the Shelburne-Margaret Bay area to the north?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also a great deal of community concern about other land use proposals for the Shoalwater Bay area. There are eight other proposals for land use. One would like to know whether the Minister could assure the Australian public that these proposals will not also be given the green light by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a need for a wide-ranging inquiry, possibly by the Resource Assessment Commission, into all aspects of sandmining. It is not sufficient to limit the considerations, as is happening at the moment, to what is happening on our beaches. There are extensive deposits of sand in the old dunes south of Broken Hill. It is my understanding that mining there could be carried out with very much less environmental damage than is likely to occur on beaches. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also necessary that we look very closely at the downstream uses to which the products of this mineral sandmining are put. We are told by the Government that it is committed to ecologically sustainable development&mdash;in other words, development which can be indefinitely sustained. One characteristic of such development has to be that when a non-renewable resource is exploited&mdash;and the titanium that comes from beach sand is non-renewable&mdash;for use as a pigment, which 90 per cent of the titanium is, and is distributed around the world on walls, it cannot be garnered back from that use and returned into metal. That industry is not sustainable. Again, to mine our beaches in an irrevocably damaging way, to use the products of that mining for a purpose for which there are other pigments&mdash;we had paints for thousands of years before we discovered the use of titanium oxide&mdash;and to spread them around in ways in which their recycling becomes impossible, when at the same time titanium is a very important resource for many high grade steels, a use from which it could be recycled and for which future generations may well have a need, is to use a resource in a non-renewable way. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate has before it this afternoon a motion to revoke all mining leases in the Shoalwater Bay military training area. The Opposition is very conscious of the need for the preservation of the peculiar environment of the Shoalwater Bay training area. We are also fully aware of the characteristics of that area. We are conscious of the need to have a military training area for the Australian Defence Force as well as of the need for development of Australian industry and the Australian economy consistent with the maintenance of effective environmental controls.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree completely with much of what Senator Counter said. The area has survived because of its relative inaccessibility. As well, the peculiar characteristics of much of that country have not made it suitable in the past for grazing or agricultural activities. I differ with Senator Coulter on the point of access to the area. He said that the only way one can get in is by sea. There are a number of roads, but the fine point is that access to them is controlled. The gates are locked and chained, et cetera, and for very good reasons: this is a live firing area where exercises are carried out, and we simply cannot have tourists or the uninformed general public walking through an area where high explosive is moving at very high speed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, Senator Coulter stressed the point that it probably was not economic to mine the area. That is not a concern of the Parliament. It is for the Parliament not to harass business. It cannot guarantee its survival in an economic sense. The right to go broke is the other side of the coin of the right to earn a profit. Consonant with the responsibilities of government to see that the general public interest is protected, it certainly is not the responsibility of the Government to vet programs on whether they will be profitable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition recognises that it is a very complex issue. We are dealing with three considerations which are often mutually contradictory: running a military training area, which is what it is primarily; running a mining operation; and, above all, maintaining the environment, which is a very difficult problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My attention has been drawn to an article in the press last week by Fiona Kennedy where she claims that the Leader of the Australian Democrats, Senator Coulter, was one of the very few Federal politicians to have visited the Shoalwater Bay area. I can recall members of this Parliament way back going routinely to the Shoalwater Bay area to witness Army exercises. The first time I went was in 1979; I am sure there was a Kangaroo exercise preceding that. There were both parliamentary and party committees. So there has been a stream of parliamentarians through there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My own interest in and experience of the area goes back 40 years. Some of my relatives have properties around the border of the training area. I have flown aircraft over the area&mdash;C130s and Nomads&mdash;on tactical exercises with the Services. I have driven over most of it in Army vehicles. I have slept on the ground in the dust there. The only thing I always do when I am there is be very careful where I put my feet because it is an area that is rife with poisonous snakes. One of the hazards for the Army on exercises there is snake bite. I was in the area for several days last September when 6 Brigade did an exercise, and I think they had eight or nine snake bites, most of them occurring around the watering points, of which there are only two in the area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The position of the Opposition in relation to this motion is governed by the Government's stated policy, which is on the public record. A media release dated 15 October 1990 by Senator Bolkus, when he was the relevant Minister, said that the issue of leases would be conditional on the front dunes not being touched and on a land rehabilitation program of the highest standards being put in place, and that the company would have to develop a memorandum of understanding with the Department of Defence on how the land will be used. To the Opposition, the Government has gone out of its way to cover our concerns comprehensively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Senator Bolkus's press release was issued there were a series of lease conditions&mdash;21 of them, according to the papers I have. They dealt with everything from the military use of the area through the environmental management plan to hydrology, which Senator Coulter mentioned. It is a matter of very great concern that Byfield Creek and the catchment area there, which supplies the Livingstone Shire with water for the Yeppoon settlement, is maintained and is not damaged in any way at all. That is covered in the lease conditions. There will be no mining of frontal dunes, which I think is quite critical. The supplies must be brought in and taken out by barge and rehabilitation must be undertaken, not only to rehabilitate the area but until such time, under the aegis of the CSIRO, as the area has become self-sustaining. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the light of the detail the Government has made available, at this point we have no reason to oppose the mining, given the protection that has been provided by the Government. We certainly will have a major concern in watching the Government to see that it honours the undertakings it has given, but we have no reason to doubt its credentials at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the few minutes I have left I want to deal with the use of Shoalwater Bay as a military training area. We cannot compromise the military use of that area and the availability of that to the Australian defence forces as a training area. From my personal experience, the Australian defence forces have had an interest in conservation that goes back to the 1950s. They have an excellent record in looking after their training lands, particularly in the southern part of Australia, around Puckapunyal and Seymour in Victoria. They were interested in preserving the countryside in the 1950s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> If I look at my own State&mdash;Canungra, Shoalwater Bay, the high range training area at the back of Townsville, at Tully and the Wide Bay area&mdash;the record of the Defence Department is excellent. It is important that the defence forces have access to these areas. They need space to move; they need areas in which to conduct live firing exercises. We cannot train troops without bringing them face to face with reality. While it is difficult to simulate actual warfare, live firing is part of it, and therefore we do have destruction of the environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Coulter said that there was a bombing range at Shoalwater Bay. My understanding of the Shoalwater Bay area is that there is one range on Townsend Island and there are other areas where aerial ordnance has been dropped. We cannot escape the fact that damage is done when we detonate high explosives. It is inevitable that that is done. The Services try to restrict the number of times they do that. They repair the damage where possible and they rotate the training areas. It is important that we have a much bigger area than we need at any one time so that we do not wear out the hillsides and the creeks putting vehicles, troops and all the rest of it through them. There are very few places in Australia where we have military training areas. Shoalwater Bay is the only area we have of that size on the east coast. Even using Shoalwater Bay, there is a very considerable transport cost in getting units up to it, mainly from the south, with a few that come down from the north. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most important concern I have in relation to the use of Shoalwater Bay for mining is the safety distances that are now required with modern weapons. We are moving into a higher technology era where laser designators and laser guided munitions are becoming increasingly common for precision guided munitions. The moment we start using lasers, the safety distances we require go up considerably over the safety distances we require for high explosive. Put quite simply, if we need one mile for a certain type of high explosive, when using lasers we might need 10 miles so that people's eyesight is not damaged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be absolutely intolerable for the use of that training area to be compromised by the presence of miners and their families resident in the area. If human beings are involved in commerce there they must always recognise that they take a secondary place to the activities of the military using it as a training area. As a senator for Queensland, I will have very little patience with anyone who rings up and complains to me about the noise of gunfire or the denial of access to certain areas which comes from the use of that as a military training area. </PARA>

I think it is, by whatever definition, relatively pristine. I understand that the military took over that land in about 1965, and it is possible that not too much had been happening there before the military took it over. However, to talk of any land in Australia as pristine in 1965 is a bit exciting. Somebody must have walked over it. Probably it was not as it ever was before, but compared to other areas where there had been felling for grazing or different land use, quite clearly it was relatively uninterfered with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Coulter went on to say that the military has been very good at looking after this land, which is a change of heart from what the Democrats have had to say about military protection of places in times past. Even more interestingly, he said that only a small area has been used for bombing. I cannot imagine any area used for bombing that would still rate the description `pristine', unless it was referred to as pristinely interrupted. No place that has been used for bombing can be a pristine area. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose we could get down to how much land has been destroyed in this area by bombing versus how much land is proposed to be included under the mining leases. For the record, the mining leases will occupy about 5 per cent of the land of the Shoalwater Bay National Estate area. I do not know the size of the bombing area, but I am advised that the five mining leases will constitute 5 per cent of the Shoalwater Bay National Estate area. It depends on where that area is; I would not want to say that 5 per cent is very small so therefore we do not have to worry about it. But it should be noted that it is 5 per cent. It is not 50 per cent, it is not 25 per cent, it is not more than half. It is a small area in terms of percentage. I would also presume that it is probably not where the bombs have dropped, although I am not clear where the bombing area is with respect to the mining leases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today we are making clear what our positions are. Much work has been done over the years in coming to this decision. Most of what has been said today has not told the full story and long history of this area. It is true and important to note that prior to that land being acquired by the Commonwealth as a defence training area prospecting licences were issued by the State of Queensland and held by Murphyores Incorporated Pty Ltd and Mineral Deposits Pty Ltd. These approvals have not been given out of the blue; they have arisen as a result of a very long deliberative process dealing with rights which were in place before the Commonwealth acquired the land for a defence training area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I understand it, prior to 1965, under State mining legislation, a mining company holding a licence to prospect could expect to be granted a mining lease on request. Mineral Deposits Pty Ltd waived its compensation rights in exchange for the restoration by the Commonwealth of its pre-acquisition dredging leases. That action was agreed to and approved by the Governor-General in Council in 1969. Those dredging leases expired in 1988 unused. To avoid a compensation claim by Murphyores, the Commonwealth agreed that its existing prospecting licences would be continued and that any subsequent applications for mining leases would be granted on substantially the same terms as previously held from the State. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to note that all of this has been a matter of considerable consideration. It went through the High Court. We are not rushing to produce exploration licences or mining leases without massive deliberation in this area. I take Senator MacGibbon's point that probably nowhere has such thought been given to the balance between the need for development and the protection of the environment. In this case, it has been complicated further by the requirements of the military which is present in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1980 the whole of the Shoalwater Bay defence training area was put on the register of the National Estate. As I mentioned earlier, there was a settlement out of the High Court when it was tackling this case. The Commonwealth agreed to the issues of mining leases to Murphyores unless environmental reasons following the preparation of an environmental impact statement prevented the exploration of minerals. The EIS was completed in February 1990, the outcome being that mining leases could be issued subject to a number of conditions being met. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also important to note that the terms of the 1970 agreement between the Commonwealth and Murphyores, and the terms of the High Court settlement of the action between the Commonwealth and Murphyores, meant that the Commonwealth was legally obliged to issue leases subject to conditions. In 1990, the Cabinet decided that the leases could be issued subject to a number of stringent conditions designed to protect the environment and heritage values of the area, as well as the area's use as a military training area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other honourable senators have mentioned the lease conditions. It is very useful to acknowledge the presence of the lease conditions. There are 21 points. As Senator MacGibbon has already stated, it is probably the most comprehensive and thorough arrangement or detail of a lease to ensure, as much as possible, that almost every variation of environmental concern is covered. Some of the conditions have been referred to previously, but I think they need to be stated again. In particular, the frontal dunes are not be used, not to be included. Those listening to Senator Coulter might not have understood that. The frontal dunes are not to be touched. There also has to be a barging of the products, heavy equipment and fuel from the area. Senator MacGibbon also mentioned the difficulty of access&mdash;although quite clearly there is some access because it is a military training area. To minimise any further environmental damage from infrastructure, most of the comings and goings for the mining areas will be by barge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Condition 11 points out that if any areas of special significance, which are as yet unrecognised or undocumented, are found&mdash;be they of flora and fauna or Aboriginal significance&mdash;the mining plan has to ensure that those areas will be protected and avoided by the dredge path. I will not go through all of the points of the lease agreement. Condition 16 provides that two Commonwealth Government nominees are to be afforded access to witness, inspect or examine any part of the operation, including the processing plant and any monitoring of equipment. They shall be provided with any necessary assistance in carrying out such duties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to note that if any of the conditions of this lease is breached, or if there is evidence of significant impact on the environment, the work shall halt. Point 21 is very important. It provides for liaison with ATSIC to ensure maximum protection of significant Aboriginal sites and close working with Aboriginal communities to ensure that their knowledge and expert evidence, if you like, of those areas is taken into account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In some ways, we have here a brilliant example of what is meant by `sustainable development'. Quite clearly, there are benefits from the mining. While Senator Coulter argues that this mining can be carried out in all sorts of other places, quite clearly the exploration shows that there are significant amounts of the rare earth from sandmining in this area. The mining companies have made the economic decision to proceed. On the one hand, the Government has to balance that sort of development which, according to some reports, will provide a significant number of jobs&mdash;perhaps 400, others say 500, and I have heard others mention less than 400&mdash;in the long term. That cannot be overlooked. There will also be a return to the Government and to the people of Australia, through the balance of trade, of up to $270m per annum. This is not an insignificant mining project. On the other hand, we have an area which, by some definitions, is pristine. It has been relatively untouched over the years. It is an area which any number of people say is very beautiful and deserves our protection and keenest environmental regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How do we find the solution between these conflicting areas? In this sort of process, particularly the lease conditions which go with the allowance of these leases, the Government has required the mining companies to seriously understand its intentions in this matter. Protection of the environment is a very high and significant part of this Government's agenda. Mining cannot proceed, as it has in the past, with no regard at all to the impact on the local community or local environment. There cannot be disregard for the consequences of these activities. Mining companies now recognise that. In coming to an agreement on these lease conditions, these mining companies understand how serious is the Government's intent to protect the environment as much as possible while at the same time properly allowing development. If and when the operation proceeds, it will need the closest examination and supervision. I believe that it is an excellent example of what could be meant by `sustainable development'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to note that until those conditions of the lease are met mining will not proceed. The proposals by the mining companies must have the approval of the Queensland Government before the implementation of the lease permissions can proceed. There are brakes and checks at every turn in the granting of these leases, from which we should take heart. We do not necessarily want to wholesomely approve that this should be the process in every case, but it certainly shows that government, committed to environment protection, can put those stringent requirements on mining and that the mining industry can appreciate the seriousness of its obligations and come to the party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is perfectly reasonable for the mining companies to say, `We are not going to be constrained by all of those considerations about the environment. We are not going to do that at all. We will take our mining equipment or our mining proposals elsewhere'. They have not done that. They have found it more reasonable to actually sit down with the parties involved, State and Federal government, and take into account the conditions of the lease, which certainly indicates a serious desire by the mining companies to cooperate in this area and that they also see the importance of sustainable development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The debates we might have had 25 or 50 years ago when mining companies would have laughed people supporting the environment to scorn no longer take place. The mining industries know that they cannot ignore the environment; they do so at their own peril. They also have to know that if they ignore the conditions of the environment they take on not only the Government but also the people of this country, both through the Government and outside of government, who say that wilful and wanton damage of the environment will not be allowed, as has been the case in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Strangely, this Shoalwater Bay development, in providing this kind of example, deserves our most serious supervision and following of progress. Not only is this development a matter of concern between environment and mining&mdash;if you like, government and its concern for the environment being the same as the rights of mining&mdash;but also, as has been mentioned earlier, it takes into account the needs of the Defence Force. Some of us&mdash;and I would be included&mdash;would like a situation where we never have defence forces and we never have to test weapons. I would be appalled if we were to go the way of a weapon that somehow has a laser attached to it which makes it bigger and brighter and has a `10 times factor', as I think Senator MacGibbon put it. But I am not unrealistic about the needs of defence forces for proper and adequate training. This agreement that has been reached between government, mining and the Department of the Defence&mdash;which is, although an arm of government separate from its concerns about the environment, clearly a part of government&mdash;is a stunning example of what could be meant by `sustainable development'&mdash;something from which we could take cautious heart. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there is any damage&mdash;more than is permissible or allowable under the mining lease&mdash;to the environment, quite clearly the Government will move to see that a stop is put to either the whole mining operation or to those processes and practices that are environmentally damaging. At the same time, the terms of the lease conditions also provide for rehabilitation. The conditions of the lease provide not only for final rehabilitation&mdash;meaning, I presume, at the end of the mining operation&mdash;but also for rehabilitation on the go, as the process proceeds, so that the land is not left degraded, to be blown away or forgotten for the duration of the mining which may in fact be a number of years. Rehabilitation is required as the process proceeds, thus minimising the damage from the lack or presence of plants, to enable plants not only to emerge and regrow but also to bind the soil. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government will be voting against this urgency motion. The Government is concerned about all of the issues raised by Senator Coulter, but in its process to protect the environment, having regard to the needs of the military in this area and by placing very stringent conditions on the mining, I believe we have here an example of sustainable development. We should not blush but support such a process and, indeed, extend these sorts of very stringent environmental conditions to other areas where the mining industry in the past has not been required to be as concerned as government is&mdash;the mining industry now seems to appreciate that it must be concerned&mdash;to protect Australia's environment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Coulter asked the Senate to support an urgency motion to revoke sandmining leases in the Shoalwater Bay area. Senator MacGibbon and I looked at the case very carefully. There was some superficial appeal in the motion, but I agree with the comments of my colleague and friend from Queensland Senator MacGibbon that we cannot support the motion which Senator Coulter has brought before the Senate. One of the reasons we cannot support it is that clearly Senator Coulter, on the arguments advanced today, labours under some misapprehensions not only about the area but also about the nature of the sandmining that would take place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Coulter gave a very eloquent and very moving speech about the sand dunes, about the migratory birds and about the beauty of sitting on the beach, but many of these concerns are not real concerns at all. For example, Senator Coulter's concern that the sand dunes might be affected has in fact already been dealt with. It has been dealt with in the lease conditions, No. 9 of which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There shall be no mining of frontal dunes.</PARA>
<PARA>Quite clearly, the frontal dunes that Senator Coulter mentioned will not be affected. It is a spurious and perhaps misleading argument to say that this is one of the reasons the sandmining leases should be revoked. The matter has been dealt with and need not be dealt with by the Senate. Senator Coulter said that he had a concern about migratory birds. As somebody who enjoys looking at various forms of wildlife, I agree that this could be a problem. Again, the lease conditions that govern this sandmining lease deal with this matter. Lease condition No. 11 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If areas of special significance, eg major areas of rainforest, rare and/or endangered flora and fauna and aboriginal areas of cultural and heritage significance, are found during the exploration phase, the mine plan shall ensure that they are protected by having the dredge path avoid these areas.</PARA>
<PARA>Condition 14 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Special attention shall be paid to the education of all employees on the desirability and methods of environmental protection including the protection of areas excluded from operations on environmental grounds and of Aboriginal sites.</PARA>
<PARA>That matter also has clearly been dealt with. There is no reason why we should support this motion. The area is the subject of significant studies. The whole area has been looked at, the environmental impact has been looked at, will be monitored during the course of the life of this mine, and poses no real threat to the matters Senator Coulter has raised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why then should we support this motion? Senator Coulter raised a number of points that were perhaps more philosophical. He did say, for example, that these areas would be devastated. Devastated would not be the case. Senator Coulter perhaps has not sat on the beaches at the Gold Coast. Nearly all of those beaches were the subject of sandmining in the 1960s and 1970s. The area around Currumbin was heavily sandmined in the 1970s. There was in fact a processing plant at Currumbin. One would not even know it now when one goes to visit the area because, of course, it has all been restored. So it is wrong to say that sandmining would destroy the area, that sandmining would destroy the environmental significance or the beauty of the area, because sandmining clearly in the past has not done this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, Senator Coulter seems to miss the point that in Queensland these days there is increasing movement towards multiple use of land. For example, the Byfield Creek sandmining area is in the middle of a national park. The effect has already been looked at. It is considered that the sandmining will not significantly affect the national park and it is planned to go ahead. So the argument that mining industries destroy the environment, the argument that the mining industry will devastate these sites to such an extent that they cannot be restored, is clearly wrong. It has been shown to be wrong in the past and clearly will be shown to be wrong again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Coulter then raised a more philosophical argument. The argument he raised was that we should not allow this sandmining to take place because it was non-sustainable. On what basis did he say that it would be non-sustainable? He said that it would be non-sustainable because the titanium oxide which would be extracted and used could not be recycled; therefore, it was clearly a non-sustainable industry&mdash;a non-sustainable extractive process. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Coulter" NAMEID="TF4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TF4">Senator Coulter</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You have that right!</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EU4">Senator O'CHEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On Senator Coulter's logic, we should not mine for oil, coal, gas or any mineral which cannot be substantially recycled. One cannot put the argument that something is non-sustainable because it cannot be recycled in this industry or that industry but it is still a sustainable industry; you either have it or you do not. Senator Coulter clearly misses the point that nearly every mining industry&mdash;under Senator Coulter's definition of non-sustainability&mdash;is non-sustainable, if that be the definition of non-sustainability.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at these issues we have a responsibility to recognise that we are involved in an extractive process&mdash;we are taking something out&mdash;but that we are taking it out for a purpose: to sustain the economy, to provide resources and, most importantly, to provide jobs. If Senator Coulter had his way and the motion were to be passed and the Government accepted it, then we would be losing not only a sandmine but also the jobs that would go with it. The National Party cannot accept that, when the project has already been the subject of significant environmental study and there are 21 special clauses to the lease which are designed to protect the environment and ensure proper management and care throughout the life of the mine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be devastating to towns such as Gladstone&mdash;which would receive the benefit of the mine&mdash;were this motion to be passed and the Government to accept it. It is planned that two downstream Gladstone mills would result from the project, with an initial capital expenditure of $180m&mdash;$180m in an area which is already suffering very high levels of unemployment and where existing industries are not assured of being there in 20 years time, or even in five years time, because of the effects of the recession and the drop in global demand for many of the products that are made there. What we are talking about here is turning our backs on $180m worth of potential investment in Gladstone alone with just two mills. An enormous boost to the economy of Gladstone and central Queensland would flow from this mine if it were given the chance, but Senator Coulter does not wish to give it that chance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, Senator Coulter told the Senate that the profitability of this mine is marginal. The profitability of this mine may be marginal&mdash;maybe it is not marginal&mdash;but is it for the Senate to be the arbiter of business transactions and business investment in this country? Is it for us, as members of the Senate, to sit here and say, `This project is viable; that project is not viable, therefore we are not going to allow that project to take place.'? Of course that is not our role in the Senate. If we agree to these leases on principle, albeit with conditions, then it is for the company concerned to make the judgment as to whether the mine is viable and whether it will go ahead. If the mine is not viable, as Senator Coulter would have us believe, then the company is clearly not going to invest in it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect to Senator Coulter, it is a furphy to suggest that the mine is possibly marginally viable and, therefore, we should block it. It does not follow that we should take that course of action and, as a senator from Queensland, I would be loath to vote for a motion which overrides the initial and ongoing environmental studies that have been done; to vote for a motion that would not create jobs but would, in fact, cause the loss of jobs; to vote for a motion which would deprive one of our regional cities of $180m worth of investment; and to vote for a motion on the basis that Senator Coulter or some other honourable senator in this chamber believed that a particular investment project was not viable. We, on this side of the chamber, will not be supporting the motion for the reasons that have been set out&mdash;reasons which we believe are eminent commonsense. </PARA>

<PARA>That is a very serious charge. Mr Downer has totally got his facts wrong and if he had rung my office he would have found out why. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The circumstances are that a firm called Techway has contracts with the Defence Department. There was concern as to whether it was meeting the Australian content. When this was brought to the attention of my office we launched an investigation. We requested the Department of Administrative Services to look at the Australian content of Techway and to report back. Mr Downer claims in his press release that we have turned `a blind eye' and that in some way we are not concerned about it. The facts are the direct opposite. We immediately investigated this situation to make sure that the contractual obligations were being fully met. We informed Techway of this. For Mr Downer to cast a cloud over my office in such a defamatory way when the facts are directly the opposite is a very shameful thing for him to do. </PARA>

<PARA>I am aware of the issue that the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) has raised, but I am not aware of what has been going on in his office or the Department of Defence. I draw to the Senate's attention that some two or maybe three years ago I was assured by officials of the Department of Defence that regular assessments would be made under the terms of the contract with IBM and that all participants in this DESINE contract would be scrutinised on a regular basis in respect of their Australian and New Zealand or ANZ content. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the Minister whether that has been occurring regularly. In other words, has there been compliance throughout the period since about 1989 on this contract? In addition, I was given assurances at the same time by officials of his Department that the Department of Defence would also be scrutinising the total ANZ content, not from a compliance point of view but to ensure that this requirement was met. Has that regular scrutiny been carried out by his Department as well? What exactly is the position with both DAS and Defence in terms of the assurances that I was given by Defence officials during considerations of the estimates in May and October of 1989?</PARA>

There is also a difficulty in assessing how one assesses the content&mdash;whether one does it in terms of hard material or in dollar terms. This is where some of the friction or differences between the departments monitoring this and their belief as to whether or not Techway has met its obligations has occurred.

There has been a disagreement on whether there is sufficient ANZ content in the hard discs, screens, et cetera, or whether there has been an attempt to assess it in dollar terms in the through-life contract.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">TO</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">THE PARLIAMENTARY JOINT COMMITTEE ON THE NATIONAL CRIME AUTHORITY'S REPORT "WHO IS TO GUARD THE GUARDS?"</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Report on the Parliamentary Joint Committee's evaluation of the National Crime Authority, tabled on 28 November 1991, follows on from the Committee's earlier evaluation in 1988. That earlier Report recommended that a comprehensive evaluation of the Authority's work, and the need for a body such as the Authority, be undertaken seven years after the date of commencement of the National Crime Authority Act 1984. The Committee has a statutory duty under section 55 of the National Crime Authority Act "to monitor and to review the performance by the Authority of its functions" and to report its findings to Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is now nearly eight years since this House enacted the National Crime Authority Bill. In delivering the Second Reading Speech, the then Minister for Communications said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&mdash;the Authority was "designed to effectively coordinate and lead on a national basis the attack against organised crime";</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&mdash;"the basic role of the proposed Crime Authority&mdash;although there are others as well&mdash;will be to operate as an arm of the criminal investigation process, gathering and assembling evidence for transmission to other law enforcement agencies for use ultimately in conducting prosecutions".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So far as the Government is concerned, the Authority has generally lived up to the hopes placed in it. Indeed that is also the view of the other Governments represented on the Inter-Governmental Committee, the Ministerial Committee to which the Authority is primarily accountable, and which now comprises all nine Governments in Australia. The Inter-Governmental Committee's submission to the Parliamentary Committee said, in part, ". . . . the NCA remains the most effective national vehicle for countering organised crime that can be devised, given the division of responsibilities amongst the Australian jurisdictions and the need to balance effectiveness with accountability . . . ".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In its current evaluation, the Parliamentary Joint Committee has come to a similar conclusion and supports the continued existence and activities of the Authority, and acknowledges that it is now a vital part of Australia's law enforcement regime. The Committee accepts the continued validity of the reasons that led to the establishment of the Authority, and does so notwithstanding a number of submissions to it critical of the Authority and opposed to its continuation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the only law enforcement agency in the area of organised crime able to operate in and across all Australian jurisdictions, the Authority has been able to ensure that the targets it pursues have not been able, as in the past, to evade proper investigations because of jurisdictional problems. The Mr Asia group is perhaps the classic example of such evasion, as Mr Justice Stewart showed in his 1983 Royal Commission report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are some aspects of this national role which should be emphasised. The Authority has working with it officers from every police service in Australia, numbering in total 91 at 31 December last. The scope of the Authority's activities is reflected in the multiple sources of its references: of the 13 references it has received so far, the Commonwealth is involved in 12, New South Wales 8, Victoria 5, South Australia 4, Western Australia 2, Queensland 2 and the Northern Territory 1.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result of Authority investigations, persons have been convicted in all the mainland States. Each State and Territory has its own legislation underpinning the Commonwealth Act. Those jurisdictions which have granted references have contributed substantially to the Authority's operating costs&mdash;directly under the cost-sharing arrangements to the tune of more than $22m to 30 June last, and indirectly through the provision of the police officers mentioned earlier, the salaries of most of whom continue to be met by their parent forces.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Authority coordinates its activities with those of other agencies. These coordination arrangements were formalised in 1991 by the establishment of a Consultative Committee and a Secretariat, which are the primary selection vehicles for recommendations on Authority references and inquiries to the Inter-Governmental Committee. Represented on these two bodies are the Australian Securities Commission, the Cash Transaction Reports Agency, the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence and all the Commissioners of Police. No other law enforcement agency is subjected to such a discipline.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the area of investigative techniques, the Authority has adapted and extended the model of the Costigan and Stewart Royal Commissions and uses all the relevant investigative talents&mdash;lawyers, accountants, police officers, intelligence officers supplemented where required by tax officers, customs officers and other specialists. Where appropriate, the Authority has concentrated on the financial assets of those whom it has investigated, using the pecuniary penalty provisions of the Customs Act and the Proceeds of Crime Act and referring understated or undeclared income to the Australian Taxation Office. It has also introduced new investigative techniques in some particular areas of organised crime.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proceeds of crime frozen or secured up to 30 June 1991 as a result of Authority investigations amounted to more than $38m. The Authority also makes use of the money laundering provisions of the Proceeds of Crime Act. Most of the people facing proceedings in this complex area have been charged following Authority investigations. In one investigation, the value of assets frozen or secured is $9m.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Taxation Office has issued assessments amounting to more than $47m as a result of Authority investigations. In addition, the Authority has notified the Tax Office of a further $22m in understated or undeclared income, and has assisted in the issue of other assessments amounting to more than $14m. These figures demonstrate that the Authority is targeting people at the top of the tree and that it is doing so with some success.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An example of its leadership in the area of investigative technique is the Authority's use of Chinese officers, beginning some years ago, in its investigations into drug importations, an initiative recently taken up by the NSW Crime Commission and the NSW Police Service.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Queensland Criminal Justice Commission, the NSW Crime Commission and the NSW Independent Commission Against Corruption are well aware that innovative and successful investigative techniques arise from mixing investigative talents. The first two in particular have followed in the Authority's footsteps. The Government commends this path to police forces. The use of accountants and investigative lawyers is critical to the effective investigation of organised crime.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Authority has also displayed leadership in other areas. It has organised operational conferences on particular aspects of organised crime. It is making a substantial contribution to lifting the standard of strategic intelligence in law enforcement agencies generally. Its innovations with information technology and electronic surveillance have attracted attention elsewhere.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government and the Inter-Governmental Committee believe the Authority is an essential element of the Australian law enforcement strategy, and has justified its existence hitherto. It should not be assumed, however, that the Authority can rest on its laurels. As was indicated in the Parliamentary Committee's Report, the Authority's role and function must remain under critical evaluation. While the reasons for the establishment of the Authority are still valid, there has been significant development over the past 8 years in the capacity of Australian police forces to undertake sophisticated investigations. The Authority itself has contributed to those changes, and their implications for the role and operations of the Authority require continuous assessment. Members of the Inter-Governmental Committee look to the new Chairman, Mr Tom Sherman, to move firmly to consolidate and build upon the foundation now established and to lead the Authority in a productive partnership with other law enforcement agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most of the genuinely held concerns about what the Authority might suffer and do or not do have turned out to have been misplaced. No credible evidence has been forthcoming that the Authority has been a danger to civil liberties. Nor has it been shackled in what it wishes to do: it has never been refused a reference. The prospect of political interference was a concern in 1983 and 1984, but there has been no suggestion that this has occurred. Legal challenges to the Authority's powers and the like have been few&mdash;perhaps surprisingly so. Those proceedings which have reached the Federal Court involving the use by the Authority of its powers have all been resolved in the Authority's favour. One such matter did not reach the Court, the Authority having altered its view. That these and similar fears have been allayed is largely due to the good sense of successive Chairmen and Members of the Authority, and its staff, who have established both its independence and its credibility.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Parliamentary Joint Committee received 56 submissions and took evidence from 64 individuals at 12 public hearings in six cities. The public hearing with the Authority in the course of the evaluation was the first time that the Committee had heard evidence from the Authority in public. The approach adopted by the Committee in holding public hearings was in contrast to that adopted by a previous Committee in 1988 when conducting an evaluation of the Authority: all its hearings were in private. The public hearings seem to have been successful.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Authority being constituted as it is, the Government has consulted the Inter-Governmental Committee on the Report's recommendations. What follows is accordingly a response not simply from the Commonwealth but from all nine jurisdictions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Parliamentary Joint Committee's first recommendation was that the re-allocation of resources required by police forces to compensate for the Authority's changed emphasis be given urgent attention. These are matters for Police Ministers and Commissioners. No doubt the NCA's new Chairman, Mr Tom Sherman, and the other Members of the Authority, together with the Inter-Governmental Committee, will keep the directions and resource implications of the Authority's investigations under constant review.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The number of police officers attached to the Authority fell significantly between 30 June 1990, when the number was 145, and 30 June 1991, when the number was 95&mdash;a fall of more than one-third. The change in the Authority's emphasis has already returned some resources to police services. The Minister for Justice will be examine recommendation as it affects the Australian Federal Police (AFP), and his State and Territory counterparts will no doubt be doing the same for their police services. The reduction in police numbers is not necessarily permanent or long-term. The Authority's emphasis may well change again and create new demands for police officers. These are properly matters for negotiation as and when the need arises.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second recommendation is that there be a continuing review of the potential for duplication of intelligence functions between the Authority, the AFP and the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence (ABCI). The Inter-Governmental Committee accepts this recommendation. It will ask the three agencies themselves to keep the matter under review, and it will obtain a report from them annually on the situation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The need to remove the prospect for duplication has been, and continues to be, a concern of all of the participating jurisdictions. The National Crime Authority Act specifically refers to the need for the Authority to consult with the ABCI. The co-operation between the Authority and the ABCI has improved significantly to the extent that they are jointly involved in the development of several strategic overviews of specific intelligence targets. The current Director of the ABCI has acknowledged in his evidence to the Parliamentary Committee that the two bodies have a good working relationship and healthy communication links. The Australian Police Ministers' Council, which has responsibility for the ABCI, has before it matters relating to the operational efficiency of the intelligence gathering resources of law enforcement agencies generally, including the Authority, the ABCI, the AFP and State and Territory Police.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The third recommendation is that the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security be given jurisdiction to investigate complaints against the Authority, its staff and those seconded to work for it. A complaints procedure was recommended by the Inter-Governmental Committee to the Joint Committee, so the Inter-Governmental Committee has no difficulty in accepting the recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government will bring forward legislation to create the position of Inspector-General of the National Crime Authority. It is intended that complaints could be made by members of the public direct to the Inspector-General, or be referred by the Parliamentary Joint Committee or a member of the Inter-Governmental Committee. For the purposes of investigating a complaint, the Inspector-General would be given full and unfettered access to all Authority information, materials and staff. He would also have discretion to refuse to investigate complaints which are frivolous, vexatious, trivial or otherwise without merit, or where he is of the view that no useful purpose would be served. It is not proposed that the Inspector-General would investigate complaints against individuals working for the NCA where such a matter fell within the ambit of existing legislation, such as Commonwealth or State police complaints arrangements. The Inspector-General would report his findings to the Minister responsible for the Authority, and would report annually to the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fourth recommendation is that the Attorney-General's Department, in consultation with the Privacy Commissioner, develop specific privacy guidelines to cover the Authority's activities. The reasons for the recommendations are set out fully in the Committee's report. The Authority has no difficulty with it. The Inter-Governmental Committee accepts the recommendation. It is proposed that compliance with the guidelines, once developed, be monitored by the Inspector General of the Authority. The Attorney-General's Department will be consulting the Authority and the Privacy Commissioner shortly. It is noted, however, that the matter is complex and not without difficulty&mdash;as has been the case in developing similar guidelines for the Australian Security Intelligence Organization.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendations five to seven go to the heart of the relationship between the Joint Committee and the Authority.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Broadly, what is proposed in the Report is that the legislative constraints which limit the Joint Committee's access to certain information about the Authority's activities should be swept away.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Parliamentary Joint Committee has itself, in the body of its Report, acknowledged that the question of the extent to which it should be permitted access to Authority information is a matter of grave concern to each of the Governments represented on the Inter-Governmental Committee. It is not as simple a matter as is represented by some current and past members of the Parliamentary Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was not the intention of the Government, nor the Parliament, when the National Crime Authority Act was passed in 1984, that the Parliamentary Joint Committee would become involved in the operational activities of the Authority.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">History has shown, however, that the relevant sections of the Act suffer from some ambiguity. This is perhaps due to the fact that these provisions were inserted by the Senate in 1984 and were not as well developed as might have been desirable. Thus, although the original Bill provided for the Inter-Governmental Committee "to monitor generally the work of the Authority", the addition of the Joint Committee provided for it "to monitor and review the performance by the Authority of its functions".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Inter-Governmental Committee regards itself as the body to which the Authority is primarily accountable. It is the Ministers on that Committee, as representatives of all Australian Governments, who have created the Authority and keep it in being. It is they who give references to the Authority. Without their support, the national character and capacity of the Authority would immediately dissolve. It is they who provide financial and human resources to the Authority, and monitor priorities and direction. It is they to whom accountability is primarily owed. The Joint Committee does not and cannot do any of these things, and the accountability owed to it is accordingly of a different character.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was recognised in 1984 that, because of the nature of the special powers given to the Authority, there was a need for special attention to the balance maintained between the civil liberties of individuals and the operational needs of law enforcement, and to the balance between those civil liberties and the concept of accountability. The Parliamentary Joint Committee was the watchdog established with principal responsibility to ensure that these balances are appropriately maintained.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is the opinion of both the Government and the Inter-Governmental Committee that certain principles need to be established to ensure that the Parliamentary Joint Committee can fulfil its responsibilities without impinging on the necessary operational security of the NCA's investigations. The Government and the Inter-Governmental Committee are of the unanimous view that the Parliamentary Committee should have access in principle to all non-operational information, but should not have access to operational information the disclosure of which might prejudice&mdash;the safety or reputation of a person or the fair trial of a person who has been or may be charged with an offence; the effectiveness of an investigation; or the operations of law enforcement agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The solution first proposed by the Parliamentary Committee to the disputed question of access to information from the Authority is, in effect, that it become the superior body, with powers greater than the Inter-Governmental Committee. By the operation of section 59(5) of the Act, the Authority is unable to furnish to the Inter-Governmental Committee "any matter the disclosure of which to members of the public could prejudice the safety or reputation of persons or the operations of law enforcement agencies". Such matters may be furnished to individual Ministers who have issued the relevant reference, but not to the Committee. The Parliamentary Committee proposes no such constraint on itself in acquiring such material, only on disclosing it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Inter-Governmental Committee does not accept this solution.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In paragraph 7.57 of its Report, however, the Parliamentary Joint Committee itself recognises the problems involved in its having unrestricted access to information, and has indicated its willingness to accept a second option which would provide it with the power to access all save "sensitive" information held by the Authority. This appears to the Inter-Governmental Committee to be a preferable approach.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government will, after discussions with the new Chairman of the Authority and the Inter-Governmental Committee, present to the Parliament a proposal for an amendment to the National Crime Authority Act which would provide the Parliamentary Joint Committee with access to all non-operational information, together with a clear definition of operational information. The Government accepts that even with a clear definition of the type of information not to be disclosed to the Parliamentary Joint Committee, there may be occasions where the Parliamentary Joint Committee would wish to dispute a decision by the Authority that material was "operational" and therefore not available to the Committee. In the past such situations have not been resolved easily, if at all.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is proposed to include in the draft legislation a procedure for review of the Authority's decision. It is envisaged that, following a request from the Parliamentary Joint Committee, the Inspector-General of the Authority (referred to in relation to recommendations three and four above) be empowered to review the Authority's determination and report to the Minister responsible to the Parliament for the Authority, who should retain the final decision on disclosure. These arrangements would ensure the accountability of that final decision, through the Minister, to the Parliamentary Committee and the Parliament as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is intended that the proposed amendments to the National Crime Authority Act be formulated in a manner acceptable to the Government, the States and Territories, the Parliamentary Joint Committee, and the Parliament as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation eight is that the National Crime Authority Act should be amended to confer on a member of the Authority a discretion to hold investigative hearings in public.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This recommendation raises important issues of principle, which are well presented and canvassed in Chapter Seven of the Joint Committee's report. The Inter-Governmental Committee has, in examining this recommendation, also taken into account the view of the Authority itself, which is that the recommendation should be adopted. After very careful consideration, however, the Inter-Governmental Committee has decided that the recommendation should not be taken up, the essential reason being that the risks in the Authority conducting public hearings outweigh the benefits. The risks include danger to the reputations, rights and civil liberties of persons called before public hearings, as well as prejudice to future court proceedings. There are also operational considerations. As is noted above, the Authority's basic role is investigative: its aim is to gather admissible evidence of offences with a view to people being prosecuted. Evidence given at hearings can be and is used as evidence in court, although witnesses at hearings cannot be obliged to incriminate themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the view of the Inter-Governmental Committee, this sets the Authority apart from the other agencies which are quoted in the Report. The role of the NSW Independent Commission against Corruption, for example, is primarily the exposure of corruption, so that while the Commission can insist on answers to its questions, such evidence given before it is not admissible in proceedings. In this aspect it resembles a Royal Commission, the object of which is the truth rather than admissible evidence. In the present context, the relevant part of the charter of the Criminal Justice Commission in Queensland is the investigation of organised crime which is beyond ordinary police methods, dearly with a view to the gathering of admissible evidence. As the Inter-Governmental Committee is advised, the Commission has never used its public hearings powers in such investigations. Indeed, the Commission has adopted a properly narrow view of the circumstances in which it will use its public hearings powers. In its 1990-91 Annual Report, it says that the public hearing process "cannot be taken lightly" and "should be reserved for serious matters of substantial public interest which go beyond the conduct of the individual and point out some issue of public principle".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is relevant to note that the National Crime Authority Act provides for the Authority to hold public sittings (as distinct from hearings) "for the purpose of informing the public of, or receiving submissions in relation to, the general conduct of its operations." The Authority is prevented from divulging at such sittings "any matter the disclosure of which to members of the public could prejudice the safety or reputation of a person or prejudice the fair trial of a person who has been or may be charged with an offence". It is a matter of regret that the Authority in the nearly seven years of its existence has held only five such sittings, the last in March 1990. It may be that the greater use of public sittings could achieve the objectives of those who urge public hearings&mdash;notably the fostering of public confidence and a reduction in secrecy&mdash;without running the risks attendant on public hearings mentioned earlier. Accordingly, the Inter-Governmental Committee will be asking the Authority to examine that possibility, and in doing so to consult with the Joint Committee. The possibility of some legislative change to section 60 of the Act is left open, but not so as to change the character of the sittings as distinct from hearings, nor to reduce the existing safeguards. Any proposals the Authority might wish to make will be carefully considered by the Commonwealth and of course by the Inter-Governmental Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation nine is that at an appropriate time in the future the appointment of Authority Chairmen be formally reviewed. This recommendation arose from the criticisms of a number of witnesses who appeared before the Joint Committee and urged that judges not be appointed to the position of Authority Chairman. The recommendation has been overtaken by events with the appointment of Mr Sherman as Chairman of the Authority. Mr Sherman is not a judge, but he is a distinguished legal practitioner. It is the sole concern of the Government and members of the Inter-Governmental Committee in such matters that the appointee be the best person available.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation ten is that consideration be given to appointing a senior police officer, either serving or retired, as a member of the Authority. The Inter-Governmental Committee is of the view that the sole concern in assessing prospective members of the Authority should be the suitability of available candidates to fulfil that role, regardless of background. On this basis, no special consideration will be given to a police officer, serving or retired. Neither is such a person in any way disqualified from appointment. The question of future membership will be discussed with members of the Inter-Governmental Committee prior to the expiry of the current members' terms of office on 30 June 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The eleventh and last recommendation is that the Attorney-General's Department consider the effect of section 12 of the National Crime Authority Act and address any ambiguities that may exist in subsection 12(4). This recommendation is entirely acceptable. An examination of the matter is in hand, and the considered views of the Authority will be taken into account, as will those of the Inter-Governmental Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government and the Inter-Governmental Committee will continue to monitor and review the activities of the National Crime Authority, as will the Parliamentary Joint Committee.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report of the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Who is to Guard the Guards?</EMPHASIS>, was provided after the Committee received 56 submissions and took evidence from 64 individuals at 12 public hearings in six cities. It was therefore quite an extensive review of the NCA's activities. The Government is now responding to the recommendations made in the Committee's report. I wish to comment briefly on the Government's response, which on the whole is somewhat disappointing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first recommendation of the Committee suggested that, in view of the different emphasis the National Crime Authority was now following, a careful and clearly detailed reallocation of resources should take place. The Government's response is that this should happen on a continuing basis by negotiation. In a certain sense that is true, of course, but in another it is far too casual. Priorities do change, but with an authority such as the NCA this needs to be done, and is being done, after careful consideration is given to the tasks that the Authority should undertake following consultation with other law enforcement agencies in the field and, indeed, after consultation with the IGC and the Joint Committee . </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Priorities have changed in the last year while Mr Justice Phillips has been Chairman of the Authority, and they are likely to be adjusted again slightly with the appointment of a new chairman. Essentially, we can expect that the priorities to come to grips with white collar organised crime will remain, and we even have now a corporate plan in place. So it is possible not only to determine ahead what the priorities of the NCA are but also what the resources should be that will best serve the achievement of those objectives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To the extent that I agree that it will happen by negotiation, it will be necessary to monitor performance and whether it is adhering to the priorities that have been established or whether success has indeed followed the attempts by the Authority to follow these priorities. It is the type of monitoring that the Joint Committee has undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It might be worth noting, even at this early stage of my comments, that somewhat later in the report the Government seems to lay stress on the activities of the intergovernmental committee and to hold out that the intergovernmental committee is the body that has the prime objective and the prime task of carrying out the monitoring process. The argument is put that it is so because the intergovernmental committee is involved through the State police Ministers and the State police forces in the day to day work of the National Crime Authority. This is indeed so and, by and large, the cooperation between the State police forces and the NCA has been constructive and useful. But monitoring is a different process, and monitoring is best carried out by an agency or committee that is somewhat removed from the day to day activities of the body it is intended to monitor. Looking at the reports presented to us by both the IGC and the NCA, we find that there has been precious little monitoring activity by the IGC. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That may well be the case. Certainly, we have had evidence that there has been little overt consultation and very little monitoring of the NCA by the IGC. Perhaps I will return to that point a little later.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Joint Committee's second recommendation was that there should be a continuing review to avoid duplication between agencies which have the task of collecting crime intelligence: the NCA, the AFP and the Bureau of Criminal Intelligence. It was acknowledged in the report that all three agencies have distinctly different tasks. In particular, the Bureau of Criminal Intelligence was, after exhaustive examination, found to provide useful information. Therefore, I find it a little odd to see it listed as one of the agencies that the coalition parties would abolish if they ever came to government. Once again, we have a requirement to monitor the activities of the NCA and the other agencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee's third recommendation called for an inspector-general to be appointed to deal with individual complaints of people who have appeared before the NCA or who have been involved in one way or another in its investigations. That obviously arises out of the recognition that, while the Joint Committee is capable of discharging, and in fact has discharged, its duty to monitor the activities of the NCA, it goes beyond its resources and, indeed, its expertise to follow through individual complaints which require detailed investigation and could, on occasion, also require hearings. I therefore welcome the Government's acceptance of that recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recommendation No. 4 called for privacy guidelines to be put in place. Once again, I am pleased that the Government has seen fit to accept that recommendation. Even though the Government protests that the task is somewhat complex, we are told that it will be pursued in consultation with the Privacy Commissioner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the nub of the report, and the matter that has provided the greatest difficulty for the Committee and the NCA and now, apparently, also the Government; that is, the matter of secrecy provisions. At the moment, although the parliamentary Joint Committee is charged with a duty `to monitor and review the performance by the Authority of its functions', it is not in a position to obtain adequate information from the NCA. That was certainly well and truly documented during the inquiry and by many witnesses. The difficulty is, of course, that some of the information that the Committee would require to discharge its duties properly could affect people's reputations and, indeed, their involvement in legal proceedings; and it could disclose information that would help criminal elements. There is, therefore, a case for dealing very carefully with such information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee's first option to deal with that was to have access to such information but to impose upon itself a strict prohibition on disclosure. It is not so much the Government that rejects this, but, rather, the Minister says that `the inter-governmental committee does not accept this solution'. I find that a little strange, particularly, as I have said before, as it is this IGC which so far has done very little monitoring that we have seen evidence of. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the second option that the Committee put forward was to have access to all information except sensitive material. The Government has fastened on to this suggestion and has changed it somewhat, but is now suggesting that we should define `operational information'; that such operational information should be excluded from the provision of information to the Joint Committee; but that the NCA should be obliged to provide all non-operational information to the Committee. The National Crime Authority will determine in the first instance which definition the particular item of information falls under, and the definitions will be put into legislation on the basis of amendments that the Government will be preparing. I certainly welcome that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find that the inspector-general will review, if the Committee is in disagreement with a decision of the NCA, and that, finally, the Minister has the final say, leaving the decision in the political arena which I am not particularly pleased about. I would have thought that the work of the National Crime Authority and the monitoring being done by the parliamentary Committee should not be placed in any way in the political arena when we are talking about access to information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The nub of the issue really is what the definition actually will be that distinguishes operational from non-operational information. It may well be that it is a definition we can work with and still discharge our duties to monitor the very important work of the NCA, but it may well be that it will be used to exclude useful information from the consideration of the Committee. In that case, it would be an extremely disappointing result to an inquiry that has been carried out thoroughly, an inquiry that has also found that the NCA is carrying out useful work in the area of law enforcement and that it should certainly continue its work. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me tell honourable senators how concentrated it was. In the first three annual reports on the National Crime Authority, in which the IGC is entitled to make a public comment, its comments were restricted to but one page. That is what I call tight writing. That was for the first three reports. Thenceforth, there has been a deafening silence. It has not even written a response&mdash;private or public&mdash;to the annual report of the National Crime Authority. The Victorian Council for Civil Liberties, for instance, notes:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think the National Crime Authority needs to be seen to be accountable, and not just accountable to the IGC.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a very penetrating observation. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In my view, the IGC is a body that has a greater vested interest in the National Crime Authority. I do not mean that disrespectfully. You are talking about relevant Ministers and so forth, some of whose staff are employed with the Authority from time to time. To me, this Committee stands much further away from any taint of vested interest in the Authority.</PARA>
<PARA>And so we do. But that contrasts rather quaintly with the IGC's view of itself and its role with respect to the NCA. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The IGC is firmly of the view that the IGC itself provides a better line of responsibility to ensure both the protection of civil liberties and the effective oversight of the operational and functional activities of the NCA.</PARA>
<PARA>Yet, as I say, the IGC wrote three pages on reports spanning a period of eight years and held 16 meetings over a period of seven years. Let us remember that the IGC is a creature of political expediency. I think it was Senator Gareth Evans when he was the Attorney-General&mdash;in one of his more distinguished careers&mdash;who noted that the only way the NCA was likely to get off the ground, so to speak, was to have the curious cooperation of the various States. I have to say that there is no stronger believer in State responsibilities than me. The difficulty I have with these collective responsibilities is finding Ministers who have themselves actually taken collective responsibilities for the functions which they demand as their absolute right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have always been moved by the fact that after 90 years of Federation we still cannot find a common starting date for school children. Yet we have all these State education Ministers demanding exclusive rights to spend money and exclusive rights to responsibility, but just no exclusive rights in terms of raising the money. I regret that we find a similar circumstance here in a different sphere. I was interested to note, both privately and publicly, the views of Mr Edwards, the Western Australian Labor State Minister for Police, who has been a vigorous, vocal and trenchant critic of the Western Australian Royal Commission, which happens to be exposing the corruption of his mates and the corruption of an activity over which he had judicial responsibility, or a jurisdictional responsibility at least, for a number of years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we look around the States we ask ourselves how effective the State police have been and how effective the police Ministers who make up this body have been in supervising, monitoring and publicly reporting on the effectiveness of their own police forces. We can go through almost every single State and see that over the last decade there has been a crisis of some sort or another with major consequences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without being parochial for more than but a moment, in a recent case in Western Australia the police knew of a bribe in respect of a local government. They had all the facts; they had the tapes; they had the evidence. But after two years they had not completed their inquiries, let alone launched a prosecution. That, of course, has been subject to some public criticism by counsel representing the Royal Commission in WA. That bribe and the circumstances surrounding visited some of Mr Edwards's mates. I do not for a moment suggest that he was, in any way, deliberately or accidentally inhibiting or interfering in that investigation. I simply say that that sort of activity was going on at a time when there should have been proper supervision and accountability on the part of that State police force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we look at the IGC and at the examples given in respect of its activities with regard to the NCA, we see that it has been equally delinquent. For instance, no management review has been initiated by the IGC since the NCA started. Nobody would know better than Senator Tate about the political and managerial imbroglio into which the NCA has been plunged on more than one occasion in the last few years. In fact, I know of no public comment by the IGC which in any way would maintain public confidence in the National Crime Authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When, on occasion, the problems of the NCA have been made public, such as the problems with the chairmanship and the problems in South Australia, to my knowledge, there has been no activity or endeavour at all on the part of the IGC to sort those problems out. It has been silent in its response, and its silence has reflected its activities. This is a body that had the absolute impertinence to suggest, in its submission to the inquiry of the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority, that the Joint Committee was most inappropriate and ought to be abolished; and I suspect it thought the Committee was totally irrelevant. Given its own performance, it had the audacity to suggest that this Parliament ought to abolish its watchdog on the National Crime Authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To my knowledge the National Crime Authority has not received&mdash;and I am sure Senator Tate will disagree with me if I am wrong&mdash;one single reference from the IGC. There have been no management assessments. In fact, there has been no contribution by the IGC towards the functioning, the management, the references, the conduct, the efficiency or the appointments of the National Crime Authority. As I say, there has been a deafening silence. I must say that, as I looked around at some of those Ministers making their contributions on the day I met them, I thought it is better that they stay silent because that way nobody will ever know the contribution they have to make. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will touch very briefly on the second matter which is this question of accountability to the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority. The IGC believes, for some peculiar reason, that it is made up of all very trustworthy Ministers who are entitled to be and capable of being the repositories of secret and sensitive information, including information on operational matters, but that this Parliament's Committee is not. If one looks at the way the police departments around Australia are running at the present time&mdash;how they are functioning and how they leak like sieves&mdash;it hardly gives one any confidence that they can have access to information with great safety. I seem to recall two people being murdered as a result of information being leaked out of a police department in respect of a national investigation. However, the parliamentary Committee proposes that its members be provided with more substantial information, not of an operational nature, so as to allow them to more effectively monitor the conduct and performance of the NCA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some little time ago now, members of the NCA appeared before the Committee. I had the impertinence or the audacity to ask them why the last chairman had resigned and whether the circumstances that caused him to resign were the subject of any internal inquiries or inquiries by other police forces. I knew that in some way the Victorian Police Department had been involved. I was told by the witnesses from the National Crime Authority that they could not tell me whether they had inquired into that or whether there had been any investigation or discussion or consideration by the National Crime Authority of the circumstances of the resignation of the chairman because, if they told me that, that may be telling me whether there was an operational matter afoot, and to tell me that would be a breach of the provisions of the Act. What a nonsense. If one cannot get that trivial, incidental information, what prospect does the Joint Committee have of being able to, with any intelligence, supervise the conduct of the National Crime Authority?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With that sort of activity and conduct in mind, I have introduced into this chamber a private member's Bill of, more than anything, a declaratory nature. Senator Spindler has gone further in his private member's Bill, but neither of those Bills, to my knowledge&mdash;in the case of my Bill it has come through the shadow Cabinet and the party room&mdash;has received any form of blessing from the Government. As Senator Spindler indirectly observed, the nature of this report is not what the Government thinks but on almost every occasion what the intergovernmental committee's view is of our report. We know what its view is: it sought for us to be abolished. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are left with this rather limp proposal that the Government will look at the matter and see whether it can find a set of words that will provide a definition of `non-operational information'. After all this endeavour, the Government is still not competent to make judgments about the level of access that ought to be obtained by the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view, this is a disappointing report&mdash;a report that does little more than reflect the cynical attitude of the intergovernmental committee. In no way does a paper of eight and a half foolscap pages begin to address this very fine document of 275-odd pages. More than anything else, perhaps it reflects the general malaise and incompetence of this Government, but certainly it reflects the predictable direction of this Government. </PARA>

This earlier report recommended that the evaluation of the Authority be undertaken seven years after the date of the commencement of the National Crime Authority Act 1984. As a result of that evaluation, the Government believes the Authority has lived up to the hope placed in it by the nine governments in Australia represented on the intergovernmental committee at ministerial level.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of recommendations were brought down by the Committee and those recommendations have been responded to by the Government. It is not my intention to cover all the recommendations, but there are a number I wish to comment on. Before doing so, let me say something about the National Crime Authority and its effectiveness. I suppose it is hard to measure the activities of the National Crime Authority other than by way of arrests and convictions. However, if one looks at the financial side of the action taken by the National Crime Authority and the matters it has brought to light, it is very clear that the Authority has been acting in a way that will target the people at the top of the tree. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First, let us look at the cost-sharing contributions to the National Crime Authority. Those jurisdictions that have granted references have contributed substantially to the Authority's operating costs, directly under the cost-sharing arrangements to the tune of more than $22m to 30 June last, and indirectly through the provision of police officers, most of whose salaries continue to be met by their parent forces. The success of the National Crime Authority continues from that point, with the proceeds of crime frozen or secured up to 30 June 1991 as a result of the Authority's investigation amounting to $38m. The Taxation Office has issued assessments amounting to more than $47m as a result of the Authority's investigation. In addition, the Authority has notified the Taxation Office of a further $22m in understated or undeclared income and has assisted in the issue of other assessments amounting to more than $14m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These figures demonstrate that the Authority is targeting people at the top of the tree and is doing so with a great deal of success. Those amounts&mdash;the proceeds frozen, the tax not paid, the undeclared and other taxes&mdash;total $121m. These figures show fairly clearly that the National Crime Authority is performing a massive task in its fight against organised crime in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I shall deal very quickly with some of the recommendations. The second recommendation from the Committee is that there be continuing review of the potential for duplication of intelligence functions between the Authority, the AFP and the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence. The intergovernmental committee accepts this recommendation. It will ask the three agencies to keep the matter under review and will obtain a report from them annually on the situation. This is a step in the right direction. It did appear from the findings of the Joint Committee that there had been some duplication of intelligence. A report and continuing discussion between those three bodies might go some small way towards interrupting the duplication of intelligence being gathered by the various authorities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third recommendation is that the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security be given jurisdiction to investigate complaints against the Authority, its staff and those seconded to work for it. A complaints procedure was recommended by the intergovernmental committee to the Joint Committee, so the intergovernmental committee has no difficulty in accepting this recommendation. I point out to the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) that it seems that the intergovernmental committee is having a great deal of say in the matter. Perhaps the Government should be a little more forceful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is pleasing to know that the Government will bring forward legislation to create the position of Inspector-General of the National Crime Authority. It is intended that complaints by members of the public could be made directly to the Inspector-General or be referred by the Parliamentary Joint Committee or a member of the Inter-Governmental Committee. This will allow people who feel as though their liberties or freedoms are in some way being infringed upon by the National Crime Authority to have some real way of making a complaint and having it redressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only disappointment I have is with recommendation 8, which is that the National Crime Authority Act should be amended to confer on members of the Authority a discretion to hold investigative hearings in public. I accept the evaluation by the Government that there is some danger in holding investigative hearings in public. I know that, by conducting public hearings, some opportunity exists for the reputations of people and their rights and civil liberties to be affected. However, some of the criticism over time of the National Crime Authority has been that it is too secretive. If we are to have any investigating authority, it is my feeling that that authority should be able to hold public hearings so that it can give the public some chance of making a decision as to whether an investigation is being carried out properly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I accept the reason that it does affect people's civil liberties and may affect some people's reputations. Of course, it could go on to affect some evidence that might come down in a court case at a later date. Weighing against that is the fact that the National Crime Authority does have a responsibility to the public. Having regard to that responsibility, I believe that in future some of the investigative hearings should be held in public so that we overcome the accusation that the National Crime Authority is too secretive in the way that it carries out its work. Some other members of the Committee may wish to speak later. Therefore, I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only a couple of weeks ago, a little girl of five who had been left with her young brother was snatched from a shop in a shopping centre in Victoria, taken into a stairwell and raped. Her young brother has most probably been injured for life in the sense of his guilt and responsibility. Heaven knows what will happen to her and her family as a result of that incident. That is violence at one end of the scale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the other end of the scale, in March this year, in an area just near my office, a 63-year-old invalid pensioner was stripped, tied to his bed and slashed with a knife to his forehead, nose and fingers. He was stabbed in the buttocks with a syringe and repeatedly kicked and punched. While he slipped in and out of consciousness, he was repeatedly burned with an iron to his forehead, legs, back, elbow and the length of his arms&mdash;all for a $130 welfare cheque. That is the sort of violence that is being perpetrated in our community, much of it on older people in their own homes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Northcote in March, a 67-year-old man was beaten to death in his store, while in February an 80-year-old grandmother was repeatedly punched and kicked in her West Brunswick home. A 71-year-old man was bashed on New Years Eve and died later in hospital as a result of his injuries. A 68-year-old woman was bashed and raped in her Murrumbeena home in December. An 80-year old man had terrible injuries inflicted on him. On 22 October last year, a 60-year-old engineer was bashed in his Sunbury home. On 14 October 1991, an elderly couple were confronted by robbers in their Rowville home for the third time and bashed for the second time in less than 18 months. </PARA>

We have record unemployment and youth unemployment at an appalling level, the worst recession in 60 years, increasing family breakdown and decreasing living standards. All those ingredients, leavened with a watering down of standards&mdash;we have seen the media, business people and politicians grasping for the hot issues and the hot, sexy stories&mdash;have produced a recipe for violence. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to speak on the report of the National Violence Monitoring Unit. Because I have only five minutes to speak about a 217 page document, I have to limit myself to one recommendation, recommendation 95 on page 175. The recommendation states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Broadcasting Tribunal should consider requiring more detailed classification program description to enable television viewers to exercise informed choice of programs, and to enable those responsible for children to exercise responsibility for children's viewing practices.</PARA>
<PARA>Parents want more than that. There has been a significant increase in complaints to television stations and to the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal about the level of violence and offensive sexual material being broadcast by TV stations. Australian parents do not want to be lectured by this unit that the ABT should have more detailed descriptions. They want tighter guidelines. They do not want the situation that we have now where television broadcasting is virtually self-regulatory. There is definitely an increase in the level of violence and offending sexual material on TV and that is likely to continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Professor Brent Waters, who is consulted by the Film Censorship Board, appeared on 2 April before the Senate Select Committee on Community Standards Relevant to the Supply of Services Utilising Telecommunications Technologies. I refer in particular to the evidence that appears on pages 1197 and 1198 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard </EMPHASIS> report. I asked him:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So, you would suggest that the interim standards of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal should conform to those of the OFLC?</PARA>
<PARA>That is the Film Censorship Board. Professor Waters said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yes.</PARA>
<PARA>I asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Do you realise that that would mean there would be a broader range of very violent material going on to television?</PARA>
<PARA>Professor Waters said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yes.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say that we should be concerned about time, that this material should be shown late at night, et cetera. The need to educate parents came through again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today the Film Censorship Board told us that although Professor Waters is consulted by the Board from time to time, he does not speak for the board. We were also told that the exercise currently being engaged in by the ABT and the OFLC, the Film Censorship Board, would not result in more levels of violence. But when the Board was asked whether it could describe to the Committee definitively whether or not the level of violent material actually going over broadcast television was appropriate at this time, it could not. Then it said, `Oh, but it is our intention not to see more violence going on TV'. Let us look at its intention in 1988 when it changed the guidelines on violence. It said to the Committee that it was its intention to see that there was less violence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the guidelines from 1987 and 1988, as presented to us by Mrs Beryl Van Luyn from the National Viewers and Listeners Association, we will see the difference between the `M' category in violence in 1987 and the `M' category in 1988. In 1987 violence which was gratuitous, exploitative, relished, cruel or unduly explicit was not permitted in the `M' classification. In 1988, in the `M' category, `realistic violence of medium intensity may be depicted but violent depictions with a high degree of realism or impact are acceptable only if contextually justified'. The `contextually justified' loophole enabled the review board to override the `R' classification and make the rape film, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Accused</EMPHASIS>, an `M' classification, legally available to children. That is a disgrace. That is precisely what has happened.

<PARA>On a number of occasions I have raised the question of treaties being dumped into this Parliament. Twenty-nine treaties have been dumped onto the table. The list is made up of treaties signed for Australia but requiring further action before entering into force for Australia, treaties signed for Australia which have entered into force, and treaties acceded to or accepted by Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that the parliamentary process does not enable a proper input into consideration of international treaties. Clearly, some of these treaties are fairly routine but there are a lot of treaties which are signed and which have great implications for national and State laws. The very fact that the Federal Government can utilise treaties&mdash;that is, utilise the external affairs power&mdash;in order to bring into this Parliament legislation which will override the powers of the States is an example. It is a very real example as to why this Parliament&mdash;particularly the Senate, which is supposed to be the guardian of the rights of the States&mdash;should have more say in treaties and provide more direction, as it were, to the Government with respect to those major treaties which very often have broad-ranging ramifications for the people of Australia and State governments and State parliaments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not suggest that the Parliament should waste too much time on a treaty such as the Air Services Agreement with Brunei Darussalam, which was done at Canberra on 30 April 1992 and entered into force on 30 April 1992. I believe that this Parliament, this Senate, should establish a Senate standing committee, as I have proposed, to examine proposed treaties so that the Parliament can have more input and more say. Possibly we would have had fewer problems with the Bill of Rights, fewer problems relating to the CEDAW convention and a whole range of other conventions, had the Parliament been consulted, had there been a procedure, a structure, which would have enabled the Parliament to at least have a good look at these treaties instead of what occurs now. What occurs now is that all of these treaties come in, they are dumped onto the table and we have only five minutes to deal with the lot. It is impossible.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Privacy Commissioner must, by notice in writing, issue guidelines for the conduct of the Medicare and pharmaceutical benefits program.</PARA>
<PARA>This has been an area of concern to me for a considerable amount of time. When the pharmaceutical benefits scheme went into the health insurance scheme with Medicare, it occurred to me, like Archimedes when he was sitting in the bath tub, that suddenly all the data on Australians who had a Medicare claim or who had received a pharmaceutical benefit would be stored in one department. It was of concern to me. </PARA>

I was part of the consultation which was undertaken with respect to these guidelines. I have taken a specific and careful interest in them.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the dinner break I was speaking on a report issued by the Privacy Commissioner under section 135AA of the National Health Act. I presumed that the document that was tabled would be the guidelines because that was what we were waiting for. I am informed that the Privacy Commissioner is not actually issuing privacy guidelines for the conduct of the Medicare and pharmaceutical benefits programs in this report. As he is required to do under section 135AA(3) of the Act, the Privacy Commissioner is in this report informing the Parliament that he has been unable to issue these guidelines prior to the due date of 1 April 1992.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason for this failure is in no way the responsibility or the fault of the Privacy Commissioner. The fact is that the Attorney-General's Department believes there is a need to amend the overriding legislation to ensure that the Privacy Commissioner's guidelines do not have any unintended consequences in terms of the de-identification of health-related data. The Government has foreshadowed that these amendments will be included in legislation to be debated during the Budget session, and the Privacy Commissioner has indicated that if this legislation is passed the guidelines will then be issued as a disallowable instrument, which is required by the Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said before the dinner break, there is a need for fully fledged public debate on what should be done with the personalised medical-related information which the vast majority of Australians provide to the Health Insurance Commission. Many important issues must be considered. For example, for how long should the Health Insurance Commission, or the bureaucrats, be able to hold this information in an identifiable form? Should it be de-identified permanently? Should people have access to health information about themselves? Under what circumstances should the Health Insurance Commission or the Department be able to re-identify historical medical data?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Health Insurance Commission might argue that some of the amendments I put when this legislation was going through have caused some of these problems. I make no apology whatsoever for that. The Government had the chance to look at those amendments. Yes, there are some unintended consequences of those amendments. For example, can an individual have his or her information retrieved?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The debate we have to have is on two levels, as I said before dinner. Do we depersonalise all the information and have it, for example, identifiable by postcode, so that we could identify 12-year-old boys living in a particular area near high tension wires and decide whether they were more likely in adulthood or in late adolescence to develop testicular cancer? Would those boys then be able to be identified by their school records or some other means?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about information relating to a drug taken by women in the early 1950s to maintain pregnancy which has now been found to cause cancer in the young adult offspring of those women? The public has to have a decision. Do we need this data so that we can identify the people who have taken these drugs and perhaps approach them and say, `We believe that you took this drug. Your children need to be checked because they are at risk.'? That is one side of the coin, and that is the argument for keeping this data in some way that can be repersonalised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other argument is whether it is appropriate for a government of any persuasion at any time to have a record of every single individual. In Estimates committees I have been told that we could identify all families with fibrocystic disease, families with phenyl ketonuria, families with thalassaemia&mdash;any family that has a genetic disorder&mdash;and that that disorder could be identified by the type of treatment. For example, a family with two or three children with fibrocystic disease could be identified by the fact that a child may have had a bowel blockage at birth, that a child may have needed treatment from a thoracic surgeon or required certain drugs. That story could be put together from the pharmaceutical data and from the Medicare data and a picture could be made of a family. That is not brave new world stuff. The Health Insurance Commission has admitted that we could identify some genetic disorders on the basis of the data the Commission now holds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The community has to decide whether we keep that data in a form that is depersonalised but retrievable and can be identified&mdash;and these are the discussions we were having with the Privacy Commissioner. That data could be retrieved with senior approval&mdash;maybe the approval of the Minister or a committee&mdash;for the public interest and in the public good. The problem we struck was the concern about whether it is in the individual's good. What happens if we find that a particular individual has had a drug and, 20 years later, is now sensitised to some other substance? Can that person get that data back? The way the legislation is written at the moment, there is some doubt as to whether any of us as individuals or any member of the public could get that data back. Should we be able to get that information back in the public interest? Should we be able to identify people who have had a particular treatment, or is the public interest better served by it only being able to be retrieved in terms of non-personal information, that is, postcode or whatever?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My predilection as a Liberal is that people ought to be responsible for their own records. They should carry not a smartcard&mdash;far from it&mdash;but a simple piece of paper, something we used to rely on once upon a time, before technology became so highfalutin, a card that indicated the drugs they had had. In my ideal world, that is what I would want. People would then be able to say, `I have this card; I have carried it around'. It would not be a case of having a nanny state where we would be saying, `It is important because we might find in 20 years time that there is a drug that is going to affect someone'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the debate the public ought to be having; it has not been having it. I notice that the person from AAP is listening to what I am saying. I hope this is reported because this is the debate we should be having. We should decide as a community whether we are prepared to keep that data in a form that is depersonalised and, with a certain authority, can be restructured or repersonalised, or whether we should expunge that data and keep it in a form in which it cannot be identified after, say, a period of five years. That is the debate we should have and have not had yet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the Privacy Commissioner has not issued these guidelines because there are some problems, but he has called for and received submissions from interested parties, after issuing draft guidelines earlier this year. The debate has been confined mainly to epidemiologists, other medical researchers, the privacy lobby and interested parties. It is a debate that has been kept largely from the public arena. This unexpected extension of time before these Medicare and pharmaceutical benefits privacy guidelines are issued provides us as legislators with an excellent opportunity to generate public debate about an important issue that affects virtually all, if not all, Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a debate I think we ought to have. When we have had it I will be happy, but until we have had it I will not be happy. I believe it is something the public ought to know about. They ought to debate this matter and make a decision once and for all on how they want their Medicare and pharmaceutical data stored and whether they want it to be able to be retrieved in terms of being able to identify their names in 20, 30, 40 or 50 years time. We ought to address the sort of government we may have. Despite the fact that I do not like my colleagues on the other side, I believe they would deal with that data in a proper form. I am not so sure about governments in 30, 40 or 50 years time with data which would extend much more than technology can offer us now. It is a debate we ought to have. I hope somebody is listening and that we will have a proper debate on the issue. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">TELECOMMUNICATIONS (PUBLIC MOBILE LICENCE CHARGE) BILL 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill imposes a charge on the grant of certain public mobile licences under the Telecommunications Act 1991. This Bill should be read with the proposed amendments to the Telecommunications Act included in the Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1992 which, together with this Bill, will enable a fee to be charged for the grant of the third public mobile licence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments to the Telecommunications Act will insert a new section 57A which will enable the Minister to determine an allocation system for the purpose of granting public mobile licences to eligible corporations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill will impose a charge on the grant of a public mobile licence in accordance with the allocation system. A charge will not be imposed where an eligible corporation is seeking to renew its licence or in circumstances where a licence is being transferred from one eligible corporation to another.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has announced that the allocation system  for the granting of the third public mobile licence will be based on criteria including the bid price, industry experience and financial strength, industry development commitments and Australian equity participation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments to the Telecommunications Act referred to previously will also insert new provisions in that Act which will enable the charge imposed by this Bill to be collected and recovered.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Financial Impact</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The charge imposed on the grant of the third public mobile licence by this Bill is expected to result in a significant contribution to Commonwealth revenue. It is not possible, however, to estimate the extent of the likely contribution given that the amount obtained will depend on the result of the process for granting the licence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I present the Explanatory Memorandum to this Bill and commend the Bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No.2) 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill is an Omnibus Bill amending 10 Acts administered within the Transport and Communications portfolio. While the proposed amendments do not, in general, involve significant policy changes, they are important for the general administration of the Transport and Communications portfolio. Details of the amendments are as follows.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Air Navigation Act 1920</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill amends the Air Navigation Act 1920 to enable ratification of two new Protocols to the Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation. These Protocols increase the membership size of both the Council of the International Civil Aviation Organisation and its Navigation Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australian Maritime Safety Authority 1990</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill amends the Australian Maritime Safety Authority Act 1990 to extend the Authority's functions to allow it to provide services to the Commonwealth, a State, the Australian Capital Territory or the Northern Territory. Those services are to be services of a maritime nature and are to be provided on a commercial basis. This means that the Authority will be able to recover the costs of providing any such services. The new provision will complement the existing function of the Authority which allows it to provide services to the maritime industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australian Postal Corporation Act 1989</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Postal Corporation Act 1989 is amended to extend the Act to the Indian Ocean Territories&mdash;Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands&mdash;as a consequence of the Government's decision to eliminate all differences between the law of the Indian Ocean Territories and that of mainland Australia. The Australian Postal Corporation Act 1989 has also been amended to provide that Australia Post is to supply its standard letter service, a community service obligation under section 27 of the Act, to the Islands at the single uniform rate of postage for carriage which applies within Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Civil Aviation Act 1988</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amendments to the Civil Aviation Act 1988 will provide that the Authority is not entitled to reimbursement by the Commonwealth where it suffers financial detriment as a result of complying with a ministerial direction concerning the performance of its environmental functions. Rather, as foreshadowed by the Government in response to the report by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aircraft Noise, it is intended that these costs be borne by the aviation industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under section 69 of the Civil Aviation Act the Authority is empowered to recover unpaid charges by imposing liens over aircraft. The Bill amends section 75 to make it clear that the Authority's statutory liens are to have priority over any other financial security interests, including pre existing mortgagees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments insert new transitional tax provisions into the Principal Act which deal with the valuation of trading stock, accelerated depreciation of assets and capital gains tax. These provisions are consequential upon the Authority becoming liable to pay income tax from 1 July 1991 and are similar to transitional tax provisions applied to Telecom and Australia Post. These amendments have been drafted in accordance with policy advice from the Treasury and will ensure that the Civil Aviation Authority is accorded the same treatment as other Government Business Enterprises that are now required to pay income tax.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other amendments will be made to correct typographical errors and to clarify that it is an offence for an aircraft to commence a flight unless it has a maintenance release that is valid for the duration of the flight.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Federal Airports Corporation Act 1986</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill amends the Federal Airports Corporation Act 1986 to specify that the Corporation is not entitled to Commonwealth reimbursement for financial detriment that it suffers as a result of complying with a ministerial direction concerning the performance of its environmental functions. It is intended that the aviation industry bear these costs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments also clarify the FAC's financial transactions powers. As a result of a decision by the House of Lords in 1990 there is a risk that an Australian court could find that the FAC does not have the power to enter into financial management risk transactions, such as interest rate swaps, fixed rate agreements and options and futures contracts. The amendments expressly provide that the FAC can enter into such transactions and are similar to provisions that were inserted into the Civil Aviation Act 1988 and the Australian National Railways Commission Act</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1983 by the Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Act 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">New transitional tax provisions dealing with accelerated depreciation of assets, capital gains tax and superannuation will also be inserted into the Principal Act. These provisions are consequential upon the FAC becoming liable to pay income tax from 1 July 1991 and are similar to transitional tax provisions applied to Telecom and Australia Post. These amendments have been drafted in accordance with policy advice from the Treasury and will ensure that the FAC is accorded the same treatment as other Government Business Enterprises that are now required to pay income tax.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Protection of the Sea (Powers of Intervention) Act 1981 and Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Act 1983</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill contains a number of amendments to Australia's Protection of the Sea package of legislation. This legislation implements several International Conventions which deal specifically with the prevention of pollution from ships. The amendments in the Bill are a consequence of amendments to these Conventions adopted recently by the relevant international organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Protection of the Sea (Powers of Intervention) Act empowers Australia to intervene on the high seas in respect of any shipping incident resulting in or likely to result in major pollution damage. The amendments to this Act will enable intervention in respect of a wider range of environmentally hazardous chemicals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Act implements the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, known as MARPOL. This is the principal convention in controlling pollution from ships, currently applying to over 90 per cent of world shipping tonnage. The Bill proposes two major amendments to this Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first will give effect to Australia's obligations under Annex IV of the Protocol on Environment Protection to the Antarctic Treaty relating to the disposal of untreated sewage, oil, chemicals and garbage in the Antarctic Area. This Annex was drafted with a view to imposing MARPOL-like obligations on those countries not a party to the MARPOL Convention. Consequently, for Australia there are few additional measures to be implemented. It is therefore efficient and sensible to include the proposed amendments in the MARPOL legislation, rather than legislation administered by the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories which will implement the remainder of the Antarctic Protocol.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The other significant amendment is the introduction of a requirement for ships to have on board an oil pollution emergency plan, which is the result of a recent amendment to the MARPOL Convention. This is one of several changes to international pollution regulations as a result of the lessons learned from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Exxon Valdez</EMPHASIS> oil spill in 1989. The emergency plan will consist of four basic elements: an outline of procedures for reporting incidents; a list of authorities or persons to be contacted in the event of an incident; a detailed description of the steps to be taken immediately by persons on board to reduce or control discharge of oil following an incident; and a procedure for co-ordinating response efforts with national and local authorities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ships visiting Australian ports will be required to have an emergency plan available for inspection by Australian Maritime Safety Authority surveyors as part of the normal port control process, and sanctions are provided for failure to comply with these requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Navigation Act 1912 and Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Act l990</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amendments to the Navigation Act 1912 and to the Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Act 1990 will correct minor drafting errors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Telecommunications Act 1991</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A number of amendments are made to the Telecommunications Act 1991, the most important of which are to enable a fee to be charged for the grant of the third public mobile licence, allow a dominant carrier to discriminate between customers in certain circumstances, allow particular basic carriage services and particular circumstances in which such services are provided to be excluded from the requirement under section 194 for basic carriage services to be set out in a tariff and to protect the name and symbol of the Australian Telecommunications Authority (AUSTEL).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments will enable a fee to be charged for the grant of the third public mobile licence and an allocation process for the selection of the licensee to be determined by the Minister. These amendments are of a technical nature and do not affect the objects, underlying principles or general thrust of the Act. They provide a greater degree of commercial certainty about payment arrangements and the allocation process for mobile licences, at a time when parties are considering whether to make substantial investments in developing proposals for the selection of Australia's third public mobile licensee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A charge will be imposed on the grant of a new public mobile licence by clause 4 of the Telecommunications (Public Mobile Licence Charge) Bill 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A new Division 5A will be inserted in Part 5 of the Telecommunications Act to enable the collection and recovery of the public mobile licence charge.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 183 of the Telecommunications Act 1991 is amended to allow certain exceptions to the rule that prevents a dominant carrier from discriminating between customers. The purpose of the amendment is to allow the Australian and Overseas Telecommunications Corporation (AOTC) to proceed with its proposal to offer concessions to low income and other disadvantaged customers. AOTC has already publicly announced a package of proposals which it proposes to implement on 1 July 1992. The amendment will ensure that AOTC's proposal can proceed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 194 of the Telecommunications Act 1991 is amended to enable regulations to be made allowing for the supply of certain basic carriage services or the supply of such services in certain circumstances without the services being included in a tariff, as presently required under section 194. The amendment will enable international transit arrangements to be excluded from the tariffing requirement. The details of such arrangements are considered to be confidential between the carriers involved.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A new section, section 402A, is inserted into the Telecommunications Act 1991 to protect the name and symbol of AUSTEL. New section 402A provides for a penalty of $3,000 for anyone contravening the protection provision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Financial Impact</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There will be no significant effects on the Commonwealth expenditure or revenue resulting from most of the amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments to the Civil Aviation Act 1988 and the Federal Airports Corporation 1986 dealing with transitional tax provisions will clarify the taxation liability of those organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments to enable a fee to be charged for the grant of the third public mobile licence, together with the proposed Telecommunications (Public Mobile Licence Charge) Bill 1992, are expected to result in a significant contribution to Commonwealth revenue. It is not possible to estimate the extent of the likely contribution given that the amount obtained will depend on the result of the process for granting the licence.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ACT SUPREME COURT (TRANSFER) BILL 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill will enhance the protection of the independence of the Australian Capital Territory Supreme Court, which is to be transferred to the Australian Capital Territory on 1 July 1992. At present, the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 merely provides that from 1 July 1992 the ACT Legislative Assembly has legislative power in relation to the establishment and administration of courts. Without something more, none of the traditional safeguards of an independent judiciary are entrenched in Territory law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the Australian Capital Territory, the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act takes the place of a constitution. It is therefore appropriate that the Self-Government Act should contain provisions entrenching the position of an independent judiciary, in a similar manner as does Chapter III of the Constitution in relation to the federal judiciary.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 8 April 1992 the ACT Legislative Assembly formally requested that the Commonwealth Parliament amend the Australian Capital Territory (SelfGovernment) Act, so as to provide a new Part of the Act dealing with the Judiciary. Specifically, the following provisions were requested by the ACT Legislative Assembly&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">a provision for the existence of the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory, which is to have all the original and appellate jurisdiction that is necessary to administer justice in the Territory;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">provisions for the removal from office of a Judge, a Magistrate or another judicial officer, only after a request to the ACT Executive by the ACT Legislative Assembly made in accordance with a report of a judicial commission, which has found that the behaviour or capacity of a person could amount to misbehaviour warranting that person's removal from office;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">provisions for the determination of judicial remuneration, which guarantee the non-diminution of that remuneration; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">provisions to protect the position of the Judges who will continue as Judges of the Court after 1 July 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988, the ACT Legislative Assembly is excluded from making laws in relation to the establishment of courts, subject to provisions of the Act providing for the transfer of legislative power. The ACT Magistrates Court was transferred to the ACT Government on 1 July 1990, when the ACT was given legislative power in relation to the establishment of magistrates' courts and coroners' courts. The Supreme Court will, under the existing provisions of the Act, be transferred on 1 July 1992 when the ACT obtains legislative power in relation to all courts; completing the process of transfer of ACT Courts to the Australian Capital Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill largely implements the recommendations of a working party comprising representatives of the Commonwealth Attorney-General's Department, the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Tourism, the ACT Government Law Office and the ACT Supreme Court. The ACT Law Society and the ACT Bar Association were also consulted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill provides for the amendment of the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 and the Australian Capital Territory Self-Government (Consequential Provisions) Act 1988, both Commonwealth Acts, and the Australian Capital Territory Supreme Court Act 1933, a Commonwealth Act which will become a Territory enactment on 1 July 1992. There are also some minor, consequential amendments of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976, the Judges (Long Leave Payments) Act 1979 and the Judges' Pensions Act 1968.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments of the Self-Government Act include provisions for the:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">jurisdiction and powers of the Supreme Court;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">establishment of a judicial commission to investigate allegations or complaints about the conduct or physical or mental capacity of a judicial officer;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">removal of a judicial officer from office; and,</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">remuneration and allowances of judicial officers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments of the ACT Supreme Court Act include provisions:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">concerning the seniority of the Judges of the Court;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">for the exercise by the Supreme Court of jurisdiction under subsections 46(4) and 48(2) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1989 of the Territory;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">for approval for the holding of other judicial offices by Judges of the Supreme Court;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">in respect of the jurisdiction and powers of the Court;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">for an oath or affirmation of office to be taken by the Registrar of the Court; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">in respect of the appointment of officers to assist the Sheriff.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The principal provisions of this Bill are those that entrench in Commonwealth legislation the traditional protections of judicial independence. Because the provisions are to be in Commonwealth legislation, the ACT judiciary will not be subject to the possibility of an attack on the independence of the ACT judicial system from the ACT Executive or Legislature.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Appointment of judges in Australia is traditionally a matter for the Executive. While the ACT Supreme Court has been a Court created by the Commonwealth, Judges have been appointed by the Governor-General in Council. The Bill provides for all future Judges and other officers of the Supreme Court to be appointed by the ACT Executive.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments of the Self-Government Act provide for the removal of a Judge or other judicial officer or a member of a tribunal by the ACT Executive following a resolution of the ACT Legislative Assembly acting in accordance with a report of a Judicial Commission, in which the Commission has concluded that the behaviour or physical or mental capacity of the judicial officer or member of the tribunal concerned could amount to proved misbehaviour or incapacity such as to warrant removal from office. This standard for the operation of a judicial commission is the standard recommended by the Advisory Committee of the Constitutional Commission in its 1988 Report (paragraph 5.55).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A judicial officer may only be removed from office by the Executive in writing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Judicial Commission will be constituted by judges who have been, but are no longer, Justices of the High Court, or who are or have been Judges of a superior court of record of a State or Territory (other than sitting resident Judges of the ACT Supreme Court) and will be appointed by the ACT Government. The Commission may be a Standing Commission or established ad hoc.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The retiring ages of the present Judges and the Master are protected by the provisions of this Bill. After 1 July 1992, the ACT Legislative Assembly will have power to make a law that establishes a retiring age for Judges or the Master that is different from that which now applies. New section 48B provides that such a law is to have no effect in relation to a Judge or the Master who was appointed before the commencement of the Act, unless the Judge or the Master consents, in writing, to the different law applying to him or her. It will therefore be possible for the ACT Legislative Assembly to increase or decrease the retiring age of members of the ACT Judiciary, but the retiring age of the current members of the Supreme Court can only be changed with their consent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a further safeguard to judicial independence, the amended Self-Government Act and the amended ACT Supreme Court Act will provide that the remuneration and allowances of a judicial officer cannot be diminished while the officer holds office, and the amended Self-Government Act provides that the remuneration and allowances of the Chief Justice, the Judges, the Master, the Chief Magistrate and a Magistrate of the Australian Capital Territory are to be determined by the Commonwealth Remuneration Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current Chief Justice and Judges of the Court, except the additional Judges, will continue to hold office on terms no less favourable than those of Judges of the Federal Court of Australia. The additional Judges are, of course, all Judges of the Federal Court of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some provisions of the Bill have been included to ensure that there is no doubt as to the fact that the ACT Supreme Court will continue to operate as the same entity after 1 July 1992. The translation of the Supreme Court Act 1933 from an Act of the Commonwealth Parliament to an ACT enactment in no way creates a break in the existence of the ACT Supreme Court.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amendments of the Australian Capital Territory Self-Government (Consequential Provisions) Act 1988 will ensure the continuity of office of the Judges and the Master of the Court. New section 29A, of the Consequential Provisions Act provides that the Chief Justice, the other Judges (including the additional Judges) and the Master as at 1 July 1992, continue to hold their office after 1 July 1992 notwithstanding the fact that from 1 July 1992 the ACT Supreme Court Act is an ACT enactment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">New section 29B provides that all proceedings pending in the Supreme Court on or before 1 July 1992, and any judgment or order entered or made before 1 July 1992, are to be continued on and after that date as if they were proceedings instituted in the Court referred to in the ACT enactment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill is expected to have no impact on Commonwealth expenditure or revenue. The running costs of the Supreme Court were agreed with the ACT Government in 1988 and that amount will be included in the General Revenue Grant of the ACT from 1 July 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I table the explanatory memorandum for the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the Bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">MIGRATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill contains a number of important policy initiatives aimed at increasing the control which the Government may exercise over Australia's migration program. In particular the Bill contains significant measures to strengthen Australia's ability to cope with the increasing number of people claiming refugee status. Provisions have also been included to deter persons, primarily Indonesian nationals, from fishing illegally in Australian waters. The Bill also contains new powers to facilitate the successful operation of the Government's initiative to attract successful business migrants to Australia. Finally, the Bill will make a number of minor technical amendments to the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Refugee Initiatives</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Over the past three years the number of applications for refugee status from persons wishing to remain in Australia has grown dramatically from below 500 applications per year to a current caseload of 22,500.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many of these applicants have been able to continue to delay their departure from Australia by deferring the lodgement of an actual application for refugee status. This is a cynical abuse of the refugee determination process which will not be tolerated by the Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the present policy based arrangements there are uncertainties about our ability to require applicants to cooperate in pursuing their claims in an expeditious manner. The Government has therefore decided to introduce a regulatory framework to underpin Australia's asylum determination procedures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government announced on 12 February 1992 that new arrangements would be introduced to improve the efficiency of Australia's system for processing claims for refugee status. The amendments set out in this Bill will facilitate refugee processing within a regulatory framework that provides certainty and accountability. The Bill will provide the Minister of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs with a clear basis of power in the Act to make regulations for the orderly processing of refugee applications.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new measures developed to improve the refugee determination process will result in a more efficient and equitable system. Incorporating processing arrangements in regulations will produce a more predictable processing environment. All applicants have an equal opportunity to pursue their claims.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments in the Bill also relieve the Minister of the obligation to consider refugee applications by persons who hold the special four-year temporary entry permit granted to nationals of the People's Republic of China who were in Australia on 20 June 1989.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The rationale for this provision is that these people have already been given protection which satisfies Australia's international obligations. Removing the duty to consider their applications will ensure processing resources are more productively employed for persons who do not have effective protection.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments will also allow the Minister to determine processing priorities so that processing of new applications for refugee status is not impeded by the existence of a backlog of unprocessed applications. Applications will no longer be processed in chronological order of receipt. Rather, applications in the backlog will be processed in tandem with new applications. The Government wishes to eliminate any incentive for persons with no claim to refugee status to lodge ill-founded applications simply to achieve continued residence in Australia while awaiting processing of their application.   The amendment will also provide that applications in the backlog shall not be found to be subject to an unreasonable delay merely because other applications received more recently are being processed or have already been determined.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Illegal Fishermen</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For some time now, the Government has been concerned about the problem of the incursion of foreign fishing vessels into Australian waters. The vessels are largely Indonesian in origin. The problem is serious, with consequences for the fishing industry, our marine environment and quarantine arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Existing laws have not had the desired deterrent effect. There have been claims that the fishermen apprehended, in serving their gaol sentences, have a `paid holiday' at the Australian taxpayers' expense. The small gratuities granted by State Corrective Services to all prisoners for their work may represent a significant amount to an Indonesian fisherman.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The scheme outlined in this Bill is the result of discussion between the relevant State and Federal agencies. It is the first step in a much wider strategy and indicates our determination to deal with this problem effectively. The scheme will render any crew member of a fishing vessel apprehended liable for the cost of his custody and removal from Australia. The master, owner, agent or charterer of the relevant vessel will also be liable for that cost. The Secretary of the Department will be able to serve a Notice on State and Territory gaols, banks or other financial institutions that may hold funds in trust for these prisoners. The notice will require them to pay the funds to the Department up to the amount of a person's liability.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The scheme, together with the present capacity to confiscate fishing boats and to impose gaol sentences, increases the disincentives for these fishermen to fish illegally in Australian waters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Business Migration</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I turn now to the amendments which relate to business migrants who arrive in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill provides a legal framework to implement two aspects of the Government's new Business Skills migration category which was announced on 17 December 1991. The first is a system of mandatory participation by Business Skills migrants in the monitoring of their business activities after their arrival in Australia. The second is the creation of a power for the Minister to cancel permanent entry permits and entry visas of Business Skills migrants after their arrival in Australia if they do not enter into business activities which meet the objectives of the category or make a genuine effort to do so. These provisions will apply to such migrants within their first three years after arrival in Australia. The Minister cannot cancel entry permits or visas unless action is initiated within the three year period.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The provisions of the Bill relating to mandatory participation in monitoring, introduce a requirement for Business Skills migrants to provide business related information and notification of changes of address, after their arrival in Australia. There are financial penalties for non-compliance with these requirements which are considered and fair. Payment of fines will not release migrants from the requirement to furnish information.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am confident that the information gathered will serve to confirm the value of this form of migration. It should minimise much of the criticism of business migration which has been prevalent, but largely unfounded, in recent years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Also, aggregated data from the monitoring will be available to help those involved in planning services to assist migrants in business. The individual information on migrants will of course be protected by the provisions of the Privacy Act 1988.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second part of these changes deal with the power to cancel entry permits and visas. The Joint Committee of Public Accounts recommended that the new arrangements for business migration should not use a system of conditional visas. The Government accepted that recommendation. Nevertheless, it is appropriate for the Minister to have the power to deal with cases of serious abuse. This concept is incorporated in these provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Each business migrant acknowledges at the time of application that he or she understands the business objectives of the category and the expectation that they will make genuine efforts to comply with them. Additionally, each business migrant acknowledges that they and their family members' entry permits may be cancelled if they do not meet the objectives of the program or make genuine efforts to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill gives the Minister clear legislative indicators on which a decision is to be based if cancellation is being considered. The overwhelming majority of business migrants are not likely to be affected by the use of this power. Only those whose intentions are inconsistent with the objectives of the category need have any concern about its use. It is not anticipated that the power will be exercised on more than a few occasions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill includes provisions which mean that the power cannot be used against a business migrant unless the Minister has notified him or her of the intention to do so within three years of the migrant's arrival in Australia. This provision allows business migrants time to make sensible business decisions. It also allows sufficient time for an assessment to be made that the business is likely to be of ongoing benefit. It also recognises that, as permanent residents, business migrants should not be under the threat of cancellation indefinitely. There is a requirement for the Minister to consider any submission by or on behalf of the business migrant. The Bill provides for determinative review by the AAT.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These amendments relating to business migrants will help to ensure the successful operation of the Business Skills category of the migration program. The Bill will also maximise economic outcomes arising from it and provide the Government with a stronger information base from which to make decisions in future. This is achieved without placing unnecessarily onerous conditions on business skills migrants. Business migrants have proven skills of value to Australia. Their entry has the continuing support of government at all levels as well as of the business community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, I will deal with some of the other, more minor, amendments to the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 20(1)(d)(iii)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of the Migration Act is to enable the Commonwealth to exercise its power to control certain persons or categories of persons who may lawfully enter and stay in this country. It has always been the intention of this government, and previous governments before it, that this power should be exercised with the public interest in mind.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One means of ensuring that the public interest is observed is to define those categories of persons whom it is undesirable to have stay in Australia. Such categories include persons who make false or misleading statements or produce bogus documents, or those with highly dangerous and communicable diseases, and those persons with criminal records. Section 20 in the Migration Act defines these categories. That section requires persons falling within these categories to be recognised as illegal entrants unless the Secretary or his delegate excuses them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment proposed to this section is in response to a Federal Court decision which has limited the power of the Commonwealth to decide who may enter and stay in Australia with regard to persons with criminal records. The intention of the Government has always been that a person who has committed a series of unrelated crimes which have resulted in that person being sentenced, in total, to a period of twelve months or more imprisonment, should be categorised as a person to whom section 20 applies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Court decision, however, requires that this provision be interpreted very narrowly. It would apply only to a person in circumstances where there is a court order that several sentences of imprisonment are to be served consecutively so as to make up one continuous period of detention of at least one year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment proposed to Section 20 will make this long-standing policy of the Government clear in the legislation and overcome the narrow interpretation of the Court.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment will not operate retrospectively to apply to persons who have, pursuant to the decision of the Federal Court, been lawfully resident in Australia and whose circumstances meet those described in the amendment to section 20(1)(d)(iii). In respect of these persons who may be outside Australia at the time of commencement of the amendment, they will not be caught by the amendment. In effect, the amendment will not apply to such persons in respect of any convictions which may have occurred before the commencement of the amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amendments to Provisions Affecting Illegal Entrant Status</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will make a minor technical amendment to section 14 of the Act to remove unnecessary retrospectivity from the provision. If a person produces bogus documentation or makes misleading statements in respect of the grant of a further entry permit after entry to Australia they will become illegal entrants. That status is effective from the date of grant of that entry permit rather than from the date of entry to Australia as presently provided for in the Act. At present, a person to whom section 20 of the Act applies (eg a person with a criminal record) becomes an illegal entrant upon entering Australia unless a properly endorsed valid entry permit is granted. That requirement is inappropriate in some cases.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For example, when official guests of the Government visit Australia. Section 15 of the Act has been amended to allow the regulations to exempt persons or classes of persons from the consequences of section 20.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Review</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill makes some minor amendments to the provisions relating to statutory merits review. The most important of these will permit a review authority to remit a case to the primary decision-maker to be reconsidered in accordance with the review authority's directions. This amendment, which is supported by the Immigration Review Tribunal, should lead to speedier review decisions in many cases by eliminating unnecessary steps in the process where the review application is successful.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Migration Act has provisions under section 115 and section 137 which permit the Minister to set aside a decision of an internal review officer and the Immigration Review Tribunal respectively, and substitute a more favourable decision. The Minister is required to table a statement in Parliament in each such case. Different tabling requirements were imposed under the two provisions because they were enacted at different times. The Bill seeks to amend section 137 to make the tabling requirements in that section identical with those in section 115.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The other amendments remove a possible ambiguity relating to the time limits for making review applications. These amendments will ensure that visa applicants have adequate opportunity to seek review of unfavourable decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I present the Explanatory Memorandum to the Bill and I commend the Bill to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No.2) 1992</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill will amend the taxation laws in a number of respects.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It will implement several measures outlined by the Prime Minister in his "ONE  NATION" statement of 26 February 1992. In this regard the Bill will give effect to the new accelerated plant depreciation rates measures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It will also provide relief for small business by deferring the initial payment of company income tax in respect of the 1991-92 income year as announced by the Prime Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Additionally, this Bill will amend the capital gains tax provisions by increasing the exemption available for gains realised on the disposal of the goodwill of small businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The research and development provisions of the taxation law are also to be amended to provide for the exemption of eligible companies from the operation of the clawback provisions when grants or recoupments of relevant expenditure are made under the Co-operative Research Centres Program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill contains amendments to the provisions of the law that deal with the avoidance of Australian taxation through the use of offshore companies and trusts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, this Bill will also extend the circumstances in which deductions for contributions to superannuation funds are allowable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The gift provisions of the income tax law will also be amended.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill contains measures to exempt the pay and allowances of Australian Defence Force members serving with the U.N. in Cambodia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Medicare Levy relief for health card holders will be confined to blind pensioners and sickness allowance beneficiaries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, the Bill contains a number of minor technical and procedural amendments of the taxation laws.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I turn now to a more detailed discussion of these measures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Depreciation amendments</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will provide higher depreciation rates for plant and equipment with an effective life of five or more years. In some instances, this will represent a substantial reduction in the period over which items can  be written-off. For example, the cost of items with an effective life of 20 years will now be able to be written-off over 8 years&mdash;half the time it took under the former system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also simplifies the calculation of depreciation. Once effective life is determined, the rates of depreciation for most items of plant are set out without the need to amend the rate further to take account of broadbanding and loadings. For most taxpayers, the only calculation required will be to reduce the rates if the taxpayer has elected to use the prime cost method of depreciation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Deferral of the initial payment of company tax</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will provide the legislation necessary to give effect to the announcement, in the Prime Minister's "ONE NATION" statement, to provide relief for small business by deferring the initial payment of company income tax in respect of the 1991-92 income year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The companies affected are those with a tax liability of $1000 or more, but less than $400,000, and which pay their tax in two instalments. The date for the initial payment will be deferred by 9 weeks from the 28th day of the month following the balance date to the 28th day of the third month following the balance date.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments, which will defer revenue of $10 million, will ensure that franking deficit tax and franking credits and debits will be determined as if there had been no deferral of the initial tax payment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Capital gains tax</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Taxpayers disposing of a business, or an interest in a business, will be subject to the capital gains tax provisions on any gain or loss realised on the disposal if the asset was acquired after 19 September 1985. The goodwill of a business may be one such asset.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the existing provisions, 20% of any capital gain realised on the disposal of goodwill is exempt from tax, provided that the net business interests of the taxpayer have a value of less than $1 million.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In recognition of the unique circumstances facing the owners of small businesses, the Government has decided to increase the capital gains tax exemption for goodwill from 20% to 50% for disposals of goodwill that occur after 26 February 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, the new exemption level will apply to taxpayers whose net business interests are worth up to $2 million. The effect of inflation will be offset by the annual indexation of this exemption threshold in line with the consumer price index, commencing with the 1993-94 income year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government also proposes a number of technical amendments to the capital gains tax provisions which are intended, in some cases to clarify the operation and effect of the existing law and in other cases to alleviate the possible inequitable application of these provisions to taxpayers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The estimated cost to the revenue of the increased  goodwill exemption is $5 million in 1992-93 and $10 million in subsequent years. The additional amendments to the capital gains tax provisions are not expected to have any significant impact on the revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Research and development expenditure</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will prevent the application of the research and development clawback provisions to certain eligible companies where a grant or recoupment is made by the Commonwealth under the Co-operative Research Centres Program. The exclusion will also apply to a company that is a partner in a partnership designated as a Co-operative Research Centre.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, this exclusion from the clawback provisions will not extend to an eligible company that is a partner in a partnership that is not designated as a Co-operative Research Centre.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These amendments will cost the revenue an estimated amount of $2 million in 1991-92, $4 million in 1992-93 and 1993-94, and $5 million in 1994-95.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Foreign source income</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amendments in this area reflect the Government's willingness to act on proposals for the smoother implementation of the accruals tax measures introduced with general effect from the 1990-91 income year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In this vein, the Bill will correct certain anomalies which arise in relation to:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the tax exemption of branch profits of an Australian company when derived through a partnership or trust; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the incidence of double taxation that could arise in the case of certain transactions that are deemed to be dividends.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will also amend certain exemptions from tax that apply to off-shore life insurance businesses of resident companies to ensure that only the correct amount of relief is provided.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Also, in order to relieve taxpayers from an unintended liability to tax, the Bill will reduce the income of a controlled foreign company that is attributed to resident taxpayers by the amount of dividends paid to another company on certain transitional finance shares.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will provide a further benefit to taxpayers by extending the capital gains tax roll-over relief for asset disposals which is available when determining whether a controlled foreign company passes the active income test.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, I must also emphasise the Government's determination to ensure that these measures have their intended effect in countering tax avoidance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In this regard, some of the amendments will ensure that:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">an election for capital gains tax roll-over relief for an asset disposal when determining whether a controlled foreign company passes the active income test is binding when calculating the amount of a capital gain on a subsequent disposal of that asset; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">income from related party transactions with a controlled foreign company will only escape attribution to resident taxpayers where the company itself is conducting an active trade or business in its country of residence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Deductions for contributions to superannuation funds</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, this Bill will amend the income tax law to extend the circumstances in which deductions are allowable for contributions to superannuation funds to provide superannuation benefits to employees. In particular, the Bill will allow as deductions contributions to three superannuation funds if one of those funds has been established by a law of the Commonwealth, a State or Territory. Under the existing law, the deduction is limited to two funds only. This amendment will have effect from 1 July 1990.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will also amend the law to enable substantially self-employed people with minimal employer superannuation support to receive the same higher maximum level of tax deductions for personal superannuation contributions as self-employed people and employees without superannuation support. Under the existing law, they are limited to a maximum of $3000. The change proposed by this Bill will mean that the maximum deduction is the lesser of $3000 plus 75% of the contributions over $3000 and the amount required to fund their reasonable benefit level. The proposed amendment will apply to contributions made on or after 1 July 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These amendments are not expected to have a substantial impact on the revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Gifts</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The gift provisions of the income tax law are amended to reflect  a change in name of the World Wildlife Fund Australia to the World Wide Fund for Nature Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This change will have no impact on the revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Pay and allowances of Defence Force members serving in Cambodia</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This amendment will exempt from income tax the pay and allowances of members of the Australian Defence Force allotted for duty with the United Nations Advance Mission in Cambodia and the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Medicare Levy Relief</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Relief from liability for half the Medicare Levy, at present available to all health card holders, will be restricted to blind pensioners and sickness allowance beneficiaries. This will ensure that the law operates as the Government originally intended it to do.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Technical amendments</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, in addition to the amendments of a technical nature to which I have already referred, the Bill will make technical change to amend the expression "resident" or "resident of Australia" to include Commonwealth public servants who are members of the new Public Sector Superannuation Scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I present the Explanatory Memorandum which contains more detailed explanations of the provisions of the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the Bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT (SELF ASSESSMENT) BILL 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Background</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A major element of the Government's reform agenda since taking office has been the comprehensive reform of the Australian taxation system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When this Government took office in 1983, there was a widespread view that the Australian income tax system operated unfairly. In 1985 the Government introduced major business and personal tax reforms which addressed a large number of longstanding flaws in the tax system. The Government has continued to build on these reforms with the objective of making the tax system fairer and more efficient. The 1988 business tax reforms further encouraged economic efficiency. Since 1985, the Government has developed a comprehensive system for taxing foreign source income and there has also been reform in such areas as superannuation and depreciation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unquestionably, the tax system is now one of the fairest and most secure in the world, however reform does not end there. The Government is committed to ensuring that the Australian tax system continues to meet the community's expectation of fairness, certainty and efficiency at the highest possible level.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Improvements to Self Assessment</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the context of the study of options for simplifying the income tax system, announced on 15 February 1990, the Government decided on a major overhaul of the present self assessment system of taxation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia has had a self assessment system of taxation since 1986. This Bill will provide real benefits for taxpayers by making the system fairer and more certain.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill implements the Government's decision, announced in the Treasurer's statements of 13 December 1990 and with the 1991-92 Budget, to improve existing self assessment arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill proposes changes to the law to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">introduce a new system of binding Public Rulings applicable to income tax, withholding taxes, franking deficit tax, Medicare levy and fringe benefits tax;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">introduce a new system of binding Private Rulings for completed or proposed transactions or arrangements.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(g)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">introduce a new system of penalties for understatements of income tax liability. The penalties will be based on the requirement that taxpayers exercise reasonable care in carrying out their tax obligations.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(h)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">introduce a new interest system for underpayments or late payments of income tax, based on commercial principles and market interest rates;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">reduce late payment penalties to take into account the new interest system. This will allow for the separation of interest and penalties while providing an incentive for taxpayers to pay income tax on time;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(k)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">remove, in most cases, the requirement for taxpayers to lodge notices of elections or other notifications with the Commissioner.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consultation</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In determining the final form of the changes the Government, through the ATO, has consulted extensively with taxpayer and tax professional representative bodies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In responding to concerns expressed about current self  assessment arrangements by these representative bodies, the Government released the consultative document `A Full Self Assessment System of Taxation' as part of the Treasurer's Tax Simplification statement of 13 December 1990.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following careful consideration of the submissions and extensive consultation with interested parties, the Government summarised the broad features of the proposed measures in the August 1991 information paper `Improvements to Self Assessment&mdash;Priority Tasks'. The Government again showed its commitment to a consultative process by agreeing to continue consultation on the technical details.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill represents the outcome of that process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The measures contained in the Bill will apply from the later of the date of Royal Assent or 1 July 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I now turn to a more detailed discussion of the measures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Rulings and Review Rights</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Taxpayers who are genuinely uncertain about the tax effect of a completed or proposed arrangement will be able to seek a Private Ruling from the Commissioner. The Commissioner will be bound by the ruling to the extent that the tax that would be payable by the taxpayer will be reduced to reflect the tax that would be payable under the ruling.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commissioner will continue to issue Public Rulings. These will be binding in the same way as Private Rulings will be binding on the Commissioner.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commissioner will only be able to withdraw the benefit of a ruling on arrangements that have not yet been entered into, except where it would be grossly inequitable to allow a taxpayer to continue to benefit from an incorrect ruling.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A taxpayer will be able to have an unfavourable Private Ruling, even on a proposed arrangement, reviewed by the AAT or courts. When the review process is finalised, the decision of the AAT or court will be legally binding and conclusive as to the application of the ordinary provisions of the legislation to an actual arrangement not relevantly different from the proposal or arrangement to which the Private Ruling related.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Taxpayers will be able to object against a Private Ruling within the later of:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">60 days after receipt of the ruling; or</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">4 years from the due date for the lodgment of the relevant return.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new system of binding and reviewable rulings will promote certainty for taxpayers, and thereby reduce their risks and opportunity costs. The new system will also be fairer because taxpayers will be able to object to Private Rulings and have the matter reviewed by an independent tribunal or court.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Extended Objection Periods</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill extends the period within which a taxpayer can object against an assessment from 60 days to 4 years, and, as I mentioned above, provides a similar objection period for Private Rulings. The 4 year objection period corresponds with the Commissioner's power of amendment. These changes represent enhanced rights of objection and appeal for taxpayers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Taxpayers will have full rights of review either against the Private Ruling where there is no assessment, or against the assessment, except to the extent that the taxpayer has already objected against a matter in respect of a Private Ruling. By allowing taxpayers to object to Private Rulings the Bill provides the opportunity to bring forward in time the resolution of matters in dispute.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Self Amendment</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commissioner will be able to rely on statements made by the taxpayer in a request for an amendment in amending the taxpayer's assessment in the same way as the Commissioner can now rely on statements made by the taxpayer in a return when making an assessment. However, the Commissioner may decide not to accept statements in the request for amendment or made elsewhere and, for example, make enquiries as to whether the amendment is necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commissioner is obliged to amend the taxpayer's assessment where the Commissioner is satisfied that the amendment is necessary to reflect the correct tax.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where a taxpayer self amends the Commissioner will have 4 years to review the item amended.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These changes will provide opportunities for efficiency gains in the administration of the income tax law by reducing duplication of work where it does not add value.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Understatement Penalties</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The key features of the new penalty provisions are:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">all taxpayers will be required to exercise reasonable care in conducting their tax affairs. Failure to exercise reasonable care will attract a penalty of 25% of a tax shortfall or franking tax shortfall caused by the failure;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">taxpayers with large claims (generally $10 000 tax or more) will, in addition, be required to ensure that the positions they adopt are reasonably arguable. Failure to have a reasonably arguable position will attract a penalty of 25% of a tax shortfall or franking tax shortfall caused by the failure;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">a taxpayer who has received a Private Ruling from the Commissioner on a matter but does not follow the ruling when preparing the return will also be liable to pay a penalty of 25% of a tax shortfall or franking tax shortfall caused by not following the ruling;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">taxpayers who behave recklessly with regard to their tax affairs, or who set out to deliberately evade tax will also be penalised (at 50% and 75% respectively) in respect of any tax shortfall or franking tax shortfall caused by their behaviour;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">taxpayers who enter into arrangements for the sole or dominant purpose of avoiding tax will be liable to pay penalty of 50% of a tax shortfall caused by the arrangement, reduced to 25% if the position taken by the taxpayer is reasonably arguable. This will be so, irrespective of the provision of the Income Tax Assessment Act used by the Commissioner to defeat the arrangement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">understatement penalties may be increased by 20% of the penalty if there are aggravating circumstances, for example, a taxpayer hinders the Commissioner's enquiries, or decreased by 20% of the penalty if the taxpayer discloses a tax shortfall or scheme to the Commissioner during an audit;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">taxpayers who voluntarily disclose a tax shortfall or scheme to the Commissioner before the Commissioner enquires into the taxpayer's affairs will have the penalty reduced by 80%;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">understatement penalties will be subject to the Commissioner's discretion to remit the penalty in whole or in part;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">understatement penalties will be subject to full review rights.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Reasonable care and reasonably arguable position</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The whole idea of the new understatement penalties is to ensure that people do not get penalised when they have made an honest and genuine attempt to correctly determine their taxable income. The Bill replaces the existing system where penalty is automatically attracted at the rate of 200%, and remitted at the discretion of the Commissioner. In so doing, it reduces the risk of penalties for taxpayers provided taxpayers adhere to the  standards of reasonable care and, where appropriate, reasonably arguable position.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reasonable care standard requires a taxpayer to exercise the care that an ordinary person would be likely to have exercised in the circumstances of the taxpayer. Reasonable care requires taxpayers to make a reasonable attempt to comply with their tax obligations. The effort required is commensurate with all the taxpayer's circumstances, including the taxpayer's knowledge, education and skill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has opted to favour equity in this area by choosing a standard which has regard to the taxpayer's circumstances. However, following experience in the United States, the Government considers it appropriate that a more rigorous standard apply where the item at issue is very large (eg., generally more than $10 000 in tax). Where the interpretation of the law for such large items is in issue, we expect taxpayers to exercise more care. That is the taxpayer must have a reasonably arguable position on the matter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reasonably arguable position standard will, because of the $10 000 threshold, apply only to relatively few taxpayers. The crux of the standard is that taxpayers should not take positions at law which, at the time taken, are not about as arguable as an alternative position. All said and done, the standard is about analysing the law and its application to the facts. If there is a strong argument to support the taxpayer's position, that may be enough. However the Government does not want taxpayers to take positions which are not defensible or which do not have reasonable prospects of success.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where a taxpayer perceives a serious risk that the taxpayer's preferred position may not be reasonably arguable, the taxpayer is able to seek a Private Ruling from the Commissioner.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Commissioner's discretion to remit</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the Bill provides a set of rules and accompanying penalties, there may be cases that will not fit neatly into a category of behaviour, or for which the prescribed rates of penalty are inappropriate. For this reason, and as a result of the consultative process, the discretion which the Commissioner has to remit penalties is not removed by this Bill. The Commissioner will retain the flexibility to provide concessional treatment where it would be fair and reasonable to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Taxpayers who use tax agents</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result of the consultative process, the Government agreed in the August 1991 information paper to put on hold the proposal in the December 1990 consultative document that there should be tax agent penalties. A review is in course to determine, amongst other things, whether tax agent penalties or some other form of regulation of tax agents is appropriate, and if so, the level of those penalties or the form of regulation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Pending the outcome of that review, and as an interim measure to protect the Revenue, the Bill maintains the current position that a taxpayer is liable to penalties for understatements of tax caused by the negligent or delinquent behaviour of the tax agent in dealing with the taxpayer's affairs. However, a taxpayer who is liable to penalty in these circumstances is able to sue the tax agent to recover both penalty and interest.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Late Payment Penalty</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The penalty for late payment is to be reduced from the current 20% per annum to 8% per annum, but will be complemented by the new interest system. The reduced late payment penalty, together with the new interest system, should ensure that the Revenue is not used as a financing vehicle. It also provides an effective reduction in the level of late payment penalties for most taxpayers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By reducing the penalty, and introducing the new interest system, the Bill will allow for the separation of penalties and interest so that they can be applied separately as appropriate to the circumstances of each case. It also allows for a more commercial approach to be applied to the payment of tax.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This penalty does not apply to debit amendments other than late payment of the increase in tax. Like other penalties, the Commissioner will have the power to remit the penalty in whole or in part.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Interest System</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will provide for interest to be paid by taxpayers in relation to the underpayment of tax, including debit amendments, and the late payment of tax. Interest will apply irrespective of whether a taxpayer is subject to understatement penalties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The basis of the interest system is to compensate the Revenue for the time value of money for the period in which it is denied the use of funds.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To reflect a more commercial approach to the payment of tax, the statutory interest rate is based on market rates. The rate of interest payable by taxpayers will be set by reference to the weighted average yield for the 13 Week Treasury Note tenders plus 4%. The extra 4% reflects administrative costs and the fact that most taxpayers would not be able to borrow at the 13 Week Treasury Note rate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given that interest is meant to compensate the Revenue for  the time value of money, the rate at which interest is to be paid by taxpayers will be varied periodically to reflect interest rate movements in the market.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commissioner will have the power to remit interest.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In effect interest at the 13 Week Treasury Note rate plus the 4% would make most taxpayers indifferent to borrowing from a bank to pay tax or being liable to the interest at that rate. The late payment penalty encourages taxpayers to pay tax on time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Deduction for interest payments</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result of the consultative process, and to make the system fairer, interest paid by taxpayers to the ATO will be tax deductible. This will remove the present lack of symmetry in the tax treatment of interest paid by taxpayers to the ATO and interest paid by the ATO to taxpayers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Interest on overpayments</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Interest on funds borrowed to pay tax are deductible for certain categories of business taxpayers but not for other taxpayers. To benefit those taxpayers who are not entitled to a deduction for interest on funds borrowed to pay tax, the Government is considering amendment of the law to exempt from tax interest paid by the ATO on overpayments of tax to such taxpayers, with the prospect of changes being introduced after the Budget.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Financial impact</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is estimated that the new interest system, (including reduced late payment penalties and deductibility for interest payments made by taxpayers to the ATO) will cost the Revenue $20m in 1993-94 and $64m in 1994-95 and subsequent years based on existing late payment penalty and statutory interest rates. However, the actual cost to the Revenue in any year will depend on the interest rates prevailing in the particular period. These costs could be higher or lower depending on whether interest rates are higher or lower than current market rates.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Elections and Other Notifications</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In most cases taxpayers will no longer be required to prepare and lodge written notices of elections. However, the taxpayer's records will need to reflect the decisions taken in calculating the taxable income.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other Proposals</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The August 1991 information paper foreshadowed other amendments to the taxation laws. These amendments are not yet finalised and will be included in a separate Bill to be introduced later this year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government believes these measures to be genuine tax reform which will improve the current self assessment system of taxation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I present the Explanatory Memorandum which contains more detailed explanations of the provisions of the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the Bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No.3) 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill will amend the taxation laws to implement several measures outlined by the Prime Minister in his "One Nation" statement of 26 February 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It will change the taxation provisions to make investment in Australian industry more attractive. This is, of course, part of the Government's strategy to assist Australian business to become more competitive in the international arena.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will amend the depreciation provisions in a number of respects.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Taxpayers who install depreciable property on Crown leases will no longer be denied depreciation deductions only by reason of the fact that the property is attached to leased land.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Capital expenditure on the construction of buildings used for short-term traveller accommodation and industrial buildings will be able to be written-off at an accelerated rate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will also extend depreciation eligibility to certain structural improvements at the 2 1/2 per cent rate accorded income producing buildings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also provides for the taxation treatment of the proposed Development Allowance and Pooled Development Funds.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Also provided for in the Bill are the taxation measures to provide the facility for certain new transport and electricity projects to be financed by means of non-assessable/non-deductible borrowings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another "One Nation" initiative to be provided for by this Bill is amendments to the bad debt provisions to remove some uncertainty as to the operation of the taxation law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition to these One Nation measures, the Bill will amend the definition of primary production and the research and development provisions of the taxation law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The definition of "primary production" will be amended to include taxpayers engaged in horticulture. "Horticulture" will include the propagation or cultivation of plants for themselves or their commercially useful parts and includes the use of intensive and artificial growing techniques.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The research and development provisions of the taxation law are to be amended to confirm that prospecting, exploring or drilling for minerals, petroleum or natural gas is not as such research and development (R&amp;D) for the purpose of the special R&amp;D deduction of up to 150% of expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will also make changes to the arrangements for the administration of the reasonable benefit limits as set out in the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act 1987.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I turn now to a more detailed discussion of these measures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Crown leases</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill amends the depreciation provisions so that taxpayers who install depreciable property on Crown leases will no longer be denied depreciation deductions only by reason of the fact that the property is attached to leased land.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under existing law, taxpayers who install depreciable property on Crown leases can be denied depreciation deductions because, owing to the degree of attachment of the property to the land, the law treats the Crown as the owner, and not the taxpayer who actually incurred the expenditure. Taxpayers must own the property for which deductions are sought.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The law is to be amended to treat taxpayers in those circumstances as owners of the property for depreciation purposes, so enabling them to obtain deductions for the income-producing use of such property that occurs after 26 February 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A number of consequential amendments will be required to the capital gains tax provisions as the result of the changes to the depreciation provisions, to ensure that the two provisions treat property on Crown leases in a consistent manner.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Those consequential amendments will be introduced during the Budget session of the Parliament and will apply from the same date as the depreciation changes, 26 February 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These depreciation amendments are not expected to have a significant impact on the revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Traveller accommodation</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The capital cost of buildings used in the provision of short-term traveller accommodation is to be evenly deductible over 25 years at the rate of 4 per cent per annum, up from 2.5 per cent per annum. The higher rate  will also apply to extensions, alterations or improvements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment applies to hotels, motels and guesthouses that contain at least 10 rooms available for short-term use by travellers. It also applies to buildings containing not less than 10 apartments, units or flats, and associated facilities, for short-term use by travellers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The higher rate will be available where construction commences after 26 February 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The estimated cost to revenue of these amendments is nil in 1991-92 and 1992-93; $2 million in 1993-94; $6 million in 1994-95; and $12 million in 1995-96.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Industrial buildings</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The rate of deduction for buildings used in industrial activities is also to increase from 2.5 per cent per annum to 4 per cent per annum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Industrial activities encompass manufacturing operations and certain closely related activities. They also include the processing of primary products, such as minerals, wool, timber and foodstuffs. Printing and similar activities are also included as is the production of energy either for sale or for use in manufacturing and related activities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Buildings not covered by the amendments, such as offices and shops, will continue to be deductible at the rate of 2.5 per cent per annum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment applies to buildings, or extensions, alterations or improvements to buildings, commenced to be constructed after 26 February 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is estimated that the cost to revenue will be nil in 1991-92 and 1992-93; $3 million in 1993-94; $9 million in 1994-95; and $18 million in 1995-96.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Income-producing structural improvements</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Deductions are to be available for the cost of income-producing structures on land that are not presently deductible under existing capital allowance provisions in the law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The rate of deduction will be 2.5 per cent per annum, the same as for most income-producing buildings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Examples of structures to which the concession will apply include roads, runways, bridges, dams, walls and fences, including earthworks integral to the installation of those structures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment will not apply to other non-depreciating earthworks and artificial landscapes such as grass playing fields and fairways.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment applies where construction commences after 26 February 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Development Allowance</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill includes measures to re-activate and amend the former investment allowance provisions to allow a deduction, for a restricted period, of 10% of capital expenditure on plant and equipment acquired by taxpayers for certain large scale Australian projects.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This proposal, which was announced in the "One Nation" statement on 26 February 1992, is designed to promote an early upturn in investment in new plant and equipment for projects which offer particular benefits for Australia's competitiveness in world markets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Development Allowance Authority Bill 1992, which was introduced earlier, is integral to the operation of the taxation provisions covered under this Bill.  The Authority will determine whether criteria have been met to enable the allowance of a taxation deduction.  A certificate issued by the Authority is a pre-requisite to any taxation deduction.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The estimated cost of this measure is expected to be $40 million in 1994-95 and $70 million in 1995-96.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Pooled Development Funds</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill will also provide for the taxation of Pooled Development Funds (PDFs) and the tax effects for persons investing in PDFs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By this measure the Government is facilitating the provision of equity capital for small and medium sized firms.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">PDFs will be companies registered by a Board established under a Pooled Development Funds Act. The scheme will be administered by the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce. The Pooled Development Funds Bill was also introduced earlier.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">PDFs will be taxed on their taxable income at a concessional rate of 30 per cent. Their taxable income will be calculated on the same basis as that of other companies. The imputation provisions of the income tax law will apply to PDFs in the same way  they apply to other companies. Dividends paid by PDFs will therefore be frankable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unfranked dividends paid by PDFs will be exempt from income tax. In the case of franked PDF dividends, shareholders will have the choice of claiming the exemption, or using the imputation credits attached to those dividends by including the dividends in their assessable income.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Shareholders will also be exempt from tax on any profits or gains on the disposal of PDF shares. Correspondingly, no deductions will be allowable for any losses incurred on disposal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is not expected to be a revenue cost for the first two years for this measure. The estimated cost for 1994-95 and 1995-96 is $5 million in each year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Infrastructure borrowings</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill creates a category of borrowings&mdash;described as infrastructure borrowings&mdash;that will be available to finance the construction of certain new land transport, seaport and electricity generating facilities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The tax benefits provided by this measure will facilitate private sector investment in the construction, ownership and operation of infrastructure that in the past was normally undertaken by the public sector.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Infrastructure projects of the type specified typically have a long construction period and do not produce revenue for some years. This can mean that companies borrowing to develop such projects will not be able to obtain a deduction for interest costs in the year in which they are incurred. The measure will assist the financing of the projects by effectively allowing the borrowing company to transfer the benefit of its interest deduction to investors. Such a transfer reduces the financing cost to the borrower.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The transfer of the benefit of tax deductibility for interest will be achieved by the interest on the infrastructure borrowing being freed from income tax in the hands of investors, with the interest paid by the borrower not qualifying for deduction.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Investors in infrastructure borrowings will also benefit by not having to pay income tax on any profits on the disposal of their interest in the borrowing. They will not, however, be able to claim a deduction for any loss on disposal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Importantly, the Government has decided to further encourage private sector investment in the specified areas by allowing a tax deduction for interest on borrowings to invest in infrastructure borrowings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The measure, as indicated, is targeted to genuine private sector projects in the areas specified. It is not designed to promote new forms of financing the public sector. Eligibility is based on the private sector infrastructure provider deriving assessable income in consequence of the public being charged a fee for the use of, or output from, the facility. The tax benefits of an infrastructure borrowing will not be available for projects where there is a form of public underwriting of the risks associated with construction, ownership or use.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Infrastructure borrowings will be able to be used to finance the construction of one of the specified facilities by a company, a corporate unit trust or a public trading trust that intends to own, use and effectively control the use of the facility to generate assessable income for at least 25 years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Companies whose sole purpose is to invest in bodies constructing one of the specified categories of infrastructure facility will also be able to raise infrastructure borrowings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The maximum period of an infrastructure borrowing, including the refinancing of an infrastructure borrowing, will be ten years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The estimated revenue cost of this measure for 1993-94, 1994-95 and 1995-96 is $10 million, $35 million and $100 million respectively.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Bad debts</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill will give effect to the Prime Minister's announcement in the "One Nation" statement to amend the bad debt provisions in the income tax law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will clarify that the writing-off of a bad part of a debt is an allowable deduction.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It will also ensure that a deduction will be allowed for swap losses where the debt is extinguished on or after 27 February 1992 as a result of entering into debt/equity swap arrangements. Under the proposed amendment, debt/equity swaps may be arranged even though the debt is not yet bad.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The swap loss is the difference between the book value of the debt and the value taken in exchange for the debt. The value of the equity will be its market value or the value recorded in the books of the creditor, whichever is greater.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will also ensure that any profits or losses subsequently realised from the disposal, cancellation or redemption of the equity acquired through debt/equity swaps are assessable or deductible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These measures will enable some debt restructuring for debtors in difficulty without requiring trading to cease and should therefore result in some reduction in the number of cases where businesses are liquidated.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment will have no long term cost to the revenue. Some deductions from debt/equity swaps could be brought forward at a small but unquantifiable cost to the revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Expenditure on research and development activities</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will confirm that the cost of prospecting, exploring or drilling for minerals, petroleum or natural gas is not as such research and development (R&amp;D) expenditure for the purpose of the special R&amp;D tax deduction of up to 150% of expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment will ensure that if the purpose of the prospecting, exploring or drilling activities is to discover, determine more precisely the location of, or determine the size or quality of, deposits,then the activities are not research and development activities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment will have no effect on revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Primary production definition</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Taxpayers engaged in the cultivation or propagation of plants in media other than soil do not qualify as primary producers under the income tax law. The Government believes this is inequitable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill therefore proposes an amendment to the definition of primary production so as to include taxpayers engaged in horticulture. The proposed definition of horticulture will apply to taxpayers who are engaged in the cultivation or propagation of plants (including fungi) for themselves or their commercially useful parts, and expressly includes propagation or cultivation in media other than soil.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The definition will not apply to activities other than in the course of, or for the purpose of, a business.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The estimated cost to the revenue of the inclusion of horticulture in the definition of primary production will be $0.5 million per year from 1992-93.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Occupational Superannuation Standards Act amendments</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will make changes to the arrangements for the administration of the reasonable benefit limits (RBL) as set out in the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act 1987.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The RBL apply to the total amount of retirement benefits receivable on a concessionally taxed basis. The payment of amounts in excess of the RBL are identified by the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner and communicated to the Commissioner of Taxation for tax assessment purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill proposes that only RBL determinations made by the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner that result in an income tax liability for the taxpayers be notified. At present the Act requires that all determination decisions made by the Commissioner be individually notified to taxpayers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also proposes that determinations which do not give rise to a tax liability can be notified upon the initiative of the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner. The existing right of taxpayers to request a copy of a determination will remain.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Almost 600,000 determinations were dispatched for payments made in 1990/91. It is estimated that the effect of the proposed changes will be to reduce the number of determinations required to be notified by approximately 50%.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This will result in substantial reductions in the administrative burden on ordinary taxpayers, particularly when completing their tax returns.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There will also be reductions in ISC administrative costs other than a small cost increase to be incurred next year to cover implementation.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of this Bill is to give effect to the initiative announced in the Prime Minister's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">One Nation</EMPHASIS> Statement to alleviate the problems small and medium sized Australian firms have experienced in obtaining patient equity capital. It also reflects changes to the announced program made to enhance its attractiveness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill provides for the establishment of investment companies, to be called Pooled Development Funds, which will provide patient equity capital for eligible activities in Australian companies with total assets not greater than $30m.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the concerns of industry expressed most frequently to me as Industry Minister is the failure of the Australian capital market to provide long-term development capital for productive investment. The problem was raised again during the consultations that Ministers had with business prior to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">One Nation</EMPHASIS> Statement. It is difficult to prove the case about the lack of development capital, but the anecdotal evidence is quite strong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a compelling need to improve the flow of development capital to:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government recognises that there are imperfections in the capital market and that small and medium sized firms often have difficulty in obtaining equity capital, especially those that are technology based, or those that are in the early stages of potentially rapid growth. Suitable development capital is often unavailable for such firms because:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">suppliers of capital are risk averse and often have a short-term investment outlook;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">they do not have access to the same range of sources of capital as do larger firms, particularly as there is no reliable and easily accessible market for trading equity in small businesses; and</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill establishes a Pooled Development Funds Registration Board, comprising a Chairperson and four members drawn from the private sector and an officer from my Department, to administer the Program.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian companies with access to appropriate management expertise and sources of capital may apply to the Board for registration as a PDF.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has decided not to limit the pool of capital that may be invested through the PDFs. Any number of PDFs may be registered and the PDFs can raise as much capital as they can attract.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To encourage investment in PDFs, the Government has decided to tax the PDFs at 30% rather than at the general company tax rate of 39%, and to allow investors in PDFs to elect to receive their dividends either as tax exempt or through the imputation system. The latter feature is a significant modification of the Program since its announcement, and will provide improved benefits for shareholders facing a tax rate below 30%. It has also removed the taxation based inhibitions on low tax investors, such as super funds, from investing in small and medium sized businesses via PDFs. In addition, any gains on the sale of shares in PDFs will be tax exempt. (Further details on these incentives will be provided on introduction of the Bill to amend the tax laws to give effect to these and other initiatives in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">One Nation</EMPHASIS> Statement.)</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tax benefits will not come into play until the investment activity by the PDFs is successful. In effect, the Government and the shareholders will share the benefits of the PDFs' activities through a lower tax rate and tax exempt returns to shareholders. The benefits to the Government and the economy will come from the expansion in business activity and growth in employment in the PDF investee businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">PDFs will be required to comply with certain rules set out in the Bill. The tax benefits are conditional on the PDFs complying with those rules and this will be monitored by the Board. While the ultimate sanction for breaking the requirements will be revocation of the PDF status of a particular company the Board will have other discretionary powers to ensure that the spirit of the Program is not breached.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been some useful suggestions by investment and fund managers to features of the PDF proposal announced in the `One Nation' Statement. One of the suggestions relates to the nature of the proposed tax incentive, and this has been addressed in the modifications to the tax treatment mentioned earlier.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other comments have concentrated on improving the commercial flexibility of the PDFs. The Government has also taken notice of these suggestions by both changing some of the parameters announced earlier and providing the Board with discretions to allow it to waive some of the requirements for particular PDFs in certain situations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Previously it was announced that apart from life offices and banks, no investor could own more than 10 per cent of a PDF. Furthermore a PDF could not invest more than 10 per cent of its funds in any one business. Both these parameters have been changed to 20 per cent. In addition, in certain circumstances PDFs will be able to invest in previously owned shares.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to discretions it is expected that the Board will exercise these only where the commercial realities require such action. For example the intention is that PDFs invest in small and medium sized companies and $30m in total assets has been chosen as the benchmark. However, the Board may allow a further investment in companies if the value of the total assets in the investee business exceeds $30m where it is clear that the further investment is desirable to protect earlier ones. These discretions in no way undermine the integrity and objectives of the Government's Program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">PDFs may invest only in companies and only for the purpose of establishing new businesses or substantially developing new production capacity or markets for established businesses.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government considers that there should be a wide choice in the industry spread for investments by the PDFs. Accordingly, the Bill provides that PDFs may invest in any area of business activity other than:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DEVELOPMENT ALLOWANCE AUTHORITY BILL 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The need for this Bill was foreshadowed in the announcement of the development allowance in the Government's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">One Nation</EMPHASIS> Statement of February this year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government gives a high priority to the introduction of this and related <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">One Nation</EMPHASIS> initiatives legislation. Passage of this legislation, in establishing the Development Allowance Authority (the DAA) to facilitate investment and reform in major projects, in conjunction with related amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (the Tax Act), brings the development allowance to working reality.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The development allowance itself builds on the advantages of the accelerated depreciation measures also announced in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">One Nation</EMPHASIS> Statement. The development allowance will achieve this by  promoting an early upturn in investment in new plant and equipment for projects which offer particular benefits for our competitiveness in world markets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The development allowance has two key economic objectives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, it seeks to encourage an early upturn in investment in new plant and equipment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Second, and at the same time, it looks to encourage reform both within those companies receiving the allowance and in the economic environment in which they operate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The allowance is modest in its direct impact on firms&mdash;providing a 10 per cent deduction against assessable income for eligible plant expenditure once incurred. But its indirect effect is potentially much greater. The allowance provides firms looking to undertake large projects with additional leverage to negotiate progress against a broad best practice agenda. Ideally, these reforms will work their way through our industrial system to impact positively on the operational environment for those projects not benefiting directly from the allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The DAA in pre-qualifying a project for the allowance must be satisfied that the project's contribution to our competitive standing is both sufficient and achievable. Importantly, the development allowance best typifies a central theme of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">One Nation</EMPHASIS>&mdash;development initiatives being contingent on efficiency gains being achieved. Put  simply the development allowance rewards success and represents a conscious rejection of those policies of the past which underwrote loss and failure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">One Nation</EMPHASIS>, Bill Scales, the new Chair of the Industry Commission, reported to the Treasurer on the operational aspects of the development allowance. This Bill follows from that report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill establishes the DAA and sets out the scope of the Authority's role in assessing the eligibility of projects to pre-qualify for the development allowance. While the DAA is to determine what plant expenditure (once incurred) will pre-qualify for the allowance, the final decision as to eligibility will rest with the Commissioner of Taxation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The DAA is to be a one member Statutory Authority operating within the Treasurer's portfolio. The Treasurer will make an announcement shortly as to who will hold the office of the DAA.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The DAA will receive support from a Secretariat&mdash;the Development Allowance Authority Secretariat&mdash;that is being established  within the Treasury.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The cost of the development allowance is estimated to be approximately $40 in 1994-95 and $70m in 1995-96.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill sets out a working example of an applicant progressing through the various steps towards obtaining a pre-qualifying certificate from the DAA. This example highlights how the work of the DAA and the process for obtaining eligibility are framed around a timetable of key trigger dates. These dates reflect the underlying objectives of the allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In brief, a project proponent first applies to the DAA to register a project that is expected to meet the eligibility criteria and, unless the project has substantially commenced by end 1992, the competitiveness tests for the development allowance. The DAA then assesses the applicant's case against the criteria set out in the Bill. Once registered, the next stage involves the applicant providing the DAA with documentation that demonstrates that the project has the necessary approvals and authorisations to substantially commence. The final phase involves an application and project report to the DAA for a pre-qualifying certificate. An entity holding a pre-qualifying certificate claims the development allowance (subject to the relevant tax tests) from the Australian Taxation Office once the expenditure is incurred.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I turn now to the key elements of the Bill&mdash;providing for the DAA's assessment of a project against the objectives I have outlined.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Project Definition</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Central to the legislation is the concept of a project.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The allowance is only available to large projects. A threshold has been set of  gross capital expenditure of $50m or more.  Gross capital expenditure is total expenditure of a capital nature that is incurred, or will be incurred, in carrying out the project. Encouraging projects of this magnitude will induce confidence in our economic future. As mentioned before large projects will be better placed to use the allowance as a lever to secure reform and best practice both within their operations and the economic environment in which they operate. Further, the demonstration effect of reform secured by these large projects will be substantial.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill sets out the meaning of carrying out a project for the purposes of the development allowance. A project may involve:  establishing a new productive facility in Australia, or establishing two or more related productive facilities that make up either a discrete or vertically integrated project in Australia. A project may also involve expansions, improvements or upgrades of a substantial nature at a new or existing productive facility. Environment upgrades will be eligible. However, projects involving ongoing maintenance-related investment or the aggregation of investment in unrelated productive facilities will not be eligible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A productive facility is defined as a facility used primarily by the operator for the production or distribution of the same or related goods or services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is also required that plant expenditure is to be incurred wholly or principally for carrying out the project for which the entity is seeking a pre-qualifying certificate. The intention here is to quarantine the allowance to that plant expenditure that is genuinely for primary use in the eligible project.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Basic Eligibility Test</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The basic eligibility test reflects the fact that the development allowance is an initiative conceived in the emerging low tariff environment. Certain activities, largely in the non-traded sectors and specified in the Bill, are excluded from eligibility for the allowance. In addition, projects which are heavily assisted are also excluded from eligibility.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill sets out a clear test to be applied in establishing whether the project benefits from substantial assistance. This test involves an applicant satisfying the DAA that the project does not  have a nominal or effective rate of assistance (taking the lower) exceeding 10 per cent. These are accepted measures of assistance, and are  to be calculated in a manner consistent with the methodology used by the Industry Commission. The calculation will be based on the level of tariff or other foreshadowed levels of assistance that are to apply on 1 July 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where the entire productive facility fails the basic eligibility test then none of the expenditure will be eligible for the allowance. If only a part of the project falls within this category then only that expenditure  related to the excluded sector is ineligible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Competitiveness Test</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The competitiveness test is the linchpin for the wider benefits of the development allowance initiative.  There are two parts to the test. First, the DAA must be satisfied that the project's labour-management arrangements substantially reflect world best practice. Second, the prices of key inputs to the project's  operation are economic and efficient. Key inputs could include, for example:  products from a statutory marketing authority or private supplier for which the project involves their further processing; the transport by government or private rail systems of those inputs and final product to the market place; and electricity or other infrastructure support. The key input prices test does not apply to inputs of land, labour and capital. If the DAA is satisfied that a registered project has substantially commenced by end 1992, then in order that the project not be further delayed, the project will not be required to meet the competitiveness test.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The DAA as a Facilitator</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Importantly the Bill enables the DAA to facilitate the allowance approvals process. The DAA, with the consent of the applicant, may approach a third party to advise it that its action, or inaction, has prevented or may prevent the project from prequalifying or registering for the development allowance. The goal here is to help the applicant  secure the reforms that are part of the objective of the allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Key Trigger Dates&mdash;Registration, Approvals and Certification</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For a project to be considered by the DAA, the DAA  must be satisfied that the project had in no way or form been commenced by the entity or a related entity before</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">27 February 1992. This is intended to reinforce the objective of the allowance&mdash;to bring forward  investment in new plant and equipment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Proponents are required to have applied to the DAA for registration by 1 January 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill sets out the procedures for an applicant to  register a project with the DAA.  The applicant is required to provide a written application and project report setting out such information about the project as required by the DAA. An application needs to be signed by the Chairperson in the case of a company, or a person of equivalent authority for a non-company entity. This requirement is to help ensure that the proponent is genuinely committed to the project.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also specifies the criteria against which the DAA assesses an application for registration. These criteria are intended to ensure that the applicant has a genuine intention to proceed with an eligible project, within the specified time frame. For example the project:  did not commence prior to 27 February 1992;  has passed or is reasonably likely to pass the $50m threshold test; will not operate in a protected or ineligible sector of the economy; is reasonably likely to be completed and further that there is reasonably likely to be a substantial commitment to the project's completion by 1 July 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By 1 July 1995 the applicant must furnish the DAA with approvals and documentation that demonstrate that the project has the necessary authorisations and approvals in order to substantially commence. This is an important precursor to the DAA being satisfied by 1 July 1996 that there is a substantial commitment to the project's completion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The cut-off date for applying for a pre-qualifying certificate is 1 August 1996.  Importantly, in addition to meeting the basic eligibility and competitiveness tests, the project needs to have substantially commenced&mdash;that is, there is a substantial commitment to the project's completion by 1 July 1996. The Bill specifies factors which the DAA may take into account in making this assessment. For example, a substantial commitment to complete a project would not be taken to have occurred where contracts for only a small proportion of the project's total cost have been entered into and where there is no substantial physical evidence that the project has commenced.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill sets out the procedures for an applicant to obtain a pre-qualifying certificate.  As in the case of registration, an entity must lodge a written application and project report setting out such information as is required by the DAA to assess the project. An application will not be accepted from an entity that has not registered and has not met the conditions attached to the registration&mdash;for example, that final documentation relating to approvals have been provided by 1 July 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also specifies the criteria against which the DAA assesses an application for a pre-qualifying certificate. These criteria are intended to ensure that the applicant has met the relevant tests and that there is a substantial commitment by 1 July 1996 to the project's completion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, and this is a test for the Commissioner of Taxation under the Tax Act, the plant must be in use or installed ready for use by 1 July 2002.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Prospective Deduction Test</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To ensure that the DAA does not spend time assessing applications which would not in any event be eligible for the allowance under the relevant tax tests,  the Bill allows the DAA to apply a prospective deduction test to determine whether the entity's expenditure is reasonably likely to be deductible under the Tax Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Information Provision</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Underlying these processes is the requirement that the entity must satisfy the DAA that the tests have been met. This will involve the entity furnishing the DAA with adequate information and/or documentation in order that the DAA is satisfied that the project has passed the relevant tests. That  information will be provided by the applicant to the DAA primarily in the application form and the project report. To ensure the DAA is well positioned to assess each case against the relevant information set, the DAA has powers to request that an entity provide additional information or documentation. If an applicant fails to meet such a request, the DAA is empowered to refuse to consider the application.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In light of the degree of intellectual rigour needed to apply the policy objectives, reflected for example in the competitiveness test, the Bill allows the DAA to draw on the expertise of consultants and Commonwealth authorities, for example the Industry Commission, in assessing the eligibility of applicants.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also provides for the suitable handling and treatment of commercial-in-confidence information. The entity may apply to the DAA to have certain information treated as commercial-in-confidence, and the DAA is required to accede to that request unless the DAA considers that the public interest suggests otherwise.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Transfers and Variations&mdash;Registration and Pre-qualifying Certificate</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also allows applications to be made by a range of commercial entities, including companies, partnerships, joint ventures, and company groups (in the case of a vertically integrated company group project scheme). The project definitions, applying to these entities, is structured to ensure that a genuine project is being proposed by the commercial entity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill is structured to reflect that  the DAA operates amidst commercial reality&mdash;whereby a genuine transfer in the responsibility for completing a project or a project's  modification may warrant corresponding changes in the registration and certification documents. While complex in appearance, underlying these provisions is an intention to ensure that the DAA can operate flexibly when such changes are demonstrably based on commercial realities and are genuine endeavours to complete the same or substantially the same project as was originally registered or certified. For example, the Bill enables the DAA to transfer registration or certification to a new or restructured entity in certain circumstances&mdash;including, where the transfer of the project's responsibility is genuine and for genuine commercial reasons and the project is the same or substantially the same as that originally registered or certified.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Registration and Certification&mdash;Cancellation and Termination</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The DAA may cancel or terminate a certificate in certain circumstances. In the case of a failure to comply with an information request the DAA may terminate a certificate or cancel a registration. Termination of a certificate only impacts on expenditure incurred after the date of termination. Cancellation has the same effect as if registration or a pre-qualifying certificate had never been granted. If an entity provides the DAA or a Department officer with false or misleading information then the DAA may cancel the registration or certificate. The DAA is also required to cancel a registration or terminate a certificate at the entity's request.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The key link between the work of the DAA and the entity finally obtaining the development allowance from the ATO lies in the pre-qualifying certificate. The pre-qualifying certificate will specify the elements of the project&mdash;the plant expenditure that once incurred will pre-qualify for the allowance. As previously mentioned, pre-qualifying under this Bill does not automatically entitle the entity to the development allowance. That determination is ultimately one for the Commissioner of Taxation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The DAA is required to notify the Commissioner of Taxation of any action taken under this Bill which impacts on the operation of the development allowance provisions of the Tax Act. For example, if a certificate is cancelled the DAA would advise the Commissioner of Taxation in order that the Commissioner of Taxation can reassess any allowances already claimed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Review Procedures</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill sets out the procedures for reviewing decisions made by the DAA. The key feature of this part is that a request by an applicant to review a DAA decision is first subject to reconsideration by the DAA itself, before being considered by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. An applicant may request in writing a DAA review  within 21  days of the applicant being advised of a DAA decision. The DAA is then required to reconsider that decision within 40 days. If a decision is not made within that time, the decision is taken to have been confirmed. This is intended to ensure that a request is not held up by the DAA and  may be subsequently reviewed by the AAT.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Reporting Requirements</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill contains provisions whereby both the Minister and the Parliament are kept well informed of the operations of the DAA. The DAA will be required (up to 1 July 1997) to prepare an Annual Report which is to be tabled within 15 sitting days of its receipt. In addition, the DAA will be required to provide the Minister with quarterly reports on the operation of the DAA up to 1 January 1997. Following that date, the DAA will be required to provide a periodic report and/or Annual Report  at the request of the Minister. The variation in the reporting requirements over time reflect the anticipated workload of the DAA in line with the key trigger dates for registration and certification.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Administrative Framework</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In terms of the administrative framework, the Bill provides for a full or part-time DAA office holder until 1 January 1997. It is envisaged that the initial appointment will be on a full-time basis. The Bill allows for the Minister's providing a written determination to the Governor-General to terminate a full-time appointment if the Minister considers that the workload is insufficient to justify a full-time appointment. The Bill also enables the DAA to delegate its powers and functions to a SES  officer in the Department.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Post-1 January 1997 and until 1 July 2002, the office of the DAA may be undertaken on an acting basis by a SES officer in the Department of the Treasury. From 1 July 2002 the office of DAA may be undertaken on an acting basis by a SES officer in the Australian Taxation Office. These provisions reflect the anticipated workload and responsibilities of the DAA against the operational trigger dates for registration and pre-qualifying certification.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also contains adequate conflict of interest provisions. In particular, if the DAA has an interest related in any way to a matter to be considered  by the DAA, then the DAA is required to advise the Minister and take no further action until the Minister has determined (within 28 days) whether that interest will conflict with the DAA performing its functions. Should the Minister consider that the interest would conflict with the DAA effectively performing its functions, then the Minister shall direct the DAA to delegate the matter to a SES officer in the Department.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, miscellaneous provisions of the Bill provide for regulations not inconsistent with the Bill, and that if a document is given to one partner then it can be assumed to have been given to the partnership.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To sum up, the Development Allowance Authority is the conduit to our securing the potential benefits of the development allowance&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">A relatively modest initiative but with a profound indirect effect.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Having received the allowance, project operators stand on their own. The allowance is self liquidating so that it does not see firms entrenched in a hand-out mentality.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The allowance both stimulates and rewards success.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To conclude, the establishment of the DAA represents the Government's moving into a  mature phase of development initiatives in a low tariff environment. Underpinning this shift is a rejection of the handout mentality of the past. In its place is the acceptance that Government alone cannot forge the reform agenda. Business must itself internalise a reform agenda for the economic and institutional environment in which it operates. The DAA and the development allowance will be a catalyst for broadening the best practice agenda which will secure efficiency and productivity gains. It is those gains and reform mentality that will lay the groundwork for income and employment growth and job security.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">SALES TAX ASSESSMENT BILL 1992</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the main Bill in a package of six Bills that will, as part of the simplification of the sales tax law, replace the existing sales tax legislation. It represents a major overhaul by the Government of the existing sales tax law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Overall, the package of Bills will replace the 27 Acts which currently deal exclusively with sales tax. The Sales Tax Assessment Bill 1992 will replace the 11 Assessment Acts, and the Sales Tax Procedure Act, that are necessary to administer the law under its current structure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The main features of the measures are:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.a significant reduction in the number of persons required to pay sales tax;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.a complete restructuring and redrafting of the WST legislation, in plain English, to make it simpler to use and more certain in its application;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.a streamlining of the system for acquiring business inputs and other conditionally exempt goods free of tax; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.a significant strengthening of the anti-avoidance provisions of the law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These changes will complement legislation introduced late last year to expand the range of business inputs which are exempted from tax.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The simplification of the sales tax law will bring substantial benefits both for taxpayers and the Australian Taxation Office which is responsible for administering the tax.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I now turn to the more important changes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">SMALL BUSINESS CONCESSION</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The exemption for small business has been considerably widened so that it will offer to the majority of taxpayers the option of not paying tax. Exemption will now be available to all persons liable to pay sales tax if their liability does not exceed $10,000 per annum. This is a considerable advance on the present concession, which is  mainly limited to manufacturers and has a generally lower threshold. While the concession will be optional&mdash;some small businesses may wish not to take up the concession so that they may continue to acquire their business inputs free from tax&mdash;it is expected that a significant number of small businesses will avail themselves of the concession. This will result in savings to those businesses who will no longer be required to lodge returns and make small tax payments to the Australian Taxation Office. It will also reduce the costs of collecting the tax.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">REGISTRATION AND QUOTATION</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the existing law it is compulsory for persons liable to pay tax to be registered and quote their certificates of registration. This compulsion will be removed by this Bill. Registration of taxpayers will be optional, as will quotation by those who elect to be registered. This will remove the need for penalties for non-registration or for failure to quote a certificate. It will also relieve taxpayers from the threat of penalty in situations where they are not certain whether they should register or quote a certificate. However, because of the general advantages of registration it is expected that most taxpayers who are currently registered for sales tax will remain registered. Moreover, certain exemptions from tax in the area of business inputs will be restricted on purchase to registered persons.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CONDITIONAL EXEMPTION SYSTEM</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will provide a much simpler set of rules for persons who are currently entitled to exemption from sales tax and will continue to be under the new law. Such persons will, in some cases, be able to be registered and simply quote a sales tax registration number to obtain goods tax-free. In other cases they will  quote in a similar fashion to the existing conditional exemption system except that there will be authority for it in the law. This will make quotation for persons entitled to exemption more certain.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new system will, however, impose a liability on any person who provides an incorrect certificate. This is considered appropriate bearing in mind that the person providing the certificate should be aware of the purpose of use of the goods and whether or not exemption applies. The new system will also benefit vendor taxpayers who will no longer have a liability if they accept an incorrect certificate in good faith.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AVOIDANCE OF TAX</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consistent with the Government's policy to stamp out tax avoidance, the Bill will contain a general anti-avoidance provision to catch schemes designed to avoid the payment of sales tax. The general provision will replace a number of provisions that are directed to particular schemes but which do not cover the field of tax avoidance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">GENERAL LIABILITY TO TAX</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The basic aim of the sales tax law is to impose a tax on all goods going into use in Australia for the first time unless they are specifically exempted. There are some gaps in the present law in reaching this aim and the law is to be tightened in certain areas to ensure that all goods that should bear tax do so. This will be achieved by strengthening the provisions relating to royalties and catching certain manufacturing costs that presently fall outside the tax base.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Additionally, a liability will be imposed on the sale or use of goods that ordinarily would be subject to tax but somehow have managed to by-pass a taxing point without payment of tax.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">COMMISSIONER'S DISCRETIONS</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In revising the existing law, a significant number of Commissioner's discretions have been removed with the object of making the law more self-assessing. Commissioner's discretions have been retained only where it is essential for sound administration or to avoid the need for unduly complex law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">GENERAL</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are a number of other changes to the law which will make it easier to follow. The rules relating to leases have been considerably simplified to bring them into line with sales of goods. A number of complex deeming provisions relating to the making-up of goods from materials supplied by a customer have been removed and replaced with a simpler system. There will be new rules for selling goods tax-free to Australian residents intending to travel overseas which will clarify this situation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">SUMMARY</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the new law is a considerable simplification of the existing law there are still some areas which will remain reasonably complex. This is unavoidable with a wholesale tax that is imposed only on goods. However, it is the Government's position that in the field of indirect taxation it favours the present wholesale tax because it enables essential goods such as food and clothing to be exempted from the tax and it leaves important service industries which are vital to the growth of the economy, such as the tourist industry, largely free from tax. It is also much easier to collect, having far fewer collection points than a retail or general consumption tax.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill not only simplifies a relatively complex taxation law but it represents a considerable advance in writing law in a plain English style that can be easily understood by the general public.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the new law will not commence to impose tax until 3 months after it has received the Royal Assent. During this time the existing law will continue to apply.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The delayed introduction will allow the Commissioner of Taxation sufficient time to publicise the changes to the  existing law and to set in place the new arrangements that will be necessary for its administration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Additionally, members of the Simplification Review will be making themselves available during this period to meet with key bodies and taxpayers' representatives to discuss the new law and to identify any concerns with it. The Government is aware that, in a project that has seen the complete restructuring and re-writing of the sales tax law, it is likely that some errors and unintended omissions or changes are unavoidable. These will only emerge after detailed analysis of the new law over an extended period.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, Mr. President, I would particularly draw Honourable Senators attention to the Explanatory Memorandum accompanying these Bills. While all of the changes made by the Bill are explained in detail in that document, the aim of the Simplification Review has not merely been to improve the sales tax law but also to improve the traditional explanatory materials brought forward to explain it. One example of this is the Explanatory Memorandums for these Bills. They have been specially designed, after discussions with representatives of their users, to meet concerns expressed about the structure and short-comings of earlier explanatory memorandums. In particular, the memorandums seek to provide, in a form easily accessed by all users, a detailed explanation of all the changes proposed to the existing law as well as the reasons for those changes. Recent advances in computer technology now enable far more professionally presented and better structured material to be brought forward. Maximum use has been made of this technology by the Review team. I also note that there is a separate Explanatory Memorandum which sets out quite comprehensive tables which identify where provisions of the existing law are dealt with in the new law, and vice versa.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the Bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">SALES TAX IMPOSITION BILLS 1992</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These Bills are part of the package of six Bills that make up the new simplified sales tax law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These three Imposition Bills will have the effect of imposing tax on the assessable dealings that are liable to tax under the Sales Tax Assessment Bill. Three Imposition Bills are necessary because of the requirement of the Constitution that a law imposing taxation shall deal only with one subject of taxation and that laws imposing  customs duty and laws imposing excise duties deal only with those duties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first Imposition Bill will impose tax on relevant dealings to the extent it is a duty of customs; the second Imposition Bill will impose tax on relevant dealings to the extent that it is a duty of excise and the third Imposition Bill will impose tax on relevant dealings to the extent that the tax is neither a duty of customs nor a duty of excise.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend these Bills to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">SALES TAX AMENDMENT (TRANSITIONAL) BILL 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill is part of a package of six Bills that make up the new simplified sales tax law. Its purpose is to provide for the necessary transitional arrangements that are essential to ensure a smooth change over from the existing law to the new law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">More specifically, the Bill will terminate the old law from the day before the first taxing day under the new law. It will provide that in certain situations goods taxed under the existing law will not be taxed under the new law. Where goods can be taxed under both the existing and new law a credit will be available for tax paid under the existing law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will also deal with the position of goods acquired tax-free under quote under the existing law but which are not dealt with in a taxable manner until after the first taxing day of the new law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To reduce the burden on taxpayers who are presently registered for sales tax from applying for fresh registration under the new law, there will be provision for existing registrations to continue. Registered persons will not have to re-apply for registration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A further transitional provision will preserve the operation of the current small business exemptions to ensure that no small business is disadvantaged by the change over to the new law. The Bill also covers other minor transitional arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, in the event that there are some matters not adequately covered by the transitional provisions, there is power for regulations to be made to deal with them. The Government is taking every step to ensure that in the general operation of the sales tax law, no taxpayer will  be disadvantaged as a result of the change over.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The operation of the Bill is explained in more detail in the Explanatory Memorandum circulated with the package of Bills.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the Bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) BILL 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is the second major Bill in a package of six Bills which make up the new simplified sales tax law. This Bill needs to be read together with the other Bills to which it is linked.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Bill will identify those goods which will be exempt from sales tax, either absolutely or in certain circumstances. It will also classify the remaining goods for the purpose of determining the rate of sales tax to be paid on them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will contain guidelines clarifying the circumstances in which exemption may be claimed to make it easier for persons to decide if they are entitled to claim exemption. The Bill will require persons claiming exemption to intend to use the goods in circumstances for a minimum period.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will also require goods generally to be used for more than 50 per cent in exempt circumstances in order for exemption to apply. Other goods will be exempt if they are for use exclusively in a stipulated way. Some goods will be exempt if they are for use to a sufficient extent in a specified way.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There will be a further requirement that, apart from leases, the person who claims the benefit of an exemption will be the person who will have to actually use the goods in the exempt way.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another change which will make the application of the sales tax laws more certain is the use of standard terminology. In the existing law, different terms with similar or overlapping meanings are used to describe similar concepts. In the new law, in keeping with the policy of plain English drafting, key concepts which recur in descriptions of goods will be expressed in uniform or standard terminology each time those particular concepts are referred to.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although the scope of existing exemptions and classifications will be preserved as nearly as possible,  the adoption of standard terminology will result in some small change to some items. These changes are explained in detail in the Explanatory Memorandum circulated with this Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the course of reviewing the existing law some obsolete items have been identified and these have been omitted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new law will make a number of changes to the classification of goods as a result of the simplification review. Some goods which are taxable will now become exempt. These are:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">natural mineral water</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">pallets for transporting or storing goods</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">gases</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">works of art</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some goods which are presently exempt will become taxable. These include:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">plastic and rubber sheeting</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">switch lampholders</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">some sensors and thermostats</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">pet food for dog and cat breeders</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, exemptions have been drafted in simpler language. The structure of the exemption Schedules has been altered so that similar kinds of goods will be grouped together and easier to find.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, there will be some adjustments to the scope of the exemptions for goods for use in business or industry. One of the main changes will be in the presentation of the exemptions. There will now be separate references to each industry or activity covered by the business inputs provisions although the structure of the exemption for each industry will be similar. This will overcome many of the inconsistencies in the existing treatment of different industries. Much of the complexity and duplication within the existing exemptions for `eligible business goods' and `aids to manufacture' will be removed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The last point which should be noted is that some exemptions for business inputs will only be available for registered persons. This will be done to encourage regular users of these exemptions to register and quote a number which is a simpler system than quoting an exemption declaration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An Explanatory Memorandum containing detailed information on this Bill is being made available to Honourable Senators and further details on the changes made by the Bill will be found in that document.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When we adjourned at half past one in the morning last Friday, I was asking Senator Bolkus why there was no correspondence between the Australian Property Group and the Auditor-General. There was merely a conversation that took place concerning the ALP premises; there was merely a conversation that took place between Mr Domonic Collins and someone on the staff of the Auditor-General. The meeting of 28 November was set up and a conversation took place about the physical virtues of the building. A reply was then given on 7 December by the Assistant Auditor-General, Mr Jacobs, saying that his office was pleased to accept the offer of a yet to be named Lend Lease site at Barton. There was a subsequent letter to that on 4 March 1991, referring to the yet to be named Lend Lease site at Barton. In other words, at no time was there any evidence or, indeed, evidence to the contrary that the Auditor-General was ever informed that the proposed site belonged to the Australian Labor Party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, to go back one step further, the material as tabled by Senator Bolkus showed that after the advertisement was placed in the paper there were 14 applicants or 14 expressions of interest. All 14 people were sent the same letter. The initial letter from Lend Lease said that it was representing ALP interests, but the letter that was sent to the Auditor-General on 21 November 1990 outlining those people who had registered an expression of interest involved not the 14 people but only 13. Guess which one was missing&mdash;the Labor Party proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Subsequent to that, the Auditor-General wrote back and said, `We have three options'. That is documented in the letters that were tabled. The Auditor-General expressed a preference for three buildings on the list of 13. Surprise, surprise, out of the blue, there was a phone call from Mr Collins to somebody on the staff of the Auditor-General saying that there was another option. The meeting of the 28th, as I explained a moment ago, was established. He came over and discussed the physical merits of the building. There were no notes taken of that meeting and all the evidence shows that the Audit Office was duped into believing that that site belonged to Lend Lease. It subsequently has found out that it belonged to the Labor Party, but it is all a bit late. The Audit Office needed new premises, it had accepted the offer of these premises, and the lease went ahead. Do we have any legitimate correspondence which the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) can table that in any way shows that, prior to 7 December, the Audit Office knew in any way, shape or form that the Labor Party was the owner of that building?</PARA>

Mr Collins advised that, as far as he could recall, ANAO would not have been made aware that the ALP was the owner of the proposed building until about March 1991. ANAO was not advised of the availability of the proposal immediately following the closing of the expressions of interest&mdash;that is, Mr Collins's briefing of 21 November 1990&mdash;as the Industry Commission had a spatial requirement for premises of approximately this size and Mr Collins was attempting to avoid a Dutch auction by potential tenants.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer to the Australia Council's reply to a question that I raised about the extent to which it had funded its own programs at the expense of other programs relating to arts bodies. The suggestion was made that over the past five years there has been a fall in the funding by the Australia Council of its own programs, quite apart from increases in its administration costs. The concern that I had was that in the latest year there had been an 11.8 per cent increase in funding to the Australia Council's own programs while funding to other programs was being reduced. From the printed reply I got to my question on notice, I noticed going back to 1987-88 a substantial rise&mdash;something like 58 per cent&mdash;in the expenditure by the Australia Council on its own programs while expenditure on programs of arts organisations had fallen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The interesting thing is that if we go back one further year we find that payments of $2.1m were made in 1986-87 compared with $2.02m in 1990-91. In other words, the figure for the latest year is lower than the figure for five years ago but represents a steady increase over the last four years. I am interested in knowing why the figure in the 1986-87 year was so large&mdash;$2.1m&mdash;and why it fell to $1.28m in 1987-88. Obviously, that was some kind of exceptional year. I need that information to know whether the criticism that lots of arts groups have been making about the Australia Council being tough on them but fairly lenient on itself, as this clearly rising trend over the last four years indicates, is in fact a reasonable criticism. While the Minister is seeking guidance, perhaps I can continue. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator MICHAEL BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps I could go on with a general point which will not need a response. The reason this question of Australia Council cuts in funding to arts groups is so important is that the Government has been running a totally false campaign alleging that the coalition seeks to cut arts funding through the Australia Council. The Minister has gone on record saying so and it is simply totally false. In the Fightback documents there is a clear and unequivocal undertaking that there will be no reduction whatsoever in arts grants that are based on arts criteria through the Australia Council. So arts organisations which may have been wrongly led to believe through a dishonest campaign by this Government that they will face cuts in funding should be confident in the fact that we have given this total commitment and undertaking. Despite that undertaking that there will be no arts cuts that are based on arts criteria, we have had organisations such as Arts Action running in their little newsletters totally misleading and mischievous reports that there will be something like a $43m cut in arts funding under a coalition government. It simply is not true.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is evident is that there has been a squeeze because of the combination of increased spending by the Australia Council on its own programs and a restraint, involving a fairly constant level in real terms, in expenditure on the arts by the Government. That has meant that many other areas, such as the performing arts, have suffered some kind of downturn. If we look at the latest year, we see that funding for one program has gone down from $5.4m to $5.1m. Funding for another program has gone down from $32.9m to $28.1m, and so on. So there has been a series of significant falls in allocations to various art forms while over the last four years there has been this significant increase in funding of the Australia Council's own programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What concerned me was that a lot of these programs seemed to have a fairly peripheral involvement with the arts. There may be some merit in having some talkathons and all sorts of other gatherings which no doubt excite people. Perhaps I am being unreasonable in saying that gatherings of intellectuals may be very useful and perhaps I am cross because I am obviously not classified as an intellectual and so I did not go. Remarkably, I got an invitation which, I regret to say, I did not see. These gatherings, these talkfests, may be useful, but I am certain that if the arts organisations were asked whether they would prefer the Australia Council to actually give them the money so that they could run their arts programs or have talkathons run by the Australia Council, the universal view would be, `For heaven's sake, let the Australia Council cut down its own programs and let more arts money actually go to the arts'. </PARA>

I cannot allow his comments about Fightback and the arts to go uncommented upon, although I certainly do not intend to provoke a debate about it; I know that you, Mr Chairman, would not let me anyway. The arts groups are understandably concerned about the impact of the GST upon their performance, their operations, in a variety of ways; but that is a matter for debate on another day. I feel it is appropriate to put that on the record. I cannot provide Senator Baume with the detail about the 1986-87 and 1987-88 changes.

Many of them are widely regarded as providing very worthwhile assistance to artists and the arts. Nevertheless, so as not to waste the time of the Committee, I accept that there is legitimate interest in the variation to which Senator Baume refers.

As the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan) was the first person to mention the GST and its impact on the arts, I should tell him, if he wants some concerns in the arts about tax and its impact on the arts, that maybe he should discuss with arts people the consequence of the proposed changes in the sales tax situation. I am surprised that the Parliamentary Secretary would not have noted that sales tax has an enormous and severe impact on the arts, particularly if the recent judgment in relation to the making of stage props is set aside. I remind the Parliamentary Secretary that overall the GST and the Fightback package bring significant benefits to the arts. I will leave it at that.

The response I received to the questions I put on notice concerning the time that the Mitchell repository has been empty is a matter of some concern. As I understand it, the National Film and Sound Archive did not occupy the building until late last year, even though it became available back in 1985. It was occupied by the Department of Aviation until February 1988. Apparently the total amount of rent paid over that period for a building which was not used was something like half a million dollars.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I asked what had gone wrong. As I understand it, the reply says that there were union concerns about occupational health and safety issues which took until December 1991 to resolve and the building was then occupied. I must say it is extraordinary that there can be delays of years in this sort of thing. The response by the Archive was that after the end of the occupation of the building in February 1988 the complex fit-out and shelving work took until May 1989 to complete. The problems included dispute and litigation between the fit-out contractor and the shelving contractor, damage to shelving on installation, difficulties in achieving the strict humidity controls and temperature requirements, and the need for rectification of insulation panels. In addition, there was repairing damage, disputes about occupational health and safety, and so on. There has been an extraordinary waste of half a million dollars in rent for a place that was not occupied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I asked how much it would have cost to build a special purpose repository with the same sort of capacity, recognising that something like $3.16m had to be spent in fitting out this building.

It would have cost only $1.1m to buy a repository on which we have spent $3.2m and which the Archive has been unable to occupy for all that time. We have wasted half a million dollars on dead rent.

I did that against the background of the unfair and inequitable distribution of this money as between the States. The situation is quite disconcerting. I pointed out the discriminatory nature of the formula proposed. The formula for the disbursement of those funds was on a per capita basis for the States and Territories, which is quite inequitable. For example, Queensland has only 510 heritage buildings&mdash;less than half of Tasmania's 1,101&mdash;yet under the proposed formula for the disbursement of the $20m, Queensland will receive approximately $3.4m compared with Tasmania, which will receive $520,000, or almost six times the funding for less than half the number of buildings.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make a brief point. Has the Government considered the strong case put by disabled sports people for a reallocation of funding for international sport, particularly in terms of their participation in events such as the Paralympics? There is no doubt that the outstanding achievements of disabled Australian sports people overseas seem to be significantly disproportionate, to the advantage of disabled sports people, to those of able bodied Australian sports people overseas. This was evident, for example, in the winter Olympics where Australian skiers, unfortunately, did not do very well, whereas the disabled skiers did outstandingly well. I think the first gold medal won by any Australian skier in any major international races of this kind was won at the recent disabled skiing Olympics which followed the normal Olympics.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Disabled sports people get very little money. They still require a large amount of funding for travel and sustenance. These people may well be in a situation which is less conducive to their being able to raise adequate money themselves to fund such programs. I understand that the Government obviously has limits on all of its funding. I am not stressing the need for increased funding for sport at a time of financial restraint. After all, there have been enormous increases in funding of sport in recent years. It seems to me that there is an unfair concentration away from disabled sports people and I wonder whether the Government has addressed that problem. </PARA>

The summer Paralympic training camp will be held at the AIS soon, before the athletes leave, at an additional cost of $100,000, to be borne by the Government.

I would not mind if it came out of the disgraceful political stunt which emerged out of the office of the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories (Mrs Kelly).

Using sport as this kind of pork barrel is unacceptable. If the $5m which is to go to the Sydney Olympic bid is to come from that disgraceful pork barrel, I would be overjoyed; it would be a much better way to use sporting money, but I do not think it should come from other allocations to sporting people.

We then have Vinnicombe who, on a technicality, gets away with half of his proposed sentence even though he admitted that he took the drug and the tests showed that he had taken the drug. Had that test been taken in Australia and had exactly the same results as those taken overseas been registered, he would not have wriggled out of the penalty that was properly imposed on him and which I must say I regret to see he managed to escape on legal grounds.</PARA></TALK.START>

The Amateur Cycling Federation, I am advised, has not applied for any government assistance for its legal costs, so that problem with regard to it has not arisen yet. As to the case being taken by Mr Vinnicombe against the Sports Drug Agency, I am advised that the Agency certainly is not seeking in any way to settle this matter out of court. In fact, it is optimistic that it can win in this case. It is not a matter I know about in detail, but my advice is that, far from any intention to settle out of court, it is quite determined to continue and persist. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is one other matter that concerns me. It is excluded from the proposed amendments&mdash;the third bite at the ASDA legislation cherry. There appears to be no capacity for a confession by an athlete of having taken drugs to carry the same weight as a finding by the Australian Sports Drug Agency. We had Vinnicombe in this situation confessing that he had taken performance enhancing drugs&mdash;after he had been found out, of course. He did not volunteer it until he was found out.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is necessary to distinguish between the role of the Sports Drug Agency and the role of the relevant national sporting organisations or the Australian Sports Commission. It is not for the Sports Drug Agency to decide that somebody is guilty. Its job is to conduct tests; and I understand that it also has a parallel educational function. In so far as its testing function is concerned, the Agency relies on the empirical evidence of tests conducted by laboratories which have IOC accreditation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Agency does not take a position on the guilt or otherwise of the individual athlete. This is a matter for the national sporting association or the ASC, if Commonwealth funding is involved. I am sure that the relevant national sporting organisation would unquestionably be interested in such admissions by athletes. I understand that the AOC has amended its doping policy to recognise such admissions as a prima facie case for investigating a banned doping practice, and the Australian Sports Commission intends to make a similar amendment to its policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the policies of national sporting organisations must accord with those of the Commission, national sporting organisations will be required also to include similar provisions in their doping policies. It is proper for admissions by athletes to be dealt with by those organisations which are concerned with the issue of guilt and application of appropriate sanctions. This is not the ASDA's role. So the Government is not taking any action about it through ASDA or through that Act, but the appropriate action has been taken through the appropriate body, which is the Sports Commission. </PARA>

I was not quite certain, because of the particular choice of language there. It said that it would be a practice worthy of investigation. That is not what I am after. I am after a confession of drug taking carrying the same force as a positive drug test. In the Vinnicombe case, he admitted to having taken drugs, once having been caught out. It would seem to me vital that there be an unequivocal and clear statement from the Australian Sports Commission that organisations that receive government support and funding must act on people who are `guilty' of taking performance enhancing drugs as a result of either test or admission.</PARA></TALK.START>

It may be that one could subsequently come back and say&mdash;and I am not trying to make light of this; I am trying to envisage the only circumstance in which this might arise; and one must realise that admissions, in some legal circumstances, can be challengeable depending on the circumstances in which they were obtained&mdash;`I provided this admission under X, Y and Z circumstance which indicates that it should be disregarded and I withdraw the admission'.

I think Senator McMullan said that the Australian Amateur Cycling Federation has not requested funding.

I do not know the name of the body, but I am advised that the professional cycling association has made an application and, although it has not yet been officially approved, I understand that decisions have been made which mean that it will be approved. The Attorney-General's Department, or whichever body it is that makes the decision, has indicated that that will be the decision.

I was not as concerned about it as I was about the amateurs but there is no doubt that one of the professional bodies&mdash;I think it was the League of Wheelmen&mdash;did feel under great pressure to enter that mediation because there was no assurance that, if it stood up for what it knew was right, it would receive any support or have any access to legal backing. This is one of the real problems that we face: unless there is some kind of undertaking about legal support, there is a real risk of people being prepared to enter into this sort of mediation because the consequences of not settling are financially disastrous, even to professional sporting bodies. This seems to me to be quite untenable.

I am not sure whether the AFP would be in a position to disclose that. I do not have any knowledge about that and it is not a matter we can pursue any further here.

I certainly raised the question, recorded on page 89 of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, which sought information with regard to the number of students in schools. Subsequently, a very detailed answer was given. It was listed as an unanswered question, which allows it now to be raised.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The detailed statistical information that was provided in the information to the question related, firstly, to Christmas Island, where it listed the total number of residents on the island as 1,291. It then listed the employed, the unemployed and the number of children. Specifically, with regard to children attending school, it listed 353 children and broke them up between their preschool, primary school and secondary school numbers of 51, 250 and 52 respectively. With regard to the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, the supplementary information given related to the schools on Home Island, West Island and those children that obviously attended education facilities on the mainland and provided a break-up of 179 children. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, the Minister for Finance. I suppose when he said `Minister' I thought `Department' as well. Is it a fact that the Department of Finance recently knocked back an application to lease a property in Mort Street in the city? Senator McMullan can correct me if I am wrong, but I understand that the rental escalation was to be 6 or 7 per cent per annum and that it was to be leased on behalf of DEET. The view was that the figure of 6 to 7 per cent escalation for the property in Mort Street was most optimistic in the current climate.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am asking the question because of the correlation that exists between the documents just tabled with respect to the lease. I think it is worth commenting on one of those. The lease agreement was signed this year, yet the escalation applies from 1 January 1991&mdash;nearly 18 months ago&mdash;at a rate of 10.5 per cent per annum until completion. This seems to be an extraordinarily high figure. Why was it backdated&mdash;certainly 12 months from the date of signature of the lease&mdash;to 1 January 1991? What was the justification for the extraordinarily high figure of 10.5 per cent? Does this fit the norm of agreements entered into between the Commonwealth Government and private owners?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have another question relating to the ongoing escalation of 9 per cent per annum from the date of occupation for a period of 10 years, with an option for another five; then at the option of the lessor&mdash;not of the lessor and/or the lessee&mdash;to review the rental to market; and that, having come to the determination, the actual rental paid will be the original rental as agreed, escalated, or the market, whichever is the higher. This seems to be a one-way street. I understand that since this agreement has been reached, the base rental, instead of being $280 per square metre, is more in the order, when we add the costs and outgoings, of $350 per square metre, which is approximately $70 more. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My advice is that the process of setting an agreed commencement date and negotiating an escalator clause related to judgments about a market for commercial property in the area in question is a standard procedure that applied on this occasion as on others. I do not have anything to add. As I am advised, there is nothing extraordinary about that.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Owing to the complexity of the great copious documents that Senator McMullan has made available to us today and which, quite frankly, he indicated at 1.30 in the morning last Thursday he had in his possession and was ready to table, I really think it would have been reasonable for Senator McMullan to have made them available for people to at least have a look at in the interim. I have got as far as reading all the correspondence to 21 June 1991 and still there is not a single solitary message about, or mention of, the fact that the Labor Party is in fact to be the developer of this site and indeed the landlord. I ask Senator McMullan right at the outset: will the Australian Labor Party have its headquarters in that building which will also house the Australian National Audit Office?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SE4">Senator BISHOP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The 27 May 1991. We will run through the chronology of this in just a moment. He went on to say:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the first place, it is now proposed to draw all areas of the ANAO at one building at Section 22, Barton. This building will provide an area of approximately 6,000 square metres, which represents a reduction of some 1,400 square metres of total office space held by the ANAO in Medibank House . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The letter then goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the same time, the ANAO will be sole tenants of the new building and having co-located, could expect to have resolved accommodation concerns well into the future.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the Australian National Audit Office by 27 May 1991 not only did not know that the Australian Labor Party was the landlord, but thought that it was going to be in the building all by itself. Indeed, the Public Accounts Committee in its report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Auditor General: Ally of the People and Parliament</EMPHASIS>  recommended that it should be in a building of its own and that it should be called Audit House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, I have been through the copious stuff that Senator McMullan has tabled this evening. Right up until 21 June the building was being referred to as section 22 in Barton, having been referred all the way through up until that description as the yet-to-be-named Lend Lease site at Barton opposite the National Press Club. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I see from these documents&mdash;some of which are expurgated, I must say; I do not know what has been left out&mdash;that on 2 May 1991, Mr Ian McPhee, the First Assistant Secretary, Financial Management Division, of the Department of Finance, wrote to the Auditor-General at the National Audit Office a letter of some 2 1/2 pages which, quite frankly, shows that the Department was not keen on the proposal for the Audit Office to move into these new premises. He concluded by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In light of these likely changes in works processes&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and he outlines a whole list of reasons as to why the Department is not keen&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">if you wish to proceed with the option of seeking a relocation of accommodation which cannot be accommodated within the proposed new arrangements, you would need to address the matter as a New Policy Proposal addressing the essential and unavoidable criteria and providing costing information (including the clarification sought above).</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Jacobs wrote back to the Secretary of the Department of Finance talking about the proposed site&mdash;as I said earlier, when reading from that letter of 27 May, the Audit Office thought it was going to be the sole occupant&mdash;and said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I now seek, urgently, your agreement in principal to the location of the ANAO to the new building at Section 22 in Barton.</PARA>
<PARA>On 11 June, Mr J. Meert, Executive Director of the Executive Support Branch&mdash;I am not quite sure what it is the executive support branch of&mdash;wrote to the Department of Finance setting out the various offices the Australian National Audit Office has in Canberra, Sydney and Brisbane, and giving a summary. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The move to Section 22 in Barton is seen as essential for operational reasons and is cost effective in the long-term. The change in Sydney's accommodation is unavoidable because the lease cannot be renegotiated. It is also cost effective in the long-term. In Brisbane, the relocation to Adelaide Street is seen as being cost effective once operational considerations are taken into account.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your urgent support of this proposal would be very much appreciated.</PARA>
<PARA>The Property Group wrote back to the Auditor-General on 21 June, this time referring to the site:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further to the recent presentation and discussions with Lend Lease and the joint venture developers of the office building in Barton in which you have an interest in occupying, I seek your agreement to proceed with negotiations on your behalf.</PARA>
<PARA>There was another interesting letter, dated 4 July, again from the Australian Property Group to the Auditor-General, helping the Auditor-General to meet some of the criticisms of the Department of Finance. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to our discussions this morning concerning the Department of Finance not supporting your move to Section 22, Barton.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Listed below are some points you should keep in mind when discussing the possible relocation of the Australian National Audit Office to Barton.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, this documentation shows the following: the Auditor-General was keen to move out of what he calls `refugee premises'; the Australian Property Group placed an advertisement in the newspaper asking for registered expressions of interest for rental premises; the Australian Property Group received 14 expressions of interest; the Australian Property Group was well aware that the site opposite the National Press Club was owned by the ALP; the Australian Property Group sent only 13 of the 14 expressions of interest on to the Auditor-General, omitting&mdash;surprise, surprise!&mdash;the ALP expression of interest. That was on 21 November 1990. The Auditor-General wrote back, saying, `We have examined what you have sent to us. Here are our three options that we are happy with'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A mysterious phone call emanated from Domonic Collins to a member of staff from the Australian National Audit Office in which he said: `There is another option. I would like to come and talk to you about it'. A meeting was scheduled for 29 November 1990. The people to whom I have spoken, who were actual participants on that occasion, have told me that there is no recollection of the ALP's ever being mentioned, there were no notes taken, there are no minutes and there are no records of that discussion, except the recollection that this person, Domonic Collins, described the physical attributes of the building. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 7 December, the Acting Auditor-General, Mr Jacobs, wrote to the Australian Property Group, saying that the Australian Audit Office was keen to have the yet-to-be-named Lend Lease site at Barton opposite the National Press Club. On 4 March 1991, the Acting Auditor-General again wrote to the Australian Property Group saying that the yet-to-be-named Lend Lease site at Barton was an acceptable premises. There was no mention of the ALP. All through the correspondence, up to and including 4 July 1991, there is no mention of the Australian Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My information is that at whatever time the Australian National Audit Office became aware of the fact that the Australian Labor Party was involved, the Auditor-General proceeded to take every precaution to ensure that there was separate egress and access in order to be totally separated from the Australian Labor Party. In other words, there was every indication that the Audit Office was not happy. Whether or not it was, I make it quite clear, as do an enormous number of people who have contacted my office since I raised the matter, that it is totally inappropriate for the Australian National Audit Office&mdash;which, like Caesar's wife, must be above suspicion&mdash;to be the tenant of a political party. I hope that it would have rejected the Liberal Party's submission out of hand too, because that was a political party's submission. When we discussed this matter last week I drew attention to the Australian Labor Party in particular as being a bad landlord but added that the principle remained constant for whatever political party was involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also concerned to know what conditions in the agreement to lease have yet to be fulfilled, because I gather in the very short time that I have had to quickly flick through it that there is provision for the agreement to be terminated. It depends on various conditions not being fulfilled by the lessor. I want to know what conditions are not fulfilled. I want to know what the date of this document is and who has signed it for and on behalf of the parties to the agreement. I beg your pardon; I have found the date; it is 23 April 1992. My particular concern is to know the following:  what conditions are set out; what conditions have been fulfilled; what conditions remain unfulfilled; whether the agreement could be breached; and what penalty would have to be paid to the Australian Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have already heard my colleague Senator Parer and others in this place say that the 9 per cent annual increment is outrageous. We are in a position now where inflation is at an all-time low.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To say it is a national disgrace and to say that there are many Australians who are just as concerned as we are about this matter, would be not to overstate it.

I find that desperation a little disappointing. From some time in March 1991 until February 1992, in the correspondence that the Department of Finance has entered into with the Australian National Audit Office and the Australian Property Group there is no mention of the Australian Labor Party.

I have to say that that stretches the bounds of credibility beyond any reasonable standard.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator McMullan is great at putting a spin on things. So that we get it straight, the fact of the matter is this: nobody is saying that it was Lend Lease which tried to camouflage the ALP, because Lend Lease wrote to the Australian Property Group and disclosed, right at first instance, that the ALP was its client and the owner of the development. When I finish I will ask this question very specifically through you, Mr Chairman: why did the Australian Property Group leave the ALP expression of interest off the list that was sent to the Australian National Audit Office?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we go back to the facts and the spin that Senator McMullan puts on them, the allegation is that the Australian National Audit Office was kept in the dark right up until March 1991 as to who was the true landlord. The Department of Finance was kept in the dark right up until 3 February 1992. The Parliamentary Secretary can answer if he likes, if he purports to have an answer, as to why that was so. If this was so open and so up and down, firstly, why did the Australian Property Group not let the Australian National Audit Office know right at first instance that the Labor Party had registered an expression of interest and, secondly, why did the APG do it by a secret method, if you like, not putting the ALP on the list, as the expressions of interest were all received, despite the fact that every applicant or every company that registered its expression of interest received the same letter? It was deliberately left off, added in later. At no stage in any of the correspondence is the Labor Party mentioned until the Government had it on the hook and it knew if it did not take that proposition it was not going to get a building at all. The Department of Finance made it quite clear that it was not keen on the move. It was kept in the dark that it was the Australian Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> At what stage, further from the documentation, can Senator McMullan show me that the Department of Finance agreed to allow the Australian National Audit Office to enter into an agreement which would have been considered binding, at least morally binding if not legally binding? At what stage did the Department of Finance feel that the agreement had been struck, that is, prior to its knowing that it was the Labor Party that it was dealing with? Those are two very specific questions for the Parliamentary Secretary to answer. Why was the Labor Party submission left off the initial list sent to the Audit Office on 21 November 1990? Why was reference to the Australian Labor Party left out of all correspondence? Precisely at what time and how did the Department of Finance find out it was the Australian Labor Party? Had authority to the Australian National Audit Office already been given to enter into a contract for an agreement to lease?</PARA>

This was a plant&mdash;probably by the aNiMaLS&mdash;because I received a letter from the Auditor-General by fax within 24 hours advising me that in no way did he feel slighted by the fact that I had raised the matter and that he hoped that out of it would come more commercial rental for the Australian National Audit Office.

The Government has put one of its major departments into premises owned by the ALP under terms and conditions which are very bankable. The ALP has been able to take a document signed by the Government to the bank and say, `Here is a 15-year lease'. It has a $1.68m base rental plus all outgoings, making it approximately $1.8m per year, plus 10.5 per cent retrospective to 1 January 1991, and then, from the date of occupation, at 9 per cent per annum for the next 15 years.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In speaking on 27 May, Senator Chamarette accused Perth broadcaster Howard Sattler, and the radio station for which he works, Radio 6PR, of promoting racism and tabling a document that called, in effect, for the political censorship of Mr Sattler. He was accused of having referred to the deaths of three young Aboriginal car thieves as `good riddance to bad rubbish', when it is a fact&mdash;and Senator Chamarette knows it to be a fact&mdash;that he made this statement without knowing the racial origin of the three youths. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Chamarette, on radio on Friday, 29 May, had to admit this fact as well as her lack of knowledge of several positive initiatives that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sattler File</EMPHASIS>, which is the name of Mr Sattler's program, has taken in regard to Aboriginals. She did not know that his program had publicised the cause of a disabled Aboriginal who had been denied funding for a necessary overseas trip or that the brother of an Aboriginal man in Broome who was the victim of a racist murder had been given air time. She did not know that Howard Sattler had sought to publicise the case of the tragic and disgraceful story of Louis Johnson, to which she referred in the Senate, by seeking to interview his family&mdash;an opportunity which they chose not to exercise. That is their freedom; that is their right. But it is certainly not Senator Chamarette's right to come in here and slam Mr Sattler in the way in which she did. Mr Sattler had also strongly criticised the apparent lack of satisfactory or appropriate action by ambulance officers in this same case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Chamarette was not aware of the efforts of the station to provide education to a young Aboriginal footballer and its granting journalism cadetships to three young Aboriginal trainees. All that Senator Chamarette could say was, `I personally don't listen to your program', and that she had chosen not to listen to the program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not just a matter of unfair criticism being made under privilege, serious and all as that is; what is far more sinister is an obvious attempt by the Murdoch University Centre for Research in Culture and Communication and so-called progressive thinkers to drive Howard Sattler from the airwaves and to censor and suppress the views that he promotes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A serious campaign has been launched to influence and intimidate advertisers on 6PR in order to force the station to change its editorial policy. A 69-page report is being sent to advertisers in order to convince them that they should withdraw their custom or presumably face the same kind of vilification that is now being directed against the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sattler File</EMPHASIS>. They are told that they are not good corporate citizens and that Aboriginal organisations and communities in receipt of government funding will boycott the sponsors of the program. This is blackmail. While individuals can always exercise such a choice, I regard it as sinister that government funds and government agencies are blatantly advocated as being tools in such a boycott. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also pertinent to ask how much public money has been consumed in this exercise in political censorship, in the production of this report and its extensive circulation. Who paid the researcher time? Who paid for the production and distribution of the report? Taxpayers have an assumed duty to subsidise `politically correct' propaganda. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The paper by Steve Mickler, which was tabled by Senator Chamarette, is not only an example of a slanted accusation of racism, whereby populist anger against criminals is falsely equated with continuing genocidal pressure against Aboriginal people; it is also an example of how that despicable American doctrine of `political correctness', whereby the values of the left wing intelligentsia are imposed without hindrance, is to be foisted on the Australian media. When it is recommended that the Western Australian Government use its control of the Totalisator Agency Board to enforce what, in the view of the writer, is a non-racist, non-discriminatory policy, we have a crude demand for political censorship. I am absolutely and utterly astonished that Senator Chamarette wishes to be associated with that form of censorship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, the ABT is called upon to institute censorship by regulating program structures and editorial practices that allegedly amount to gratuitous vilification. Advertisers are threatened for complicity with a station with a reputation for racism. There is an unspoken but obvious premise that tough-minded comments about juvenile crime are racist because so many of the perpetrators of these crimes are Aboriginals and that the suppression of racism as an all-encompassing and heinous offence takes precedence over such archaic notions as freedom of speech or allowing the Western Australian public to exercise their free choice by voting with their radio dials. I regard these premises as intellectually contemptible and highly dangerous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A racist is a person who propagates the view that other human beings are inferior because of their racial characteristics and should suffer discrimination. A racist is not a person who criticises other Australians, fairly or unfairly, for their actions or who attacks government policies seen as favouring a particular group. I would have thought that Senator Chamarette would have understood these facts. It is a gross misuse of the term to apply it to anyone who dissents from the `politically correct' line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is so obvious why Howard Sattler has attracted the wrath of these people. He is a populist who has taken a strong line on crime and has given voice to the understandable and legitimate fears and concerns of a large number of Western Australians. His real crime is not to have attacked Aboriginals, but to have expressed deep seated anger against car thieves who cause the deaths of innocent people, with the result that a State Labor government bowed to public opinion and instituted tougher legislation. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TH4">Senator KNOWLES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Baume is quite correct. It is admitted that the Federal Executive of the Australian Journalists Association found that its rules had not been violated by these comments on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sattler File</EMPHASIS> but, in Senator Chamarette's eyes, he remains guilty of expressing politically incorrect views. Clearly, according to Senator Chamarette, any broadcaster who questions the validity of Aboriginal sacred sites or sides with the mining industry in public debate must be silenced.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Howard Sattler is not necessarily a political conservative. He is a vociferous republican and he never hesitates to castigate the Liberal and National parties over issues and personalities. These are his views and he is entitled to promote them. We can disagree with him and we can criticise his style, while always defending his right to express political opinions. He is described as rude and overbearing in the long report being circulated to 6PR advertisers. If that were to be so, so what?  When has total objectivity hitherto being demanded from talkback radio? This, surely, is a description that can be applied to many Australian broadcasters, including his 6PR colleague, Robert Maumill. Has Senator Chamarette tried to silence him? No, she has not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One would think that in a democratic society those who object to the style would ignore the program and perhaps the ratings would suffer. If the numbers that Senator Chamarette alleges are so large, on this basis alone Mr Sattler would have been taken off air years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The quoted `victim' of Mr Sattler's bias, Rob Riley of the Aboriginal Legal Service, is certainly no stranger to the cut and thrust of public debate and has no trouble in finding a media voice when he needs it. According to the report, it seems to be an offence for Howard Sattler to have a listening audience of middle aged and elderly people who supposedly have an exaggerated fear of crime. I know a lot of people who listen to the program, and I am certain that they would not like to consider themselves either middle aged or elderly. But so what, if that is the majority of the audience? Obviously, those who seek to impose a politically correct agenda do not believe that these people are entitled to a voice&mdash;certainly not one that is listened to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would add that it is an insult to listeners and callers to allege that Howard Sattler has manufactured public opinion, with the implication that their views, therefore, have no validity, as being sectional and prejudiced. Such adjectives could equally be applied to the other side of the debate, particularly to this grubby document to which I refer. It is a measure of the venom and bias of this report that Mr Sattler is castigated by Senator Chamarette for emphasising the fact that the rally against sterner State legislation on juvenile offenders attracted 400 people as against 30,000 who attended an earlier rally calling for higher penalties, or 12,000 who attended a candlelight vigil for the innocent victims of crime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wonder what the authors and sponsors of this report, and the campaign to remove Howard Sattler from the airwaves, hope to achieve in the long run. There is no place for any broadcaster to incite racial violence, but Howard Sattler has faced no such charges. We have a legal system that will curb any such action. The view that Mr Sattler and his callers express may be regarded as offensive by some, but it is a view that is entitled to be expressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a Western Australian senator, I remain conscious that only three years ago there was a campaign of racial violence and the most vicious propaganda unleashed in Perth by the Australian Nationalist Movement, whose leading lights are now in gaol. That is the kind of true racism that should concern us. Mr Sattler regularly spoke out very strongly against these real racists. Did we hear a squeak from these very same people who are now yelling today? No, we did not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nothing better wins support and credibility for the real racists than censorship of the hard-nosed, populist but essentially responsible views expressed by Howard Sattler and many of his callers. Nothing will create public resentment faster than Senator Chamarette's call for the broadcasters to be silenced because Australia has signed human rights treaties. Whatever happened to the right of freedom of speech? Would Senator Chamarette like to see that go altogether, except for her parliamentary privilege? I suppose she would. Nothing is more calculated to drive people with a genuine fear of crime and concern as to inappropriate treatment of Aboriginals to political extremes than the type of censorship advocated in this report and promoted by Senator Chamarette. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Muzzle the social democrat and learn to deal with the Marxist revolutionary. Silence the populist and ultimately we will be hearing from the fascists. Is that what we want for Australia? It is certainly not the type of Australia I want. If the new political correctness is allowed to enforce its own terms of radical debate on the popular media, it will not stop there. We can look forward to the censorship within our universities of academics such as Geoffrey Blainey, who from scholarship and conviction opposed the received wisdom of the political Left. It will become impossible to have a rational debate about crime or policy towards Aboriginals without fear of intimidation&mdash;infinitely more pervasive than anything alleged against Mr Sattler. Genuine fears will be driven underground and Aboriginal Australians will attract a far greater resentment from the wider community than ever could be aroused by a radio program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to question the assumption that Steve Mickler and his ilk necessarily speak for Aboriginal Australians, many of whom want effective action against crime and are not interested in the Western Australian Aboriginal Media Association, are not anxious to use sacred sites to stop development, and do not accept the constant propaganda that they are victims of colonialism and white society. Indeed, there is no worse denigration of Aboriginal Australians than this constant ascribing of victim status so that they become diminished moral beings who must be constantly excused all responsibility for their own actions. After the interview with Senator Chamarette last Friday, one of the first of many callers who rang 6PR to voice support for Howard Sattler was Aboriginal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will keep on fighting to make sure that Australia remains a democracy where controversial opinions can be expressed without intimidation from the agencies of government. If my fellow Western Australians disagree with Howard Sattler and dislike his programs, they remain free to tune in elsewhere, like Senator Chamarette. I hope that Senator Chamarette will try to inform herself more thoroughly before she comes into the Senate and makes the sort of outrageous statements she made last week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notified Senator Chamarette's office this evening that I was going to make these comments. I do not know whether she has gone home or has chosen not to come into the chamber tonight. I certainly hope that she will seek to make a formal apology in the Senate to both radio 6PR and to Howard Sattler. I know that my fellow Western Australians who disagree with Senator Chamarette would have the decency to refrain from bucketing Howard Sattler on biased second-hand evidence. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I moved a motion earlier today concerning the increasingly desperate position of farmers in western New South Wales. The announcement on the weekend that 59 per cent of the State is in drought has brought on the latest crisis. Drought has been a part of some farmers lives for the past two or more years. As everyone in this chamber knows, droughts are dreadful things. For those who live in cities, drought might affect only a social or sporting event. It might mean a slight drop in shoppers for a shopkeeper&mdash;but nothing too serious.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Drought is the most devastating thing one could imagine for farmers. Of course, one never knows how long it will last. Invariably, one moves into drought ready for short term measures&mdash;hand feeding and conserving water. The next step is usually to cut back on the numbers of stock. The farmer has to guesstimate how many and what type. If he sells in the down market and it rains the next week, he will lose a lot of money; if he does not de-stock and it does not rain, his situation becomes even more critical. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He might decide to take a gamble on sowing a crop without the necessary moisture in the soil for germination, hoping that rain will come to kick it off. The alternative to not planting a crop is no crop, and definitely no chance of income at the end of the season. For those in the western districts of New South Wales there are few options and choices when the rain does not come. Numbers are cut back, ewes are not joined and some stock is sent away on agistment. Then it is pretty much a case of sitting it out and hoping the break comes before the feed reserves or the money run out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Drought affects good and bad farmers and there is often no great difference between how each survives. For people to suggest that good farmers can predict drought and can manage it easily just highlights the ignorance of those who make such statements. The definition of drought as compared with merely a dry spell has exercised the minds of the Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs for a while. Certainly, good farmers ought to be prepared for the regular dry spells which afflict much of this country, but the prolonged drought cannot be budgeted for and farmers cannot be realistically expected to battle it out on their own. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remain concerned that the Federal Government is stalling on the question of a national drought strategy. I remain concerned that it is trying to opt out of its responsibilities in this regard. I do not believe that farmers&mdash;especially in the western districts&mdash;can afford to carry on for much longer without knowing how much help they can expect from the Government, State or Federal. It is impossible for these farmers to make any forward plans because they do not know whether they ought to be selling their stock, sending them away on feed, selling the farm or just giving up and walking away from their debts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot begin to understand the emotional strain that this must place on families, yet they survive, largely, better than city families in meeting crisis. I make that comment not from my own bias, but from a Coopers and Lybrand study which shows that in rural areas more people remain married, and families are more stable, despite the fact that the stresses on rural families are greater. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government needs to become aware that there is a serious revolution going on in rural Australia. Small towns are shrinking and disappearing. Rural areas are becoming more regionalised. Some towns with ageing populations are becoming ghost towns with no income generated to sustain them. There is little or no work force as such. Young people are abandoning these towns and moving to regional cities in the hope of getting better employment prospects. That has serious implications for the future for the provision of education, health and welfare services, and for the infrastructure to sustain those activities. It also has serious implications for the standards of education for rural dwellers, for service industries, banks, machinery and seed dealers, mechanics, transport and all the public services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has serious implications for the future of the family farm&mdash;how it will operate, who will service it and who will want to do it. More than ever, farmers today are terrified to encourage their children into farming because of its uncertainties and its difficulties. Many see no future for the family farm, notwithstanding the obvious benefits of a rural family lifestyle&mdash;the family values, the quality of life and the statistics that show that rural marriages are more stable than city relationships. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All this is happening now in New South Wales. It has the potential to accelerate in the western areas of the State where drought is just one of the mountain of problems facing the people in those areas. The Government can do little about the weather, it has shown that it can do little about the price of wool, but it can do a lot more about what assistance it is prepared to give those farmers facing a genuine crisis through a disaster of nature. It is incumbent on this Government to move the process a lot quicker than it has done. The rate of farmers moving into non-viable situations cannot be allowed to continue unabated. I implore the Federal Government to examine what is happening in western New South Wales now and not stall any longer on setting down strategies for assistance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not seek to delay the Senate too long, but unfortunately I understand one of the news media is to `knock off' some material that I wished to present to the Parliament at a later date. As a result, I want to present it to the Senate now instead. This relates to an extraordinary investment by the Prime Minister of Australia (Mr Keating) when he was still Treasurer amounting to something like $430,000. We all know about the right wing of the Australian Labor Party being keen to get its snouts in the public trough, but now its leader has gone and spent $430,000 to get his share of snouts in a much more private trough&mdash;a piggery. Just a month before he ceased being Treasurer last year, Mr Keating sent the note I am about to read to the Registrar of Members Interests, the Clerk of the House of Representatives. I believe it is a fairly misleading note. It is dated 7 June 1991 and it states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I advise that on 15 May 1991&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is while he was still Treasurer&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">my family company Pleuron Pty Limited and I made an investment by way of acquisition of shares in Euphron Pty Limited, a company, which has interests in a piggery and a refrigeration fabrication business.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The interests acquired by both Pleuron Pty Limited and me in Euphron Pty Limited do not constitute a controlling interest in that company, nor do I or any member of my family hold a directorship of that company.</PARA>
<PARA>At the time, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> reported that this was a $50,000 pig deal. Its heading was `$50,000 pig deal reveals a rasher Keating' and referred to the matter that he had intended at one stage to `bring home the bacon' in one of his failed Budgets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The facts are that that massively understates the level of the investment. In fact, the family company, Pleuron Pty Ltd, in which Mr Keating and his wife are shareholders&mdash;Mr Keating is by far the majority shareholder&mdash;has a total paid up capital of $478,500. That is a pretty substantial company. I think a lot of politicians would be very pleased indeed to have been able to save anything like that sort of amount of money to put into a company. I can think of very few who from their parliamentary salaries would be able to save any more than a fraction of that. That $478,500 paid up capital is according to the latest return with the Australian Securities Commission which was released today. That family company, Pleuron Pty Ltd, is represented on the board of Euphron which is in itself a major shareholder in the Brown and Hatton group of companies by Pleuron's Company Secretary, a Mr Christopher Steven Coudounaris, a solicitor with Gadens, who has no personal interest in the Pleuron and Euphron companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This creates some interesting questions. In fact, the whole structure creates a whole lot of interesting questions. It is clear that, for example, Mr Keating's family company, Pleuron, holds an interest in Euphron. In fact, it is a half interest in Euphron&mdash;not just a modest one that does not carry any control. It is quite clear that the interest in Euphron Pty Ltd represents half the shareholding. It is half ownership of Euphron. Mr Keating skirts around that by saying, `It does not constitute a controlling interest'. Who on earth has the controlling interest if they are equal shareholders?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I make is that Mr Keating directly holds 100 ordinary shares in Euphron and his family company, Pleuron, owns 430,000 A shares in Euphron. Another company, called Sephrenia Pty Ltd, has a similar 430,000 B shareholdings, and Mr Archilles Constantinidis holds 100 ordinary shares. In other words, Mr Keating's 100 ordinaries and Mr Constantinidis's 100 ordinary shares match, as do the 430,000 A shares and B shares that Pleuron, in the first instance, and Sephrenia, in the second instance, hold in Euphron. Okay&mdash;he does not have a controlling interest; he just shares ownership. One would have thought that the Prime Minister might have thought it worth while to at least concede that he shares what appears to be a controlling interest in a major company with assets around the $850,000 mark, as I recall. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He also says, `Neither I nor any member of my family holds a directorship in that company'&mdash;that company being Euphron. But the shareholding of his family company, Pleuron, in Euphron, which is a major shareholder in the Brown and Hatton group of companies, is represented on that board by Pleuron's company secretary, Mr Christopher Steven Coudounaris, a solicitor with Gadens who has no personal interest in the Pleuron and Euphron companies. This means that Mr Keating's statement to the Parliament on 7 June hides the fact that, while no-one in his family held a directorship in Euphron directly, there is a nominee acting for them, Mr Steven Coudounaris, who has no personal interest in the Pleuron and Euphron companies. He is a nominee acting, clearly, as a director of Euphron for Pleuron. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One would have thought that in this situation, where the Government has been trying to make a virtue of declarations of interest, Mr Keating would seek to make it clear that he does have a major interest and that, even though he is not a director, he has a nominee on that board. It is interesting to note, too, that, while Pleuron's annual return has been made to the Australian Securities Commission&mdash;a copy of which came out today&mdash;Euphron, in which he is a joint shareholder with Sephrenia, has not yet filed its annual return to the Australian Securities Commission for the year to 30 June 1991, although it was due for filing on 1 January 1992. Many people say that it is normal for these things not to be sent in on time, but I would have thought there might be some special merit in a company in which the Prime Minister holds a 50 per cent interest&mdash;</PARA>

I admit that he did not set much of a good example with the Taxation Office, but maybe Prime Ministers are not required to put in their tax returns on time. Obviously, they are not obliged to make certain that the companies in which they hold a 50 per cent interest put in their company returns on time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would hope that when Mr Keating hears of this he will encourage his nominee on that board to do something about that and to get that company return in, even if it is only to allow stickybeaks like me to see what is in the return, as well as providing the people with whom that company may do business&mdash;creditors and so on&mdash;with some indication of what that company is all about. It would also be nice if the Brown and Hatton Group Pty Ltd, in which I understand Euphron is a major shareholder, also put in a return, because that has not had a return put in for some time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are the vehicles by which Mr Keating has an interest in the piggery. The piggery was bought by the Brown and Hatton Group Pty Ltd when it had another name. All these companies seem to change their names with incredible enthusiasm. This one was called Denvalt at the time. I hope that some attempt will be made to fill in the returns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> of this pig deal indicated that Mr Keating had bought Mr J.J. Brown's interest in that group. Mr J.J. Brown was a former Minister in the Hawke Government, a member of the right wing of the Labor Party of New South Wales and, in that sense, I suppose, one of the `mates'. There are other companies in the group, such as Jensay Pty Ltd and Olympia Refrigeration Sales Pty Ltd&mdash;both at the almost notorious address that crops up everywhere of 48-54 Meeks Road, Marrickville&mdash;and neither company has filed returns with the Australian Securities Commission for the financial years ended 30 June 1989, 1990 and 1991. I do not know why they have not been struck off the register, but one would have thought that that kind of delay is not appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was also interested to note in my searches that, while a company called Olympia Refrigeration Sales Pty Ltd is a member of the group, there is another company called Olympia Refrigeration Pty Ltd which has gone into liquidation, owing considerable amounts to creditors including an amount for workers compensation insurance. Naturally, it no longer carries on business. I wonder to what extent Olympia Refrigeration Sales Pty Ltd is carrying on business formerly carried on by Olympia Refrigeration Pty Ltd. I suppose that creditors of Olympia Refrigeration Pty Ltd may well be interested to know whether they could have done a better deal and got money out of the collapsed company had this situation not obtained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a very complicated company structure. Because these companies do not put in their returns in anything like good time&mdash;in fact, they are sometimes years behind&mdash;it is very difficult to establish the Brown and Hatton structure. I cannot guess. All I can say with confidence is that the annual return of Pleuron Ltd, Mr Keating's company, shows that it is in a very healthy state. It has current assets of $480,000, total assets of $481,460 and a shareholders equity of $474,438. I look forward to the Prime Minister explaining to the Parliament whether he has joint ownership of this major company&mdash;at least major as far as most people are concerned as something worth around $1m is not chickenfeed&mdash;whether he has an equal control in it; whether he has a nominee as a director of it; and whether he will encourage it eventually to file its annual return. </PARA>
