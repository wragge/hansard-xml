In terms of encouragement of growth in the economy, we have announced a number of matters which will take a little time to take effect. We are not going to be panicked into doing anything silly by a lacklustre Opposition, and why should we be? To say that the Government is offering more of the same is totally incorrect. What is being offered by the Opposition is more of the same of the Margaret Thatcher vintage of the 1970s.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last Thursday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> carried a report of a person who had been directed to be re-employed and awarded back pay because that person was unfairly dismissed. The report concerns a security officer who did not seek time off but sought a re-rostering of his shift so he could attend to the birth of his son when his wife was in labour. The employer dismissed that worker. On appeal to the New South Wales Industrial Relations Commissioner, in the judgment that was handed down, as reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>, the Commissioner said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am satisfied that the termination of Mr Baker's employment as a result of his non-attendance at work to be with his wife for the birth of their child was, in all circumstances, a harsh, unfair or unjust dismissal of the highest order.</PARA>

<PARA>On that basis, this worker was reinstated in employment and awarded 13 weeks back pay. I understand that the employer in this case, South West Security, regards this as an outrageous decision and wants to appeal it. I therefore will not go to the merits of the case. What I simply say about it is this: under our system, that worker had a place to go to be reinstated or for redress, and that worker had a chance to put a fair case and be judged appropriately. The employer has a right to appeal, and it will go to appeal if the employer lodges one, and have the matter finally determined. Under the industrial relations system, that is possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition's proposal is to introduce common law, where the relationship is that of a master and a servant and where the servant&mdash;in this case, the worker&mdash;would have no rights and would not be able to resist being dismissed in those circumstances; indeed, it is doubtful whether he would be allowed off to attend to the birth of his son with his wife at the time at all. So the stark difference here is between a system that denies rights and one that confers them on both parties. I hope there is a speedy conclusion to this case. The truth of the outcome is that it will be fair and reasonable, something that is accessible under us but not under the Opposition.</PARA>

<PARA>If I wanted a judgment on the level of support for a GST in New Zealand, I certainly would not ask the Australian Treasury for it. Whatever its skills and expertise, the Treasury is not a public relations pollster, it is not a public relations firm and it is not an advertising agency.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Since I am substituting for Senator Collins today in Transport and Communications, perhaps I should answer this question from the wider perspective of the whole portfolio. I note that the Industry Commission's 1991-92 annual report states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the effects of the recession, reform efforts of earlier years are producing positive results in many areas of economic activity. They have reduced costs for many industries and consumers, and increased choice and quality. The burden on taxpayers from public sector inefficiency has also been lessened.</PARA>
<PARA>I am pleased to advise the Senate that many of the examples of the reform dividend come under the umbrella of the Transport and Communications portfolio, including significant falls in domestic air fares and record numbers of passengers travelling, with the flow-on benefits to the Australian tourism industry; Civil Aviation Authority cuts in charges to industry in real terms of $96m in 1992-93; turnaround times for grain ships at Australian ports dropping from an average of 4.5 days to 2.4 days, saving farmers $10m per annum; and AOTC reducing its charges for long distance calls, including a 13 per cent reduction from Melbourne to Sydney on the previous year and further reductions likely with increased competition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I add a few more examples to those provided by the Commission: Australia Post has achieved real reductions in the basic postal charge for the past six years; a reduction in the stevedoring industry work force of 57 per cent; a reduction of over 50 per cent in shipboard crewing levels for grain handling operations; and falls of 20 to 25 per cent in stevedoring charges negotiated for new contracts. All these improvements reduce charges to industry and consumers and increase Australia's productivity and its ability to compete internationally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government has put in place the legislative and structural framework to achieve ongoing micro-economic reform in the Transport and Communications portfolio. In aviation, shipping, the waterfront, telecommunications and broadcasting, reforms are achieving benefits which will flow progressively throughout the Australian economy. More recently, measures have been announced to develop rail and road infrastructure. The Government agrees with the Industry Commission that the reform process is ongoing. Major challenges ahead focus on areas of joint Commonwealth-State responsibility and State responsibilities, including rail reform and uniform road transport regulation, and on ports.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The micro-economic reform achievements so far have occurred with minimum industrial disruption, despite the significant impact of those changes. A major reason for that has been that the reform program has been carried on in consultation with all the parties concerned: industry, unions, employers and employees have been a fundamental component to gaining the commitment in order to achieve the reform.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The consultative approach to reform advocated by the Government is in stark contrast to the Opposition's confrontationist approach. This Government is committed to the continuing development of the critical transport and communications infrastructure of this country. The coalition has given no such commitment but, rather, has adopted a hope-something-will-happen approach to most key infrastructure developments and an approach where government commitment goes missing and consultation plays little part. This is surely not good enough to ensure that Australian infrastructure does not once again fall into the run-down state which occurred under the previous coalition Government.</PARA>

That was his big go in the article on Saturday. If one looks at that industry alone, there is a lot of intra-industry trade. Australia is a very big exporter of paper products, and there will inevitably be some imports of paper products. That is true across a whole range of industries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last two financial years, strong growth in exports has more than paid for our imports. Further, as exports grew, imported components into a variety of industries took up a larger proportion of the total import bill. The highest growth in imports in 1991-92 occurred in the `other goods' category, which contains these components which go into manufacturing industry. The importation of investment goods is essential for a sustained recovery for manufacturing industry itself. Last year, imports of investment goods were higher. I make the point that, as the effects of the depreciation of the dollar take effect and Australia's low inflation rate takes hold, local producers and all Australians will reap the benefits of competitive advantage over foreign producers. That is a process which is already taking place.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government is aware of reports of the acquisition of Portuguese-manufactured weapons by the SLORC in Burma. We are seeking to verify them. If confirmed, we will certainly express our concern directly to the Portuguese Government, as we have done in respect of other countries known to export arms to Burma. We would express that concern in very strong terms. It does not sit very happily with Portugal's professed concern for human rights so far as East Timor is concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have made it clear on many occasions that the Australian Government would support the implementation of an international embargo on the sale of arms to Burma. However, our soundings&mdash;and we have taken many of them&mdash;indicate that there is simply not sufficiently wide support for such an embargo to be successful, particularly one administered through the United Nations, which would require Security Council endorsement. It could not be expected to get that, given that China, unhappily, is a major continuing arms supplier. We have instituted our own unilateral ban, however, on the sale of arms and defence-related goods.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a serious dearth of accurate statistics on Burma's foreign trade. The situation is particularly unclear because of the extent of smuggling across Burma's borders. However, trade between China and Burma has, by all accounts, increased very sharply in recent years. According to a recent academic study which uses official Burmese figures, China received 29.4 per cent of Burma's exports and supplied 11.3 per cent of its imports in 1989-90. In the same year, Japan&mdash;about which Senator Chamarette also asked&mdash;is reported to have received just 4.2 per cent of Burma's exports and to have supplied 23.8 per cent of its imports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, as to the question of narcotics production, increased narcotics production in Burma, which has been widely reported, is clearly one result of the parlous economic and political situation in the country, including the continuing conflict between Burmese authorities and a number of ethnic minority groups.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Burmese Government's programs, ostensibly designed to eradicate opium production and processing, have in fact been conducted in parallel with politically and economically motivated tolerance of, or even support for, narcotics traffickers.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last Friday, 4 December, the third committee of the UN General Assembly adopted an important resolution by consensus, which includes a call upon the SLORC to release Daw Aung San Suu Kyi unconditionally. That resolution, which Australia strongly welcomes, does underline the international community's very grave concern at the continuing failure of the Burmese Government to move towards democracy and the continued seriousness of the human rights situation in that country.</PARA></TALK.START>

The fact that this resolution, which we co-sponsored and were actively involved in drafting, was adopted by consensus will again send a very clear signal to the SLORC about the breadth of international concern at the situation in that country and Burma's increasing political isolation, even from countries within its own region.</PARA>

It would make sense if it were part of a wider international economic sanctions exercise. Over recent months we have explored very actively the possibility of sustaining such an exercise but, unfortunately, have not been able to gather sufficient support for that, in particular from the countries actually trading with Burma. There is a degree of support in principle from Europe, North America, Japan and elsewhere, and we would be prepared to go along with that if it were meaningful in practice.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of the views of the South Australian Manufacturing Council. Governments get views from bodies of this kind all the time on these issues and we have to discuss them as we get these representations. There was a discussion, as Senator Spindler points out, about these representations before the Budget. There were no recommendations. There was a discussion about some of the representations we had received. I will not be advising the Prime Minister or anybody else to have a pause in tariff cuts, particularly not now, because in the last few months there has been something like a 15 per cent depreciation of the Australian dollar, which, of course, adds significantly to the level of protection given to local manufactures.

The implication in his head is apparently that that will do something about the present unfortunate employment situation. I want to make it clear that I do not believe that. I believe that while tariffs may have made a marginal impact on employment in this country, the major contributors to unemployment in Australia have been the recession and a high level of structural adjustment in a number of government instrumentalities and major firms.

Thus, it is not something that features in the daily press, which tends to report bad news not good.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The latest in this list is Optus Communications, a company with 1,300 employees in the telecommunications industry. Optus has concluded an agreement which will enable those workers to increase their skills, to use those skills more flexibly, to be paid under a performance based pay scheme, which provides for a 10 per cent annual bonus subject to the productivity levels being achieved. It incorporates the annual leave loading and other allowances in a base rate, and provides for time off in lieu of overtime.

This is an agreement that covers 150,000 Australian workers in the Australian Public Service sector. This is primarily a performance based agreement. In other words, they will find levels of higher productivity in order to pay for wage increases, and if they do not find them, the wage increases will be restricted to a couple of adjustments to make sure that living standards in this country do not fall behind. It is basically a decentralising of what up until now has been a relatively rigid structure for the Australian Public Service&mdash;decentralising that to the agencies that make up the Public Service, to enable the public servants to chase the productivity changes that are available at that level, but to do so with a proper safety net. It is not what the Opposition proposes. What the Opposition proposes is effectively the law of the jungle, and devil take the hindmost; everyone will be pushed and pressed and sacked if he disagrees. This is an agreement based on cooperation. It underpins our level of workplace reform, and is yet another example of how successfully we manage reform in this country.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is fair enough for the MTIA, the Industry Commission and commentators such as Professor Garnaut to make those remarks. Their remarks are about encouraging a quicker pace for reform. Our concern is to perform at the highest and fastest level. But remarks that are about quicker, faster, higher, more, more, more, without any regard to the quality of change remind me of the old rag trade saying, `Never mind the quality, feel the width'. The essential issue here is to make reform that is genuine, irreversible and reflects a real change in the culture of the community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In answer to an earlier question today, I referred to what the Industry Commission really said as opposed to selective quoting of what people pretend it asserted. The Industry Commission said that there was significant micro-economic reform in this country. I am prepared to table my list of quotes so that Senator Ferguson can go to the actual source material to see that that is demonstrated. It is for those reasons that the Prime Minister made his remarks. They were made on the basis&mdash;if we take, for example, the shipping industry or the waterfront&mdash;that a number of structural changes that were necessary have been made, with the Government playing a positive role in their making. Now it is over to the private sector; it has to take advantage of those changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where the full value of the reduction in waterfront costs has not been passed on to exporters or importers, the companies that use it, but is captured by the shipping companies&mdash;as Professor Fels found in the Prices Surveillance Authority report on the waterfront&mdash;it is for those companies in their commercial negotiations with the shipping companies to extract that full value; and we would urge them to do so. As a positive step to encourage them to achieve that, we are making available transparently to the whole community the levels of the reform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is never an end to micro-economic reform in a country such as Australia. We are on a reform continuum.

But the Reserve Bank article rightly dismisses these views, pointing out that the growth is too widespread and too consistent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My discussions with many manufacturers from a wide variety of fields confirm that manufacturers intend to stay in export markets after the upturn in the economy. Indeed, through periods of high growth in the mid-1980s, the export propensity of Australian manufacturing firms increased very steadily. For example, there were 15 per cent growth rates in manufacturing exports, even at a time when the economy was growing strongly. Those exports have continued to grow through the recession.</PARA>

This Government has absolutely no truck with anyone in any section of society who is breaching the law about criminality or terrorism, and we exhaustively use our powers to deal with it. But I am not the appropriate Minister; I am not a policing Minister. It may well be that the industrial relations portfolio under a Liberal government would be a policing portfolio, but under a Labor Government it is a portfolio about trying to encourage industrial harmony and productivity.

If this is the union that is referred to in the document incorporated by Senator Short, and if I deregistered this union in 1990, how can I be blamed for a report which, I repeat, the Victorian police themselves have not acted on?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us go back to what happened in the most recent bout of questioning on this issue. I know that there are allegations of this sort around, but no-one has yet produced any evidence. I do not know whether any of those allegations are true, and there is no evidence that they are true. In terms of the usage in this chamber of the privilege of parliament and the right to name people under parliamentary privilege, I happen to take that very responsibly. But what has the Opposition done? It has smeared all building unions&mdash;the BWIU, carpenters, plumbers, plasterers and electricians&mdash;all unions as a group, without naming them, when one union is referred to in this report. I think that is reprehensible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also reprehensible that those opposite do not tell anyone that we have dealt with this union and that no action has been taken by the competent authority. The Opposition then blames us for some sort of refusal or deliberate disinclination to act. When I last reported on this matter to the Senate, officers of my Department inquired into it and found that the Victorian police were not doing anything. All that information is before the Federal Police and before ASIO. If any action is to be taken, the matter is in the proper hands of the policing authorities and they will deal with it. </PARA>

As Senator Crane would know, there is some very strong evidence of what was done at the Camperdown abattoirs in October 1991 when a Mr Warwick Leeson acted allegedly and, on the evidence, probably correctly, in terms of inferences that can be drawn, as an agent provocateur. People were prosecuted on the basis of the allegations he made, all of which prosecutions were brought against meatworkers who were picketing and all of which prosecutions were dismissed, with costs being awarded against the police.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to join with my colleagues in taking note of the answer given by the Minister for Industrial Relations, Senator Cook, in Question Time today. It is an alarming situation when we have a Minister responsible for any portfolio who is happy at one time to answer questions in relation to that portfolio and in less than a week announce that questions relating to the same matter have somehow shifted themselves out of that portfolio responsibility. Senator Cook now seeks to wash his hands of any involvement by him or his Department in the future in relation to this report. He says that it is not a matter for him; it is a matter related to Senator Tate's portfolio. But it is a matter for him; that is why he answered the questions last week.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there is any suggestion that unions have been infiltrated by organised crime or by terrorists, that must be a matter of interest for the Minister responsible for industrial relations, for a variety of reasons. The first reason is quite obvious&mdash;it is simply a misuse of the unions and the cause to which they are meant to be directing their attention. In all probability, there may be a diversion of funds and capacity from the unions into areas not for the benefit of the workers on whose behalf they are meant to be acting. Once we get to the question of funds, we realise that Senator Cook's Department is responsible for a large amount of funds that go towards unions. Therefore, he should be concerned as to whether these allegations are correct.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleague Senator Cooney said that it is not up to the Minister or the Executive to be doing the investigating because other people can do that. That may be true, but all that has been asked is whether the Minister will ascertain what the current state of affairs is. Who he gets to do that is his business. Senator Cook has said, `Look, this was all a few years ago. How am I expected to know? It is not my problem'. Then he tries to mislead the Senate by saying, `Look, you might not realise this but we got rid of the BLF and therefore this is not a problem'. But the minute that has been tabled refers to the BLF and other unions. I noted in Senator Cook's response that he has not ruled out the involvement of other unions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view, Senator Cook is not entitled to come into this place and say that three years later he does not know anything about it and he does not think it is his place to investigate it. More particularly, he should not be able to say that the fact that the Victoria Police has not done anything is in itself a reason for the Commonwealth not to do something if there is a matter of substance to be looked at. One has only to look at the Commonwealth's view in industrial relations to see why it is happy to let the Victorian Government do what it likes. The Victorian Government is not allowed to do some things in industrial relations because the Commonwealth does not like it, so it is seeking to take some steps to do what the Commonwealth wants in that respect. So I do not see why this matter is any different from the debate we are having over industrial relations policy. The Commonwealth says it has a right to intervene there and look after its interest and to intervene here and look after its interest if it wishes to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like briefly to make some remarks about the answer given by the Minister for Justice, Senator Tate, in Question Time today. I understand the degree to which he is required to avoid making remarks with respect to ASIO, but the question he was asked did not relate solely to ASIO; it related to other Commonwealth agencies as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, it is simply unsatisfactory that a Minister will acknowledge in one week that serious allegations do concern his portfolio, that he will go and get someone to get some information, that information will be brought forward from the Victorian police and, then, in seven or eight days following his first response that Minister will try to wash his hands and say, `It's nothing to do with me', when it has everything to do with him. Millions of dollars worth of taxpayers' money is going to the unions. He is responsible for industrial relations and he is responsible to see that the unions are working well. </PARA>

Through a freedom of information request, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> has obtained a massively censored version of the report written by the two Treasury officers and one senior officer from the Taxation Office after they were sent to New Zealand in September 1991 obviously to fossick around for any information that the Government might be able to use against the coalition's Fightback proposals&mdash;particularly the proposal to implement a goods and services tax to replace, as part of a major beneficial reform of our taxation system, the wholesale sales tax, which is the archaic and secret consumption tax system that we have, payroll tax and the very heavy petrol tax that we have in Australia. The coalition proposes to reform the indirect tax system to make it much simpler, fairer and equitable as well as to reduce personal income tax in Australia on average across the board by about one-third.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report by the Treasury and Tax Office officials on their return to Australia appears to have been a very different sort of report to that which the Government had been expecting. Although virtually all of the report was obliterated and censored by the Government before skerricks of it were released to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> under freedom of information, it does say that `the implementation of the goods and services tax was universally reported to have gone very smoothly' in New Zealand. Any comments in most of the rest of the report are of a favourable nature. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But there are enormous parts of the report which have been obliterated and not made public. For example, all pages from 9 to 24 of this 24-page report have been totally deleted. Some sections in the early parts of the report&mdash;it is inconceivable why they would be obliterated or kept secret in any way&mdash;have been obliterated. For example, almost all of the material under the subheading `Attitudes to GST' has been deleted. Other than to say that there is virtually no lobbying for change to the GST and that there is further evidence of the acceptance of GST, the rest is wiped out. For all those reasons, it is a very important report. That is why I have moved that Standing Orders be suspended. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not waste a lot of the Senate's time debating this motion to suspend Standing Orders as I understand it will be supported. But I think it is fairly important that we do put on the record why the Government does not support the motion. Quite simply, it is a very irresponsible proposal. Senator Short actually knows it is, but he is rather desperate to find something to prop up the Opposition's ailing policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there were a crisis about the failure of the Government to provide this information, if it were a matter about which immediate action should be taken, it is remarkable that nothing happened six weeks ago when, at an Estimates committee meeting, the Treasury was asked whether the Government would provide it. We said no. About a month ago we advised why we would not do so. This is a quite straightforward matter under freedom of information, under the proper management of government business and under the proper management of a relationship between countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The trip report is mostly records of confidential discussions between the Australian officials and the New Zealand officials, and of discussions in confidence with New Zealand business representatives and academics. In the course of the normal conduct of bilateral relations between friendly countries, we send our officers regularly to New Zealand and New Zealand officers regularly come here. Discussions are held with senior representatives of government, business and others on the basis that those discussions will be confidential. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very important that we maintain that liaison and the capacity to have those discussions. Therefore, it is important that we do not wantonly undermine the confidential basis upon which these discussions have been going on, as I understand it, for quite a long time. If we were to table here and release the results of the report of confidential discussions with New Zealand, it would not only impact upon our relationship with New Zealand but also it would have a profound impact on our relationship with every country with which we wish to have confidential discussions&mdash;as everybody understands we should and must do as a proper government responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are quite happy to have a discussion about all those things on the public record pro and anti the impact of the GST in New Zealand, Canada, the UK and wherever else people want to discuss it. What a fascinating objective to have in public life&mdash;to aspire to turn Australia into New Zealand! What a fantastic objective! But I will not go too far into that debate, although I would love to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us talk about whether or not it is proper, as a matter of public policy, to seek to require that a document be tabled when it is quite clearly against the national interest that it be tabled. It is not a question of the Government having put its arm into the bureaucratic process and required that a document that normally would be made public be not made public. It is the very opposite. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Treasury has made clear&mdash;and as any rudimentary examination of the freedom of information legislation makes clear with regard to the original document&mdash;although those same principles do not bind the Parliament, they should apply in this instance to the Parliament's interpretation of whether it should require these documents to be tabled. It is very important that we&mdash;as a chamber of the Parliament; as representatives of Australia&mdash;make responsible decisions with a long term view rather than irresponsible decisions in the fervent hope that some short term benefit may flow. In my view, that clearly is what would be involved in the release of this document, and that is why the Government will not be supporting either the suspension or the motion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The motion and its achievement, to the extent that it will make the GST more of a focus of public debate in Australia, clearly are in the Government's interests. We are quite happy to have the GST as the focus of debate today, tomorrow and every day until the election. That is not a problem for us at all. The more that is the case, the better. But we do have an obligation to seek to protect the public interest in this matter. That is why this document, which is not a major document and which has not been in any way suppressed by political decision, will not be released. People who are entirely partisan in their life cannot understand that that might not be the case for others. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;`Watch it', says my colleague. This may be a document which indicates that Mr Keating would very much like to have a GST in Australia.

Anything coming from New Zealand will not sway that opinion, particularly in view of the short time which the Treasury officials spent over there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition is on record as saying that it does not respect Treasury very much. In recent days it has criticised Treasury when a number of other issues have been raised. It is not particularly good for the Opposition to debate this report of Treasury, nor is it very logical of it to place a great deal of store in the report, when in other contexts it has rejected Treasury advice and Treasury analysis. For that reason also, one could not place a great deal of emphasis on what use the Opposition may make of this document once it becomes public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We understand that the Treasury officers spoke to academics in New Zealand. I think Senator McMullan has mentioned that. I would be very surprised if any academic in New Zealand is concerned about having his or her views revealed publicly. I think it is very much to be regretted if any academics who hold views on an important issue such as this should express those views to Treasury officials and then object to those views being released to the public. It is in the nature of academic discourse that those views should be known quite widely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, I would be disappointed if business people in New Zealand who had views which were of sufficient strength to influence Treasury officials in their report also were now embarrassed by the release of that sort of information which should be in the public domain. Of course, it is just possible that some of the New Zealand Treasury officials in New Zealand said certain things, but surely that would be a relatively small part of this report which we are led to believe is dealing with the impact of a GST on New Zealand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that very little harm would flow from this, and not a great deal of good would flow from it either, because it is probably a report of little moment, but we would support the motion to suspend Standing Orders and also urge Senator Short to immediately put the substantive motion which we will support. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make a few comments on the motion before us. The understanding that was reached previously on the Regulation of Video Material Bill, Senator Walters's Bill, as I understood it, was that it would be debated in the committee stage. It should be remembered that the Bill has been supported to the committee stage. This is a most important piece of legislation which has been around for some time. It is most relevant at this time for a number of reasons, not least of which has been the fact that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has bought into the argument about violence on television and that, of course, goes to the question of the classifications that are applied to certain films and videos by the Office of Film and Literature Classification.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Walters's Bill is designed to ensure that the classifications, which the Prime Minister has been publicly making statements about, are tightened up so far as violence and sexploit material are concerned. It is a most important measure. I believe it is indicative of the attitude of some members of the Government in that they are not prepared to allow this Bill to be debated in committee. As we know, the technical aspects, which are the key aspects of legislation, are determined in the committee stage. Otherwise, we have a situation where people rabbit on about matters which, very frequently, they are not fully briefed upon. We saw that happen during the second reading debate on Senator Walters's Bill. A number of honourable senators made absurd statements, which they would not have proffered had they known anything about the legislation or about the regime in respect of film and video classifications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that we have an ideal and unique opportunity to make a contribution to the protection of children and to uphold the dignity of human beings, particularly women, if we allow further consideration of Senator Walters's Bill. I remind the Senate that Senator Walters's Bill has a number of purposes. One purpose is to prevent the continuance of the X classification. This classification is applied by the Office of Film and Literature Classification to certain types of videos which in Canada would be ruled out because they offend persons to the extent that they are regarded as obscene. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because the Office of Film and Literature Classification places such material in the X category and thus renders it legal for sale and hire in particular areas, this prevents an ordinary citizen&mdash;for example, a woman who is grossly offended by some of the material in that X classification, which as we were told&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Very briefly, I rise to join this debate on the Government's position. The Government is not only outnumbered but also it has revealed its inconsistency and hypocrisy on this matter.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All governments in Australia must ensure the further development and effective implementation of guidelines of video materials which portray, condone or incite violence against women or degrade women.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have the Labor Party's outright refusal to foster a community in which women are safe. Firstly, it has failed to act on the recommendations of the 1988 report of the Joint Select Committee on Video Material; and, secondly, it failed to support Senator Walters's private member's Bill, the Regulation of Video Material Bill 1988. Now it is stifling debate on Senator Walters's Bill which is before the Parliament at the moment. The inconsistency and hypocrisy of this Government are revealed in all their horror. This Government will parade its virtues for public approval but, when it comes to the crunch and to doing what is right by Australian women to protect them from the violence which is endemic in this community, it will not lift a finger. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is all very well for the Prime Minister to advocate greater enforcement of television violence standards.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with much pleasure that I take the passage of this Bill on behalf of the Liberal-National Party coalition because it is a Bill for which I have a great deal of sympathy. It fulfils one of my wishes. As I have stated on previous occasions in the Senate, the Government has no business in running a pure commercial enterprise like an airline in the 1990s. Indeed, probably for the last 20 years or more government has had no business trying to run an airline.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the Senate has before it this afternoon the Qantas Sale Bill 1992, the purpose of which, broadly, is to define the terms and conditions of sale of the airline. Qantas is a government owned company. It is proposed that the government holding be sold to the private sector both within Australia and overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot help reflecting upon the irony of the situation, because Qantas was bought by a Labor government. Now, 47 years later, Qantas is being sold by a Labor government. Those of us who have been in the Parliament for some while will remember that, when we put the case years ago that Qantas should be sold, we had enormous opposition from the Labor Party on purely ideological grounds&mdash;that one could not sell this great Australian icon; that it would go to rack and ruin if it were sold. So it really is quite ironic that today I am here speaking on this Bill for the sale of this airline. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition's main criticism about this sale is that it has taken so long in coming. The reason that Qantas is being sold is that the Government can no longer afford to keep the airline. So we have the situation, again with a touch of irony, that the airline is being sold by the Government for the wrong reasons. But, historically, the Government bought the airline for the wrong reason; it was a Labor government that bought it, and it did so on purely ideological grounds because it believed in nationalisation. The Government that bought the airline tried to nationalise the main airline in Australia at the time, which was Australian National Airlines. The Government was defeated in that and it turned around and bought another internal airline, which was Qantas, but which was also involved in overseas passenger and freight travel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1990 the Labor Party changed its view in a very bitter conference and decided to sell 49 per cent of the airline. That was quite an illogical decision. Why would the Government sell 49 per cent if it were prepared to sell some of it? This year the financial pressures were so heavy on the Government that it changed its position once more and decided to sell 100 per cent of it. The Government had to sell 100 per cent because it knew, and was advised repeatedly, that no-one would buy 49 per cent of the airline, which was the original proposition. Who would go into a commercial contract with a government that has run the country as badly as this Government has? We have seen the national debt go from about $32 billion up to somewhere in excess of a gross figure now of over $200 billion in 10 years. So the only way the Government could sell Qantas was to sell the whole lot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth of that is shown on the first page of the second reading speech. The Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From 1988 on, the boards of directors for both Qantas and Australian Airlines had repeatedly raised with the Government the question of their being given greater access to equity capital. The airlines were weighed down by grossly uncommercial debt to equity ratios at a time of rapid business expansion.</PARA>
<PARA>That is at the heart of the matter. The Government can no longer afford to keep this airline. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I was preparing the material for this speech, I was very interested to talk to two advisers from the Department. I am grateful for their advice, but I could not help a wry smile when, through the course of the discussion, one of the advisers said, `Of course Qantas was originally a private company'. I refrained from saying it but, with the greatest of respect to the advisers, I think I know a little more about the history of Qantas than they do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is perfectly true that Qantas started out in 1920 as a private company. It was founded in Queensland. It was a company that started in the face of enormous difficulties. It faced a great deal of financial difficulty. It was restrained by the government of the day in every way possible. It was not allowed to compete with the railways, which in the early 1920s were very strong. The only air routes Qantas could get were linking the rail heads through western Queensland from Charleville to Cloncurry and even before that from Winton to Longreach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is history that on 2 November 1922 the Armstrong Whitworth FK8 flew the first service. From there, the company has prospered. I believe it has prospered through the quality of the men who founded that airline: Hudson Fysh was the Chief Executive for many years, long after the Government bought the airline. Hudson Fysh and Paddy McGinnes were two light horse soldiers from the First World War. McGinnes won a DCM at Gallipoli; Fysh was also at Gallipoli. They later transferred to No. 1 Squadron&mdash;the first Australian squadron and arguably the squadron with the greatest history of any of the squadrons in the RAAF. Both of them won distinguished flying crosses in that squadron. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After the war they joined with one of the engineers from the squadron, Arthur Baird. He was as legendary a figure as McGuinness and Fysh. They came together with a western Queensland grazier, Fergus McMaster of Moscow station. He raised the funds to form what was called the Queensland and Northern Territory Aerial Service. From that point on, in the face of great difficulties and with very primitive equipment, the service grew at a rapid rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I may be wrong, but I think for every year that the service was in operation, and that includes the years of the Great Depression, the company always showed a dividend&mdash;it always made a profit. That is no mean achievement and it is something that the airline has not always been able to manage while it has been owned by governments of various persuasions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The airline grew very rapidly from a small outback airline until it branched out of Australia, in partnership with Imperial Airways, to run a passenger service between Australia and the United Kingdom&mdash;first of all with the DH86s and later with the Empire flying boats, four of which came along in 1938-39. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a private company the airline rendered a very great service to Australia during the war. It lost a number of its crew through war service, although they were officially classified as non-combatants. It operated a freight and passenger service right to the front line when the Pacific war developed. It is no overstatement to say that the service the airline rendered to Australia was as good and as praiseworthy as any service the RAAF offered this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1947 Mr Chifley was the Prime Minister and the airline was bought by the Government. From then the airline expanded into a major international carrier&mdash;the sole Australian flag carrier. It has been apparent for the last 10 to 15 years that the shortage of capital in the airline has caused problems for the company. It simply has not had enough capitalisation to keep its interest payments down and to grow the way it should have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill before us starts by defining two points&mdash;the 50 per cent sale day and the 100 per cent sale day. It then moves into the articles of association, which define how the company will operate. Foreign ownership is defined as being limited in aggregate to 35 per cent. There is a good reason for that. If foreign ownership goes past 35 per cent the international traffic rights, which are fundamental to an international airline, will be null and void because Qantas will not be deemed to be an Australian owned airline. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The total foreign holding in any one hand is limited to 25 per cent. While I would prefer to see 100 per cent of Qantas ownership remain in Australian hands, I recognise that in today's market 25 per cent is the figure that we would probably need to offer to attract foreign airline bids. Make no mistake about it, if a group has a holding of 25 per cent in one hand, it has a very powerful influence on a company. It is not true to say that the rest of Qantas, the 75 per cent, will rule the roost without any reference at all to the 25 per cent foreign holding. It will be quite a powerful influence on the policies of the company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the articles of association there are provisions limiting the number of foreign directors and denoting who can vote for them, requiring that the chairman always be Australian, and stipulating that the company maintain Qantas as its name, have its headquarters in Australia and be incorporated within Australia. The proposed procedure is that the initial sale of 49 per cent will take place and subsequently there will be a float to the Australian community of the remaining 51 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Originally, that was going to be towards the end of this year or in the early part of next year. The latest information from the Minister for Finance is that it will take place after the end of the financial year&mdash;that is, after the end of June next year. If that happens there will be an interesting problem for the Government. I do not think the Government will take any notice of it because how big a debt we have does not seem to worry this Government. An amount of $1.6 billion from the sale of Qantas was included in this year's Budget, and quite clearly that sum is not going to be realised within this financial year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part 3 deals with the requirement for the airline to trade under the name of Qantas when operating international services. I did raise the matter of Australia Asia Airlines with the advisers and I am assured that that will not be in any conflict with the provisions of the Act. Australia Asia Airlines is the subcompany set up by Qantas to trade with Taiwan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next part of the Bill deals with the debt and capital reconstruction. Because it is undercapitalised, Qantas does owe a very great deal of money and most of that is covered by Commonwealth of Australia guarantees. I cannot recall having seen a balance sheet in the immediate past. I think the last one I saw for the company listed debts of around $4 billion against assets of about $8 billion. This part of the Bill deals with the procedures by which the Government will remove itself from being guarantor for those loans in return for some shares in the company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part 5 deals with the maintenance of long service leave entitlements. Part 6 repeals the Qantas Empire Airways Act and the Australian National Airlines Act. Qantas Empire Airways was formed when Qantas became an international carrier in 1934. There was a joint shareholding with half of the company owned by the original Qantas and the other half owned by Imperial Airways, the precursor of British Overseas Airways Corporation, which has now become British Airways. It is rather interesting because it appears as though the successor to Imperial Airways&mdash;British Airways&mdash;will be the company which takes up the 25 per cent holding in Qantas. Part 7 deals with conditions of service of employees and part 8 tidies up some miscellaneous matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I wish to make a few general comments. There is a lot in this Bill about how the sale will take place, but there is very little about who the company will be sold to, apart from defining very clearly the overseas limits. That is one of the great weaknesses of the Bill. The overseas sales are very clearly defined: a maximum of 25 per cent to any one group, presumably an airline, and then a tranche of 10 per cent going to investors overseas. The inference&mdash;indeed, the comment in the newspapers recently of British Airways being in partnership with the Australian institutions, the superannuation funds and life insurance companies&mdash;is that they will take up the remainder of between 25 per cent and 49 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a very good case for the Bill to have made some provision for the sale of this great airline to the Australian public&mdash;first of all, to the employees, because I believe that the employees should be encouraged in every way. Certainly the policy of the Liberal and National parties is to do just that: to make it attractive for employees to take a shareholding in their company. I do not know what the size of Qantas is today. It used to have approximately 10,000 to 12,000 personnel. Since it has been merged with Australian Airlines, which had 8,000 to 10,000 employees, it probably has anywhere between 18,000 and 22,000 employees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The management of a big block of employees such as that is very difficult. It is hard to motivate them and get the best out of them. It requires very high management skills. A good way of doing that is to encourage them to take a shareholding in the company so that they can see the effect of their work, reflected in both their job security and their financial reward. I believe there is a case for discounting some of the share float to the employees and encouraging them to take up the maximum shareholding in the company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Beyond that, the Australian public&mdash;and I am talking about individual investors and family investors as opposed to the big institutions such as AMP, Bankers Trust and all those other investment houses&mdash;should be encouraged to take a maximum holding in the company. The institutional holders have a great deal to answer for in the last 10 to 15 years. They are entirely motivated by profit: if shares go up by a few cents or a dollar or two, they move out to get a profit for their own investment portfolios. That leads to very short-sighted policies and does not help the stability of the company at all. I would like the general public to be encouraged to take a maximum holding in this company, but we do not hear a word from the Government about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even though times are hard, I do believe the public would support with their pockets the sale of Qantas stock. There are a couple of companies in Australia which are institutions in the public mind&mdash;institutions that encourage very great feelings of nationalism. One of them is Arnotts Biscuits, as one can see from all the debate that is running at present, as Campbells tries to take it over. Another such company is Qantas; there is a very great national pride in Qantas. I do believe that the general public would be prepared to get behind that national pride and support it with their own savings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next point I make relates to the current belief in mega-carriers. There is a feeling around the world&mdash;and it has been around for about 10 or 15 years&mdash;that one has to be very big to survive in the airline business. As I have made it clear to the Senate on numerous occasions over the years, I do not share that belief. I do not deny that the trend is running very strongly that way. It may well be that in 10 years time we have only six to nine giant carriers in the world. It might even be as few as four to six; the situation certainly looks as though it is going that way. The management problems of those mega-carriers are enormous. If we look at the history of the international airlines which exist at present, we see that only about four or five of them made a profit in the last financial year. They are in great difficulties; they have great managerial problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will always be a place for a well-managed airline which gives outstanding service. Qantas, provided it changes some of its practices with respect to its cabin attendants, certainly could be in that category. It certainly provides outstanding service technically and through its aircrew. We do not have to join and submerge the company with one of the large international airlines in order for it to survive. We certainly need strategic alliances. A 25 per cent holding would give us that and we would have access to the computer reservations and the booking services of another company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, there are not the economies of scale in airline traffic that exist in the manufacturing industry. If a company is manufacturing cars, the more it produces, the lower its unit costs; whereas, once an airline gets beyond a certain level, it does not enjoy the same benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final matter I raise relates to the defence needs of this country. I believe that the Defence Act should be modified and amended so that there is provision in a national emergency for all transport resources, not only the airlines but also road and rail transport, to be taken over in the national interest. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was with some joy that I listened to Senator MacGibbon's remarks in relation to the symbolic nature of Qantas because, undoubtedly, over all the years that Senator MacGibbon reviewed in his speech, Qantas has increasingly come to occupy a special place in the Australian psyche. It is very much a symbol of Australia. Even though most people probably never travel in an aircraft, they nonetheless recognise the national carrier as a uniquely Australian symbol and they are quite proud of it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a national carrier, Qantas has fostered an exceptional goodwill in this country. Australians abroad have learnt to trust and rely on the national carrier, especially in difficult times when deserted by other airlines as a result of flight time changes, ticketing errors or whatever. I have been in that situation when overseas. The Qantas tradition, perhaps born of longevity and the tyranny of distance, is unique. It has provided an excellent service to Australians. It also has an excellent record of safety as an international carrier&mdash;a record unparalleled by other international airlines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill before us contains legislative changes to finalise the 100 per cent sale of Qantas. I was interested to hear what Senator MacGibbon said about ordinary Australians buying shares in their airline. Of course, when the airline is entirely government owned, it is the fact that, by proxy, every single Australian has a share in it. The Democrats are firmly of the opinion that, in the national interest, the Government should retain at least 51 per cent ownership. We will be voting against this Bill when the motion that it be read a second time is put, as we are opposed to the airline's privatisation. As we expect the Opposition to support the Government, we intend to move some amendments at the committee stage. I will be interested to know exactly how Senator MacGibbon and the coalition feel about those amendments because they seek to do some of the things that Senator MacGibbon spoke about. While we will not attempt to amend the Bill along the lines of having 51 per cent government ownership, we will be attempting to safeguard the national interest against undue foreign ownership and the control of our national carrier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was particularly interested in several other aspects of Senator MacGibbon's speech. He seemed to be relying on a philosophical view that private is good and government is bad. He would know&mdash;in fact, he mentioned this in his speech&mdash;that many of the very large international overseas carriers, some of them totally privately owned, have been unable to continue. It is not necessarily a mark of government ownership which puts Qantas in any difficult position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many large privately owned companies in Australia which have fallen on very hard times in recent days. One wonders just what Senator MacGibbon thinks of those. The evidence is not that government is bad and private is good; the evidence is that some government is good and some government is bad, and some private is good and some private is bad. It is not a function of whether a business is government owned or privately owned; it is whether the business is run efficiently that is significant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to make the point&mdash;I would agree with Senator MacGibbon on this&mdash;that Qantas has suffered from a lack of adequate capital to meet its needs. If the issue is the injection of capital, I make the point that the capital eventually comes from the community. Again, it does not matter too much whether it is a government owned business because the capital will find its way from the community to that business by way of taxation. If a private business receives capital from the community, essentially the profits of those shareholders and their businesses, which ultimately come from the community, will flow into the business by way of underwriting increases in share capital. The capital comes from the community, either by way of a government tax or by way of a private tax, if you like, which is essentially the profits that some people take and re-invest back into other businesses. It is important to recognise that there is nothing essentially good or bad about doing it through government or privately; it is just a different way of finding the capital which goes into those businesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will be proposing amendments to further restrict foreign ownership of Qantas and to weaken the influence of foreign players, something that Senator MacGibbon referred to in his speech. At the same time, our changes would stem the flow of profits offshore. They would increase the scope for participation by small Australian shareholders and would make it easier&mdash;should the public ever wish&mdash;to repatriate Qantas wholly into Australian hands. We are hoping that Senator MacGibbon will support these amendments when the time comes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats oppose the full privatisation of the national carrier. Public ownership in general is essential to provide a showcase for innovation in work practices and progressive employment practices. With a proper injection of funds, Qantas could have provided substantial returns to the Australian people&mdash;indeed, in recent years it has made profits, albeit small profits. However, for nearly three decades Liberal and Labor governments have been starving the enterprise of funds. It is absolutely incredible that the airline has survived so long with this low capital injection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been negligence in funding that has been central to the financial and efficiency problems faced by Qantas. Lack of capital has been an issue since the early 1970s. The initial injection of government funds was small. This has never been adequately followed up. Qantas made it plain in its 1990-91 annual report that undercapitalisation was the predominant factor in its financial loss in that year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a number of years the airline has consistently argued that its profitability was being badly affected by what it called its `grossly inadequate level of capital'. At the end of the 1990-91 financial year its debt to equity ratio stood at 77 : 23. Financing costs exceeded equity by $206m. Its level of equity would not even buy a jumbo jet. Yet at that time the airline had 43 aircraft in its fleet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There can be no doubt that if the Government had not starved our national carrier of funds it would not have had to borrow so much. The Government has been playing a game of financial brinkmanship with the airline. Qantas is so highly geared that it is indeed amazing that it has not gone down the path of the recently failed Compass Airlines venture. It has barely twice the amount of capital of the failed Compass Airlines. Qantas says it needs an injection of $1 billion to reduce its debt to equity ratio to similar levels of its competitors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A strong case exists worldwide for governments to gain expertise in the aviation industry. This industry is regulated by way of bilateral agreements between governments. This has evolved through the industry's historical connections with national security and disaster aid. It is unique that free market forces do not prevail and that government involvement is the order of the day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another broad issue that is central to this debate is the question of foreign ownership of Australian enterprises. It must be asked whether it is in the national interest for six digit profit figures to go offshore and the extent to which limits should be applied to foreign control over Australian culture in the broadest sense of Australian icons such as Qantas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">National interest is central to this debate. A fully Australian owned and controlled company is more likely to act in the national interest. As I said in my opening remarks, Qantas has a special role in the Australian psyche. It has this very deep cultural connection. It is important that its identity should not be confused in the minds of Australians abroad, nor in the minds of visitors to this country. Tourists worldwide tend to travel with the national carrier of the country they are visiting as part of the cultural experience. Seasoned travellers are well aware of the differences in flying with, for example, the German owned Lufthansa as opposed to our own Qantas. Both reflect the ambience of their origins. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Qantas has acted in the national interest in national emergencies and disasters. Senator MacGibbon mentioned such emergencies that occurred during the Second World War. In the protracted 1989 pilots strike, Qantas ferried domestic passengers, offering relief at a time when belligerent union activity brought domestic air travel in this country to a virtual standstill for months. Again, when Cyclone Tracy struck Darwin on Christmas Day in 1974, the national carrier evacuated tens of thousands of stranded residents out of the wrecked and ravaged town. Qantas also airlifted hundreds of Australians stranded in Beijing in the horrific days following the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989. The impact of commercialisation on humanitarian service traditions such as these, particularly when such commercialisation involves a large percentage of foreign control, is at the heart of many of the Democrat concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Qantas is a major earner of foreign currency, which is badly needed to reduce our ballooning foreign debt&mdash;a problem of which the last few days should have made us all too aware. Tourism in this country is widely acknowledged as having a bright future. We are all aware of the vertical integration of the tourist industry, particularly as it affects Japanese tourism in Queensland, the acquisition of tourist resorts, the travel by Japanese tourists on Japanese airlines and so on. This burgeoning industry is already Australia's largest export earner, reaping $7.3 billion in foreign currency annually. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Questions must be asked about the wisdom of allowing foreign players access to a sizeable chunk of valuable profits which would otherwise make massive contributions to reduction of that debt. The larger the foreign equity in Qantas, the more the profits flow offshore. Foreign dollars earned through Australian enterprises should be used in the national interest to pay off our debt and not to rack up profits for ring-ins. This is why we will attempt to limit foreign ownership levels in the privatisation of Qantas and other ventures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe the Government's proposed 35 per cent limit on foreign ownership, with a 25 per cent limit on any one person, is too high. In the committee stage, we will attempt to reduce both of these limits. While the 25 per cent threshold per shareholder is below the legal definition of a controlling interest&mdash;Senator MacGibbon referred to this&mdash;under these terms foreigners would be able to exert effective, or de facto, control over the company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We further reject the idea that a substantial foreign equity is essential to allow our airline to operate in the age of mega-carriers. While Qantas, even now that it has merged with Australian Airlines, remains small fry in this emerging age of mega-carriers, international evidence makes it clear that room exists for, if you like, boutique airlines. I would not quite put Qantas in that category, but I draw attention to the small time transatlantic carrier, Virgin Airlines, which started up in the 1980s covering one of the most cut-throat and competitive international routes, the Trans-Atlantic route, and which is making good profits. This airline is smaller than Qantas and operates on routes far more competitive than our airline's main international hauls. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In attempting to limit the amount of foreign equity in the privatised carrier as well as the total amount any one foreign player may acquire, we want to increase the scope for small shareholder participation for equity reasons. I was quite taken with Senator MacGibbon's idea of equity ownership by the workers in Qantas itself or Qantas-Australian Airlines. History reveals a significant transfer of wealth occurs during privatisation processes. Privatisation tends to involve underpricing of share issues, as we saw in the Commonwealth Bank share issue and the privatisation of both British Airways and Air New Zealand. Limits on foreign equity, such as the Democrats are proposing, will optimise opportunities for Australian shareholders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another key reason to limit foreign ownership is that, should Australians ever want to repatriate the airline, the smaller the foreign equity the easier the task will be. We also believe, given international trends towards mega-carriers with 40 per cent foreign equity, that it is highly likely a future government will attempt to increase the foreign equity threshold in Qantas. A low equity base rate provides a better chance to stave this process off; and that in the long term is in the national interest. The Democrats do not accept that Qantas must become a mega-carrier to survive. As I have already argued, international evidence exists to support smaller airlines and Qantas is further advantaged by operating in a partially captive niche market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, Qantas has fostered exceptional goodwill in this country. It has helped countless Australians stranded abroad. It has provided assistance in times of internal turmoil and in the face of natural disaster. It is at the forefront of a burgeoning industry&mdash;one which will significantly contribute to reducing the blow-out in our foreign debt. As I said earlier, it also has an exceptional safety record. Australians have a great deal of confidence and pride in their national carrier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats remain philosophically opposed to wholesale privatisation and believe that excessive foreign control of our national icons is against the national interest.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not surprising that Senator Coulter, in his closing remarks, on behalf of the Australian Democrats, claimed that the passage of the Qantas Sale Bill, which will result in the privatisation of Qantas, will mark a sad day. He said in his opening remarks, about 20 minutes ago, that government ownership of enterprises is equal to the people's ownership of those enterprises. I was not surprised to hear Senator Coulter say that, given the general philosophical position of the Democrats these days. But it was certainly surprising that he should try to raise that discredited old socialist theory in this debate about Qantas, because a theory is all that particular claim is.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ownership of an enterprise implies a measure of control. Certainly, direct shareholders who have invested in a private company do have a measure of control over that company. To suggest that the Australian people, through government ownership, have the same measure of control over a government-owned business enterprise is patent nonsense. People elect a government to deal with a wide range of policy matters and issues, not simply to manage one particular government business enterprise which, according to the socialist theory which we have heard Senator Coulter espouse, the people, through that government ownership, own themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a very tenuous link between the people and a government business enterprise through that government ownership. That is one very important reason why governments have no business running business enterprises. It is a very important reason why government business enterprises ought to be privatised. There are other reasons, such as matters of efficiency, competitiveness and access to capital for the growth of that enterprise. Certainly, there is no justification for governments continuing to own business enterprises in the modern era. Even the Government has recognised that fact and is now proceeding to privatise Qantas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Six months ago the Keating Government announced that Qantas would purchase 100 per cent of Australian Airlines and that this newly merged airline of the previous two operators would be completely privatised with a 35 per cent foreign ownership limit. However, in the previous year, 1991, the Government had announced that only 49 per cent of Qantas and all of Australian Airlines would be sold separately well before the conclusion of this year. Under those provisions, neither airline could bid for the other. In February of this year, there was yet another announcement that the two airlines would be allowed to bid for each other, that Qantas would fly domestic routes and that other local airlines would fly international routes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is clear from this continually changing feast with respect to privatisation of Qantas in Australia is the Keating Government's complete inability to conduct even an elementary exercise in privatisation. It is a very interesting time for the airline industry in Australia&mdash;for governments, passengers and airlines. On the one hand, we are faced with substantial policy changes that were initiated in the One Nation statement and their presumed implementation, however slowly. On the other hand, we are faced with the forever changing effects within the international airline industry itself. Both of these factors will have a profound effect on Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's policy of multiple designation, which it has pursued in negotiations with bilateral aviation partners, has become accepted in most parts of the world. In tandem with this pursuit has been the achievement of significant capacity increases in major markets, providing scope for entry by Australian carriers. There is agreement with New Zealand for a freeing up of the trans-Tasman route so as to service foreign countries from the other host country, and Qantas has obtained direct entry to the domestic market through its unused seats on domestic sectors of international services. All of this has taken Australia to a position where the unusual barrier between Australia's inter-national and domestic air service markets appears to provide existing carriers with an opportunity for expansion. Of course, it is the disappearance of that pre-existing barrier that will allow a great expansion in air services in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a consequence of those changes, we come to the legislation before us today, the Qantas Sale Bill 1992, which gives effect to what is apparently the final decision of this Government with regard to the current state of Australian aviation. Although the Liberal and National parties are not opposing this legislation, it does astound me that this Labor Government has taken so very long to take even this degree of action and that its path has been so circuitous. The way in which this sale has been delayed and its status changed is simply further testimony to this decaying Government's incapacity to manage not merely this issue but, of course, the broader issues of the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sad history of this Government's aviation industry policy and of the entire Qantas privatisation approach is simply one which highlights dithering and decay on the part of this Government. Foreign companies that want to buy into Qantas are still attempting to obtain information on the company. Privatisation initiatives should have been undertaken years ago by this Government, not merely in recent months. The real tragedy is that the privatisation of Qantas did not come about in the early 1970s, as many coalition members have long advocated. As I said earlier, governments have no place running businesses and they have no place running airlines, particularly in the way in which this Labor Government has done by incurring massive debts and losses and harbouring monumental internal inefficiencies&mdash;in effect, keeping a massive failure in the air at taxpayers expense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the 1970s enormous changes have taken place in the aviation industry worldwide. Qantas has been a member of the premier international group of airlines&mdash;those airlines which flew what were previously known as the Commonwealth routes. Arrangements existed between Qantas and the former BOAC. Air India and even South African Airways were also involved as well as some of the other major leaguers. What happened at that time was an eventual disintegration of these players and the emergence of the ASEAN airline carriers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government was caught out at that time, just as it has been caught out all this time later. Undoubtedly something should have been done during the years of the Whitlam Government because that is when new approaches to aviation were taking place. No action was taken and as a result the fit and proper expansion of our international airline did not occur. Two years ago the Labor Party was frothing at the mouth about Qantas and privatisation; it was very uncomfortable and very much at sea with this big issue. That is why it took the Government so long to get its act together&mdash;and it is still not there yet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party privatisation debate centred on the outrage of selling the so-called `family silver'&mdash;Qantas was regarded as such&mdash;rather than getting to the basics and finding out exactly what went on within the company. Not only has this Government impaired our own Australian international airline through too many years of protection; as we only too sadly know, it has also plunged more than 11 per cent of Australians into unemployment through similar inaction in other areas of much needed and desperately needed micro-economic reform. As we know, this Government has all but sent Australia broke as a consequence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the past two years there have been massive and fundamental changes elsewhere, but nothing has changed adequately in Australia under the Hawke and then the Keating governments. With the collapse of communism in eastern Europe we have even seen huge sections of Russia's Aeroflot airline privatised. But only now after years of procrastination do we see this Labor Government finally getting around to privatising Qantas and organising a firm and distinctive policy on the matter. As with everything else this Government touches, the go-slow effect seems to prevail and there is very little progress. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The four most profitable world airlines do not include Qantas among them. British Airways, Singapore Airlines, Cathay Pacific and Thai International take the four top spots. It is British Airways, now fully privatised, which is making real inroads into the requirement to have a staff shareholding. This is something which a privatised Qantas must also reflect, because it is this very factor which in large measure has assisted British Airways to get where it is today. Employee participation in ownership and a wider distribution of shares in the airline will prove positive steps for the community and should be encouraged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a major shortcoming of this legislation that the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins) has chosen not to enshrine within it a mechanism whereby employees could participate in the ownership of Qantas. It should be readily evident to any clear-thinking person that it is extremely important for employees to participate in ownership, because having part-ownership in the enterprise in which they work provides them with greater motivation. Singapore Airlines has taken initiatives in this area and is now in a similar position to that of British Airways, despite still having some government money in the airline. We all know how successful Singapore Airlines has been. Both Cathay Pacific and Thai International are well on the way to privatisation and also reflect strong and high profits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition supports this Bill in the sense that it is well past time for the Government to unbind Qantas from its protective wrappings and to set it up to compete fully and aggressively for a share in the world's air routes. The Prime Minister was hopeful in his One Nation document that both Australian and Ansett would be operating across the Tasman by 1993 at the latest. Well, 1993 is not too far away and I find it difficult to believe, with this Government's record on micro-economic reform, that we will see that claim eventuate before the next year is out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is hoped that with the passage of this Bill the Government will set a better example&mdash;after some futile attempts to establish an appropriate aviation network and after having left the aviation industry in such a degree of uncertainty, following its various changes in direction in recent years. Fundamentally, at least, the Bill addresses a number of national interest safeguards, including that the headquarters of Qantas and its operations will remain in Australia and that the Qantas name is to be reserved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us hope that the Prime Minister does not want to change the name as he does our national flag or we might even see competitions in our schools to replace the flying kangaroo as well as the Australian flag. Our internationally recognised marsupial is one of Australia's best national treasures and must remain identified with Qantas if any semblance of our international identity is to endure in the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill provides for the company to be incorporated in Australia and for the chairman and two-thirds of the board to be Australian citizens. Total foreign ownership is not to exceed 35 per cent, which I believe is the internationally accepted limit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are three final points to which I wish to refer. The first is that it is shameful that one of our most important pieces of legislation relating to our international aviation industry has come to us through the guillotine in the other place. Such constraints of time not only diminish the importance of the legislation for the future of the industry in Australia, but also confirm what many in our community have long thought: a government which rams important pieces of legislation through the Parliament without proper time for detailed debate makes itself less worthy to remain in government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, while it is important for airlines from Australia to have access to markets in other countries when we give airlines from those countries access to Australia, Qantas should not be able to prevent those airlines flying into Australia just because it does not wish to operate on a particular route. I particularly refer to the continuing failure of this Government to allow the establishment of a convenient air link between Australia and Chile. The report of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade on Australia's relations with Latin America emphasised the importance of improving air links between Australia and South America. The Government has provided a favourable response to this Senate report, but, as it did with the Qantas sale, prevaricates and fudges when it comes to doing anything practical about its recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During my visit to Chile in July, I had discussions with LAN-Chile, which was extremely hopeful that a visit from Australian transport officials a week or so later would finalise agreement for services to begin; but agreement has still not been achieved. It is my advice that this is because Qantas does not wish to operate the Chile-Australia route but is insisting on unreasonable restrictions before agreeing that LAN-Chile can operate the route. I understand that Qantas is insisting in particular that LAN-Chile should agree to operate a direct flight from Santiago to Australia and not be allowed to pick up passengers at Easter Island or Tahiti. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an unreasonable, dog-in-the-manger attitude on the part of Qantas. If Qantas is not prepared to operate a service itself, a service which is very necessary to the development of Australia's trade and investment relations with Latin America, this Government should not acquiesce in its demands for restrictions on the operators of an airline such as LAN-Chile, which is prepared to take the commercial risk of developing a new route which will benefit Australia and Chile. The Government should immediately conclude an air services agreement with Chile which is satisfactory to LAN-Chile so that this urgently needed service can commence forthwith. The Government should not be doing the bidding of Qantas when Qantas is being unreasonable in its attitude.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that the Opposition will not be opposing the Bill, my third point concerns the completion of this privatisation process in as short a time as possible. It is, of course, not the intention to sell Qantas lock, stock and barrel to overseas interests, because foreign ownership must not exceed 35 per cent. What happens in terms of the capital raising for the privatisation if there are no overseas bidders or if we choose not to accept such overseas bidders as are offering?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Qantas has enjoyed 45 years in government hands, and I would say that very little, if any, of that time was invested in finding out just how much flying the kangaroo was doing or what it could do given different conditions and different management. Given the changes in the Government's policy on that matter, it will not be surprising if the sale remains unsettled well into next year. Given the Government's past record and sullied reputation on the speed of micro-economic reform, it will remain a prickly affair of control with regard to the Government selling Qantas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, it is important that this privatisation be completed as quickly as possible, but that is not likely to occur given the Government's mismanagement of this issue over an extended period. It has long been the policy of the Liberal and National parties to privatise Qantas and it is on that basis, despite the fact that the Government, we believe, has mismanaged this process, that we support this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to contribute to the debate on the Qantas Sale Bill 1992, to support the Government's action and to join with my colleague Senator Chapman in pointing out some of the deficiencies in the Labor Government's privatisation programs over the last few years and the uncertainty that these have created around the sale of Qantas. The Government can be commended properly for finally, after a number of years, coming to a sensible sale arrangement. As Senator Chapman said, the destruction of the artificial barriers between domestic and international air traffic in Australia will be a benefit to consumers. We would expect the privatisation of Qantas to have major benefits to consumers and to Australia's potential to develop its tourism market.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A brief look at the Government's privatisation program over the last few years shows that the targets for the proceeds of the sales, which are usually announced around about Budget night, generally wither away quite disturbingly as we move towards the end of the financial year. One needs to question&mdash;perhaps the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins) will respond at some stage to this&mdash;the quality of advice the Government is receiving on the value of its proceeds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first privatisation program of this Government was in 1988-89 when it forecast an income of $700m in that year from privatisation. The actual achievement was only $535m, a shortfall of 24 per cent. For the following year, 1989-90, it estimated $1.2 billion and achieved $1.068 billion, a shortfall of only 11 per cent. In the next year, 1990-91, it made a target of $1 billion and achieved only $162m, a shortfall of 84 per cent. In the last financial year, the Government made an estimation of proceeds of $625m and made the remarkable achievement of actually having a negative income&mdash;obviously due to costs incurred in relation to organising the privatisation of some of these things&mdash;of $302m, a shortfall of 148 per cent. I think this highlights the point made by Senator Chapman in relation to the quality of the privatisation program operated by the Hawke and Keating governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From my memory of the privatisation debate, in the early 1980s when the Liberal Party first proposed privatisation as a way of making Australia more efficient, creating jobs and creating the opportunity for people and employers to get involved in these enterprises, members of the Labor Party were very strident opponents of privatisation. That was only a few short years ago. I remember advertisements appearing on television around Australia with none other than Graham Kennedy saying that the Liberal Party was proposing to sell off the family jewels to pay for next week's groceries. Of course, it was only a few short years later&mdash;only two years, I think&mdash;that the Labor Party embraced the privatisation policies which the Liberal Party had been proposing for most of the last decade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although privatisation has become a popular policy in Australia in the last few years, a lot of people mistakenly think it was Margaret Thatcher or Ronald Reagan who invented privatisation. I remind the Senate that it was Adam Smith who, in book 5, chapter II, part 1 of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Wealth of Nations</EMPHASIS>, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In every great monarchy of Europe the sale of the crown lands would produce a very large sum of money, which, if applied to the payment of the public debts, would deliver from mortgage a much greater revenue than any which those lands have ever afforded to the crown . . . When the crown lands had become private property, they would, in the course of a few years, become well improved and well cultivated.</PARA>
<PARA>So it is not a modern idea. I am sure that not even Adam Smith would claim responsibility for the idea of selling Crown assets to ensure that a country achieves greater prosperity for its citizens. But, indeed, it was Margaret Thatcher who pioneered many of the privatisation processes which Australia is just beginning to adopt now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is of great benefit to Australia that, even though we have dragged our heels somewhat on the privatisation process in relation to our trading partners, we can, of course, learn a lot from the mistakes made by the Thatcher Administration and privatisation in other parts of the world. As someone who has studied privatisation for most of the last 10 years, I can say that it will be of enormous benefit to this Government, and to a Hewson government when it is elected next year, to be able to draw on international advice and experience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of Labor's flirtation with privatisation in the last few years, we have already seen in Australia the development of some significant support advice on privatisation in the merchant banking area and amongst stockbrokers, legal and accounting firms and even advertising and public relations firms. It has become a specialist area for most of these disciplines and, of course, that will help the privatisation programs of both the Government and the Liberal and National parties should we gain government next year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the objectives of privatisation is, of course, how one devotes the proceeds from those privatisation sales. The Fightback package proposes realising $15 billion worth of sale proceeds in the next three years. I certainly hope that our estimations are more accurate than those of the Government. One of the things that the Opposition puts forward in Fightback, in contrast to the Government, is the use of those privatisation proceeds. We intend to use the proceeds from the privatisation sales to reduce public debt interest. We have estimated in Fightback that in the year 1993-94 that reduction would be $228m, in 1994-95 it would be $504m&mdash;over half a billion dollars&mdash;and it would be the same in 1995-96. In other words, in 1990-91 constant dollars, over a three-year period there would be a total effect on the Budget of $1.289 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is in stark contrast to this Government's record. It is extremely unlikely that we will be able to achieve the $1.6 billion target for privatisation, of which the Qantas sale package is obviously a crucial element. The $1.6 billion is an integral part of the Government's current year Budget. It is worth considering that Australia's social security expenditure for 1992-93 is estimated to be in the realm of $39 billion, or $105m a day. If the Government achieves its entire privatisation program and gets the $1.6 billion in the kitty by the end of the year, that will have the remarkable effect of paying for 15 days of welfare spending. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The money has already been spent. We are talking about how we can get these privatisation proceeds in. Most Australians would be horrified to know that we have to sell these national business enterprises and put the proceeds towards current year spending. The placing of those proceeds towards repatriation of public debt would be far more beneficial to every taxpayer in Australia and every future taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The objectives of privatisation should always be to increase the opportunity for consumers and taxpayers to maximise their investment, as to whether they should buy a slice of Qantas, or as taxpayers in the role of consumers who choose to use a previous public enterprise. We want lower costs and better service. The other objective, which has been referred to by Senator MacGibbon, is to broaden share ownership and particularly to encourage employees to take a stake in the enterprise in which they are employed. As Senator MacGibbon quite properly said, when there is an enterprise with 10,000 or 12,000 people involved in it, it takes an enormous achievement to ensure that each one of those employees is working very hard to achieve corporate goals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those of us in this chamber who are some of the most frequent fliers in Australia know very well that the service a person is rendered on an aeroplane is a mix of many hundreds of people trying to ensure that the travel experience is a good one. If one link in that management travel service is bad, then that person's experience with the airline will be less than satisfactory and, because of the choice there is now, he or she will not fly with that airline again. That applies to ticketing; the way a person is treated in the transit lounge or in any other lounge; the seating arrangements; the way the meal is served; the way the baggage is handled; and the way a person is treated when leaving the airport and jumping into a taxi or bus&mdash;it involves the whole travel experience. When people are travelling internationally and they are very tired, worn out, angry and grumpy, they appreciate the higher service levels. As I said, every employee of an airline must pull his weight and be focused on the achievement of the goal, which for an airline should be delivering a worthwhile service and leaving customers with a happy experience. These matters were well canvassed by Jan Calzon, the head of Scandinavian Airlines, in his book about service and the value of customers to airlines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe in privatisation. We support this Bill because we want to see expanded opportunities for the private sector, the free enterprise sector, and a reduction in the total size of government, which therefore ensures that the burden of taxes on citizens is lowered and that they can invest further money in productive enterprise. The important thing about the privatisation of Qantas is that it is pushed out into the market where, if it succeeds and can raise more capital, it will get bigger and flourish, provide better services and better returns to the shareholders. That is something that has not been achieved. I think speakers from all sides of the chamber&mdash;Senator Bruce Childs and his faction may disagree&mdash;would realise that over the last few years Qantas has been stymied by lack of investment capital. It is not fair that an airline with such a tremendous reputation should be shackled in that way. The sale of Qantas in the next few months will unclip its wings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to look broadly at some of the benefits of privatisation to try to convince Senator Coulter&mdash;which is probably a waste of my time&mdash;that privatisation can have enormous benefits, particularly for low and middle income earners. Australia now has over a million people who do not have jobs. We have an enormous foreign debt. One of the worst attributes of that enormous foreign debt is that there is now a whole generation of Australians&mdash;I am not talking about just the younger generation but of people in their 40s and 50s who have lost their jobs and are having enormous difficulties getting back into the work force to look after and maintain their families&mdash;who cannot get their foot on the bottom rung of the ladder in our society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These people wake up every morning with a terrible outlook because they cannot find a job and they do not know how they are going to progress in this world. They have all been to school, and some have been to university. In some cases they have had jobs. It is a terrible position for them to be in. I am sure that honourable senators on both sides of the chamber have been exposed to hundreds of people in these circumstances. We, as a parliament, must ensure, then, that we create a society where these people will have the opportunity to get their feet on the bottom rung of the ladder. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we stick with the old notions of saying dogmatically and philosophically that we must maintain organisations such as Qantas under the ownership of government, we will not achieve this objective. One of the benefits for Australia in being one of the latecomers to privatisation activity is that it has been proven around the world that bodies that have been privatised have been able to achieve outstanding growth rates, outstanding success and outstanding increases in productivity. A study done by the World Bank, called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The welfare consequences of selling public enterprise</EMPHASIS>, which involved a very thorough analysis of 12 privatisations in four different countries&mdash;namely, Britain, Chile, Malaysia and Mexico&mdash;showed that the average annual net gains for GBEs was 26 per cent. The study concentrated entirely on non-privatisation aspects of the increase; in other words, it took away all the factors not directly attributable to privatisation in trying to assess the average annual net gains in productivity. The bank identified some key factors in regard to why these achievements were made: firstly, higher investment; secondly, managerial innovation; thirdly, better pricing of services; and, fourthly, a more productive work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put it to the Australian Democrats and to the chamber that if privatisation in those four countries&mdash;as shown in this thorough study&mdash;has been able to achieve higher investment, managerial innovation, better pricing of services and a more productive work force, then it is very dog in the manger-ish, very negative and very reactionary to oppose the privatisation process when we know very well that Qantas can achieve all of those things for Australia. The sale of Qantas can help to increase the number of jobs and the number of international visitors coming to Australia. That will create positive benefits that it just cannot achieve, and has not been able to achieve, for Australia as a government owned enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the Government deserves congratulations for its reforms to airline businesses over the last few years. They have certainly been late in coming, but they have been most worth while. One of the matters which concerned me at the time that Compass Airlines came on the scene was the matter of having a deregulated sky but a highly regulated ground. As I said earlier, the travel business is not just what the cost of the plane fare is or what the schedule is; it relates to the total experience of people getting to the airport, into the lounge, into the plane, and so forth. If Australia is to develop its airline industry and its tourism industry, then it is very important that we have sensible arrangements on the ground. Those of us who have had the privilege of travelling internationally and then have had to transfer to a domestic flight in Australia know that we have a major problem; that is, when one lands at an international terminal and needs to get onto a domestic flight, in most capital cities, one has to travel a long distance, put one's baggage into a taxi or bus, and then travel across to another terminal. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. Senator Bell and Senator Collins are reinforcing my point. If Australia wants to be internationally competitive in this area, we need to look at the problem of facilities on the ground. The Opposition proposes to privatise airports. We hope that that will be a positive step in ensuring that there is even more competition between ground services and that airlines have equal opportunities to access services on the ground. Furthermore, we hope to encourage infrastructure expenditure on the ground so that we can have sensible ground arrangements for national and international travellers, because one spends a lot of time on the ground when travelling internationally.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Campbell and the other speakers in the debate for their contributions to it. I also reject any ideological dogmatism in respect of privatisation, but I reject it firmly both ways. Some industries are truly competitive and operations are clearly enhanced when businesses are run in private hands. I believe that the airline industry is one of those.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But privatisation is not the cure-all of everyone's problems, as the Opposition would have us believe. A contemporary example of that is the Federal Opposition's proposal to privatise our ports. Because of our demography, the enormous capital costs of our ports and the fact that they are widely dispersed, they are not able to truly compete. Ports in Europe, for example, can be truly competitive because they are closely spaced with not very great distances between them; if people do not like one port, they can go to the next. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The same approach is evidenced by the conservative Government in New South Wales rejecting the privatisation proposition. The New South Wales State Minister for Transport indicated that, as far as the New South Wales Government is concerned, there are far greater advantages for it in the corporatisation of its ports than having them sold. I agree that at this point in our history&mdash;I am not suggesting that it should be fixed in time&mdash;that is the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The same applies to our airports. I am not suggesting that some airports may not at some future time be improved by sale. For example, at some future time when the second Sydney airport is truly competitive with the existing airport in Sydney it may well be in the national interest to sell both airports. But as overseas experience has shown&mdash;and Canada is a classic example&mdash;this issue is not something to be dogmatically approached. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that it is in the national interest in a real sense for Australia to have a very fine, up to date, modern network of airport infrastructure around the whole country. Our population is not entirely concentrated in Sydney and Melbourne. There are Australians who, thank goodness, choose to live elsewhere. They are assisted by having a modern airport infrastructure which, I have to say quite frankly&mdash;certainly in the case of isolated places such as Darwin&mdash;would not be able to be provided if it were operated entirely on a private basis. The magnificent airport terminal in Darwin&mdash;which I believe without question it is in the national interest to have at that gateway&mdash;will probably not be fully in the black for something like 10 years. So there is a place for public ownership, but I believe that airlines have gone well past it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to prolong the debate, but I want to lay to rest one great myth that there is some great public benefit in the government owning an airline. There was once. There was a time when Australian Airlines regularly serviced ports which it would never have serviced had it been a private commercial concern. But those days are long gone. Australian Airlines currently services about a quarter of the ports that it serviced in the 1970s. Even since that quite recent time, it no longer services 75 per cent of the ports it serviced in those days. It has been operating as a commercial entity for a very long time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Campbell correctly alluded to the very discerning demands of frequent fliers. He is absolutely right: business travel is a very lucrative part of the operations of any airline. Frequent fliers often make their decisions about on which airlines they will travel on quite small differences. Senator Campbell might be very interested to know that recently I was shown a computer print-out of one major Australian airline's revenue in terms of passengers per kilometre travelled. Top of the list was yours truly. Senator Campbell may be interested to know that he was No. 2. It might be a combination of having young children and coming from a long way from Canberra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was somewhat puzzled by Senator Chapman's contribution. I know it is heresy to say this, but sometimes I have wondered whether taxpayers get full value for money for the fact-finding trips on which politicians, ever assiduous in making endless sacrifices in the public interest, are sent overseas. Senator Chapman puzzled me somewhat in belting me around the ears about the Government's failures in providing a direct link from Chile to Australia. He advised us that he in fact had been there as part of a parliamentary delegation. In advancing the interests of Chile and its aviation interests, he wanted me to institute direct flights between Lima and Australia. I was a bit puzzled by that, considering that Lima is the capital of Peru. Perhaps when we are in a position to advance the interests of Chile we will do so by providing flights from Santiago instead of the port that Senator Chapman wants us to service. Obviously Chile made a huge impact on him when he was there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to the extraordinary contribution made to the aviation debate by Senator Short, a senior coalition frontbencher, in a speech that he gave in Sydney to an aviation seminar when he laid down the coalition's aviation policy. I described that policy as being an open skies policy. It was pleasing to note that some Opposition speakers during this debate supported my position on this. I took some exception to this because I said that it was important for Australian governments to be mindful of the interests of our own carriers and to negotiate these extremely valuable rights on a reciprocal basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Short then went on three dot points later to make the extraordinary statement that under a coalition government other Australian carriers would have the opportunity to service international routes but only if Qantas was given first right of refusal. I thought that was an extraordinary statement to make. We have established a commission independent of the Government that will determine how these routes are distributed. It is an extraordinary thing, on the one hand, to say one will have an open skies policy and, on the other hand, say three paragraphs later that one will allow only Australian carriers other than Qantas to service a route if Qantas does not want to do it and brushes the crumbs off the table. I reject that position completely. I actually tabled the page from Senator Short's speech where he said that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a public response a few days later&mdash;it is still to be clarified by the coalition&mdash;Senator Short took me to task and said that I had misinterpreted the coalition's policy; I am quoting from his press release if people think I am making this up. He said that I had totally misinterpreted the coalition's policy; it did not have an open skies policy at all; it had an open up the skies policy. The question of only providing for international carriers other than Qantas to be able to service routes&mdash;if Qantas does not want those routes&mdash;is still to be clarified by the coalition. I look forward to that clarification. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far as other matters that were raised during the debate are concerned, including the important question of the revenue, I make it clear that the $1.6 billion in the Budget does not simply refer to revenue obtained from the sale of Qantas. It in fact refers to revenue obtained by the sale of a number of government assets of which Qantas is a part. I was pleased to hear Senator MacGibbon comment very strongly in support of an employee share scheme for the company. The Government fully intends that to happen; it will happen. Indeed, Senator MacGibbon has no doubt seen the small&mdash;but important&mdash;technical amendment circulated by the Government. It will be moved during the committee stage and is to expedite the employee share scheme so that it can go ahead without any complications at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator MacGibbon referred to the number of employees of the combined Qantas-Australian. He is correct in saying that it is a very large company. The combined total staff is currently about 27,000&mdash;it is very large. That is despite the very significant staff restructuring that has occurred in the past and is still occurring as we speak. It is extremely important to ensure that those employees get an opportunity on an equitable basis to be part of that arrangement. I have been advised that there is a letter waiting for me after this debate from the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) on that very subject. That is being advanced currently by negotiations between the Government and the company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of Senator Coulter's contributions about wanting 51 per cent of the company retained, I have to confess that it hurts me deeply to have to agree with Senator MacGibbon about anything, but I strongly support the comments he made in that respect. He is absolutely right about the problem of the 49 per cent sale. As the Minister who took this matter to Cabinet, it was not just a question of the revenue that was involved; it was simply good aviation policy. The problem with the 49 per cent is that it actually gave the worst of both worlds. As Senator MacGibbon correctly said, it would have depressed the sale price for that 49 per cent because potential investors would find an entity that still had a government majority operating in it to be an unattractive investment. The trouble is that it would have left us with the down side, that is, having sold 49 per cent, the Government&mdash;having a majority shareholding&mdash;would still be responsible for recapitalising the airline to get it to a reasonable debt equity ratio. In terms of getting that gearing ratio to something respectable such as 60 : 40, the problem is that we are talking about expenditure off the Budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the greatest respect to the Australian Democrats, if they want to take that off the Budget we are talking of a figure of around $2 billion. Frankly, I have to say to them, unblushingly, that if it is a choice between building schools, hospitals, railways and roads, or putting $2 billion of public money into an airline to subsidise the smoked salmon up in first class, then I do not think that that is a particularly sensible way in which to spend that large a sum of money. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is highly debatable in terms of the overall public benefit&mdash;and that is the test&mdash;that comes from continued public ownership of an asset. As I said before, there are clear cases to be made for public ownership of assets. I have mentioned two during this debate. One was airport terminals. At this point in our development in Australia, under certain circumstances we need to maintain the impetus of getting tourists here and ensuring that they have an enjoyable stay while they are here. Senator Campbell was absolutely right about that. Most tourists who visit Australia want to visit more than one port. Although most of them do want to start at ports such as Sydney and Melbourne, they want to go elsewhere after that. I think ensuring that tourists have a national network of high quality major airports is assisted currently by continued public ownership of those assets.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I do not suggest&mdash;and I made that clear&mdash;that that is something that is fixed in time. As this country develops, as our tourist industry becomes more advanced than it is now, and as these assets grow&mdash;and currently the Federal Airports Corporation has a fairly aggressive program of some $2 billion worth of new capitalisation of airport infrastructure already in train around Australia&mdash;then it may well be that that is assisted in particular situations by the kind of airline process that we are dealing with today. But in an open, competitive area which the airlines are in now, I believe that the public interest without question is being served by the legislation that is in front of us here today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I indicate also, in response to something that Senator Campbell said about the Democrat amendments, that the Government will not be supporting these Democrat amendments. The balance that we have in the legislation that is currently before the Senate has been very carefully and painstakingly assessed and measured. We believe that it is the necessary foundation for a successful sale and successful future operation of this very important asset, and we will not be making the quite significant changes during the committee stage that these Democrat amendments would cause. I thank honourable senators for their contributions to the debate and for their support for the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA>They are simple technical, but important, amendments. The amendments proposed by the Government relate to the definition of the term `relevant interest'. The Bill seeks to use the concept of relevant interest from the corporations law&mdash;that is, the definition&mdash;to trace foreign ownership and control through company chains. Thus Qantas shares would be classed as `foreign' if foreigners either directly or indirectly have control over the voting rights of those shares or the power to dispose of them. The relevant interest concept could be used to determine the level of foreign ownership and to ensure that it stays within the limits imposed by the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, section 33 of the corporations law could result in a foreigner being deemed as having a relevant interest in Qantas shares held by a subsidiary of Qantas. In particular, the one we are thinking of would be a subsidiary that would be established to conduct an employee share ownership scheme. This would have the unintended effect of adding those shares held by Qantas subsidiaries&mdash;and in this case, of course, it would be by the Australian employees of Qantas&mdash;to the relevant interests of foreigners, thus inappropriately restricting the level of foreign ownership beyond that intended by the Bill. So, essentially, these amendments make the provision for the establishment of an employee ownership scheme without any unnecessary complications. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The comment was, of course, a cheap political shot, which the Minister is entitled to make on these occasions. He did pick up a slip of the tongue on my part in my speech at the second reading stage when I referred to Lima instead of Santiago when talking about the urgent need for air links between Chile and Australia. I must admit the slip of the tongue occurred because, at the same time as I was thinking of the importance of these air links, I was also thinking of the importance of developing shipping links between Australia and South America, which are particularly relevant to Lima. These slips of the tongue do occur from time to time. It is undoubtedly the air link between Santiago and Australia which is urgently required. I note that although the Minister did pick up that slip of the tongue, he failed to address the substance of my argument, which is the delay which is occurring and the way Qantas is being allowed to ensure that that delay occurs.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>These amendments deal with the extent of foreign ownership and the degree to which foreign investment might control Qantas. The first amendment to clause 7, paragraph (1)(a), seeks to substitute for the 35 per cent foreign investment a much lower limit of only 20 per cent. While we have just voted against the privatisation, we believe&mdash;and I think the arguments were well set out in my speech at the second reading stage&mdash;that a smaller level of foreign investment would be advantageous. I think that was also supported by the remarks made by Senator MacGibbon in relation to the desirability of encouraging more Australian investment and also, of course, investment by the staff of Qantas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second amendment is to paragraph (1)(b) of clause 7 and it seeks to reduce the maximum allowable investment of an individual foreign person from 25 per cent to 10 per cent. The justification of this&mdash;as was pointed out both by me and Senator MacGibbon&mdash;is that 25 per cent as a single shareholding is a very significant block and can essentially hold the rest of the company to ransom by the threat to withdraw that shareholding, to sell it or to manipulate it in some way. We support the idea of reducing that individual foreign investment from 25 per cent to 10 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third amendment is to paragraph (1)(c) and it seeks to reduce the level of impact of foreign investment at the shareholder level. It reduces the proportion of a director's position for which substantial foreign shareholdings can vote from one-third to one-fifth. It reduces the impact at the board level from one-third to one-fifth, again attempting to limit the extent to which that 25 per cent shareholding by a single person and the 35 per cent shareholding by foreign investors can significantly affect the direction of the company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth amendment&mdash;which also relates to that level&mdash;to paragraph (1)(i) increases the proportion of directors who must be Australian citizens from two-thirds to four-fifths. Again, it attempts to redress the imbalance caused by that high 35 per cent foreign investment shareholding and the 25 per cent by one foreign investor so that the influence is reduced at the board level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the fifth amendment to subclause (3) seeks to reduce the minimum foreign shareholding which is defined as substantial from 15 per cent to 5 per cent for the purposes of determining the maximum proportion of directors' positions which such shareholdings can vote for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These amendments are all related. They attempt to reduce the influence of foreign shareholding of individuals and foreign shareholding as a whole by affecting the percentage of foreign shareholding, the percentage which an individual person can hold and the impact of that foreign shareholding at the board level, so that the influence over the national carrier, Qantas, remains substantially Australian. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition is sympathetic to the views expressed by Senator Coulter on behalf of the Australian Democrats but, regrettably, they are not practical and we will be opposing the amendments which are before the Committee. I would like to take a few minutes to explain why they are not practical.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier the Minister for Transport and Communications, Senator Collins, said that it would cost $2 billion to refinance Qantas. I will not enter into a debate about that, but my memory goes back to 1988 when Senator Gareth Evans was in that ministerial portfolio. I thought the figure that Senator Evans was bandying about then was $5 billion. My memory may be wrong but, on the balance of probabilities&mdash;Senator Evans is sometimes a little erratic with figures&mdash;maybe he did use that figure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the point is that a great deal of money is needed to make it an efficient and effective company and we simply cannot afford it. So we come down to the business of having to sell the airline. I do not have any difficulty with selling the airline to private interests but, as I said in my speech, the quantity of overseas ownership is something we have to think about very carefully. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The advice that we have had, and a large part of it comes from the bureaucracy and the Government, is that a 25 per cent holding in one overseas block is the minimal figure that we can have in today's climate. I would accept that. There is enough evidence around that some overseas interests would be quite happy to buy 100 per cent. Fortunately, that is not before us. If we were proposing to sell 100 per cent of the airline, we would lose all those traffic rights which are so valuable and which Senator Collins talks about, and it would no longer be an Australian airline. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, the nation would be bereft of an essential component in its independence. We would lose the independence of an Australian airline. As a by-line, such a sale would be politically unsaleable in my own State of Queensland, not only in the outback areas but in Queensland itself. When the idea was around that the Government might sell 100 per cent of the airline, the protests from the general public were enormous. If I could be allowed a moment of levity, I am sorry that the Government did not proceed with that because we would certainly have got a great deal of political mileage out of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The advantage with having an overseas shareholding is that it will provide, particularly if it is a major airline, essential strategic links. Most travel around the world now involves multiple ports of call for a traveller. The ability to plan that trip by getting access to a worldwide computer net and to make onward bookings is absolutely critical. A company can no longer operate in one nation and be able to provide an efficient travel service; it needs to have access to the resources of another company. That is what this 25 per cent holding will provide for Qantas. The other thing is that, if Qantas is in association with what must be one of the major airlines of the world to take up that 25 per cent holding, it would expect to receive quite a flow-on of traffic from that airline. Since it would have a financial interest in Qantas, presumably it would provide a preferential pathway for its bookings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia needs not only the profits from the sale in this country but also the invisible earnings of maintaining an Australian airline. I think the invisible earnings from Qantas would be at least $2 billion to $3 billion a year, and if the airline is run in a better and more efficient way&mdash;as I am quite sure it will be as a private enterprise&mdash;those profits to the Australian nation will be commensurately larger. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the fallacies of the argument advanced by the Democrats this afternoon is the assumption that there will be no more profitability from a privately owned airline than from a government owned airline. I would differ from that very greatly. I well remember a conversation I had with one of the chairmen of Qantas in the immediate past, who came to the company with a long and successful experience in private industry. I will not mention his name, but I said to him in private, `What's it like running Qantas?'. He said, `You know, David, the big difference between Qantas and what I did before is the fact that there are no hungry shareholders. There is no pressure on me at all to perform. There is no pressure on the Qantas board to perform'. That is one of the realities of commercial life. There are not the pressures on a government business enterprise that exist in the straight commercial world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that, when we have the overseas shareholding in the company, the public benefactions in the national interest that have come from Qantas are not in any way diminished  I am mindful that it was Qantas that really started the Flying Doctor Service. The friendship between Hudson Fysh, Fergus McMaster and John Flynn, who was a Presbyterian minister in western Queensland, led to the formation of the first emergency health services in the western part of Queensland. In 1927&mdash;a few years after Qantas started&mdash;Qantas provided the aircraft for the first Flying Doctor Service. That was as a private company. It was really a great public benefaction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I am on the same vein, it would be wrong to confine that public benefaction to only a private company. After the Second World War when Trans Australia Airlines was formed&mdash;the predecessor of Australian Airlines, which is now totally owned by Qantas&mdash;the support that TAA gave the Royal Flying Doctor Service, as it was then, was really quite considerable. It provided much of the maintenance support for the aircraft. The public commitment that both Australian Airlines and Qantas have made to the good of the Australian community is quite considerable. I hope that the injection of overseas shareholding in the company does not diminish that in any way for the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government will not be supporting these amendments for the reasons already stated by Senator MacGibbon. As would most Australians, I would prefer to have all our major investments entirely in the hands of Australian entrepreneurs and entirely financed by Australian institutions. Regrettably, we do not live in that perfect world. It is important to access foreign investment in our aviation and tourism industries, firstly, to provide the equity, which we often cannot raise domestically, and, secondly, to provide those important links in international business which knows no borders in terms of the lines that are drawn on a map these days.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our tourism industry has never been more important than it is to this country at this time and it is growing rapidly. In the year before last, tourism earned for Australia something in excess of $7 billion in foreign exchange. In the year just past, for which statistics were produced only last week, foreign exchange earnings from tourism in Australia exceeded $8 billion a year. Some 11 per cent of the total economic activity in Australia has been produced from the tourism industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year, international tourist visitation to Australia increased by over 13 per cent. This is in the face of depressed international conditions in many other parts of the world. Australia is ever more seen as an attractive destination. Domestic aviation numbers have increased by 18 per cent over last year. One very exciting statistic on our domestic deregulation, which impacts on the Australian operations of this combined entity for which we are processing this legislation, shows that prior to deregulation some 21 per cent of Australians travelled interstate by air. That figure has leapt from 21 per cent to 37 per cent. That is close to 40 per cent; it has almost doubled since deregulation. So the benefits of these changes are tangible; they are currently flowing through to the Australian economy and, in particular, to ordinary Australians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;While we are on part 3, which deals with the articles of association and the sale of the company, it has been suggested to me that under the present car parking fringe benefits tax Qantas will pay $6m a year extra tax. That will be a consequence of the legislation that was introduced in the last Budget. That, surely, makes the purchase of shares not only for Australians but for overseas prospective purchasers more unattractive. I think the figure of $6m highlights the absolute absurdity of this car parking fringe benefits tax, which has been roundly condemned throughout the length and breadth of this land. It is a stark example of the inequity and unfairness in this tax. I ask the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins), firstly, whether it would be much of an impediment to the sale of the company and, secondly, whether he would talk to his friend and colleague the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) to get a bit of sanity into the Government's policies.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That consideration of the committee stages of the Migration Laws Amendment Bill 1992 and associated bills in committee of the whole after the second readings of the bills be an order of the day for the sitting day next occurring after the day on which the High Court gives its judgment in relation to section 3 of the Migration Amendment Act 1992.</PARA>
<PARA>I believe that this is a most reasonable proposal. I am proposing that the committee stage consideration of the Migration Laws Amendment Bill and associated Bills be postponed until after the High Court brings down its decision tomorrow. I am not proposing, as I would like to have done, that the second reading stage be put off. A number of honourable senators have prepared their speeches and are willing to make them today. Also, some honourable senators who want to make speeches on Bills that will be called on after this package of Bills has been dealt with may have been disadvantaged had a motion to defer the second reading stage been successful. In that sense, my proposal is reasonable and has regard to the convenience of all honourable senators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that it is even more reasonable for the Senate to defer the committee stage of the Bills until the High Court delivers judgment on questions which these Bills deal with. In Lim v. the Commonwealth the High Court has been considering a claim by Lim, on behalf of a number of Cambodian refugees, which challenges portions of the Migration Act that relate to refugees, particularly those portions which relate to mandatory detention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bills that are currently before us, particularly the Migration Reform Bill 1992, go to that part of the Migration Act. In those circumstances, it would be reasonable for the Senate to defer consideration of the committee stage until the judgment of the High Court has been delivered. It may be argued that the High Court will indicate its disapproval of those sections of the legislation which mandate detention in a discriminatory manner. There again, it might be said that the Bills currently before us seek to remove that problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I will be indicating later in the debate, the problem is that a more serious question may arise. The question goes to lawfulness and whether the individuals have been lawfully detained. As I understand it, this legislation seeks to identify a class of people and determine that detention as lawful under those circumstances, thus seeking to remove considerations of the provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am really going to the heart of the legislation which I do not want to do. I simply want to speak to this proposition. The case, which has been heard and upon which a judgment will be made tomorrow, arose out of the decisions of the Parliament when it last considered the migration legislation. I and a number of other senators vigorously opposed section 54S, which has been appealed against. Section 54S of the Migration Act states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A court is not to order the release from custody of a designated person.</PARA>
<PARA>When was this legislation decided? It was decided on a day in May. It was rushed through the House of Representatives and through the Senate on one day&mdash;the day before the Cambodians were to appear before the Federal Court seeking their release from detention pending the outcome of their applications for refugee status. These people were denied their day in court. Had the Government listened to me and other senators, it would not have found itself before the Federal Court because it may have more properly considered the legislation on that occasion and not rushed it through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that it is now unreasonable to refuse again to listen to what the High Court may say. It is unreasonable to refuse to listen to what others might say following the High Court decision. It would indicate to me that those who vote against this motion have a closed mind on this matter, and my concern is that too many people have a closed mind about refugees. They tar them with the same brush. They think that there is an enormous problem out there; whereas in fact of all the refugee status seekers, there have been fewer than 500 boat people. But the public has been given the impression by the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) and some others that there are hundreds of boats out there between here and China and Cambodia being swept down by trade winds or something else and we are about to be overburdened by the rush of asylum seekers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What Mr Justice Einfeld has stated should be heeded. No-one in this chamber would question Mr Justice Einfeld's competency when it comes to refugees or when it comes to human rights. He said that Australia's treatment of refugees is a matter of national shame. I also say that it is a matter of national shame. I believe that the Govern-ment's treatment and administration of the issue of refugees are disgraceful. It is callous, it is uncivilised, and it is bordering on the barbaric. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tonight we heard on SBS another person who had been working for the Department at Villawood saying quite intentionally that it was a deliberate policy to keep these people in detention and to make them snap, so that when they returned to their country of origin they would be a walking advertisement to discourage further departures for Australia.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> A senior officer of the Department also appeared on television and stated that, when it came to refugees, the Department had a culture of rejection. That is a matter of national shame. When people who raise this concern are branded by the Minister as headline seekers, to me, that indicates a closed mind. It indicates an unreasonable attitude; certainly not a caring and compassionate one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those Cambodians have been here for more than three years. They have been locked up&mdash;in detention&mdash;suffering enormous psychological damage. Anyone who has seen the film <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Killing Fields</EMPHASIS> will have got a glimpse of the enormous trauma that people in Cambodia suffered. Those of us who have studied the issue further will recognise the extraordinary problems faced by these people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To say, as the Minister has, that the boat people are queue-jumpers is absolutely false. Are Cambodians queue-jumpers? What do honourable senators think queue-jumping means? Queue-jumping means that people do not go through the normal processes; they do not apply to the Australian Embassy in their own territory or country for entry into Australia. To say that Cambodians are queue-jumpers is a nonsense. It is a  legal nonsense as well because at the time of their departure,</PARA>
<PARA>and for some years before that, Australia had no representatives in Phnom Penh. It did not recognise Democratic Kampuchea, as it was called. Are these people queue-jumpers? They had no facility to seek entry into Australia. They are refugees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday I took the opportunity to visit Villawood and I was concerned to see the effect of long term detention on these people. It was absolutely disgraceful. They are fed, they are clothed&mdash;not by the Department but by charity organisations, and the St Vincent de Paul Society was there&mdash;and they are housed. They are in detention with tall wire fences around them and are not able to get out. They are changed from one location to another. They came from Melbourne to Sydney. They were woken up early in the morning and they had two hours to leave Melbourne. Is that the action of a compassionate government?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to hear what the High Court has to say. It might not say anything, but it will make a judgment in respect of the last lot of laws that we passed and which I and a number of other senators opposed. Nobody opposed it in the House of Representatives, but here at least we did oppose it, and we did hold the matter up for a while. The legislation went through the Parliament so quickly that, prior to the legislation being determined, the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills was unable to give us the benefit of its deliberation. I notice that the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, in its seventh report after the passage of the Bills, took the extraordinary measure of commenting on this legislation, which is the subject of the High Court challenge to be determined tomorrow.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of the legislation which was passed in this chamber and the House of Representatives, the Scrutiny of Bills Committee said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The combined effect of new paragraph 54R(3)(e) and section 54S is that a `designated person' is effectively denied access to the courts for the purposes of determining whether or not they should continue to be detained. This may be considered to be contrary to Article 9, paragraph 4 of the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights, which provides:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Anyone who is deprived of his liberty by arrest or detention shall be entitled to take proceedings before a court, in order that that court may decide without delay on the lawfulness of his detention and order his release if the detention is not lawful.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our nation's record of social justice is tested by our attitude and treatment of those least able to defend themselves. In Australia at present they are the refugees who have fled from persecution and who have a well-grounded fear that if they are returned they will suffer persecution. I raised in the Senate Estimates Committee, and I think Senator Chamarette raised it the other day as well, the question of what guarantees the Government had got from the PRC Government dealing with the Chinese who were forcibly deported by this Government from Port Hedland. It has not said so, but I know what the guarantees are because I have seen the decision of the PRC Central Council of, I think, 12 August, which was well-sounding. Two days later we sent one Chinese student there from Villawood and he was bunged in the slammer immediately, although he is out now. </PARA>

I know that, and I will tell honourable senators later how I know it. I believe that we should pass this motion, as all it does is to say, `Let us listen to what the High Court says about a matter with which this Bill deals. Let us hear what it may have to say about the administration by Australia of the laws relating to refugees'. What is wrong with that? All I am asking the Government for is 24 hours.

Quite consistently throughout his address he spoke of such persons as `refugees'. In other words, Senator Harradine made the determination without any scrutiny of the individual claims of the persons concerned. He has come to his own conclusion&mdash;which speaks to me of a closed mind&mdash;in relation to this matter, rather than there being an individual scrutiny of the particular cases of the persons who have arrived on Australia's shores in an unheralded manner.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Harradine read it and adopted it for the purposes of his address to this chamber. It is an unfair and untrue reflection on both the Department and the policy of the Government. Senator Harradine spoke of people approaching this matter with a closed mind, but I believe that he has brought forward some evidence of the same malady which is the subject of his accusation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I return to the core of the matter that Senator Harradine has brought to the attention of the chamber. Tonight we are engaging in a parliamentary activity as the legislators of the Commonwealth of Australia who are elected by the people. In this case we are trying to deal with the difficult question of the arrival of persons into Australia who do not have any lawful right to be here&mdash;I put to one side whether they can subsequently claim refugee status and have that claim recognised&mdash;and are without any of the normal visas and so on which characterise most people who come here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question is how we deal with these people: what sort of review process they are to be allowed to participate in in order to ensure that their cases are fairly scrutinised; what sort of detention they may be subject to; and what sort of removal process they might then be subject to if their particular claims to stay in Australia are not regarded as substantiated by the merit review process which is to be provided. In other words, we are looking to create a new statutory scheme to deal with these matters that, I remind honourable senators, will come into operation later next year&mdash;not immediately, not within a few weeks and not even within a few months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The High Court will be making its decision on the basis of the current statute. It may be that it will come to a decision that is adverse to certain sections within that statute. If it does, the status and future of the persons concerned will be determined according to the current statute over the next few days, weeks and months. Nothing we do tonight to substitute a completely new regime to operate from later next year will affect the way in which the High Court's decision is given weight and has consequences from tomorrow onwards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that we are in a position tonight&mdash;unlike last time, when Senator Harradine's castigation of the process through the Parliament may have had some substance&mdash;to deliberate upon and consider in a fair way whether to support the policy behind the Migration Laws Amendment Bill and associated Bills. What the High Court says about the present Act is really irrelevant to our consideration of putting in place a completely different regime which will displace that from later next year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I believe that we can go ahead in good conscience and good faith tonight. We can act as a parliament and let the High Court do its work in relation to the present Act. Consequences will flow from its decision tomorrow, but not in a way which can fundamentally affect our consideration of the proper policy to embody in the statute law of Australia tonight. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats will be supporting the motion moved by Senator Harradine. The case before the High Court, Lim v. the Commonwealth, challenges the provisions that were passed by parliament in May this year. I was one of the senators, backed by the Australian Democrats as a party, who strongly opposed the Parliament's intervention, in a court case then proceeding, in a way which gave a direct instruction to the court to find in a particular way. The court could not address the substance of the question as to whether people should be detained. It was simply directed by that legislation to find in a particular way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time that amending legislation created a different class of persons&mdash;persons who do not have the same legal rights as every citizen of Australia and, for that matter, the world; that is, they do not have equality before the courts which judge his or her behaviour or which make decisions on his or her fate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If parliament in May of this year had not passed that legislation, we would now not be faced with this particular case and the judgment that the High Court will hand down tomorrow. That legislation forms the basis of the law as it stands in decisions on asylum seekers and whether they are allowed to remain even on a provisional visa or are to be detained and deported. The amendments that are now before us will be affected by that High Court judgment, which is due to be handed down tomorrow, because that judgment will affect the very basis of the legislation as it stands, which we propose to amend tonight. It almost sounds like a re-run of what happened in May. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">May I also say very briefly, because I believe the substance of the amendments will and should be dealt with later, that the number of people we are dealing with is small&mdash;fewer than 500 in four years. Yet the Government is prepared to pass legislation to `protect' Australia against such people through means which affect a very basic principle of universal justice, namely, that all people deserve equality before the courts of whichever country they happen to be in which determine their fate. On this basis, the Australian Democrats strongly support the proposition that consideration of this Bill be deferred after the second reading debate to enable the Parliament to take account of the High Court judgment to be delivered tomorrow. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I speak on behalf of the Opposition. The legislation that was before us earlier this year was supported by the Opposition as we believe that it is important that the people of Australia's interest in a sound immigration process and a refugee determination process be just, careful and, after due process, followed through. Similarly, shortly this evening the Opposition will be supporting the Migration Laws Amendment Bill and associated Bills, which are the subject of this procedural motion. We do not believe that this is the time to be in any way soft or weakening in representing the interests of the Australian people in the determination of illegal entry into Australia of persons who are not bona fide refugees being able by some mere compassion to remain in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I listened very carefully to Senator Harradine's speech and Senator Spindler's remarks. I note that they voted against the majority of this Senate, and against the majority of the Parliament in the adoption of the original law. It may be the case that they will put contrary arguments when we debate the migration legislation before us this evening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe there is any reason for delay in the Senate's determination of the Migration Laws Amendment Bill 1992 and allied Bills, which are before us. However, two Bills are separate from the matters which are before us now&mdash;that is, matters relating to the adult migrant education program&mdash;and there happens to be considerable interest in a briefing which will occur tomorrow. It is for that reason only that I expect the Government will initiate a delay of the committee stages of two of the Bills which are before us tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the Bill which is the subject of Senator Harradine's motion, I am not convinced by the arguments which have been put that there is a delay. Senator Harradine has asked for one day more, and I hear his plea very clearly. But in fact the terms of the motion ask for consideration the day after the High Court hands down its judgment. For all we know, there may be some slippage and we in the Opposition make it entirely clear to the Senate that we support the Government in the clarification of the law in regard to the detention of persons and the process for determining refugee status. It is for these reasons that the Opposition will be opposing the procedural motion that is before us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, I take this opportunity to agree with that part of Senator Harradine's remarks with which I believe the great majority of Australians, and indeed international observers, would agree concerning the deplorable record of this Government in the handling of those illegal immigrants who have arrived in this country by boat and who are subject to the process of determining their refugee status. Hundreds of illegal immigrants in this country have been detained behind barbed wire for more than three years. It is totally inadequate for the Labor Government to excuse the accusations that are made&mdash;some just, some exaggerated&mdash;about the denial of these persons' human rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is intolerable to the Opposition that persons who arrive here illegally do not have the determination of their status within six months or, at the most, 12 months. But it has been more than three years. I regard that as a failure of government administration and, as has become apparent, a failure to ensure that the law is of such clarity that these matters can be determined justly and fairly on the basis of evidence and with proper representation&mdash;and determined within a reasonable period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw attention to two articles which appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of last Thursday, 3 December. One was written by Jennifer McAsey and the other by Greg Sheridan. I have already brought these articles to the attention of officers advising the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) who are in the chamber tonight. I ask that the allegations which are made in these two articles be answered by the Minister, point by point. These two articles give a description of the deplorable inadequacy of the handling of more than 300 persons who have arrived in Australia illegally. I will quote a few paragraphs of Jennifer McAsey's article, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They were to spend the next five months there. `We had to sleep on the floor without a mattress,' Cong Binh says. `We were not allowed to use the telephone, and if we wrote to our family our letters were opened. It was very hot, and often there was no special food for the baby.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They saw no lawyers for nine months, no welfare workers; their applications for refugee status were filled out with the help of an interpreter and camp security guards.</PARA>
<PARA>That is an uncorroborated article. I would regard it as inexcusable that, in Australia in the 1990s, baby food was not available for babies or that people had to sleep on the bare floor for months without a bed or at least a mattress. I do not believe, on face value, that this is the full story in relation to these boat people in Australia. But I ask the Minister that, for the benefit of the Senate and for the benefit of the entire public of Australia, there be some refutation if it can be made out. To the extent it will not be refuted, it is all the more condemning of this Government and its total inadequacy. I conclude by confirming that, whilst the Opposition is entirely critical of the Government's behaviour in the handling of this process, no case has been made out for any delay in this legislation, and we do not support the motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support Senator Harradine's procedural motion. I will speak only briefly on this matter as I intend speaking later during the second reading debate. The reason I support Senator Harradine's motion is twofold. Firstly, as was mentioned by Senator Spindler, this situation smacks too much of an earlier deliberation we had in this very chamber in which we pre-empted a High Court appeal. I think the previously debated Migration Amendment Bill 1992 which pre-empted the appeal to the High Court cast a shadow over this chamber. As Senator Harradine said earlier, the rushing through of the legislation deprived a particular group of people of their day in court and also contravened the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was glad to see that Senator Tate did not like the accusation of closed minds being made. A way of refuting that is very simple: just a delay of 24 hours, which would allow us to take into consideration the decision that may be brought down in the Federal challenge, is one way of establishing that we do have open minds. Senator Tate said that nothing we do tonight will affect the High Court decision. That may well be so, but it is not the same as saying that what the High Court says about the present Act has nothing to teach us, in light of the mistakes that we made earlier. We cannot act in good faith by acting precipitately once again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My second reason for supporting Senator Harradine's motion is that it is relevant to this particular legislation. This legislation involves the consideration of mandatory provisions. Any consideration of mandatory provisions necessarily moves outside judicial discretion and threatens access to due process. Because the legislation we are dealing with tonight involves such mandatory provisions, we again place ourselves in jeopardy of contravening our duty in relation to the judicial process and international covenants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by adding my support for, and urging honourable senators to give due consideration to, Senator Harradine's motion. It is all very well for Senator Teague to talk in a very concerned manner about the human rights of people detained in custody for years, but I ask him to remember that it was this Parliament that actually pre-empted the appeal of some of those very people who were detained for years awaiting completion of the processing of their refugee status application, depriving them of the right to natural justice and the ability to remove themselves from the dreadful conditions he talked about. I urge all coalition senators to join him and to defer the final consideration of this legislation until after the High Court challenge, as Senator Harradine has proposed. </PARA>

I will summarise Senator Tate's reasons for opposing it. They appear to be three-fold, two of which were given in response to my initial contribution. He said, first, that I had a closed mind because I called people refugees.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Tate does not understand, nor does he realise, what is contained in the United Nations convention relating to the status of refugees. The UN convention uses the term `refugees' in the same manner that I used it. Part one of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Handbook on procedures and criteria for determining refugee status</EMPHASIS>, which is headed `Criteria for the Determination of Refugee Status', states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A person is a refugee within the meaning of the 1951 Convention as soon as he fulfils the criteria contained in the definition . . . Recognition of his refugee status does not therefore make him a refugee but declares him to be one. He does not become a refugee because of recognition, but is recognized because he is a refugee.</PARA>
<PARA>The definition is quite clear; it relates to the person's well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, et cetera. In the mind of that person, he is a refugee. This is one of the problems that the Government has with this matter. It deems every one of those people to be guilty until they can prove somehow that they are innocent. That is a real problem. In my view, that is a contravention of our obligations under this convention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) to say that I have a closed mind simply because I used the title `refugee' in the same manner as the UN convention uses it, shows the ignorance and the closed mind of the Government in this respect. These people are called queue-jumpers&mdash;I have said that it is tragic to call them that&mdash;and rorters. The Minister's own departmental official said on television that there is racism in the Department, that all Chinese are liars&mdash;no Chinese tells the truth, and that Bangladesh has no refugees. The Minister should look at the transcript of the SBS program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second reason Senator Tate opposed my motion is that I accused the Department of carrying on a deliberate policy to make people snap `so when they return they would be walking advertisements to discourage further departures from Australia'. I did not say that. I quoted what an officer contracted by the Department of Immigration, Mr Andrew Biro, said tonight over SBS news. If the Minister had listened to the SBS news, he would have seen that that is precisely what he said. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final statement that Senator Tate made against my reasonable proposition was that the legislation with which we are dealing does not come into effect until next year. I thank Senator Spindler, of the Democrats, and Senator Chamarette, who both dealt with that matter. If it is not proposed that it come into effect until next year, what is the reason for so vigorously opposing my motion, which simply proposes to delay consideration at the committee stage until the High Court delivers its judgment tomorrow?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Spindler, Senator Chamarette and I might have the last laugh in that perhaps the High Court will deliver a judgment which rules the legislation which we opposed and which the Government adopted last time this matter was before the Parliament to be unconstitutional or ultra vires the obligations of Australia in respect of the UNHCR or the ICCPR. Perhaps the judgment will also say something about this Government's deplorable human rights record when it comes to the question of refugees. But that is not why I wanted the delay; I wanted it so that we would be able to consider what the Court has to say. The Court may or may not say what I have indicated, but at least let us see what it says. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very disappointed that the Opposition is not supporting my motion. Senator Teague gave two reasons. First he said that the Opposition was not going to begin to be soft or weakened in its attitudes to illegal immigrants. That is not the issue here. Clearly, there must be fair, due process. Everyone realises that. Those who have spoken in favour of my motion realise that as much as anybody else. We realise the need for fair, due process and proper consideration of refugee status applications&mdash;indeed, of all immigration applications&mdash;in order to prevent queue jumping, et cetera. We agree with what Senator Teague said about that, but I cannot understand why that is an argument for opposing this quite reasonable proposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate has before it the Migration Laws Amendment Bill 1992 and five associated Bills, which are all significant. All of them have been very carefully determined by the Government in consultation with representatives of the parliamentary parties, including my colleague the shadow Minister for immigration and ethnic affairs, Mr Phillip Ruddock. There has been careful consultation in the Opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst I will be raising a number of specific matters with regard to each of the six Bills, the Opposition will not be opposing the second reading of any of the six Bills. However, I make it entirely clear that the Opposition has no confidence in this Government's ability to maximise the Australian people's confidence in immigration programs in this country. We need a change of government in this country, not least to ensure that, with the precise policies of the Liberal and National parties, the Australian people's confidence in the immigration policies of the Government of Australia will be regained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under Labor we have been let down very badly by a succession of Ministers. Let me refer to the continual amendments of legislation that have come before the Parliament in recent years. Firstly, I was a member of the original committee on migration regulations of this Parliament and over several years have spoken for the Opposition on migration legislation before the Senate. In every speech, I have noted the inadequacies of the Government in putting together legislation that can stand and be sound and stable. We have had amendment upon amendment upon amendment all reacting to the failures of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, erratic decisions have been made by the Labor Government. The most notorious of these was the decision made emotionally and subjectively by the Prime Minister at that time, Mr Hawke, when he exempted what turned out to be 40,000 students from China to enable them to stay in Australia for four years, virtually indefinitely, without a clear definition of their status in Australia. We argued that that decision should never have been made. I still believe that the decision was made without consultation by the Prime Minister over the head of the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs at that time, Senator Robert Ray. That sort of erratic decision has blown apart the integrity of Australia's immigration process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that those cases should still be determined on merit case by case. Of course, where after due process there is a case for refugee determination the refugee should be allowed to stay, but I still fully expect three-quarters&mdash;even more&mdash;of those students to return to China and serve their own country. We should not give a special advantage to the people of one nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, the Labor Government has exercised inadequate control, taken the easy options and adopted wrongly balanced immigration policies. I have frequently pointed out to the Senate the Government's inadequate control of the entire migration program and the undermining of the integrity of the program that this has meant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fourthly&mdash;and we have just touched upon this area&mdash;the Government has failed in relation to illegal entrance to Australia. There have been intolerable delays in refugee determination, especially with regard to the boat people. This period will go down as a black mark on Australia's immigration policies and administration. Some people have been behind barbed wire for more than three years. Surely we can have a sensible, lawful and due process that is just, that considers evidence and that reaches determination after six months or, at the most, 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I stand apart entirely from this episode of Australia's history. As an Opposition senator, I am not responsible for the Labor Government's failure to achieve determined status for the refugee applicants amongst the up to 400 boat people who have arrived on our shores over the last several years. It is only this year that the Government has put in place laws that will enable a more definitive process. It is too late; it is too slow. The Australian people condemn the Government. We have put Australia's name in disrepute. We are charged with failures in human rights when Australia should be a beacon of example in human rights. It is intolerable that people who come to our shores, however misled they are by being told that inevitably they will be received, be kept behind barbed wire and inadequately treated. It is a disgrace on the part of this Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fifthly, this country is in economic recession. We have one million unemployed, we have a huge Budget deficit and we have a huge balance of payments deficit. We are in huge debt, yet this Government has an immigration program that we as a nation cannot sustain. This Government should be thrown out for its inadequacies in immigration policy. Is it right to accept the applications of persons from all over the world to immigrate to this marvellous country and to see them unemployed and lining up for benefits at the expense of the Australian taxpayers? Australia loses and those individuals and their families lose. The Government should not lure people here beyond a reasonable quota. In past recessions, the immigration program had rightly fallen to between 50,000 and 70,000. It is greater than that at the moment. It has been too slow getting down to what it is now. Is it 85,000? We will lower net immigration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sixth problem is that the Government does not protect taxpayers' interests. It lacks discipline. It fails to put responsible checks on the extension of benefits to newly arrived migrants. I notice in the legislation before us tonight that the Government has copied a small amount of what the Liberal and National parties have announced as proper policy. The Government is introducing through this legislation a six-month period of exclusion from benefits. We welcome that, of course, but we think a two-year exclusion from benefit is appropriate. Let us not forget that we in this Parliament represent the Australian people and the national interests of Australia. Sure we have compassion, but let us not lure people into thinking that they can go into the social security system straight away . </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, there is the question of refugee determination, not only with regard to the boat people but also with regard to the Chinese students. Besides you, Mr Acting Deputy President, and me, I do not think there are more than a half dozen people who understand China and seek to be sympathetic with respect to the real needs of the Chinese people, Australia's relationship with China and, indeed, the Chinese students who are here. No-one can accuse you or me of any kind of racial hang-up or any kind of difficulty in dealing with this matter on its merits. But not even my friends should be given positive discrimination or special treatment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is all about equal treatment. We must have an immigration program which lives up to our standards of being non-discriminatory and equal to all. There should be no unfairness and the Australian people should be able to say, `We really believe in the immigration program'. I believe that only a Liberal and National party government will provide the disciplines that are needed once again to give the Australian people confidence in the immigration program of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now refer to the six Bills. The Migration Reform Bill 1992 is the largest and most important of the Bills that are before us. The Opposition welcomes what this Bill seeks to achieve, although I remain critical of the Government for not going as far as the Opposition is advocating in a number of respects. Clause 3 inserts an object into the Migration Act and I welcome this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Control of our borders is to be reinforced by a one-visa system which will simplify and standardise the documentation needed on entry to Australia. One aspect of this is the requirement that Australian citizens should use their Australian passport or other acceptable evidence of Australian citizenship when entering or leaving the country. I realise that some Australians who are dual nationals and have not travelled on an Australian passport may be concerned about this. However, I make it clear that the Opposition firmly supports this step. Our belief is that Australian citizenship is very important and should not be undervalued. It does not reflect well on Australian citizenship if a citizen wants to travel abroad on a passport issued by another country. So the Opposition certainly supports this aspect of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Proposed new section 54V of the Bill puts an onus on non-citizens to provide evidence of their authority to be present in Australia when required to do so by a departmental officer on reasonable suspicion. I acknowledge that this can be an important tool to assist in the discovery and deportation of illegal entrants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that the Bill introduces the concept of a bridging visa which will be available for certain unlawful non-citizens and will give them lawful status and release from detention. The emphasis on unlawful non-citizens having to be detained and the possibility of a bridging visa then being granted to some is sound and I raise no objection to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill proposes a major shake-up of the procedures for the review of immigration decisions. In the future we are to have an immigration review tribunal and a refugee review tribunal, with significant questions to be referred up to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The Opposition regrets that the Government has not followed the views of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations on this matter. The Committee's approach is that, within the system of tribunals, there should be an appeals panel to consider questions of principle and to ensure consistency in tribunal decisions. Instead, the Bill will allow a reference of matters of principle to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the past we have found that the courts to which immigration matters have been appealed do not always have an appreciation of the impact of their decisions on the effective and tight administration of the immigration program. I believe there is a risk that the AAT will similarly not always be in touch with the particular requirements of immigration decision-making&mdash;that is, the intentions of this Parliament; the intentions of the law&mdash;even with a senior member of the Tribunal on the AAT for a particular case. This is not how the Opposition would have proceeded in this matter, and we think we can improve on this.

The Opposition is critical of this in that there will still be access to a whole host of situations in which judicial review will be available. This concerns us.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister has referred to this Bill as broadly reflecting views received from a committee to review the merits review system chaired by the Hon. Ian Macphee. I ask whether the Committee has provided advice on these matters formally to the Minister, and, if so, whether that advice will be provided to the Senate. If the Minister is following the Committee's advice only broadly, it is reasonable for us to ask to be told the extent to which he has in detail departed from that advice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to refer to the situation of New Zealand nationals under this Bill. The Minister's speech says that New Zealanders will still be able to enter Australia without a visa and with the same degree of favoured convenience as at present. That continues past practice. However, I ask for the Minister's clarification of the capacity for changes in this area as a result of this Bill. There has been some concern in the community and in New Zealand about this. Section 26(1)(3) provides that regulations may prescribe criteria for visas in specified classes including Section 26A, which refers to the special category visas for New Zealanders. Would this enable the Government to require that visas be presented or to impose conditions on the work done by a holder in Australia? How in turn does all this affect the reciprocal rights of Australians in New Zealand? A clear statement from the Government is needed about this.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 28 of the Act at present gives the Minister a power to suspend the processing of visa applications for specified classes of visa until a specified date. This is a very broad power. It was placed in the Act as a result of the legislative changes made in 1989 and was intended to give the Minister better control over the number of visas being issued for various categories of migrants. It is a power that has not actually been used, and this seems to be because of the rather sweeping nature of it. It is a somewhat inflexible power, and its use would in fact cause complications for the smooth administration of the migration program by bringing the handling of visa applications in a designated class to a complete standstill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not unreasonable then for the Government to bring forward legislation to introduce greater flexibility into the situation, and the Opposition will therefore not oppose this Bill. Its main purpose is to allow the Minister to place a numerical limit or cap on a class or classes of visas, as determined by a notice in the Gazette. Where a cap is in force, applications can still be processed up to the point of grant, so that the whole machinery does not grind to a complete halt. The basic principle of the Bill is embodied in clause 7, and is supported by the Opposition. So is the other aspect of this Bill, a technical change to correct an error the Government made in the drafting of the Migration Amendment Act (No. 2) 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Opposition did have a concern with the Bill as originally introduced into the other place by the Government on the matter of consistency of certain definitions of exceptions from the new capping provisions. There is of course a need in the Bill for some exceptions from the effect of capping a class of visas, but it would be confusing for the exceptions to be inserted into the Act by this Bill to be expressed in terms different from the comparable exceptions already in the Act. The Opposition was concerned that the exceptions in new Section 28C were not exactly the same as those already in Section 28 of the Act. I am pleased to say that the Minister, Mr Hand, accepted the validity of what the Shadow Minister, Mr Ruddock, was saying on this, and Mr Hand has duly moved amendments to insert into the Bill clause 6, which amends Section 28 to bring it into line with the exceptions in clause 7 of the Bill. Had he not done so, it would have been my intention to move such amendments here in the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill provides in section 28C(1)(c) for the limit not to apply to an applicant who is a spouse, dependent child or aged parent of "a person who is usually resident in Australia and whose continued presence in Australia is not subject to a limitation as to time imposed by law". I ask the Minister handling the Bill to give the Senate some explanation as to why the Government is adding these words in this Bill. Does this have particular reference to New Zealanders?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It seems that section 28G will to give the Minister very sweeping authority. This new section will allow the Minister to deal with outstanding and further applications in a capped class of visas as the Minister considers appropriate. Obviously, there has already been a good deal of thinking going on within the Department about what administrative actions this might entail, and I ask the Minister to spell out for the Senate what will be the range of options. The one option that is discussed in the second reading speech and in the Explanatory Memorandum is that the Minister would be empowered to impose ceilings on the number of visas that can be granted at overseas posts and to allocate numbers between posts. There may be problems with this procedure if it is left as a purely administrative matter internal to the Department. I suggest that it would be best if such decisions are made openly and limits imposed on particular posts are made public. The process should be transparent. If it is not, then there is always the risk that a Minister will set quotas in response to lobbying for particular higher or lower ceilings at particular posts. This would diminish the integrity of Australia's immigration administration, and I therefore urge openness and transparency as the best approach.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There has not been any statement by the Government of its exact intentions about how soon it wishes to use this new power to apply caps to visa categories. I ask what the Government's intentions are. Will the powers be used soon?</PARA>

This is an area of considerable interest to me as it touches on my longstanding interest both in immigration and in language and literacy policy.

In the norm, it will be $1,000, and for some it will be $250. These charges are new. The Opposition does not oppose the Government's proposals. But what is very new and very significant is that there is a government guarantee or, as it appears in the legislation, an obligation on the government to provide 510 hours of English tuition to those who do not have a viable knowledge of the English language. This is a new principle, which the Opposition supports. We regard the 510 hours as a minimum.

These arrangements will complement new migration selection criteria which require a points test for English language competence in certain categories.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill in part is linked with the previous Bill under discussion. It provides, in clause 6, for 510 hours of tuition in an approved English course. This is an obligation placed on the Commonwealth, and the Opposition does not oppose the Bill. This is a minimum guarantee&mdash;an obligation of government established by clause 6 for the first time. Adult migrant education&mdash;in particular, English tuition to adult migrants&mdash;currently has major inadequacies.

This Bill now proposes explicit powers for the Minister or the Minister's delegate to refuse a visa to a person thought likely to engage in criminal conduct, be a danger to the community or foment discord in or vilify a segment of the community.

Australia's immigration law is ultimately determined by the Australian Parliament on behalf of the Australian people. The Minister is also bound by this law. The integrity of Australia's immigration policy is vital. We want to see that integrity enhanced. Hence our support for this Bill. However, another element is the Government's administration of vital immigration policy. This is where confidence is lacking and where change is required. I look forward to the coming change of government, for it is this which will, I believe, lead to the clear and positive decisions which will restore the Australian people's confidence in the immigration processes of this nation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the Migration Laws Amendment Bill 1992. This Bill seeks to increase the Government's capacity to control the entry into Australia of non-citizens through executive decisions. Secondly, the Bill seeks to limit possibilities of appeals to the courts against such decisions. In other words, the Bill seeks to limit judicial review.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill's focus is on the entry of refugees and reflects the Government's concern about the current processing and review of claims made within Australia by people seeking refugee status. Yet Australia's refugee problem is very small indeed. The panic engendered by the arrival of a few boats to the north of the country has been out of all proportion to the so-called threat posed by the people in question, or to the portent they represent for a future influx of people from the north. Five hundred-odd asylum seekers over a period of four years surely does not constitute an invasion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The nature of the Government's response to the new so-called wave of boat people seems in itself to have created a vicious circle. The Government seeks to justify the gross violations of human rights that are occurring with the continued isolation and detention of asylum seekers at Port Hedland. To do so it is striking out at anyone who tries to stand up for the individuals involved; yet it must be said that not since the passage of the War-time Refugees Removal Act in 1949 has Australia seen anything as shameful as the detention centre at Port Hedland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recent repatriation of 113 PRC nationals without giving the group access to independent legal advice is a national disgrace at a time when China is accepted as one of the leading producers of political refugees in the world. It is equally shameful that the Government denies that the Cambodian asylum seekers have reasonable grounds for fearing for their lives if forced to return to that country. Senator Evans's efforts to achieve peace for Cambodia are laudable; however, our involvement in the region should not blind us to the real and ongoing difficulties and dangers faced by Cambodian people while the Khmer Rouge is still a force to be reckoned with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats support some features of the Bill, including the establishment of a better merit review system which will probably reduce the number of judicial review applications going to the Federal Court. However, the Government's attempt to deprive asylum seekers of equal legal rights is shameful and unworthy of a civilised nation. In this Bill the Federal Court is deprived of its existing jurisdiction to review migration and to review decisions under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 or the Judiciary Act 1903. Instead, the Bill provides for a statutory code of judicial review in the Federal Court with substantially narrowed heads of judicial review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under proposed section 166LB, a breach of the rules of natural justice and an unreasonable exercise of power&mdash;in other words, so unreasonable that no reasonable person could have so exercised the power&mdash;are excluded as grounds for review. So are irrelevant considerations, perceived bias or bad faith. However, direct appeals to the High Court under placitum 75(v) will still lie because they cannot be abolished and the High Court will be inundated, as pointed out by the Chief Justice in his letter to the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, there are good objective reasons in support of the expectation that the High Court will be flooded with judicial review applications, particularly since the heads of judicial review proposed to be eliminated under this Bill for the Federal Court figure prominently in cases where Commonwealth administrative action has been held to be unlawful. For this reason alone, persons aggrieved by migration and refugee decision making are highly unlikely to be satisfied with a statutory code of judicial review which denies them the opportunity to raise many of the most significant and effective grounds of challenge. Since such grounds will be available only in the High Court, such persons will naturally pursue the judicial review remedies in that forum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such a scenario is thoroughly undesirable for several reasons which affect not only applicants for review but also the Commonwealth itself. As Australia's ultimate appellate court, it is highly undesirable that the High Court's finite resources be diverted by the necessity of having to process numerous applications for review arising in its original jurisdiction. To suggest that the High Court will be able to remit such matters to the Federal Court under section 44 of the Judiciary Act is to ignore the operation of proposed new section 166LK(3) of the Bill. The effect of that provision is to limit the Federal Court to the much narrower scope of judicial review available under the statutory judicial review code. Clearly, the High Court will be left with no real alternative but to hear itself the applications for judicial review of migration and refugee decisions brought in its original jurisdiction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, proposed section 166LK could be constitutionally invalid. It may be invalid as imposing an impermissible limitation on the High Court's inherent power of remitter. The effect of the proposed section will be to shear from matters in their remitted form the plenitude of jurisdiction exercisable under placitum 75(v) of the Constitution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, the effect of the Bill's proposals is to deny persons aggrieved by migration and refugee decisions the protection of the law available to persons aggrieved by Commonwealth administrative decision making generally. Such an approach discriminates against migrants, their families and sponsors, refugees and other persons affected by migration decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government proposes that asylum seekers be denied equal rights before Australian courts even though these courts are making decisions on their fate. It gives rise to the serious question of whether the Bill meets Australia's obligations under article 26 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which deals with equality before the law and provides that all persons `are entitled without any discrimination to the equal protection of the law'. Clearly, it does not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On what basis can the Government effectively invite the merits review bodies to reach decisions on the basis of irrelevant considerations or in bad faith, safe in the knowledge that such decisions will be unreviewable on those grounds in the Federal Court? It is also difficult to see any justification, for example, in the exclusion of the rules of natural justice or unreasonable decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government seems to be proceeding on the basis that the establishment of merits review procedures somehow obviates the need for efficient and effective judicial review of migration and refugee decision making in accordance with well established principles and procedures which are available to other persons adversely affected by Commonwealth administrative action. But the mere provision of procedures for merits review does not mean that such processes will always operate according to legal principles and requirements. There is clearly a continuing need for effective judicial review to guard against unlawful administrative decision making in all its various forms, including unreasonableness and all the other traditional heads of judicial review identified above. Clearly, this Bill does nothing of the sort. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats will not be supporting the Opposition's second reading amendment. The Opposition says in this amendment that the Government has failed to control the refugee determination process. The Opposition exhorts the Government to limit judicial appeals&mdash;the very purpose of this Bill to which we object strongly&mdash;and it says that in particular it regrets that the Government has failed to control the refugee determination process of the students from the People's Republic of China who are in Australia. The Australian Democrats believe that a promise by one Prime Minister should be kept by the next Prime Minister and any other Prime Minister following him. It is a promise given by the Australian nation and it should not be subverted by obstructive bureaucratic procedures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I listened in vain to Senator Teague for the spirit of liberalism that we have come to expect from the Party of John Gorton, Harold Holt, Malcolm Fraser, Peter Baume, Ian Macphee and even Robert Menzies.

These powers are important in order to safeguard the community and they are important to the national interest. The measures contained in this Bill are very strong and of course the stronger the measures, the more carefully and cautiously they have to be applied. The second reading speech states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The power is intended to be exercised in a manner consistent with well accepted Australian values such that it is aimed at those persons who may regard entry to this country as a means to attack those values.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new provisions will not be used to breach established standards of industrial democracy, for example.</PARA>
<PARA>I would like the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) to enlarge on that example and give us a few others if he can. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under this Bill, there is an avenue of appeal to the AAT regarding decisions made by delegates of the Minister, but if the decision is made by the Minister himself there can be no appeal. I accept the reasons given in the Bill for those provisions. After making such a decision, the Minister has 15 sitting days of Parliament to table those actions. As I said, I appreciate and accept the need for those powers, but I wonder how much information the Minister will give the Parliament about the decisions he has made and his reasons, if any, for making those decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under those powers, if the Minister were to make an outright decision to refuse someone entry into Australia or reject the status that somebody in Australia has and decide that he or she should be deported, I assume he would do so with advice from his Department, from a lobby group or as a result of representations by a family or whatever. I would like the Minister, who is at the table, to tell me how much information we will be given. I believe Parliament should be given sufficient information for it to be able to appreciate the circumstances relating to such a decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also mentioned in the Minister's second reading speech that policy guidelines will be developed in due course to help the decision makers. I would like to know what the Minister means by `in due course'. I suggest that he supply us with a draft of the guidelines he has in mind to help his officers make their decisions, or will he wait to base them on the decisions made in the next couple of years? I would like him to give me that information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation goes further with people who are classed as undesirable or who have committed offences, but it does not have much power to cover those people who have come to Australia recently and quickly got Australian citizenship. There are measures in this Bill to deal with migrants in certain categories who have residential status who commit offences. There is a guideline in a statement by the Minister which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following is a statement on Australia's Criminal Deportation Policy by the Minister for Immigration. . .</PARA>
<PARA>The guidelines define the sorts of offences which might be committed. The courts deal with people holding Australian visa status. If there are any convictions in the time they are here they can be deported. The legislation does nothing to rid Australia of immigrants who had prior convictions in other countries but did not come forward with those details, or omitted them when they made application for Australian entry and Australian citizenship. That is where I believe the Government ought to look at strengthening the current regulations for Australian citizenship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have always said that Australia is too hasty to grant citizenship to migrants. I believe that there should be an extension of the prerequisite period of residence so that we have more time to judge the people who want to become permanent residents of Australia, because once a person is naturalised, that is the end of the matter, to my knowledge. If a crime is committed between the gaining of residential status and the acquisition of citizenship but is not reported and dealt with until after citizenship is granted, I understand that that person can still be deported. However, if it becomes known that a major crime was committed in a foreign country before the person became an Australian citizen, nothing can be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister details the offences committed in Australia prior to the granting of citizenship which may render those granted citizenship status liable to deportation. These include:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.serious sexual assaults, whether or not accompanied by other violence (especially where there has been more than one sexual offence);</PARA>
<PARA>The reason I raise this is that there is a famous case in Western Australia around the time of the euphoria of the bicentenary in 1988, when there was a drive towards taking out citizenship by migrants who had been in Australia the minimum time. I believe that certain factors were overlooked and that many applications for citizenship did not contain, or the Department not look fully into, information indicating whether people had previous convictions in other countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The particular case involved Tiny Pindar, the basketballer who was a convicted rapist from the United States. He came to Australia and was granted citizenship without any question. Since that time, he has been convicted of numerous charges along sexual lines, such as sexual violence, et cetera. We now have an Australian citizen that Australia can do nothing about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have asked in the Estimates on a number of occasions why this person was able to get into Australia with a prior conviction of sexual assault in the United States. I have received no answers. Perhaps it is too late to right the wrong and to bring the law of Australia down by deporting this man because he is now a citizen. But I believe that we should ensure it does not happen again. I will be very interested to hear what the Minister has to say. </PARA>

Mr Justice Einfeld, who is a man of great compassion and considerable intellectual strength, has nevertheless shown himself to be particularly concerned with the issue of migration in general and refugees in particular. The difficulty with that is this: he is a person who exercises a judicial function in a system that calls for the separation of powers. If we look at the headlines in reports about what Mr Justice Einfeld has said over recent times, the conclusion might well be drawn that he has indicated a constructive&mdash;and I use that word advisedly&mdash;bias in this area. </PARA>

It is a matter of concern that a person so well motivated as Mr Justice Einfeld should tumble into what I, and clearly the Minister, consider to be an area he should have kept away from. If indeed he were not a judge but a human rights campaigner, it would be more than proper for him to do that. As a judge, he must stand above the hurly-burly of politics, demonstrations and strong statements on a particular area so that he is seen by people who come before him as a person who is able to and will hand down judgments which are not in any way motivated by a personal stance. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also wish to say a few words about the Hon. Justice Einfeld. In today's Australian Associated Press news service there is an article headed, `Einfeld says he has never been accused of bias'. If nobody has said it to date, I say it now that Mr Justice Einfeld clearly is biased when it comes to refugee determinations. That is not an accusation that Mr Justice Einfeld should run away from, because he is constantly on the public record espousing his views on how Australia's refugee programs ought to be run. He has done it publicly. He will not deny that he has publicly espoused his views on how refugee policy should be organised in this country. There is no problem with him doing that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, there may be a problem if the judge has to sit in determination of matters which are challenged in the area of refugees. I do not think that Justice Einfeld is being honest with himself or is really looking after his own interests in continuing to be a public persona, a public expert, on refugee areas when at some future time he may be called upon to sit in judgment, because then the accusation could clearly be laid on him&mdash;he has virtually invited it by his comments contained in this article&mdash;that he is biased and prejudiced in this area. There will be a problem with the Australian judicial system if this is allowed to continue for very much longer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable thing for Justice Einfeld to do is to divorce himself from any litigation in the Federal Court that has anything to do with refugee processing in any area at all.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1I4">Senator McKIERNAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. I want to keep my speech short because there is a long night in front of us. I have made my comments about Mr Justice Einfeld. Many people who purport to be experts give government advice on how immigration policy in general, and refugee policy in particular, should be handled in this country. One particular individual gets under my skin a little every time he speaks&mdash;generally on the good old ABC. This is the first opportunity I have had to respond to him. I am referring to Father Larry Reitmeyer from Port Hedland, the Catholic priest who purports to look after things for the refugees in Port Hedland. Recently he was barred from any further contact with the people in the Port Hedland detention centre. I do not think Australia, with its 17 million or 18 million people, needs citizens of the United States of America to tell us how we should handle our affairs. If anything grates the public of this country, it is foreigners coming here telling us how to do things and how they could do it better.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest that if Father Larry wants to look after refugees he should start with his own country because it has as big a problem as we have in Australia. Proportionately, the United States does not take in as many immigrants or refugees as we do. If Father Larry, as a United States citizen, wants to do something meaningful in life and make a name for himself, he should start with his own country. Alternatively, he could do what some of us have done&mdash;become a citizen of this country, pledge his allegiance to this country and become an Australian. Then he would be qualified, as I am, to comment on matters of refugee policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another group that I want to give an honourable mention to in this short contribution is the Refugee Advice and Casework Service, which includes the Refugee Council of Australia. The report of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia's refugee and humanitarian system: achieving a balance between refuge and control</EMPHASIS>, was presented earlier this year. The Committee heard in camera evidence from the Refugee Advice and Casework Service. Eve Lester, Ms Margaret Piper and Mr Seth Richardson earned the accolade of being perhaps the worst set of witnesses that have ever appeared before a parliamentary inquiry. They did not want to answer any questions, yet they purported to be experts in the area. Incidentally, there has been an authorisation for this in camera evidence to be published. That decision was taken with the agreement of the people who appeared before us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As one would expect, it was an emotional hearing. The subject matter of refugees brings out compassion in all of us who are concerned about this issue. It was not an easy hearing; it was a very difficult one because we did not get direct answers to our questions. We were insulted on a number of occasions. Time does not permit me to go through each and every area in which this happened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I challenged Ms Piper when she equated the conditions in the Port Hedland detention centre as being only marginally better than the conditions of refugee camps in Hong Kong. Her evidence states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The conditions in Hong Kong I regard as totally intolerable. I think that when people are designing zoos they think about the conditions in which the animals in their cages would be best able to live a comparable lifestyle to that which they have in their own homes, in their natural environment. The conditions in the camps in Hong Kong are the absolute antithesis: they have taken away privacy; they have taken away freedom of choice; they have taken away any decision making capacity for these people and have provided them with next to no recreational facilities. I would never condone these conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Port Hedland is marginally better.</PARA>
<PARA>Ms Margaret Piper is doing herself and her organisation a very great disservice in making such statements on the record. A number of members of parliament&mdash;including the shadow Minister for immigration, Mr Ruddock, who is also Deputy Chairman of the Standing Committee, and me&mdash;have visited Port Hedland and seen the conditions first-hand. Some of us would know that those facilities were actually built for working men&mdash;not women at that time&mdash;as single persons' camps. Men lived there in relative comfort after a 10-, 11- or 12-hour working day. The conditions in Port Hedland are nowhere near what they are in Hong Kong or in many of the other refugee camps throughout the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That particular set of witnesses also caused us some problems on the matter of funding. Senator Spindler would be interested in this because he has a great interest&mdash;which I commend&mdash;in natural justice. However, natural justice does not come cheap; it has to be paid for. I will continue to argue that natural justice ought in the first instance be given to Australian citizens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The availability of legal aid funding for Australians in desperate need of legal assistance is drying up. Part of the reason is that it is not being used totally on the protection of refugees or asylum seekers, although they are grabbing a portion of it; it is also being used in other areas. How much does the legal assistance actually cost?  We asked direct questions of Mr Richardson and Ms Piper in this Committee to ascertain how much they were getting out of the public purse. Organisations such as theirs do have a vested interest because they exist on government funding. The initial answer to our questions on the matter of funding was that it was $55,000. Through persistent further questioning we got agreement that the funding was in the region of half a million dollars. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We will look at Senator McKiernan's socks tomorrow. The main intention of these two Bills is to recover costs of English language training for adult migrants. This legislation allows the charging of fees for the training of Australian residents who enrol in courses arranged under the adult migrant English program. The Australian Democrats have many concerns about the intent of this legislation and support many of the letters and petitions from community groups, including some of the issues raised by the New South Wales Teachers Federation and ethnic councils of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fundamental problem with this legislation is the concept of charging migrants in Australia for the purpose of assisting them in language. These moves by the Government symbolise the entrenchment of user pays principles in all areas of education in this country. What could be a more basic need amongst our migrant communities than assistance with the common language&mdash;a tool which will assist them in their everyday lives? Migrants from non-English speaking backgrounds traditionally fill jobs in industries such as motor vehicles, textiles and steel. These are the very industries where structural change and job losses have been the most severe. English skills are increasingly important in redeploying workers laid off in such industries and helping new arrivals find work&mdash;particularly the latter since the unemployment rates for those who arrived in 1991 to May 1992 is 47.4 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been shown that State Budgets bear the brunt of immigration program costs and that the States are not adequately compensated by the Commonwealth for this. This was most recently borne out in a paper by Professor Russell Matthews, an expert on public finance, at the recent Second National Outlook Immigration Conference in Sydney. If we support the principle of providing immigrants with sufficient resources so that they can fully integrate into Australian society, then there are only two solutions: firstly, to increase funding to the States for ESL teaching and other services or, secondly, to reduce the number of immigrants, particularly those from non-English speaking backgrounds, to fit what can be afforded. Obviously some balance is required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite extolling the virtues of our education system and capitalising on its marketability abroad, the Government and our education institutions still fail to provide basic bridging and other introductory courses for overseas students&mdash;a point that I made when addressing the Overseas Student Charge Amendment Bill in the Senate last week. We share some of the concerns raised in letters that we have received from the Ethnic Communities Council of South Australia, the New South Wales Teachers Federation and the Federation of Ethnic Communities Councils of Australia. The President of the Ethnic Communities Councils in South Australia writes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Budget's introduction of fees will mean that some migrants . . . will not be able to access English language training. This will significantly restrict the successful settlement of such migrants and their ability to effectively contribute to the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA>He also raises the all-important question of equity. I stress that the case of women in the migrant community is one that disturbs me at this time. Many women face not only the language barrier but other barriers as a result of their religion, cultural background and financial difficulties. These changes in this legislation will affect the already restricted opportunities for English language training for women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is recognised by the Government that participation by women in English language training is low when compared with that of men. Part of the problem relates to child-care, in that there is inadequate child-care for migrant women to enable them to access English language training. We certainly hope that additional funding in the long term can be provided to ensure that these women have access, through child-care, to English language training. The Australian Democrats are committed to a publicly funded, accessible and equitable education system for all Australians, regardless of their sex, age, race, religion or cultural or economic background. The proposed fee scale from $50 to $4,080 for ESL is a financial barrier that will prevent migrants from even considering training and is a feature of this Bill that the Democrats will not support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his second reading speech, the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) justifies his argument for user-pays English language training by stating:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . proficiency in English benefits individuals. It is reasonable therefore that individuals who benefit from the adult migrant english program should contribute to its cost.</PARA>
<PARA>Are we to deduce from this that the Government believes that basic English training should not be available to all Australians, new arrivals or otherwise, and that a natural advantage should be conferred upon those who have an ability to speak and learn English and who have the ability to pay for that training? The connection between wealth and education is a sad feature of today's education system, and these Bills are a cynical revenue raising exercise by the Government, as evidenced by other aspects of this year's Budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation also sets a maximum entitlement for newly arrived migrants for English language training of 510 hours. The Government is to be commended for literally setting in concrete a minimum number of hours of English language training for each student. As the Minister has outlined, no government has ever given this kind of guaranteed commitment, and I think the Government is to be commended for that. I further note that providers will have the ability to roll over unused hours from one student to the next, which provides a small degree of flexibility in the provision of tuition. However, the limit of 510 hours has no educational or linguistic basis, even though it is recognised that most migrants require a minimum of 900 hours of English to enable them to find meaningful employment or access to further education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The conditions that prescribe that a migrant must register with the AMES within three months of arrival is impractical and unfair, as is the necessity that refugees and migrants begin these new classes within 12 months. While it is true that 90 per cent of migrants would fall easily within these parameters, we are concerned that they may be unduly restrictive for the 10 per cent of migrants who are too traumatised or dislocated to register in time. The Minister has told me that he intends to make regulations to provide for cases of special hardship. We would like to see that regulatory power spelt out more clearly in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other issues that arise in these Bills and with which community groups have concerns, include the test procedures; that is, what are the purposes of the testing and for what purposes will the results be used? Another issue relates to the tendering processes. It is our understanding that none of the DILGEA money will be open to tender. However, a maximum of 40 per cent of the DEET money for ESL courses will be tendered, according to the Minister. The Minister concludes his second reading speech by claiming:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the benefits of charging go beyond any contribution to revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Client contribution to cost will encourage greater motivation from students . . . places a greater obligation on service providers to meet the expectation of clients.</PARA>
<PARA>Surely the highest standard of service should be expected anyway, and the concept that fees will make migrants appreciate any more or less the value of being able to communicate in their new country is farcical. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister recognises that proficiency in English is an essential part of Australian life and that it facilitates communication and, hence, equality of opportunity amongst Australians. Despite this acknowledgment, the Government has based access to English language training on unequal opportunities and financial ability. Surely it is of community benefit to educate new arrivals in the common language of their new country. Why unnecessarily add to the trauma of displacement and isolation the inability to communicate?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats do not support the fee charging arrangements but do support a guaranteed provision of English tuition, even though the hours suggested may need attention and we would like to see some prescription of the regulations regarding exemptions and special hardship cases spelt out. I am relieved to see that refugees' preferential family members and those wholly dependent on social security payments are exempt from the charges, which the Government describes as constituting `a better managed client responsive program'. It is a pity that changes designed to create a more client responsive program could affect as many as 4,000 Australian students and deprive them of the opportunity of learning English. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this point I would like to thank the Government for agreeing to hold off the committee stage. It may in fact be that some of the queries we have will be answered by the briefing we are to have tomorrow. We probably will have some amendments to move to this legislation, but I do thank the Government for having acceded to the request of the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training to at least hold off the committee stage to enable the Committee to examine the legislation in more detail&mdash;and I do thank the Minister for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, it is the view of the Democrats that education should be publicly funded and the community should pay because the community benefits. This should be the guiding philosophy of our education system and, in our belief, should prevail in the case of providing English for migrants. </PARA>

It is a sad indictment of this Government's immigration policies that it is the lot of some 450 refugees to carry the full weight of punishment and bear the brunt of Australia's fear of a flood of boat people. Never have 450 people been the object of so much legislative action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Equally, the conditions in which the majority of boat people are held is a shameful mark on Australia's human rights record. The detention centre at Port Hedland is a disgrace and not worthy of a civilised nation such as ours&mdash;or at least one that calls itself civilised. I, too, refer in passing to the article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on 3 December. From all the reports that I have received, the article by Jennifer McAsey is an accurate reflection of what our present policy is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a lack of recognition, at least at the Port Hedland centre, of what people have been through by the time they get to this country. Even if we kept them in motel-like conditions, we would still be subjecting them to a continuation of the victimisation and persecution that has led them to depart their own countries. There is also a failure to recognise that if these people are faced in a fair way even with a negative decision they should be entitled to think through their future prospects and come to terms with that in their own time, rather than being whisked off at very short notice and taken out of their detention cells in the early hours of the morning in such a way that they can only be put in a situation of fear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may be that the Government wants to set an example&mdash;this seems to be the underlying assumption&mdash;so as to deter others from entering Australia in this way. But how can we, in all conscience, accept this? In the criminal system, the principle of general deterrence&mdash;that is, punishment of one person's offence in order to influence the behaviour of others rather than simply as a penalty for that individual alone&mdash;violates justice. It is unjust, as C.S. Lewis pointed out many years ago, to use the principle of general deterrence to contain people in a way that does not apply to their own situations. Much more so is it an offence against justice when no offence has been committed and people have simply sought refuge on our shores. Detention in this situation for people who are being processed for refugee application status is a crime against humanity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very concerned that the Minister in his speech could wax eloquent about how the procedures in this Bill will replace the somewhat open-ended doctrines of natural justice and unreasonableness. The Bill seeks to exclude breaches of natural justice, unreasonableness, bad faith, irrelevant considerations and perceived bias when the Federal Court is reviewing immigration decisions. Surely these doctrines should be uppermost in the minds of the people who are here to represent the views of a fair and reasonably minded nation such as Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator McKiernan spoke of natural justice as needing to be paid for and also to be discriminatory; that is, to be available to Australian citizens only. This is not acceptable&mdash;and it is not acceptable in the eyes of the world. While I am pleased to see that the Department affirms that it wishes to build processes which do provide fairness and certainty, that fairness and certainty should not be at the cost of natural justice. Whilst this package of Bills deals with a wider range of issues than refugees, it is these provisions which colour the whole intent of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's refugee policy is founded on the myth that we face floods of refugees. Margaret Piper, in her paper <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Recent trends and legislative changes relating to refugees and special humanitarian entrants</EMPHASIS>, says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the number of asylum seekers we have at present (some 20,800) is greater than at any time in the past, it was created by factors that are arguably idiosyncratic. About 70 per cent of the current caseload are Chinese students allowed to enter Australia after the events in Tiananmen Square.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reality is that Australia has the most impenetrable barriers to migration of any country in the world and has had since the 1850s.</PARA>
<PARA>Later she states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Why too is the government so obsessed with the illegal arrivals? Of the 22,500 asylum seekers awaiting processing, about 500 arrived illegally by boat . . . in other words, only about 2 per cent of the total.</PARA>
<PARA>Does fear of numbers underlie the persistent attempts in this legislation to limit the role of the courts in determining refugee applications. The role of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal bears looking at here. I would like to refer to the excellent analysis that was presented in a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> article of 10 November by Mr Rod Campbell. Mr Campbell, in his article entitled `Judges on the outer in laws on migration', draws to our attention the role of the AAT in relation to this legislation. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The respective heads of the IRT and the RRT can refer issues of `general application' to the AAT if they wish. The AAT can accept the referral if it wishes. The theory, it seems, is to have a high-status AAT resolve some of the more important general issues relating to immigrants and refugees, for the benefit of the other tribunals and departmental decision makers.</PARA>
<PARA>The article further states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The word `theory' is used deliberately. There are many public servants, and some entire bureaucracies, that refuse to accept that an AAT decision has any precedent value. If they do not like a decision, they refuse to apply it to any other case (until and unless forced to by the Federal Court). The AAT's role in immigration cases of general importance will be neutered if its rulings are not accorded precedent value and decision-makers can pick and choose between decisions they like and those that they do not.</PARA>
<PARA>This transfer of attention is presumably based on the presumption that judicial interference is inappropriate as access to Australia's territory by aliens is a matter of state sovereignty and therefore should be dealt with by the government of the day. Yet we have obligations as a signatory to the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees. These are legal obligations and therefore must be overseen by the judiciary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia will have to bear the diagnosis of history. Relative to many other countries, we have much better opportunities to offer assistance. These people are in our region. It is primarily our responsibility to offer justice, compassion and to respect their human dignity as they access their rights to due process of law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having dealt with the unfortunate situation presenting to people who are applying for refugee status and saying that this hard line against them is an indictment of Australia in the eyes of the world community, I now turn to the two Bills that refer to the education facilities available to those who are fortunate enough to have received acceptance into our country. The Migration Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1992 and the related Immigration Migration (Education Charge) Bill 1992 set out a means by which the cost to government for provision of English language courses to migrants can be recovered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The adult migrant English program enables people of non-English speaking backgrounds to acquire functional English upon arrival in Australia as permanent residents. Clearly, this is a major factor in their ability to make their way into the community and to make the greatest contribution that their talents and skills allow. It is self-evident that lack of functional English is a barrier to employment in this country, but there are other barriers for those who are not fluent in English and this is one of our objections to the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose and the driving force of this legislation are to be found in that wonderful adage of user pays. It is a measure driven by the forces of economics, not the desire to foster multiculturalism and social cohesion. There are many people of non-English speaking background whose desire and, dare we say, need to speak English are not driven by their desire to work. There are many people whose role is in the home, raising children and helping them through their school years. They have day to day contact with trades people, shopkeepers and the like and they need English every bit as much as someone working in paid employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is fair to say that many of the people I am referring to are women. This point was raised earlier by Senator Sowada. In the migrant community, whether we are talking about those who arrived in the years after World War II or those arriving now, the job seekers are mainly men while the home-makers are mainly women. This legislation, in seeking to recover the cost of English classes from those learning English, is putting financial pressures on families, particularly in the first couple of years after they arrive when they are least able to afford extras. One of the negative side effects of that will be borne disproportionately by women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, the Minister will tell us that certain people are exempt from having to pay for their English courses&mdash;those who are registered job seekers and those who hold health care cards. It is pleasing to see that the Government has at least made that provision, but there are lots of people who do not fit into those categories. For example, there are families in which someone is working and earning a moderate income. That does not mean that money for such courses is going to be available for other adults in the family. That is one objection I hold to the legislation. I foreshadow my support of the Australian Democrats' amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Another objection to the Migration Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) is the limit of 510 hours of tuition as set out in the legislation. People who teach adult migrant English have contacted my office and have made it perfectly clear that 510 hours is nowhere near enough time for people to acquire a second language at a functional level. Again, the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) will no doubt point out that there are courses available through the TAFE system at little cost, but I point out that the number of places available is limited and that the demand exceeds the places available considerably.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A third objection lies in the distinction drawn between the Government's obligation to provide the courses and the client's ability to take them up. Past practice has been to offer a client a course of a particular number of hours duration and, if the client is unable to take up the offer, the hours offered are deducted from the total number of hours made available to that client. I have been told of this happening time and time again, and without the clients being notified that their inability to take up a course will not be taken into account when keeping a tally of their hours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are any number of reasons why clients may not be able to take up a particular course being offered. As I mentioned earlier, it may be home duties, an inability to negotiate time from work or being in an isolated community. Therefore, the obligation to provide courses should include an obligation to work with the clients to find appropriate courses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill sets out certain conditions of eligibility and, again, it would seem pointless setting these out without providing the mechanism by which the client is supposed to discover this information. For instance, a client must register with a course provider within three months of the commencement date of his or her visa. That is fine if the client is in touch with an immigration office frequently early in his or her time in Australia. It may even be noted in big bold type in information kits clients receive when they arrive. But if clients choose not to stay in one of the major cities, move into an isolated community or are swept up into their family or ethnic community, three months will not be a long enough time. Three months is certainly not a very long time if the clients have to overcome family insistence that they do not really need to learn English, a story which is common for women in strong ethnic communities. This then results in disempowerment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lastly, a recent DILGEA instruction to adult migrant English program staff indicates that people who arrived in Australia prior to July 1991 and who have not yet attended any classes by 1 January&mdash;the date this Bill takes effect&mdash;will not be eligible for any government provision of language courses. Perhaps the Minister could take time to explain to the Senate the background of that instruction, as it does not seem to be related to this Bill in any way at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Immigration (Education) Charge Bill, like the Migration Laws Amendment Bill, seeks to recover costs from the non-English speaking recent arrivals in Australia. This seems totally counter to notions of easing people into the community, letting them know they are welcome and fostering good community spirit. As this measure is directed at people at the point at which they apply to come to Australia as permanent residents and potential future citizens, it seems odd that we bail them up at the first point of contact with Australian consular officials with the bright news that we want them to pay for their English language courses before they can even be granted a visa. Apart from raising questions about the image Australia wants to project overseas, there is a more sinister side. This measure discriminates against people who do not have functional English, to use the term as it is presented in the literature.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the terms of most equal opportunity legislation, this Bill sets out a means by which we as a nation can indirectly discriminate against certain ethnic groups. Indirect discrimination, of course, is a measure which appears ethnically neutral at first glance&mdash;after all, if we apply this measure to all people who apply to come, then we are not discriminating on grounds of race&mdash;but on closer inspection it becomes clear that certain groups will be more likely to be affected than others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So this measure discriminates in favour of those who come from English speaking countries against those who do not. The discrimination is there because the Bill exempts those who have functional English from the education charge. The measure is classic user pays. But it goes further than that. Clearly, the measure discriminates against people who are poor. While we may well decide as a nation that we do not want poor people as migrants, let us at least make such a decision consciously and openly if that is what we want&mdash;and I must add that it is certainly not what I want&mdash;and not by some back door method of saying to someone, `Of course our doors are open, but if you can't pay for your English classes that's another matter'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is provision for the Minister to decide that particular applicants can be exempted. While that may seem a worthy measure, and all legislation should be subject to review in individual cases, it means that for some people their application may depend on a further decision-making process, with yet more delays. And there is more: the Bill allows for the charge to be levied at different rates for different categories of applicants, up to an arbitrary maximum of $4,080. That means that we could find governments using this legislation to shape the ethnic make-up of our migrant intake not on the basis of open community discussion but on the basis of making the charge higher or lower for some groups as against others so as to discourage or encourage migrants from particular places. It does not take much of a leap from there to project us back into the white Australia policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill is a disgrace, just like the others. It may purport to be about cost recovery, but it contains enough powers for the Government to exclude from the migration program almost any non-English speaking group it wants excluded. It may well be that the Government wants such powers, but if it does then let it go out into the community and come into the Parliament and say so clearly and openly and debate the issue properly, rather than take such powers by stealth. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in this debate to speak particularly to the Immigration (Education) Charge Bill 1992 and the Migration Laws Amendment Bill 1992. The Opposition supports these Bills, as my colleague Senator Teague has pointed out. The teaching of English to new arrivals, where they do not have an English language capacity, is one of the most important aspects of their successful settlement in Australia. We have done the migrant community&mdash;indeed the whole nation&mdash;a disservice in the past because we have not devoted enough resources to this area. People cannot become fully functioning members of Australian society unless they have the ability to communicate. Their contribution to this country reaches its full potential only if they have this ability. For this reason, the teaching of English to our migrant population is fundamental.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Currently several programs exist to assist adult teaching of English to speakers of another language. There is the adult migration education program, English as a second language courses, workplace reform programs, English as a second language provision within higher education, and State funded programs through TAFE, ELICOS and other courses. There is enormous complexity in the number of programs and the number of people who are involved in the teaching of English in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under this legislation, once the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs finishes its requirement of providing 510 hours of English tuition, the student will have to go on to other programs run by other departments&mdash;in most cases the Department of Employment, Education and Training. This just creates more bureaucracy. Why not simplify the structure under one articulated program rather than complicating it through a number of departments? In fact, the Government needs to develop an overall policy to achieve better outcomes by ensuring that there is a rational framework in which these programs can operate, but it is the lack of resources that prevents such an approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation addresses the very significant outstanding problems relating to the provision of resources for teaching English to new arrivals to this country. Presently it is impossible to provide sufficient teaching of English to all the people entering Australia under the immigration program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had an example of this in Adelaide last year when we were conducting hearings of the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training into adult and community education. Appearing before the hearings was a Turkish lady who was a qualified accountant in Turkey. She had no English language skills. When she came to Australia she was given 300 hours of basic tuition in English. After that she lost priority and went onto social welfare. It would seem an absurd allocation of resources in this country that we pay an enormous amount of money into social welfare and do not provide the comparatively minor additional cost for getting her up to a standard of English proficiency where she could practise her profession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation greatly improves that aspect. But 510 hours is not sufficient, particularly if people want to go into a profession. As a matter of fact, depending on the proficiency of people in English when they start a course, probably more than double those hours are needed. Therefore, the whole question of resources and the way in which people are admitted to migration programs needs to be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have recently seen changes in the requirements for people entering Australia. Those entering under independent migration categories will now be subject in their points testing to an assessment of their English language capacity. This is necessary because of the costs to taxpayers of the migration program. These costs in the short and medium terms are quite significant. It is only after a period of 10 years that one starts to see the economic benefits from immigration in terms of Commonwealth outlays. Naturally, under current economic conditions, these outlays need to be rationalised as much as possible and, therefore, the Opposition has supported the moves for English competency testing. We still have, however, some serious concerns about the way in which this testing will be carried out and, in particular, whether such testing will be conducted equitably across a wide range of countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation before us also addresses the issue of a user charge in the area of teaching English to new arrivals. It introduces a scheme in respect of new migrants entering Australia who do not have functional English. The charges are introduced in two forms. There is a maximum of $4,080 for applicants from 1 January 1993 who are issued visas or entry permits after 1 March 1993, and a charge of up to $250 a year for current residents enrolling or re-enrolling in adult migrant English. In return for this charge, the Commonwealth undertakes to fund up to 510 hours of tuition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whether or not 510 hours is sufficient is a matter of debate. It depends on the various English competency levels of each person when starting the program; it depends on the different educational levels of each migrant; and it depends on their ability as language students. Therefore, the 510 hours seems quite arbitrary. But the Government feels it is sufficient to ensure that immigrants can find their way around and function and communicate at a basic level. It is not necessarily a vocational or employable level of English. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I return to the initial point in my speech: how can we expect people to achieve their full potential if they cannot function properly in society and in the workplace because of insufficient instruction in English? I am aware that they can go onto other work related programs, particularly under DEET. But how many of them will do this and how many of them will successfully complete the programs and reach an adequate level of English for the workplace? How many will be left functionally illiterate and unable to achieve their full potential not only in the workplace but also in society? This has been noted in particular in a number of articles in the press recently, and I quote from two. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> of 26 November 1992 told of Dr Carl Mahfouz, who speaks fluent Russian and Arabic. Dr Mahfouz said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . other countries have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to train us. All it needs now for Australia to get the benefit of our training is the minor expense of providing advanced English courses.</PARA>
<PARA>Dr Beata Niechoda, a surgeon trained in Poland who was also featured in the article, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are not allowed to do anything, just wait, or I can work as a labourer for $7 per hour. But the longer we wait the more we will lose our skills.</PARA>
<PARA>These are two examples of the types of dilemma that arise under our current program. We must ensure that migrants, such as those who have access to English language programs, can make the fullest contribution to our society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The scheme presented in this legislation deals with charging for educational services. Some of it goes some way towards providing the additional resources that are required, hence the boost in the number of guaranteed hours. There are exemptions in it. In reality, this addresses many of the concerns that Senator Chamarette and Senator Sowada raised. It covers the disadvantaged categories, including refugees and special assistance and those who are here for humanitarian reasons. In effect, it appears that only those entering through the concessional family and independent categories will be required to pay the full tuition fees. This will operate on a sliding scale with the maximum fee of $4,080. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the exemptions and the application of user charges to those who can afford them, it was interesting to see several comments incorporated by the Minister in his second reading speech for this legislation. The Minister stated that proficiency in English benefits individuals as well as Australian society as a whole. It is reasonable, therefore, that individuals who benefit from the program should contribute to its cost. He also made the statement that the benefits of charging go beyond any contribution to revenue; that client contribution to cost will encourage greater motivation from students; that charging places a greater obligation on service providers to meet the expectations of clients; and that charges will result in better managed client responsive programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition applauds this type of thinking, but it really begs the question: why can the Government not adopt such market oriented approaches to teaching in other areas of education if it does so for migrant education? Surely if charging for the teaching of English language programs improves the motivation of students and the responsiveness to providers, as the Minister stated, the same applies to both vocational and higher education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government still chooses to apply a different standard in this area due to an outdated, one-eyed ideology. Even though the Government is inconsistent, any adoption of freedom and responsiveness in this area of education must be welcomed, as the coalition welcomes this measure. I therefore accept the Government's position on these charges for the teaching of English to migrants, but at the same time condemn it for its hypocrisy and inconsistency on the issue of charging for educational services. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank those honourable senators who have contributed to the second reading debate on the Migration Laws Amendment Bill 1992 and associated Bills. This is important legislation. In listening to the debate, one could be forgiven for getting the impression&mdash;which I think is a complete misdescription&mdash;that Australia as a society is heartless or not welcoming. There did not seem to be any appreciation or noting of the fact that 80,000 people will be welcomed to Australia this financial year in very difficult times&mdash;times of great stress in our society. Amongst them will be 10,000 refugees&mdash;that is, persons who have been assessed as having a well-founded fear of persecution for their political beliefs and who seek refuge and haven in the democratic society of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That all has to be given much greater weight than has hitherto been given in the course of this debate when trying to describe how Australia and its migration and refugee system works. This system puts Australia at the forefront of countries that have a practical willingness to show compassion, certainly to those many thousands of Cambodians and other South East Asian refugees who have found sanctuary and a future for themselves and their descendants in Australia. That is my first point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, it is important to emphasise that certainly the Parliament of Australia and the Government of Australia elected by the people have an obligation to maintain the integrity of the borders and to ensure that those who come to Australia and seek to stay here have a real entitlement to do so, whether that entitlement is made under our own domestic approaches to these matters or whether it is in recognition of the international conventions which, for example, regulate the granting of refugee status. But we certainly have an obligation to the Australian community to ensure that those who want to stay here have a real entitlement to do so. They do not establish their claim to stay simply by arriving on our shores as boat people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no use pre-determining proper categorisation by stereotyping all boat people as refugees. The 113 Chinese nationals who arrived in Australia in late October were interviewed separately by Department of Immigration officials. As I am advised&mdash;and I have advised the Senate before&mdash;none of them made a claim to refugee status. Obviously they were seeking a better life. They were seeking to establish a future for themselves other than in the homeland of their ancestors, but they did not claim to be refugees and they were returned to China. That is a proper response by the Australian community to those who arrive on our shores, even if it is in circumstances of peril in crossing the waters to land on our shores. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Migration Reform Bill principally seeks to provide a system whereby it is much clearer who falls into the lawful and unlawful categories as far as their presence in Australia is concerned. It then tries to indicate those decision making procedures which enable the merits of any particular claim that is made to be assessed. Of course, there are questions that can properly be raised about that process. Nevertheless, for the first time we are trying in this particular Bill to put forward a comprehensive and much more simple system that is better able to be understood by those who are to be subject to it and those who have to operate the system of decision making, whether within departmental structures or within the various boards and tribunals which will carry out merits review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of matters will probably be raised in the committee stage in relation to that Bill. I need not pause now to answer all the points made during the second reading debate on that Bill. Other Bills in the package deal with capping legislation which enables a system of caps to be put on the various allocations at various posts in the granting of various visas. This is a more refined and accurate way of tackling the problem rather than the present broad brush requirement to suspend the whole processing arrangements. I understand that that is supported around the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Migration (Offences and Undesirable Persons) Amendment Bill 1992 has not had much mention tonight. It really arises from the decision to exclude from Australia non-Australian members of the Hell's Angels Motor Cycle Club. There has been quite a deal of scrutiny of the decision making process in relation to the type of decision where one finds within the Australian community a necessity to exclude persons of bad character who might undermine the values of the Australian community which they are coming to as visitors in this particular case. This certainly will enable the exclusion from Australia of persons of bad character. Once again, that can be subject to further elaboration in the committee stage. Quite clearly, if, for example, a person represents a real danger to the Australian community, is likely to engage in criminal conduct in Australia, foment discord or vilify certain segments of the Australian community, then there should be the capacity to exclude such a person. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I want to mention very briefly the Immigration (Education) Charge Bill and the Migration Act amendments dealing with the offering of English tuition to those people who come to Australia. I do not think that it has been sufficiently emphasised that the primary and paramount feature of this Bill which will make a greater impact and be accepted as a real reform as it is better understood is the entitlement which it vests in a person coming from overseas to settle in this country or who is currently here to 510 hours of tuition in the English language at the expense of their fellow Australians. This is a very considerable benefit which is now an entitlement and which the Parliament is conferring on such people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a guarantee for the person and an obligation on the Australian community which is being accepted on their behalf and made real by the Australian Parliament by means of the passage of this legislation. When one looks at it that way, the primary and paramount feature of this legislation is indeed a great reform.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I am advised, the average hours of tuition undertaken in the various adult migrant education programs is some 370 hours. That is what clients receive on average at the moment. This is a considerable advance on that entitlement. Of course, it is not a maximum in the sense that the person can then avail themselves of further programs within the TAFE system or suchlike in order to top up what they receive by way of entitlement to this 510 hours of tuition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, to ask and require those who come here as business migrants to pay $4,000 or so for a course to help their proficiency in English in order for them to engage in business&mdash;it is their intention when they come to Australia to engage in the commercial, trading and business life of this community and quite clearly they have a real incentive and need to acquire a proficiency in English&mdash;would not be excessive. There would be various gradations down from that which, I am advised, will be set by way of regulation. That debate will therefore come before the Senate and no doubt will be the subject of discussion at that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to those persons currently onshore who want to enrol or re-enrol in 1993, many of them will be asked to pay $250&mdash;50c an hour&mdash;for tuition in the English language. One may say that this comment comes from a person in a privileged position so far as income is concerned, but that does not strike</PARA>
<PARA>one as an excessive amount to pay in order to acquire proficiency in English, which is so necessary for one's social and recreational interaction in the Australian community, let alone engaging in business or commercial life of any sort. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Exemptions will apply to health care card holders and registered job seekers. That would cover at least some of the concerns that have been expressed in the chamber this evening about economic hardship. Some half a million dollars has been set aside particularly to deal with the question of women's access to these programs. I think I read that in one of the briefing notes. For incoming migrants granted visas after 1 March 1993, exemptions apply to whole categories of migrants, including refugees and special humanitarian and preferential family categories. So in those particular categories too there is a recognition of an incapacity to make even the various modest payments which would otherwise be required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The program embodied in the Immigration (Education) Charge Bill 1992 and the amendments to the Immigration (Education) Act are well worth supporting at the second reading stage. I understand that whilst the Bills themselves will not be referred to the Committee meeting tomorrow, there is an expectation that the members of the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training will be briefed on the underlying principles and expected operation of this part of the bundle of Bills that we are discussing tonight. For that reason we will not be pursuing the committee stage of debate this evening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In so far as these Bills deserve support in principle, I recommend them all to the Senate and I indicate that the Government will not be supporting the second reading amendment moved by Senator Teague, which basically laments the fact that we have not operated the refugee determination process in a way that commends itself to the Opposition. It is a very difficult area. We believe we have been, up until now&mdash;perhaps in a more reactive, piecemeal way&mdash;trying to deal with the situation. Tonight we are taking a more comprehensive approach and, I believe, a more defensible approach. Therefore the criticism is probably belated and in any case not fully justified.

<PARA>I wish to address a couple of the comments that the Minister for Justice made. It seems to me that he is putting up straw men to be better able to knock them down. To my knowledge nobody has said&mdash;and I certainly have not&mdash;that asylum seekers should have the automatic right to be regarded as refugees.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also acknowledge that the Government has the right and the responsibility to safeguard the integrity of our borders. Of course it has. What is at issue is how that is done and how the people who are on our shore without the requisite visas having been issued prior to their arrival are treated. All we are asking is that principles of justice be applied to them as we expect them to be applied to Australian citizens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me an extraordinary proposition that the extent to which legal rights may be enjoyed by a person being dealt with by our legal system and by our courts should be dependent on whether this person is an Australian citizen or not, rather than by the universally accepted legal principle that all persons must be equal before the courts. It seems to me that the integrity of our courts depends on that. Indeed the level of civilisation of this community will be judged by how we handle these processes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should also acknowledge that Senator Cooney sought me out to rectify a mistaken impression that he had. He thought that when I asked for natural justice to be applied in this process I meant it should be applied by this chamber. I assumed until this moment that this chamber would have the deepest respect for the application of natural justice in the legal system of this nation. I must say I now have some doubt that this is so. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government will be resisting these amendments. I think it has to be made clear that persons are not being stripped of their various rights to have their claims exhaustively evaluated. The various steps for merits review are quite elaborate, including not only review by the Refugee Review Tribunal but also the process which allows for the presidential powers of the AAT, or the prestige of the AAT at that level, to be invoked in order to provide some general guidance to decision makers in relation to the principles that ought to be applied.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, when it comes to review of decisions by the Federal court, it is not as though persons are being stripped of a right to approach that court, which would be one extreme way in which Senator Spindler's worst fears might be realised. What is done is a setting-up of a process of approaching the Federal Court which says that that court is to take into account a codified set of matters which, if they were not observed, could lead to a proper accusation that there had not been procedural fairness in the course of the decision making. It is codified and each ground is important in itself, although there could be some mutual overlap and reinforcement between various grounds. But to simply rely on the common law evolution of principles of so-called natural justice, now more commonly known as `rules of procedural fairness', does not give sufficient guidance either to the many decision makers who have to make thousands of decisions in this area every year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government considers it best that the various grounds be set out in a codified way, as they are. I believe that they are comprehensive in that, in effect, the sorts of considerations that are familiar to those who deal with the rules of natural justice find an echo in many of these provisions. I believe that there is good provision for grounds of review here. I am advised that the United States Supreme Court has held that a range of immigration decisions are not subject to the full due process provisions of the Constitution. I do not think that means that we should exclude grounds of review which are important to ensuring a certain amount of fairness in these assessments. They are set out in some detail in proposed new subclause 166LB(1), which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) that procedures that were required by this Act or the regulations to be observed in connection with the making of the decision were not observed;-</PARA>
<PARA>that is a ground for review&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) that the person who purported to make the decision did not have jurisdiction to make the decision;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) that the decision was not authorised by this Act or the regulations;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) that the decision was an improper exercise of the power conferred by this Act or the regulations;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(e) that the decision involved an error of law, being an error involving an incorrect interpretation of the applicable law or an incorrect application of the law to the facts as found by the person who made the decision, whether or not the error appears on the record of the decision;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(f) that the decision was induced or affected by fraud or by actual bias;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(g) that there was no evidence or other material to justify the making of the decision.</PARA>
<PARA>It is when we see those items listed that the further part of the clause, which indicates that it is not a ground but `a breach of the rules of natural justice', can be seen in the proper context. As I said, it provides&mdash;on the basis of the foundation of a very comprehensive system of merits review&mdash;a very fair process which is made available by the Australian community to those who seek a review of decisions made in relation to their claims to stay in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister to paragraph 47 of the explanatory memorandum that was provided with the Bill, which says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In recent years, the increasing frequency of unauthorised boat arrivals at Australia's northern frontier, the need to protect Australia's international fishing zones from being illegally exploited, and the close scrutiny by the Federal Court directed towards relevant sections of the Principal Act, have exposed a need to provide a uniform regime for the detention of persons illegally in Australia and for the recovery of costs associated with such detention and removal.</PARA>
<PARA>I ask the Minister to compare that regime with the current regime, particularly as it applies to refugees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current regime as it applies to refugees is set out in the Migration Amendment Act 1992&mdash;the one which has been the subject of a High Court challenge. Under that legislation, there is provision for a person to be declared a `designated person'. That person, having been declared a designated person, is held in mandatory detention. What will be the difference between that regime and the regime that is proposed in this legislation? Is it expected that there will be more persons detained or fewer persons detained?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hope I have understood Senator Harradine correctly. In relation to those non-citizens who are in Australia without valid visas, this Bill provides that they will be regarded as unlawful and will have to be held in detention. However, they will be able to get bridging visas. But those who arrive at the border without any authority to enter are not entitled to that bridging visa and will be held in detention until their claims are assessed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am advised that that particular mandatory requirement does not necessarily mean that any more will be held in detention than in the past. But that is the regime, that is the difference, and that is the way in which it is structured to try to provide for simplicity. As Senator Harradine knows, those who are in Australia are here either lawfully or unlawfully. The great majority of unlawful non-citizens will be able to get a bridging visa, but not those who arrive in Australia without authority. So those who arrived, for example, as boat people, would be held in mandatory detention under the provisions of this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understood that the capacity to obtain a bridging visa depended on the ability of the person to regularise his stay.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think there may be a misunderstanding. In relation to those who arrive in Australia without any lawful authority&mdash;for example, boat people&mdash;there is no way in which they can move into the Australian community by some attempt to regularise their presence here, to use something of the language of Senator Harradine. If they arrive without lawful authority&mdash;whether at an airport, fishing village or a major port such as Darwin&mdash;they must be held in detention, and they will be detained whilst the processes which are outlined in the Bill for the assessment of their claim for refugee status are carried out. The various reviews can then take place. All that has to occur whilst they are in detention. They cannot move into the community.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I come to the next point: the primary assessment of the application that is made by a refugee&mdash;an asylum seeker, if you like. The primary assessment is done by the Department after the application has been made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of things were said in the second reading debate about which I became a little concerned, to be quite frank. I believe aspersions were unfairly cast on some organisations which have done a quite reasonable and valiant job. They were not made by the Minister, I am not suggesting that at all, or officially by the Government. I refer to the the Refugee Council of Australia and its subsidiaries. Also, there was some reflection made upon individuals who have served refugees well, and who have worked amongst the refugees. I am concerned about this. Apparently no-one can criticise the administration of this legislation without being bagged and being called a number of things, including headline seekers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Chairman, I can assure you and the Committee that in this area that is the last thing that people want to be called. There are no votes when it comes to refugees, and any politician who stands up for refugees cannot expect to be immediately understood. But sooner or later I believe that the people of Australia will understand that the test of Australia's compassion and Australia's adherence and commitment to human rights will be in how it treats the most vulnerable and the most defenceless of individuals who come to its shores or who are already here. That is why this legislation and questioning about this legislation is so important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not accept&mdash;I am sure the Minister and the Committee will not mind me saying this&mdash;accusations being levelled at a person like Justice Einfeld, who apparently cannot say anything about refugees because he is a judge. Father Larry Rightmeyer, although he spent an enormous time in Port Hedland&mdash;because it was in his parish&mdash;assisting refugees and the Department, cannot say anything about refugees on the ABC because he sounds like an American. The officers of the Refugee Council of Australia cannot say anything about it because they are lawyers, despite the fact that many of them have served those persons who have come to Australia&mdash;the refugees&mdash;to the detriment of their own practices. Teachers apparently cannot say anything about refugees and the teaching of migrants because they somehow have vested interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We really should not have that sort of closed mind. But I am getting off the point, Mr Chairman, and I know you are going to pull me up. I come to the point about the lawyers. Is it the intention of the Government to ensure that, if further refugees arrive by boat, they will be entitled to legal assistance so as to enable them to understand their obligations and rights under international treaty and national legislation?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand that there has been concern in the community that the committee system was only recommendatory and that it was not able to come to a determination on the matter. It has been decided that what was needed in response to the various requests was a clearly independent, determinative body which would make decisions from a certain independent status that would be clearly perceived and give confidence to those who were submitting their claims to that process. As I say, the committee system was only recommendatory and, as I understand it, the composition of the committees was such that they had a large portion of bureaucratic and departmental members, as well as a refugee council nominee.

It may take a little while, but the Department will find the figures for that. As to how individual members of the committee voted on any particular application and therefore any cumulative list or voting pattern that might be discernible in relation to, for example, the Attorney-General's member of those committees, we do not have that sort of voting information.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Canada also has a review tribunal which has two members. The advantage of at least two persons being on the Review Tribunal is that it would enable the Tribunal to discuss the relevant merits of the particular individual case at length. It would also enable each member of that tribunal, in a frank and open way, to bounce his or her assessment of the case off a peer review within the tribunal. That is the case in Canada and in New Zealand. It is also the case in this legislation as far as the Immigration Review Tribunal is concerned. The Immigration Review Tribunal need not be a single member tribunal; it can have more than one member.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator Cook</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) No investigation is necessary into the withdrawal of screening arrangements at the regional airports listed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Ansett Express has already withdrawn screening at all three ports. Australian Airlink has placed the future of screening under active review at Rockhampton and Mackay. Australian Airlink has terminated service to Mt Isa for economic reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Any compromise strategy is a matter for negotiation between the airline and airport operators concerned. It is understood that Australian Airlines, on behalf of Australian Airlink, is currently discussing alternatives with local councils.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) Rockhampton, Mackay and Mt Isa are the only three airports affected at present.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) The Air Navigation Regulations do not require screening for domestic Regular Public Transport aircraft configured to seat fewer than 100 passengers. Both Ansett Australia and Australian Airlines have in recent years passed responsibility for these Queensland services to Ansett Express and Australian Airlink respectively, who operate Fokker F.28 and BAel46 equipment seating around 70 passengers. The former Boeing 737 equipment seating around 120 passengers had apparently proved too large for these routes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that smaller aircraft have been substituted by the airlines for both economic reasons and to increase flight frequency, there is no legislative need to maintain security screening at these ports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The background is that routine screening of domestic flights in Australia occurs when a variety of requirements have been met, including assessed level of threat and size of aircraft. The Government monitors the situation closely, and will always introduce appropriate security precautions, irrespective of the size of aircraft, where warranted by the circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has not however been deemed practicable for the routine screening threshold to be reduced below 100 seats. This is because the expense of screening aircraft seating fewer than 100 passengers becomes such a major component of overall operating costs that fares would have to be raised to cover this expense. The result is that patronage is discouraged and the viability of the service itself may be threatened.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government cannot countenance a situation where provincial centres are denied commercial air links because of security requirements intended more to protect interstate trunk and international routes. While monitoring the situation closely, the Government therefore permits flexibility at provincial centres where smaller aircraft operate, thereby ensuring that these commercial services can remain viable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) Security will not be withdrawn from capital city airports because of the nature and extent of traffic. The same applies to other major Queensland airports such as Cairns, Townsville and Coolangatta.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) The airlines will not be required to take out additional insurance on remaining Rockhampton, Mackay and Mt Isa flights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(8) The Government maintains flexibility in the application of security measures at all airports. This is especially relevant in keeping pace with the rapidly changing requirements brought about by the dynamic nature of Queensland's tourist industry. Therefore, while screening is no longer required at some provincial airports, it is being progressively introduced elsewhere (as at Maroochydore) where larger aircraft are now catering for rapidly expanding traffic. This reflects the Government's determination that security should be applied on both a</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">cost effective and a realistic basis. There is certainly no overall downgrading of aviation security underway in Queensland, especially given the importance of the Queensland tourist industry to Australia as a whole.</PARA>
