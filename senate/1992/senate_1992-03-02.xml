<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Hill keeps interjecting, `Talk about your 800,000'. Straight away the Opposition started about its two million jobs; I too am starting about its two million in answer to interjections from that side of the House. Looking at any of the scenarios in documents published by the Opposition and confirmed by economists who have advised the Opposition about this package, the scenarios are ones of misery and distress for the next five to 10 years for the unemployed in this country.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. I noticed that the Minister said, first of all, that he could not indicate any industry, region or age group and then proceeded to outline one industry alone&mdash;only one; the tourist industry. In that case, is the Minister saying that he cannot indicate what the Keating package will do to cut the 18.9 per cent unemployment rate reported by the Australian Bureau of Statistics for north-west Melbourne or how many of the 13,800 jobs wiped out in that region over the last 12 months will be restored?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thought Senator Baume had those figures and, in another stunt of his, threw them into the streets of Wills in a demonstration. The fact of the matter is, as he well knows, that as an economy comes out of recession jobs will grow throughout the economy. That is a fact. If that is not true, the Opposition's whole consumption tax package is an absolute mockery in terms of any signs of hope it holds for anybody.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Baume wants me to be more specific. Of course there will be growth in some sectors of the Australian economy and, in terms of employment, there will be long term decline in others. That is what restructuring an economy is about. It is something that the coalition never tried and never took on in all its golden years of government. Fightback&mdash;this consumption tax proposal&mdash;is designed to screw up the psyche of the Liberal Party, which never took on any of these things in all its history in government.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Can the Minister for Industrial Relations advise honourable senators whether the union movement has confirmed its commitment to wage outcomes which are consistent with Australia maintaining an inflation rate comparable with those of our major trading partners?  Will this commitment enable Australians to achieve the strategy outlined in the Prime Minister's One Nation package aimed at creating 800,000 jobs?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last Friday in Melbourne the Government and the ACTU met. The ACTU has confirmed that it will defer its national wage case application which, under last October's national wage case decision, would be able to come on in May of this year. The ACTU has confirmed that that application will be deferred until the latter part of this year; that it will confer with the Government as to the amount of its claim and the timing of its application; that it does this in order to lock in a low level of inflation as portrayed in the One Nation statement; that it does this as well in a cooperative frame of mind to help achieve the 800,000 new jobs that the Government will create because of the One Nation statement; and that the basis of determining a future wage application will be a consideration of the inflation rates among Australia's leading trading partners.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a very fine example of the Australian union movement putting jobs and economic recovery first. It is a fine example, too, of the Government being able to work with the union movement to achieve an outcome for this country which is in the interests of all citizens of this country. It is an example that cannot be emulated by the Opposition in any way, shape or form. Indeed, the Hewson consumption tax package involves confrontation with and, in the words of Dr Hewson himself, destruction of the Australian trade union movement to succeed on the wage assumptions that he has projected.</PARA>

The most probable scenario under the Murphy model&mdash;the wages up scenario, as he chooses to call it&mdash;is one that, if it is not to be realised, requires the destruction of the union movement, plain and simple.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many people will in fact be worse off due to the failure to increase the tax free area in line with inflation and because there is no cut in their marginal tax rates. Many families, especially those on two incomes will also be worse off.</PARA>
<PARA>Will the Minister care to explain where Mrs Mitchell is wrong in her assessments and, if he cannot, will he concede that the inevitable consequences of this divisive and heartless tax reform proposal are that the Government is deliberating exacerbating social inequities in order to create two nations rather than one?</PARA>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="446" SPEAKER="Richardson Sen The Hon G.F." NAMEID="4E4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="NSW" MINISTERIAL="TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Alston ought to be aware, the whole thrust of government reforms in the social security area right throughout the 1980s was directed to low income families. That is why we ended the pernicious practices of the Fraser Government in refusing to index all of those basic payments that were made to them. That is why Brian Howe, during his tenure as Minister, introduced family payments such that Australia had simply never, ever seen before. That does not even include the changes that were made to the tax thresholds at the time and, indeed, to marginal rates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real increases delivered to families were very substantial. The economic statement of last week has been directed to improving the standard of living of people, especially those on DSS payments. As an example, a pensioner couple with two children has received a real increase of 22 per cent, or 28 per cent if renting privately. A pensioner couple with no children has received a real increase of 13 per cent, or 18 per cent if renting privately. A single pensioner has received a real increase of 14 per cent, or 21 per cent if renting privately.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Low income working families have also benefited substantially from the large increases in family payments and family allowance supplement payments. Combined family payments have risen by 37 per cent for a family with one child under 13; 83 per cent for a family with one teenage child; 28 per cent for a family with two children under 13 years of age; and 70 per cent for a family with two teenage children. The real increases in the family allowance supplement are a far more effective way, a far more targeted way, of improving the disposable incomes of those on low incomes. It is much better than changing tax thresholds and raising rebates, because many low income families simply do not get the benefit from doing that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, the Government has also raised thresholds and rebates and has removed the intermediate tax bracket. Between 1983 and 1992 the Government raised the tax threshold from $4,595 to $5,400; replaced the 29c in the dollar tax bracket for incomes between $12,600 and $19,500 a year with a tax bracket which is only 20c in the dollar for up to $20,700 a year; and increased the dependent spouse rebate from $830 to $1,149 and the sole parent rebate from $780 to $1,080, and has indexed both. The Government has also greatly reduced the effective taxation on pensioners and allowees by increasing pensioner and beneficiary rebates to exempt full rate pensioners and allowees with no private income from taxation and by removing many of the poverty traps from the pensions and benefits system, such as the simultaneous income testing of base payments and rent assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it is very hard to argue a case that the Government has not been attending to the needs of low income families. We spent nine years making that a priority. That having been done throughout the 1980s and continuing into the 1990s, what the statement did last week was introduce a payment of $3 per week per child additional in the family allowance supplement. As well as that, the statement has to be read with the last Budget measure of changing the threshold on the family allowance supplement. That is an extraordinary record, one of which everyone on this side of the chamber is proud.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When it came to formulating this statement, the fact that the Prime Minister and the Government should then choose to give some tax relief to those who have borne the brunt of what occurred during the 1980s&mdash;that is, those on incomes between $20,000 and $40,000&mdash;should come as no surprise. What the Government has managed to do over the course of the last nine years is make sure that benefits have flowed to all those who need them.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. I take it that the Minister is, in effect, conceding that the low income earners have had it too good for too long; that we ought to get back to ancient history&mdash;which I thought his Leader was not in the business of doing; and that we ought to say that all the good things that the Government claims to have done for these people in the 1980s is sufficient reason for now disadvantaging them through the tax system. If that is not right, can the Minister tell me where Mrs Mitchell is wrong, or else concede that these people will be relatively worse off as a result of this Government's changes to the tax system?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not make any such concession. I can only repeat that the massive cash payments that were made available to low income families during the course of the 1980s that were not available before&mdash;or, when they were available, were never indexed before&mdash;represented, I think, a great leap forward for those on low incomes in Australia. So, as far as the Government is concerned, we stand by all those things that we did in the 1980s, and we look forward to doing many more in the 1990s.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree with that interjection because for many years&mdash;decades, in fact&mdash;the sales tax on motor vehicles in Australia has been structured on the antediluvian notion that motor cars are a luxury item and, therefore, should bear a special rate of tax higher than anything else. That is the origin of that tax structure, and it went on for a long time. The fact of the matter is that the reduction in sales tax will bring us more into line with international tax regimes applying to the motor vehicle industry. For example, we had one of the highest indirect taxes on motor vehicles before this change was made&mdash;the only exceptions being one or two Scandinavian countries&mdash;and that is the reason why the change was made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In so far as the benefits to the industry are concerned, we believe that some benefits will flow to the industry in terms of lower prices as a result of the reduction in the sales tax. Those benefits are important. The motor vehicle industry is a very large industry in Australia. It employs a lot of people and, through the components sector, it generates a lot of export earnings for this country. So it is important that this industry, which has been through difficult times as a consequence of the recession, should receive some stimulus in terms of the reduction of wholesale sales tax occurring at this time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the linkages with other industries are also important in respect of the motor vehicle industry, and those benefits will flow through. Similarly, the benefits from the depreciation regime changes announced in the Prime Minister's statement will flow through to the motor vehicle industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might say, in answer to the last part of the honourable senator's question, that the Government expects that the manufacturing producers in the motor vehicle industry will pass through the effects of the sales tax reductions to consumers. I have spoken to each of the chief executives of the motor vehicle companies and said that that was the wish and intention of the Government. In so far as some of them are concerned, that sales tax has already been passed on, I understand, in recent prices. That will be monitored by the Automotive Industry Authority to make sure that that happens as a consumer benefit, which in turn will be of benefit to the motor vehicle industry.</PARA>

I believe that that comment was picked up and reflected in the unique way in which decisions in national wage cases are written. In the October national wage case decision, which shortly followed my ministerial statement, the Commission itself called on the Government to review sections 115 and 112 of the Industrial Relations Act to accommodate more workplace bargaining.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I suppose there are two ways of calculating the number of people on welfare. One could count all those who receive a payment from the Department of Social Security, and if one did one would get a figure over four million. But as Senator Crowley will know, everyone in this chamber has acknowledged that family payments are not and have never been considered to be welfare payments. Rather, they are payments which recognise the increased costs for families raising children. When one considers that about half the 4.5 million people Senator Crowley is talking about are in that category, the figures start to take on a bit more meaning.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously that story was a pretty dreadful beat-up. While there may well be four million people getting some payment from the Department of Social Security, I would point out that the proportion of the labour force who are recipients of DSS payments has declined from 41.9 per cent in June 1983 to 35.5 per cent in June 1991. As a proportion of the population I think the interesting figure is that the number of DSS recipients has fallen from 19 per cent to 17.4 per cent. Although there has been a tremendous growth in the 1980s in our population and a 22 per cent growth in the same period in the labour force, there has been a fall in the number of those&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Why don't you compare it to 1980?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The June 1991 figures are a pretty fair comparison. The reason that Senator Alston finds this uncomfortable is that when the Government came to office we inherited a totally untargeted social security system. No attempt had been made in the previous decade to do anything about fraud or abuse. Fortunately, during the 1980s and further into the 1990s this Government has spent a great deal of time and effort in doing just that and has done it with remarkable success. During that time I think that we have done it without creating in the community the kind of unrest that was created in those years before we got government because  the targeting has always been done with fairness and equity in mind.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the life of this Government it is worth noting that payments for children in low income families have increased in real terms by 52 per cent if they are under 13 and by 121 per cent for teenage children. Payments to sole parents with between one and four children have increased by about 16 per cent or 24 per cent if one includes rental assistance. Unfortunately for Senator Alston and others, the list goes on and on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point is that the percentage of those in Australia who receive welfare payments has declined during the term of this Government as against the position we inherited. But what is more, the payments to those at the bottom end of the scale went up, and went up by very substantial amounts indeed. The Government has improved the real living standards of those who receive social security payments, at the same time making sure that increased assistance was targeted only to those who were in need.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that those on the Opposition benches look long and hard at those figures. It might stop the kind of ignorant comment that we have seen even in here today. It may mean that people will start concentrating on what the system can deliver, not simply on the words. The words that have been delivered here today go a long way towards stretching the English language. When one listens to Senator Alston about the record of what happened from 1975 to 1983 as against 1983 to 1992, it is pathetic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth is that those opposite did nothing, they cannot do anything and they do not like it when we show that we have done something.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A very central theme of the One Nation statement was the need to continue lifting our export performance. As all of us ought to know by now, for a trading nation such as Australia strong and sustained export growth is really the key to long term growth being achieved in output, employment and living standards. To accelerate export growth requires at least three interlocking sets of strategies by governments: first, getting the overall domestic climate of macro- and micro-economic reform policy right; secondly, getting better access to overseas markets; and, thirdly, through direct support of export promotion. I emphasise that all three of those policies are absolutely crucial.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the recurring claims by some commentators, who ought to know better, and by some Opposition spokesmen, who manifestly do not&mdash;those people who seem unable to look beyond our commitment to the Uruguay Round&mdash;the truth of the matter is that our trade policy is not one dimensional; it is anything but that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the overall economic climate, the One Nation statement is largely about maximising our competitiveness and about improving the micro-and macro-economic climate for business, for growth generally and for exports in particular. It is not just, as the Opposition spokesman on trade was heard to say the other day, the $41m that is earmarked for export promotion that is relevant in the One Nation statement. It is the whole $2.3 billion package and a very large proportion of it which is directed very immediately through its injection of cash into the area of infrastructure spending, through the commitment to ongoing, regulatory reform and other micro-economic reform, and through the tax incentives for investment, which will lower costs and boost our output and efficiency. All those dimensions are crucial.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moreover, of course, it is a central element of our policy, as emphasised in the One Nation statement, to preserve the gains made in inflation. If one really wanted to destroy Australia's competitive climate internationally, one would go straight down the path of the Hewson consumption tax package, which is notoriously and conspicuously inflationary by contrast.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that second policy area, the second government strategy, which is crucially relevant here, is to pursue better access to markets by removing inhibiting tariffs, and through other barriers. There are three dimensions to that kind of policy, not just one, as is so often asserted.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One is the global dimension, through the Uruguay Round. Secondly, there is the regional dimension, through the establishment and pursuit of APEC. Thirdly, there is everything we are doing bilaterally with other countries in that trade policy access area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third element in the strategy&mdash;and this is the one that is focused upon most specifically in the One Nation package&mdash;is the question of direct support for export promotion activities. That is what we have achieved through increased funding for the export access program, which assists small and medium sized firms to export, with increased funding of $8m over the next three years, through a funding injection of $15m over the next three years to expand Austrade's international network, especially in the Asia Pacific region, through the $18m of extra funds injected into DIFF&mdash;the development and import finance facility&mdash;which boosts our exports, of course, of capital goods and services, and, finally, through the expanded export performance bond facility, which trebled to $150m, which helps Australian businesses win contracts for major overseas projects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Government is very proud of the export performance record to date of this country. Export volumes have doubled since March 1983 and, despite the downturn in the global economy, export growth has accelerated over the past 2 years, conspicuously in the area of elaborately transformed manufactures. Export volumes rose by 7 per cent in 1989-90, by 13 per cent in 1990-91, and there has been a sustained increase in the ratio of our exports to GDP.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are very pleased with the way in which we have already achieved a very dramatic growth in Australia's exports to North East Asia and South East Asia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I am answering the question, and I will continue to draw the contrast between the way in which this Government intends to provide finance for the public hospital system of Australia through taxpayers' support rather than the system proposed by the Opposition, which is to use the private insurance system and a system of deceptive tax credits to con people like pensioners and low income householders in Australia into believing that the Opposition will take pressure off the public hospitals and allow them to get private hospital treatment. They will not be able to, because the money the Opposition will provide by way of tax credits and so on will not enable pensioners to get that sort of private insurance which will enable them to get private hospital treatment. Under the Opposition's tax credits they will be barely able to get public hospital treatment&mdash;certainly low income householders will not even be able to do that.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, it is unfortunate that those reductions in protection have come at a time when there has been a significant recession in Australia, but this Government is determined to make structural change in this economy as distinct from previous governments that backed away from it at every opportunity. In a situation of high levels of unemployment it is difficult for people in any circumstances in any industry, but there have been certain attempts to single out the textiles, clothing and footwear industries as being a particular victim of the recession.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, Senator Sowada has asked me an intelligent question and I am trying to give her an intelligent answer, which is something that Senator Alston, by nature, would not understand. If we monitor what happened to people in the post-recession period in the textile, clothing and footwear industry in 1983 and 1984, we will find that they did get employment in a wide range of other industries, including what is broadly described as the hospitality industry, the tourist industry, the hospitals&mdash;miscellaneous services of one kind or another.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This view that people who happen to have worked in the textile or clothing industry are somehow disbarred from employment elsewhere is quite extraordinary and raises the cult of the victim to bizarre levels. That is not the experience and it is unlikely to be the experience now as we come out of this recession.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, in the longer term there will be reductions in levels of employment in the textile, clothing and footwear industry. That is something which we face up to. It is difficult for people and difficult for us, but it is something which has to be recognised as important in the process of structural adjustment in the Australian economy. I do not think, with respect, Senator Sowada should join that group of people who say that somehow people in this industry are peculiarly disabled in a growing economy from obtaining other kinds of employment other than the ones which they have been used to.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is also directed to the Minister representing the Prime Minister. I refer the Minister to the much publicised comments of the Prime Minister last week in which he criticised Britain for its failure to assist Australia in its defence during World War II. Do these comments indicate that the Prime Minister believes history has taught him that Australia cannot rely on others for its defence no matter how apparently strong the ties? If this is correct, why then has the Prime Minister, as the man who has controlled and directed Labor's purse strings since 1983, presided over the continuous failure of the Government to meet its responsibility to ensure that we have adequate and highly trained combat forces?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That might have been a question appropriately directed to the Minister for Defence. In so far as it is directed to me, I am asked whether the Prime Minister's comments suggest that Australia cannot rely on others in periods of war or combat to assist us. I suppose it is largely fair to say that that has been the history of this country.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>I would like to speak briefly to this Customs' report on the illegal entry of a vessel into Montague Sound earlier this year. I say at the outset that this is a very poor report. It exposes the Coastwatch system as a ramshackle and totally inadequate service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Five minutes is a totally inadequate period in which to deal with what is an enormously important subject: the security of Australia from illegal immigrants, the import and export of prohibited goods and all the other things that the Coastwatch service is set up to prevent, in the civil regime, coming into or going out of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make a couple of general points at the outset. First of all, it is unfortunate that Customs gets the blame, by implication, because it conducted this inquiry. Customs has been managing the Coastwatch service for two or three years now. It took it over from one of the other Commonwealth departments, and it has been a very good manager of the service. The problem with the service is that the Government is not prepared to put enough money into it. Customs' part has really been quite commendable in seeing that, within those limited resources, Coastwatch operates as well as it can. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second general point is that the members of the inquiry were all chosen from in-house. It is very difficult for them to be objective and I think that shows very clearly through the report. There is also a degree of naivety about the whole thing. I think the inquiry was very badly conducted and a lot of assumptions it made simply cannot be backed up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I move very quickly through the report. The executive summary starts with the astonishing statement that Coastwatch failed to detect a target vessel illegally landing in Australia. On the next page the report says that the first intelligence report in July 1991 was of this vessel being in Jakarta and that six months later the vessel landed in Australia. It is interesting that those in the vessel actually saw a Coastwatch aircraft on 31 December. The report states that the aircraft had not been briefed on a possible vessel arriving at the time. Are we to presume, if Coastwatch aircraft are not told to expect an illegal ship, that the crews have their eyes in the cockpit or are reading or doing something like that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major part of the report is directed towards complaining about the shortages of intelligence information. The report hangs the failure to detect the vessel purely on the fact that there was not adequate intelligence available. I will come back to that in a minute. In the findings of the report, it becomes apparent that very little flying is actually done, even though the Coastwatch capabilities were expanded considerably under the new contract, in the areas that are at risk. In fact, the report says that the only flying that is done out to sea is on the approaches both to Darwin and to Broome because it is not thought likely that anyone would land in the Kimberley area where this ship came ashore. According to the report, that is really based on the experience of seven arrivals over the last two years. If that has been the pattern of the arrivals, a great degree of inflexibility in the planning and the approach of the Coastwatch service has developed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Everything seems to turn on this lack of intelligence. There are a couple of points I make about that. First of all, if anyone has any knowledge at all of the Indonesian archipelago, they will know that there are thousands of islands and thousands of small craft there. If anyone thinks they can have an intelligence service which will tell which 30- or 40-foot boat will come to Australia with illegal immigrants, they are really whistling in the wind. It is quite impossible to have that degree of sophistication in an intelligence service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, if we step up our countermeasures against these ships coming in, as we must&mdash;if these illegal immigrants, instead of coming in and advertising their presence and seeking to be detected in the way all these boat people have, operate in a covert way, no sort of intelligence service will know what is coming in. The answer is to change the system. We must have some degree of self-reliance with our own patrolling facilities to detect offshore, not inshore, when these ships arrive. It really does mean considerably more resources if we are to have an effective service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the straw men the report puts up is the proposition that we can somehow or other have 100 per cent success against entry. That is not the point at all and it is never a point I have argued. What one has to have is a high probability of detection. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too would like to address briefly this report by the Australian Customs Service Coastwatch on the investigation into the arrival of a suspect illegal entrant vessel carrying some 56 people into Montague Sound on the West Australian coast. I note that the investigation was carried out by an internal panel composed of members of Coastwatch and representatives of the client services. These client services have interests in fisheries, immigration, quarantine, customs, national parks and wildlife and Great Barrier Reef protection matters. I note with some concern that there does not seem to have been a representative of the Department of Defence and I shall return to that point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will pick out a number of items in the report without repeating the whole ambit of considerations which were canvassed by the previous speaker. I refer to a paragraph on page 6 which states that it would be impossible when investigating river mouths to do more than simply fly past them. It is clearly not possible, in the view of the Australian Customs Service, to investigate upstream whether anybody has entered a river. Doing so would reduce its capacity to carry out other supervision and surveillance activities. That in itself indicates the lack of resources, the thin coverage and indeed the whole ramshackle nature of Coastwatch as it currently is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also refer to the main problem that the investigation unit apparently found concerning the lack of definitive intelligence information. I believe that clearly shows that we are not at the moment capable of protecting our coastline, which should be our main defence focus. Following the end of the Cold War, the Australian Democrats believe that the focus of Australian defence strategy should be the protection of our coastline rather than an adherence to the old theory of forward defence which was maintained in our previous role as support forces to the United States global strategy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report's recommendations quite clearly indicate that we require a greater use of non-contract aircraft&mdash;in other words, more aircraft; that we should utilise more airfields in Western Australia; that we should change procedures and attitudes to a more goal directed point; that we should institute intelligence services capable of providing accurate and definitive information; and that we should increase liaison and cooperation&mdash;that the present system is simply not adequate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear that the present arrangements are simply not working and that we must ensure that our coastline is protected adequately. I believe that the only way to achieve that is to place current Coastwatch activities under the control of the defence forces and to ensure that the forward equipment purchasing program of the defence forces is changed to enable us to acquire the equipment and materiel that is required to protect our coastline, rather than indulge in the purchase of sabre rattling major items of defence equipment which have a long range capability which no longer has any relevance to our strategic considerations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish briefly to support what my colleague from Queensland Senator MacGibbon had to say about the Australian Customs Service report on the investigation into the illegal entry of a vessel into Montague Sound. My recollection of what happened over Christmas and my reading of the report seem to bear out the view that Coastwatch mostly watches the entrances to Darwin, Broome, Derby and Koolan Island rather than spending a great amount of time watching the open sea.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do believe&mdash;if one can believe what the press had to say at the time&mdash;that some intelligence reports were coming through that the boat was on its way down. Obviously the people aboard it were heading for more civilised country. Anyone who has visited that area will certainly know what it is like&mdash;the vast expanses of beast lines and pastoral country with not too many people living there. I would say they came ashore for a brief period to have a look around and, as the report says, when they saw fires or smoke they thought there was civilisation inland and so they headed that way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This seems to be borne out by the remarkably fit condition these people were in when rescued, after travelling the distance they had&mdash;and I do not know exactly how long they took to travel that distance. If they had not seen the fires and decided to take off inland, I presume they would have headed for Koolan Island, Broome, Derby or whatever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Coastwatch should watch the isolated coast much more than it does. However, the rescuers and the organisers are to be commended. From what I remember of the report, it said that 56 people were lost in the bush over a number of days and were all rescued in the end without suffering any great harm. It was an incident that could have turned into a real disaster, even taking account of the shorter distance they travelled, but for the fact that there was rain in the area at that time of the year, which is rather unusual. The Wet usually starts much earlier, so they were lucky. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that the WA Police Force spent $12,500 in connection with the operation, or that is what it is claiming. I should like to mention also the station people who worked for the rescue of those people. They accommodated not only the 56 people who were rescued but also twice that number in rescuers and police, and they probably are not seeking recompense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that Coastwatch is doing a reasonable job, but those isolated areas have to be patrolled a lot more. As Senator MacGibbon has said, we cannot really rely on intelligence from the Indonesian islands about what is going on, although the media did say that there were some reports of those people being on their way down. Certainly we will need that type of intelligence to prevent a recurrence of illegal immigrants coming to Australia. Of course, it is important that the lives not only of the illegal immigrants but also of the people who go out rescuing them are not put in danger. I recommend that appropriate action be taken. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too would like to make a few brief comments in support of my colleagues Senator MacGibbon and Senator Panizza with regard to Coastwatch. Coastwatch has been a major concern for Western Australians in particular for a long time, and Senator MacGibbon from Queensland shares that concern. Both our States have vast areas of coastline, which is an open door for people wishing to come into Australia. The incident earlier this year to which Senator Panizza was referring was particularly serious. It showed how easy it is for a group of people not only to break the coastline but also to get quite a long way inshore before being detected in any way, shape or form. What is concerning people from the Kimberley and the Pilbara, and other Australians, I might add, is the risk of disease to humans, livestock and wildlife, and how that can turn this country around from being a very safe and secure place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been concerned for many years about the way in which the Government has been cost-cutting Coastwatch. That concern goes back many years to when Amman Aviation and Skywest Airlines were battling to try to get the contract for Coastwatch. It is not a case of blaming Coastwatch per se; it is a case of saying: where is the money coming from? Is it sufficient? <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>Is that organisation underresourced, undermanned? The bottom line is the amount of finance that is being put towards Coastwatch to ensure that there is adequate protection of our coastlines all the way around northern Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This requirement has, I fear, been put on the back-burner for many years. I do not think enough attention has been paid to the fact that we are talking about a very valuable part of our coastline. Because many diseases can enter along the coastline, why has not more attention been focused on those areas?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot understand why earlier this year the Government kept saying that there had been a hint of intelligence passed on from other countries that this boat was on its way, when in fact it appeared that our own intelligence was inadequate to confirm or deny one way or the other what was happening. That is a matter of great concern to the people of the north-west of Western Australia. They do not know whether their coastline is being adequately looked after, whether the surveillance is sufficient, and indeed whether there are enough equipment and manpower to make sure that these safeguards are in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a matter of great concern to all of us of the Senate, and to the many Australians who take a keen interest in Coastwatch, to ensure that in the very near future the Government clearly focuses its attention on how Coastwatch can be improved and how the coastline can be put under adequate surveillance to ensure that there is no further invasion such as that which occurred early in 1992. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>This report is very important, particularly to people in rural Australia. I am a member of the Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs which is conducting an inquiry into the effects of the drought task force and of the drought itself. Since about the middle of January the Committee has conducted a number of public hearings in almost every Australian State. Given that the only assistance the Commonwealth is now affording to the rural community in time of drought is through the rural adjustment scheme, I should perhaps take this opportunity to make a few points. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of the effects of the drought, the severe recession which has hit the rural community, plus the severe drop in commodity prices, there has been a catastrophic increase under the scheme of 164 per cent in part A applications and 155 per cent under part C applications. One must bear in mind that part C of the rural adjustment scheme is aimed at helping farmers to leave the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Australia at present has the biggest overseas debt in its history, I assure the Senate that, even though the rural community may not be favoured as much by the Government as it once was in bringing money into this country, given the right sort of commodity prices and some encouragement Australian primary industry is still well positioned to help to bring Australia out of the terrible recession in which it now finds itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was disappointed that in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">One Nation</EMPHASIS> document put out last week by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the only assistance that farmers appear to be receiving is an extra $30m over the next three years in the rural adjustment scheme&mdash;$10m each year in the form of assistance under part A. There seems to be no mention in that document of part C, although I know that there has been crop planting assistance of $16.8m. This matter was brought to the Committee's attention in its public hearings by grain farmers and others who were very concerned that there was no money available under the rural adjustment scheme for that sort of activity. Therefore, I give credit to the Government for at least applying some money to that area to assist farmers to plant crops. When we were speaking to them, they had not only no rain but no money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to say that just about every place our Committee visited, apart from Esperance, has had floods since then. I do not know whether that was because we visited these places or because our Chairman, Senator Burns, just happened to pick the right time to visit them. Dubbo and Cobar have had far too much rain, but I am afraid we cannot do much about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Getting back to the serious side of this matter, for all the reasons that I alluded to earlier, I believe it is a pity that the rural adjustment scheme, given the severity of the rural decline in Australia, has not been given more support from the Government. In just about every area that we had our public hearings, fourth and fifth generation farmers were talking about leaving the land. It was very clear that there will be a departure rate of farmers in Australia of some 20 per cent to 30 per cent. That is quite alarming. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It concerns me that the Government, in its <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">One Nation</EMPHASIS> document, has allocated $800,000 per year over the next four years, until 1995, for rural counselling. Quite obviously the Government must think this recession will last a lot longer, particularly the rural recession, if it is to commit funds of nearly $1m for the next five years. The rural counselling service is doing a wonderful job. If the Government foresees that that amount of money has to be spent over the next five years, at least it is looking in a practical way at what may be the outcome of our rural recession. I hope that the Government has another look at the rural adjustment scheme and, where possible, increases long term loans and low interest loans to farmers since they prove most effective. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too am concerned about the annual report of the rural adjustment scheme. In the statement that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) put down last week there was an allocation of $10.8m for this year and $6m for next year to provide a crop planting scheme, which would give a 75 per cent subsidy to farmers who are in need. That built up an expectation that a number of farmers would receive the subsidy. On a close reading of the papers that went with the Prime Minister's statement, we see it is a fact of life that only the farmers on part B of the rural adjustment scheme will be eligible for this particular subsidy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It concerns me that the Government is trying to do a loaves and fishes act. The Government has provided $10.8m for this year's crop. On my calculations, using the Grains Council's figure of $100 a hectare to plant a crop and dividing that into the number of acres that will be planted, we estimate that between 1,500 and 1,600 farmers can be helped. On the Government's own admission in the 1990 annual report of the rural adjustment scheme, 6,042 farmers are in need of rural adjustment assistance. That leaves something like 4,000 farmers who will not be able to be assisted. The industry comes up with figures much higher. The grain industry believes that 20 per cent of grain growers&mdash;that is, 8,000 people out of 40,000 grain growers&mdash;are in need of some assistance before they can plant a crop this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then again, the statement says that it will help sugarcane farmers plant. There are 7,000 canegrowers in Australia, and they are in even greater need than the grain growers. If we take 20 per cent of the canegrowers and add 20 per cent of the grain growers, we find that there is a figure of 9,000 people who will need assistance to plant a crop this year. Yet the money that is being allocated will assist only around 1,600 people. So there will be a great need out there for assistance to plant crops. The amounts that have been allocated will just not go anywhere near the mark. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another point needs to be raised very urgently. I had wanted to take it up with the Minister responsible at Question Time today; unfortunately I was not able to ask the question. This is going through part B of the rural adjustment scheme.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year, as senators will remember, on 29 November we were told that we had to pass legislation quickly because  2,000 farmers were lining up to get Jobsearch allowance. I remind the Democrats of that because they had the gun pointed at their heads. Of those 2,000 farmers, only 120 have been able to go through the rural adjustment scheme and actually get a certificate which would give them the Jobsearch allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here we have the Government passing over the most important decision to the State rural adjustment schemes to allocate subsidies to get the seeds in the ground&mdash;and we have only four weeks to do it, because plantings must start by 1 April.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It took the rural adjustment scheme at least four months to allocate those 120 people Jobsearch allowance&mdash;and the Government is flick-passing this major decision to a body that is not equipped to make such decisions.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those principles, very briefly, were that the company will operate on a strictly commercial basis, have access to the requisite sites, operate under labour agreements that reflect best international practice and productivity standards, and be able to attract activities where appropriate, to provide access to its network and facilities to public and private sector operators, and be able to provide services for the Government on a strictly commercial basis and not be in any way responsible for redundancies that might arise in rail authorities resulting from its formation and operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition supports those objectives of the National Rail Corporation. We recognise that there are a lot fine objectives in that, but we have great doubts as to whether the Government has the will and the ability to bring them about, particularly when the Government talks about the introduction of best international practices in productivity standards and labour agreements. For a government which has shown great reluctance to improve productivity&mdash;and  the graphs of the performance of Australia in the last eight years that this Government has been in power show that pretty well everything else in the country has grown: unemployment, indebtedness, bank failures, commercial failures&mdash;productivity on an international level has been absolutely negligible, and stands in stark contrast with the achievements of other industrialised nations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We hope the Government is serious about this expression of a wish to introduce best international practice in productivity standards. To bring that about, it really has to free up the labour market and get away from having a Minister such as Senator Cook who on every issue dances to the tune of the ACTU and the unions. Unless that is done, the real problem is that we will end up, as a consequence of this National Rail Corporation Agreement Bill, with a far worse situation for Australia than we have at present.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have at present is not very good. No-one would claim that Australia's railways, collectively or individually, are models of efficiency and commercial success. I forget the amount they lose every year, but it probably runs into well in excess of $1 billion. They lose that amount because they are badly managed, and one of the key reasons for that is that labour relations within the unions&mdash;and the railway unions are extremely conservative&mdash;just have not moved with the times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very important that we have an efficient national transport system. One cannot view a transport system by looking at the individual units and developing one of them. It is fair to say that 10 years ago we had a reasonably efficient air transport system in Australia. I do not think the same is true today. We need to develop the best, most efficient systems we can in road, rail, air and sea. There are certainly innate characteristics with each form of transport which make it the transport system of choice for certain goods and services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Large bulk commodities that do not have any time pressure for delivery from one point to another are best moved by sea, provided the utilisation points are accessible to ports. Road transport certainly has the great advantage of flexibility. Roads lead to most parts of this country; the road system is highly developed. The road transport industry operates under enormous penalties. As Senator Panizza was telling me during Question Time, it pays 20 per cent sales tax on trucks and equipment, which stands in marked contrast with the sales tax reduction from 20 per cent to 15 per cent for cars announced in Mr Keating's statement last week. The industry pays an enormous amount in fuel excise and other imposts but, even so, it still survives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to look back historically at the way the sea trade on the coast of Australia has almost collapsed. Once upon a time sea trade was a big carrier for both passengers and freight. It is not so far back in history that we had a strong seaborne trade around Australia&mdash;probably up until the mid-1950s. We certainly had the large passenger liners&mdash;the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kanimbla, </EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Manunda</EMPHASIS>, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Manoora </EMPHASIS>and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Westralia</EMPHASIS>&mdash;plying around the capital cities and up to Cairns. With the development of the tourist trade on an international basis, provided the work practices could be overcome, there would be a place for cruise liners of some size doing the Barrier Reef and north Queensland runs up the east coast of Australia again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also had a very strong coastal shipping trade working through the river ports and going up the east coast, where we have so many river ports, both in New South Wales and in Queensland. There was a very strong interstate trade. That was also killed off, and it was killed off through work practices&mdash;by the dominance of the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia and the Seamen's Union demanding conditions of service that the industry simply could not support. But it was also killed off&mdash;and this is its relevance to this Bill&mdash;by the States' railways, which sought to get rid of what was a competitor, particularly in the form of intrastate coastal shipping. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can remember in my own State of Queensland the way the Queensland railways would come to the clients of AUSN, Howard Smith and the other shipping companies operating on the coast and offer them rates for the transport of their goods up the Queensland coast that the shipping companies, even if they had efficient manning practices, simply could not meet. Once the ships went off the trade, the railways were free to set their own freight rates without any respect for competition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Returning to the history of railways in Australia, since about 1850 we have been bedevilled by the fact that there has not been an overall view of running a rail system for the whole of Australia. The way we all came to get separate gauges for each State so that no State could pinch another State's rolling stock is well known and there is no point in going over what is now old history. The tragedy is that the lack of unification of the railways system has persisted, to our great economic disadvantage, well past the point by about 100 years that it should have. We have a need to run a standard gauge on all the lines in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not the purpose of this Bill to canvass the need for the development of one standard permanent way system around Australia, beyond saying that, while it is a necessity, it needs a fair bit of thought as to how it will be funded. I am not putting the case that the Federal Government should fund 100 per cent of it, although I am conscious of the argument that there is a national advantage in such a system and that therefore the common interest justifies some taxpayer support for that system. An extension of that argument is that if it is going to be for the national good, as I believe it is, and the development of the country, I do not see why one generation should pay for it in two or three decades when it is an asset the country will possess and derive benefit from over many years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from the lack of standard gauge in the railway system, the conservatism of the railway unions has been a problem. They have been interested in preserving their jobs without taking any cognisance of how they operate in those jobs. They have been supported in that, in the main, by complacent State governments. State governments have not been too concerned about the enormous losses the railways have made over all the time they have owned them, and that has led to a reluctance to see railways as systems to which modern technology could be applied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two or three years ago I went to Rockwell Collins at Cedar Rapids. Rockwell Collins is one of the world leaders in avionics and electronic systems principally for aviation and some marine use, but it has also developed an advanced electronic control system for the operation of railways. That system virtually transfers aircraft-type technology into locomotive engine cabins. It not only gives a totally different and far more efficient environment for the operation of train crews, leading to big increases in safety, ease of operation and reduction in manning, but also applies to the whole of the control system for the regulation of rail traffic on lines, the communications systems of trains in transit and so on. It is a very comprehensive system. It also has simulators similar to aircraft simulators so that locomotive drivers can be trained within a workshop or laboratory in operational techniques, safety procedures and all the rest of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I looked at this and my first reaction, given the fact that it has not been a high technology industry, was to ask the company whether locomotive drivers in their forties, fifties and older, who may even have started with steam trains in the United States, could be re-educated and taught modern practices. The company representatives said that one of the great surprises of the system was that they found that train crews converted successfully and enthusiastically to these new practices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of the day, the introduction of systems such as this significantly improves productivity, but I suggest that we would look in vain to see any State government, or even the National Rail Authority, moving in these directions within Australia. It is one of the things that we have to do if we are to have a profitable rail system. We must have a system which does not make anywhere near the present losses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have already referred to the business of best practice in labour relations and I will not canvass that. On the subject of profitability of the railway lines, I would like to refer to my own State of Queensland. Probably the only State railway which makes a nominal profit is Queensland Railways, but it does that through grossly unfair practices. Queensland Railways derives its profit from quite extortionate charges on the captive audience it has in the Bowen Basin with its coalfields. The irony of the situation is that the mines contributed pretty well 100 per cent to the cost of building that rail line and now, for the privilege of running on it,  pay quite extortionate charges to the State Government which go towards covering all the other inefficiencies within the State Rail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The consequences of that are several. First, it means that the State Government is under very little pressure to improve the gross inefficiencies in the rest of the services in the State. Secondly, those taxes&mdash;which is what they are; they are not a charge for a service, they are a straight out tax, a concealed tax, on the coal industry&mdash;are making the retention of export markets, let alone the acquisition of new markets, very difficult. The rail cost has to be added to the cost of coal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst I noted with pleasure that this Government picked up the proposition of the Liberal Party and the National Party that in government we would abolish the coal export levy&mdash;which was another iniquitous tax&mdash;and got rid of the coal export levy, it is doing nothing about talking to its colleagues in the Labor Government in Queensland to get them to set a fair and reasonable charge for rail freights on the Queensland fields. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that the Government can attain the objectives that it has listed in this Bill. It will certainly to need a great deal more determination than it has shown at any time in the previous eight years of government to take on the unions and come up with efficient work practices, and I hope it does not walk away from its responsibilities in that regard. As I said earlier, if the National Rail Corporation Agreement Bill does not work in the way it is intended to, Australia will be very much worse off, losing many more billions of dollars on an inefficient rail service. It is vital that the Government has the will and the determination to proceed down the path that it has outlined and take it to a successful conclusion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the National Rail Corporation Agreement Bill 1991. I have had a long interest in rail in South Australia mainly because of the role of Australian National in South Australia. It is a very important industry. Australian National is still either the third or fourth biggest employer of labour in South Australia of any public or private sector industry. It has a considerable influence on the economic well-being of South Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since Australian National was created in 1975, when the Whitlam Government reached agreement with the Dunstan State Labor Government to take over the State rail, AN in South Australia has done an excellent job in building up a commercially viable freight organisation that has substantially improved productivity and has been run efficiently with good management. In my view, Australian National is a model that every other State rail system in Australia could follow with success. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian National also looks after the rail system in Tasmania. At the same time as South Australian Rail was taken over by the Commonwealth, the Tasmanian State Rail was taken over. Again, similar significant improvements in the running of Tasrail have occurred. All the evidence is there that Australian National, the rail system owned by the Commonwealth, has proved itself to be the best rail system in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has had to make a number of very tough decisions over the last 17 years since its establishment. For example, when it took over the South Australian rail system and combined it with the old Commonwealth Railways which were operating in South Australia, the total number employed was close to 13,000; it is now under 6,000. That has obviously been a significant reduction. All of it was done by attrition and voluntary redundancies and without creating any long term  industrial disputes. It is a credit to both the trade unions involved and to the management that that reduction in the work force has been achieved while Australian National has been able to improve its productivity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some other changes came about in that period because of advanced technology. For example, the replacement of wooden sleepers by concrete sleepers on much of the east-west railway line that Australian National controls through South Australia has substantially reduced the number of fettlers employed along the line from probably close to 1,000 to now only a couple of hundred. There will be further reductions in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Improved communication systems using new technology on that rail system have also meant that jobs have gone. Using bigger, more powerful and longer trains and double stacking of containers have meant job losses, but there has also been a significant improvement in productivity. It has meant that over the last decade or more the east-west railway freight line, from Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide to Perth, has broken even. It seems to me that Australian National in particular has to be given considerable credit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose most of us who are interested in rail transport in Australia have made many speeches about the history in Australia of the development of rail. It has led to each State having a separate rail system, with the madness of different gauges from the last century when petty State parochialism meant that we ended up with three different railway gauges. That is still the main problem we are trying to overcome as far as running a national system of rail is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also must be the only country of 17 million people&mdash;even though spread across a very large continent&mdash;that has five rail systems operating with five separate managements which arbitrarily stop at State boundaries. It has meant that since Federation there has never been any great effort made to overcome the parochialism of the nineteenth century and the structure of the way rail was operated. When we look at the maps of the various States we see railway lines going out from each of the capital cities like spokes. Before the turn of the century every rural and regional community wanted to have a train line reaching it because that meant it could transport its produce and its people to and from the capital city. It also meant jobs in the local town. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those were the days when we relied on ox carts and horse transport to shift produce at the rate of about 20 or 25 miles a day. So the introduction of train lines into country areas was a transport revolution. But, as I said, because of the stupidity of colonial administrators in adopting different rail gauges, we have never had the benefit of a national rail system. However, through the National Rail Corporation, it seems that there is some hope that instead of having five or six rail systems operating in Australia, by the beginning of next century we might be down to only one or two, and certainly one national organisation for interstate freight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This agreement came about as a result of discussion and negotiations last year between the Federal Government and the various States that are involved. In general, like most reasonable people, I obviously support the concept of a National Rail Corporation. But there are a number of aspects about it that cause me concern. The first one is that to reach agreement with the States, the Commonwealth had to agree that no matter how much equity or financial resources it put into the National Rail Corporation it could not get more than 49 per cent of the vote on the board of the Corporation, and also it could not have a majority of board members. I believe that that is an unacceptable outcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be very strange indeed if a majority shareholder of any company in the world who is contributing, as in this case, hundreds of millions of dollars would be precluded for at least the first five years from having any more than 49 per cent of the voting rights around the board room table. I cannot imagine any other shareholder in a similar venture anywhere else in the world, let alone Australia, saying, `We will put 80 per cent of the money in, but those interests putting in less than 50 per cent are going to end up with more than 50 per cent of the vote'. I do not think that is a sensible outcome. In the negotiations the States would not agree to any other arrangement because they were very much afraid that the Commonwealth, via AN, would dominate the running of the National Rail Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been too much petty parochialism by States trying to protect their patches, whether through management of the State rail system, through State governments, or through various trade unions. There has always been a very strong protection of States rights in the running of rail. I think that has cost Australia dearly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since this Bill was introduced into the Parliament, the Prime Minister has brought down the One Nation statement which indicated that over the next four years there will be nearly $500m made available to upgrade the rail system around Australia. I do not think anyone would object to that money being spent. It has been greatly welcomed by the people in the transport industry and the rail industry. I am very pleased to see the conditions the Prime Minister has put on the $400m-plus. At page 98 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">One Nation</EMPHASIS> document, the following statement is made:</PARA>

<PARA>I believe that the last point, in particular, starts to address the concern I have expressed about the original agreement&mdash;that the $400m the Commonwealth is putting in by way of equity, as outlined in this statement, should be reflected in the voting strength of the National Rail Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the Minister for Shipping and Aviation (Senator Collins), when responding to the second reading debate, whether he would be able, even at this early stage, to give indications to the Senate of what stage negotiations are at with changing the articles of incorporation to ensure that the Commonwealth does get a commensurate voting strength to the amount of equity it is putting in. When we add AN's assets and the $400m outlined in the One Nation statement, we are looking at a Commonwealth contribution of probably somewhere around 70 per cent plus. It would be irresponsible of the Australian Government and the Parliament to allow a situation in which its equity contribution to an organisation that it has established is not reflected in voting rights. I hope that the Minister, in response to the second reading debate or at the committee stage, can give some indication to the Senate of where we are at with those negotiations on voting rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the future of the National Rail Corporation, some tough decisions will be taken which will be unpopular in various parts of Australia. I notice that, in my own State of South Australia, the standardisation of the Adelaide-Melbourne railway line will mean that a number of broad gauge railway lines will no longer have a connection to Adelaide. I do not think a third rail will be put down the middle of the broad gauge track. So the Bordertown-Mt Gambier railway line will no longer be connected to Adelaide. I think most of the rail lines in the Murray-Mallee, which mainly carry wheat, will also be left broad gauge and will not have a connection to Adelaide. Although I have read the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">One Nation</EMPHASIS> document, I still cannot find the detail on that. Perhaps the Minister, in response to the second reading debate, can also give us some indication on that matter. If those train lines are left broad gauge, there is no doubt that in a short period they will be under threat of complete closure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that the One Nation statement indicates that the Commonwealth has reached agreement with the State Government of South Australia that the passenger service between Adelaide and Mt Gambier will now cease. The State Government has agreed not to go to court or the tribunal in relation to this matter. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also have to say that one does not have to be a genius to realise that the broad gauge train lines in parts of South Australia that will be left after standardisation will be a bit like dags on the end of a sheep. When announcements are made some time in the intermediate future that those lines will probably be closed completely, there will be quite a strong community reaction. That matter will have to be dealt with. We will have to explain to people that the services that may be lost&mdash;even at freight level, let alone passenger level&mdash;can be made up in some other way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope, of course, that it would be possible for the Bordertown-Mount Gambier line to be standardised and for the present broad gauge line to be converted to standard gauge by the technique of bringing the rail in from five feet three inches to four feet eight and a half inches. Some people may argue that that would be too costly and that there would not be a cost-benefit return. But that will be a major issue for my own State. It will certainly be an issue in western Victoria where there is a major broad gauge system running from Mildura through Horsham down to Portland, as well as other ancillary lines, all of which run the risk of being dismembered from the standard gauge system&mdash;again leading to pressure for them to be closed. That will be a major issue in Victoria as it is in South Australia and again will have to be addressed by the National Rail Corporation and various governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even though those are difficult problems, we should not be deflected from the main aim of establishing a national rail freight corporation with one management system across Australia. I argue very strongly that it must be a management that reflects the equity contribution of the various shareholders. I must say that I do not trust State governments with running rail systems. The track record in Australia of State governments running rail systems, particularly in the eastern States, has been a never ending list of disasters. Billions of dollars have been lost because governments&mdash;I am not picking out Labor or Liberal; it applies to all State governments&mdash;have never been willing to make the tough decisions about management to restructure their rail in accordance with modern requirements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At times I have made myself unpopular with some sections of the rail unions in the eastern States by pointing that out. I do not believe that the rail systems of New South Wales or Victoria should be run as a social welfare system. If there are problems with redundancy and with having to reduce labour, they should be dealt with in a properly organised restructuring package whereby appropriate redundancies are paid commensurate with people's service. One does not throw people out on the scrap heap. But, conversely, one cannot expect the taxpayers to go on funding endlessly, as if into a big black hole, the losses of the State rail systems of New South Wales and Victoria, because in the end they will destroy the Budgets of both those States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of last year I was involved with reaching an agreement in South Australia between the Federal Government, AN and the unions over the redundancy package paid there when AN said that it needed to reduce labour by another 1,500 positions over a four- or five-year period. After some robust&mdash;to say the least&mdash;discussions and negotiations, agreement was reached as a special one-off package. As a result, it appears that there will be no forced redundancies; people will take the package and leave voluntarily. I believe that that has been a very successful outcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think New South Wales and Victoria have acted wisely in the past. They have responded to political pressure to maintain rail systems in areas where clearly they are not economic. I have to agree that I, like other politicians from time to time, will lobby hard when I have constituents in a particular area asking for a rail service to be maintained and a railway station to remain open. We have all been in a sense guilty of that when it may not have been in the long term economic interest of the rail system for it to remain a commercial operation. Rail should be run as a commercial operation. If the community wants a special service provided, that should be transparently identified and subsidised in a specific way in the Budget, provided out of taxpayers' revenue, but in such a way that it is seen by everybody. It should not be done with just a global figure so that it is hidden, because in the end it is the good old taxpayers who pay for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that the National Rail Corporation does not fall for what I would call the pea and thimble trick of trying to pick up the losses and inefficiencies of the system in New South Wales and Victoria, but I am suspicious still that attempts will be made by both those State governments and their rail systems to cross-subsidise some of the loss areas in their own States from the profitable area that is coming to the National Rail Corporation from the east-west freight system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I see Senator Panizza sitting on the other side of the chamber. He is a Western Australian. Westrail is the other rail system in Australia that should be congratulated on the efforts it has made to upgrade itself to make a profit on interstate freight. I think that South Australians and Western Australians should be very wary to ensure that the profit making on the east-west freight line is not used to subsidise the present enormous losses on the Melbourne-Sydney-Brisbane line. Those losses are made because the train line is not up to standard. We have all heard it before; there are too many bends and too many hills and it is a slow trip. I understand from some people that the train now takes longer to get from Sydney to Melbourne than it did when the line was first built many, many years ago. I know that the train on part of the broad gauge line between Adelaide and Melbourne certainly goes slower than it did in 1880 when the train line was built because the track has not been kept at the level that it should have been. That was due to the problem of reaching agreement between State and Federal governments about who was responsible for paying what. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose ultimately&mdash;some time in the next 10 or 15 years&mdash;Australians may be big enough to forget petty parochial State interests and end up with one rail system in this country with one management. When we get that I think we will be able to tackle an issue that I feel strongly about; that is, the building of the Alice Springs-Darwin railway line. I have to agree that it is very hard at the moment to say, in a cost-benefit analysis, that the line can pay for itself. But I think there are certain projects in Australia from time to time where one has to take a partial leap of faith to build the thing first in the belief that it is a national development issue. I certainly do not believe in the cargo cult of building a dam on every river in Australia. </PARA>

If we get the system in the south operating properly&mdash;in particular, if we get the freight system in the southern States working well&mdash;I think the justification for the Alice Springs-Darwin line gets stronger, with a major modern container port to be built near Darwin and connected to the rail system using a standard gauge. We could cut the time for freight coming into southern Australia from South East Asia by five or six days by having a land bridge across Australia. But it would require a very efficient train system, a very efficient container port in Darwin, and fast freight trains operating at speeds of 110 to 140 kilometres per hour on a very good track. That would mean that we would save probably a week's shipping time in getting goods in both directions between Asia and the southern States. </PARA>

However, there is no doubt that the higher priority in the short term is to get the southern system working properly. I think one could then justify the Alice Springs-Darwin line with a modern container port. As an article of faith I would say that, but I do not think that it is faith in the blind sense of pie in the sky. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those of us who have been aficionados of trains and rail in Australia for a long time have had a pretty bleak period over the past 20 or 30 years. Despite some of my misgivings about the technical structure of the board of the National Rail Corporation and with the statement last week, for the first time since the great train building periods of the last century Australia is getting back into trains in a big way. That is to be welcomed. We will end up with an efficient freight system for long haul freight that will make Australia a more competitive place. I think also it will make Australians, as the document says, one nation, accepting the fact that one cannot run rail as five separate systems which ought to be run nationally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have often wondered how one would run Australian Airlines or Ansett on the basis that when their aircraft crossed the State border there had to be a change of crew or that there were different booking systems. I have had plenty of examples given to me whereby freight and passengers have not been maximised in the system because different State rail systems have incompatible computer booking systems. I have been told, `You are on your own once you leave New South Wales because the Victorian system does not have a compatible computer system for monitoring the containers'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by reciting what some people say is an hilarious story. If it were not so sad it would be funny. It is about the problem of having a number of different rail systems. Some two or three years ago, I asked representatives from General Motors in South Australia why they did not use rail to send their new cars to Sydney. The transport officer said, `We did try a year ago. We loaded up a train full of brand new Holden cars to go to Sydney, all pre-ordered, all ready to go to the dealers. People had paid their deposit. We put the cars on the train in Adelaide with AN and off it went. Three days later we started getting phone calls from dealers in Sydney saying, "Where are the cars?". We made an inquiry of AN, which said, "No, no. The train got to Broken Hill. We handed it over to State Rail of New South Wales". We rang up State Rail of New South Wales and asked, "Where are the cars?". It said, "They have been delivered. You have made some mistake". This went on for some days. After some days, State Rail of New South Wales had to admit that it had lost the train, it could not find a whole train which was loaded down with probably $1m worth of cars. Several more days went by and it finally found the train sitting in a siding, I understand, somewhere near the Menindee Lake by the River Darling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the rail system we have at the moment. One just does not lose an occasional suitcase or even a container; the whole bloody train got lost. That is why General Motors went back to using trucks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Per unit, that is a much more expensive way of getting cars to Sydney, but in the long run it was a decision it was forced to make because of the inefficiencies of having five different rail systems. I hope that before this decade is out State parochialism has gone and we have a decent rail system based on the beginnings of what we have before us here in this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In addressing the National Rail Corporation Agreement Bill 1991, I am pleased to follow Senator Schacht, particularly since he acknowledged and commented upon the long awaited Alice Springs to Darwin rail link. I believe that Senator Schacht's contribution to this debate is the first public statement by a Labor politician that goes down that route and certainly acknowledges that area of importance. I only hope that Senator Schacht does not feel that he will be subject to accusations of heresy by his waterfront unions in Melbourne and Sydney and some of the other interstate rail system unions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If ever there was an opportunity for us to link South Australia and the adjoining parts of Australia with South and North East Asia through a rail connection from Alice Springs to Darwin, now is definitely the time. The proposal to extend Australia's standard gauge rail system by completing the national rail network between Darwin and Alice Springs has been an ongoing proposal since 1911 when it was a legislative promise of the Federal Parliament; it has not yet been honoured. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many reasons why the concept of a railway from Alice Springs to Darwin and a new modern port infrastructure at Darwin, as Senator Schacht has just stated very correctly&mdash;known more recently as the integrated transport system&mdash;should go ahead. The most important of these is the fact that the world's fastest growing economies lie to Australia's north: Korea, Taiwan, Japan and Indonesia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his 1989 report entitled `Australia and the North East Asian Ascendancy', Professor Ross Garnaut wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's economic success in utilising opportunities associated with North East Asian economic growth is of fundamental importance to long-term economic success, and of substantial importance politically and culturally as well.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Relations with North East Asia are in order of magnitude more important to economic development in Australia than are relations with any other region.</PARA>
<PARA>Last week we saw the tabling of the report by the North East Asia Analytical Unit within the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade entitled `Australia and North East Asia in the 1990s: Accelerating Change' in which the outlook for exports is referred to. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">North East Asia is expected to make the largest contribution of any region to Australia's export growth over the next five years. Export targets developed by Austrade suggest the possibility of gains of the order of A$10 billion Australian (in 1989 dollars) over 1989-1994.</PARA>
<PARA>The Northern Territory is undoubtedly very well placed to take advantage of these markets due to its proximity to Asia and through the establishment of trade agreements such as the recent trade memorandum signed by the Northern Territory Government and the Indonesian Government. If such reports are focusing Australia's attention on Asia and trading links with the region, then we as a nation should be looking at transport infrastructure that is commercially viable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An integrated transport system cannot work without national commitment to the project. Again, I think it is important to stress that what we are looking for from all sides of the Parliament is a commitment to the project. It cannot work unless all Australians want it to work. It is fine for me, Senator Schacht and others to stand here and give a commitment in that regard, but it must be a commitment of political parties and of major organisations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not only a project designed to benefit the Northern Territory. It is a project that will benefit all of Australia as we reduce our reliance on traditional trading partners in Europe and America and rightfully seek to forge new economic ties with the countries to our north. The proposal to build the north-south railway has been on the drawing board in one form or another since 1911 when the Commonwealth took over control from South Australia of the Northern Territory. As I said, there was a legislative promise and commitment at that time to this important project. A number of more recent feasibility studies have been increasingly positive with regard to both the construction and operation of the railway project. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have hoped that Senator Collins, both as a senator for the Northern Territory and as a Minister in the transport portfolio, would have been in this chamber to back up the comments of Senator Schacht in this important area. I suspect that, apart from someone like Senator Schacht who is prepared to speak out, we will not see many Labor politicians taking this bold stance or view because the waterfront unions of Sydney and Melbourne and the rail unions of southern Australia would not want to see the successful completion of such an important land bridge that would certainly change and alter their operations but which we should also be doing as part of all of the reforms that are so necessary in transport in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An integrated transport system would undoubtedly generate significant externalities which will provide long term benefits to Australia. There will be immediate benefits during the construction stage which will be distributed across a range of industries supplying labour and materials to the project. A completed north-south rail link will provide benefits to other rail systems and, in particular, the National Rail Corporation through increased freight movements. Providing rail services where none currently exist will substantially reduce maintenance costs and accidents on existing roads in Australia. The availability of rail transport could contribute to the development of other projects such as mineral resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present, much of our international trade is carried on foreign ships. As Senator Schacht acknowledged in his statements, the additional travel time to take things to the waterfronts and then have them serviced across the wharves is a major area that needs change in Australia. The environmental impact of running one train as opposed to many trucks will be significantly less. Importantly and not least, even though it is last on my list, there will be defence preparedness and flexibility. I note, Madam Acting Deputy President Bjelke-Petersen, that today in Question Time you raised the matter of the Government's commitment to the projects it is putting forward in the One Nation proposal and the fact that that commitment is just not there, particularly in the areas that would relate transport and defence issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the light of this benefit relating to defence preparedness, I point out that I have been interested in the benefits of defence forces based in northern Australia, particularly in relation to the north-south railway. During the 1990-91 Senate Estimates committee hearings, I asked questions of the Department of Defence about the Department's long term commitment to the Alice Springs to Darwin railway. The Department responded in the following way:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department recognises the undoubted benefits to Defence interests that would accrue from the construction of the Alice Springs-Darwin railway but it is not in a position to contribute funding for such an endeavour.</PARA>
<PARA>My response to this answer by the Department was this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think the acknowledgment by Defence of the undoubted benefits is very important to the long term planning of that transport route.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given the current state of the economy and the attention national infrastructure programs have received in recent months, particularly in the coalition's Fightback proposals and in the Federal Government's statement of commitment and programming last week called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">One Nation</EMPHASIS>, I believe that the time is now right for the Federal Government to review the Alice Springs to Darwin railway project as a national priority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must express disappointment that last week's statement by the Labor Party, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">One Nation</EMPHASIS>, did not go anywhere in this regard. The map that appears on page 97 of the statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) of 26 February outlines the additional rail funding for all Australia. Some 12 or 14 projects are identified, but there is not one item of expenditure north of the Brisbane line. Even though the rail system is extended up to Cairns, there is no identification of the Alice Springs to Darwin railway; the map stops the rail connection at Alice Springs. There is not one mention in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">One Nation</EMPHASIS> anywhere of any commitment to a project to extend the land bridge between Alice Springs and Darwin. There are many fine words and many other projects are mentioned, but most of these projects occur in that axis between Newcastle and Geelong and are conveniently located in Labor electorates or very close marginal seats. That point needs attention. </PARA>

The Labor Government is committed to introducing non-deductible, non-assessable bonds for the funding of future capital works projects, but it is interesting to note that the funding of those projects does not start for several financial years.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Associated with any debate on the issue of rail are important points relating to transport and freight costs, which we must always address. In this respect, it is important to note that the coalition's proposals specifically look at the abolition of the petroleum products excise, including diesel and avgas.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Australia is to gain the confidence of investors, particularly our Asian neighbours, the north-south railway must be recognised as a project of national importance and as an integral part of Australia's future trade performance.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear that Australia's long term strategic interests are to pursue closer trading links with our neighbouring countries in which infrastructure needs to be developed to serve such trading links.

Such a proposal would create the potential for expanded national economic activity and the strengthening of ties with neighbouring Asian economies. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are currently debating the National Rail Corporation Agreement Bill 1991. Rail in this country has long been a cause of much debate&mdash;debate between the States and the Federal Government over control and debate within the community as to the efficiency of the rail system of this nation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the past 20 years, people in government have tried to address some of the obvious problems with the rail system as it stands. However, at this moment, they stand divided. Last week some of the most significant changes in rail history were announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). As with the National Rail Corporation, these changes will address some of the obvious problems we face in relation to our railways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill before us, combined with the rail elements of the One Nation statement, will revolutionise the transport system of our great country. Australia is a nation with a definite need for a comprehensive, united rail system. Ever since white settlement began we have built up our rail infrastructure. At one point rail was the major mode of interstate travel and freight, but today it has declined significantly. Certainly people do not want to travel by train if they need to get somewhere quickly. Obviously at this point, in the short term train commuting will not be preferred by most Australians. However, many people will use trains for travelling as the network is built up under this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I see the major initiatives for rail travel as being in the area of freight transportation. The rail system of this country will be improved so significantly that the most obvious and cheapest way to transport goods will be by rail. Australian National has consistently made profits through its freight operations, proving that money can be made in the rail sector. In the 1990-91 financial year, Australian National made a $9.7m profit in its freight operations. In fact, AN even made a sizeable profit on passenger services last year. The National Rail Corporation will build on this AN experience and provide Australian industry with the method of transport I am sure it would most prefer&mdash;efficient rail. To achieve this, freight costs must be reduced, business must be encouraged to use our railways and, therefore, our rail system must be revamped. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concept of a national rail system has been discussed for a long time. Indeed, the complex web of colonial rail authorities would obviously have been inefficient from the very start of the Commonwealth. By the 1970s, serious discussion was taking place at a senior level to encourage the development of a national rail system under Federal jurisdiction. Unfortunately, because of the parochial attitude of most Australian States at the time, the plan was unable to go ahead. The result of negotiations was a merger between South Australian, Tasmanian and Commonwealth rail bodies to establish Australian National. This was a very positive step towards achieving a more efficient system, even though the two participating States could not link their rail systems across Bass Strait. In the latter 1980s when rail infrastructure was again discussed and a Federal rail system mooted, we were able to look at the situation again to try to achieve a more efficient system for this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is widespread support for the establishment of a freight system that is competitive and based on rail. If a common authority to oversee such a system were put in place and the infrastructure were upgraded to ensure that it would be compatible with the national network, and if good industrial relations practices took place within the network, then there would be absolutely no reason why our rail system could not be competitive. The key to achieving this is an agreement between the Federal Government and the States. The National Rail Corporation Bill seeks to establish the aforementioned ideal rail freight system by establishing such an agreement. With the agreement being cemented into individual States' legislation and with each party holding shares, there is little doubt that the project will work. The National Rail Corporation is an independent venture with commercial interests at heart. This is, therefore, a very sound investment for the parties involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I truly believe that the increased use of rail transport will no doubt lead to increased safety on our roads. The number of accidents that are caused because of road infrastructure and human error is horrific. The Government cannot continually renew this infrastructure when there is a rail network in existence. The people of Australia realise the significance of rail in reducing the strain on our major highways. I sympathise with the road transport workers and operators who have worked very hard to establish their businesses and capture interstate markets, but the safety of the Australian people is best served by an enhanced rail freight system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The establishment of the NRC does not mean that it will be a monopoly freight hauler in this country, as it will clearly compete with road transport. In fact, the Industry Commission Rail Transport report, volume one, makes the following important point about competition in freight services:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commission is of the view that the NRC must not merely transform the current several inefficient monopolies into a single efficient monopoly; the NRC should not be given the sole licence to operate interstate freight. Contestability in interstate freight services must exist. The Commission is concerned that the NRC not be allowed to restrict access by other operators to the rail infrastructure or interstate freight market.</PARA>
<PARA>The Industry Commission's view has certainly been taken into account in the Bill before us. It does not seek to restrict competition but welcomes it. I believe that rail will be able to provide the more efficient service with the infrastructure and established services to cope with the demands placed upon it. The future of the road transport industry lies with filling in the gaps and networking in the rail system where it cannot compete. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Around the world within different continents and regional trading blocs there has been a trend to establish the type of uniform network that we are establishing today. In Europe it was decided that by next year all rail systems in the European Community would have access to all rail infrastructure. While there could be only one viable rail operator in Australia, this European experience does illustrate the concept of independent management of train and freight services. Rather than the owner of the tracks controlling the operations of the rolling stock and commercial activities, it is in separate hands. The NRC to a great extent will operate in this way. The infrastructure owners, of course, will be a party to the NRC agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a South Australian, I have been proud to see the advancement of Australian National over the past 15 years. With its operations based in Adelaide, it has shown the way to profits in our rail system. I am glad that the most important part of the National Rail Corporation, the national operations centre, will be based in Adelaide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Rail Corporation is an exciting and important venture for this Government and this nation. It offers a chance for real competition in this nation's internal freight system. It will lead to more competitive industries as they will have less of a freight cost burden. It will also reduce the level of road transport, not through restrictive means but through good, honest competition. Unlike the Opposition, we believe in allowing competition rather than just helping our mates out. The NRC will continue the good work of Australian National in terms of freight transportation. In association with the rail and port reforms announced by the Prime Minister, it will lead to one of the best rail systems in the world. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to look at the history of rail and note that it actually opened up this country, as it did America&mdash;although, of course, the railways were government owned in Australia rather than privately owned as in America, where real estate deals were very much involved in the way those railway systems developed. When one considers the disagreement between New South Wales and Victoria resulting in two different gauges being developed, one wonders how rail ever survived at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, survive it did and the systems were gradually built. Rail at that time was seen to be very efficient compared with, say, the bullock trains and the horse-drawn wagons that used to take produce from the rural areas to the ports; and even more efficient than motor transport in the very early days. However, we have had a situation where for a number of reasons rail was seen to be inefficient when compared with modern transport systems on the roads. Also, in rail there was not what one would term `the best work culture possible'. I do not mean work culture in terms only of trade unionists and their attitudes and thoughts about job security. I mean work culture in terms of very bad management&mdash;shocking management&mdash;in the way it planned and the way it handled and worked with its people who did the hands-on work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One must consider the whole picture of transport&mdash;an integrated transport system including rail, sea, air and road. If rail were suddenly to become a great deal more efficient, I do not believe all the people who are involved in transporting by road should fall by the wayside. I believe that there is a role for both modes of transport in their most efficient forms. But if it means that there will not be an increase in the number of large transport trucks on our roads, that in itself will lead to greater road safety. When one looks at the efficiency of using one or more locomotives to draw a number of rolling stock, one hopes that this will benefit the ecology of the country as there is less use of fuel and lower pollution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is one special area in which I have an interest and with which I should like to deal. I have seen some public reports of indications by Ministers that unless B(a)(iii) of the principles is agreed to, money will not be forthcoming. I refer to the operation of labour arrangements incorporated in an enterprise award. I think the notion there is very good, it is constructive, it is capable of succeeding and it deserves  to succeed. I have seen many jobs lost on the railways. Rail has become more efficient. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Bjelke-Petersen, who now occupies the chair, will know as a citizen of Queensland that the electrification and upgrading of the permanent way has given quite good profits to the Queensland Railways from the coal area. That can be expanded in terms of the National Rail Corporation if it is properly organised. The unions saw jobs disappear week by week. Although it did not make them happy because their members lost jobs, they recognised that that was progress and they have lived with it. In the same way they will look at this proposition in terms of the National Rail Corporation Agreement Bill and what is required of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the agreement is finally made, it should be detailed and clearly understood by all the parties. When it speaks of reflecting best practice and productivity standards through efficient work and manning practices, we are talking also about management. We do not want people who are doing the hands-on work at different levels in rail being efficient and doing their best having to cope with incompetent and stupid managements who do not know how to work with people, but who see people only as numbers in terms of the job to be done or as extensions of machines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make it clear that the responsibility there is not only with the work force at the lower levels of classification, but also with top and middle management. As efficiency develops some middle management will disappear because there will be no need for those people. A great deal of responsibility will fall on people throughout the whole of the industry as to how best to do things and how to make the industry work most efficiently in order to benefit the whole community. However, in benefiting the community, people connected with the railways have the right to expect the community to consider their work as useful, to receive proper and reasonable remuneration and to be given decent working conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the process of developing this enterprise agreement I believe that a great deal of attention needs to be paid to the fact that there will be private operators coming into the area. The agreement should contain provisions dealing with problems that may arise because of the arrival of private interests. I am not saying that the rail enterprise agreement will dictate the terms under which they should operate, but if there are problems because of some contradiction in the ways in which they approach work practices or management practices, I believe those matters should be dealt with in a proper, reasonable and measured way without any further disputation. Rail is one of the most efficient forms of transport in medium and long distances. I commend the Bill and offer my support in ensuring that it succeeds. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second matter concerned the delegation of legislative power. This is not an issue as the Bill does not delegate any legislative power to the NRC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of senators referred to the need to get the industrial arrangements right, and certainly I concur with that view. The Commonwealth and States in establishing the NRC agreed that to be successful the corporation would need the right mix of commercial management, capital investment and a greenfields industrial enterprise award. This award is currently being negotiated by the NRC and the rail unions and will incorporate best practice industrial arrangements which reflect the most efficient work and manning practices determined by the technical capacity of the equipment and commercial considerations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's commitment to getting these arrangements right was reiterated in the One Nation statement made last week by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). The Government will be seeking firm commitments from the rail unions to a greenfields enterprise award and from States to accelerate rail reform in their rail systems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question was also asked as to what are the `best practice' industrial arrangements which the NRC is required to attain. These are precisely defined in clause B of the recitals to the agreement and are as a minimum those identified by the National Rail Freight Initiative Task Force in attachment 1 to its report of 21 March 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some concern was expressed that the NRC's enterprise agreement might be of only one year's duration and that it would be incompatible with private enterprise operations in the NRC system. In developing its enterprise agreement the NRC will seek to negotiate an agreement for the longest period it can. As it is intended to be a document embodying both flexibility and best practice, it is not envisaged that there will be any difficulties in private enterprise operating the various parts of the system such as the terminals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The NRC will take on the interstate functions and associated assets of the existing rail systems. The remaining functions will remain with the existing rail systems. It will be up to each government to consider what it will do with these residual railways. I cannot speak for the Victorian Government, but the Commonwealth Government will be considering this matter in relation to Australian National in the near future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was suggested during the debate that the capital base for the NRC is inadequate. This is incorrect. Perhaps the cause of the confusion is that voting shares are set in the first five years. In this period voting shares are set at the levels agreed by the shareholders and set out in the schedule to the agreement. Cash and assets contributed are reflected by the issue of `convertible shares'. At the end of the establishment period these are converted to ordinary voting shares. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In so far as capital is concerned, in addition to the $415m that the shareholders will provide, the NRC will be able to borrow commercially to fund its capital requirements. Further, it will receive a boost from the $454m main line rail upgrading package announced by the Prime Minister on 26 February. In addition, the shareholders' agreement&mdash;clause 6(2)(a)&mdash;allows for the shareholders to make additional equity payments should these be required. As this will be done via the corporate plan process, any dispute among the shareholders would be settled by the special mechanism set up to resolve disputes over the corporate plan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some honourable senators referred to concerns that the referral of power by States for the NRC to engage in intrastate trade should be revokable. I agree with those honourable senators that it would place the Commonwealth in an awkward position if, after referring a power, States were to turn around and revoke it. However, that is the nature of the Constitution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable senators opposite referred to the mechanism for resolving disputes, particularly in relation to the transfer of assets for the NRC. The point they were making was not completely clear. The mechanism is clearly set out in part 7 of the shareholders' agreement. All of the parties have agreed to this process. I am advised that the process is to try to resolve any disputes by way of conciliation and, if this does not succeed, by arbitration. The intention is to avoid any lengthy, costly, legalistic or bureaucratic processes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There seems to be some confusion about the approval of the corporate plan. The mechanism for approval of the plan is set out in article 118. It requires 75 per cent of the votes for the plan to be approved. However, during the establishment period, if for some reason one of the shareholders seeks to frustrate the approval process, a deadlock breaking mechanism will be invoked. This mechanism provides that, if the plan is not approved within 30 days, it can be approved if all of the shareholders bar one agree, irrespective of the number of shares each shareholder has. Given the need for shareholders to earn a return on their investment in the NRC, it is unlikely that any two members would seek to frustrate a commercially driven corporate plan. I add&mdash;this point has been made in debates in here before&mdash;that if it did get to this parlous position it would indicate that the entire process has been fundamentally frustrated anyway. We all hope that that will not happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Concern was expressed that the funds allocated in the Prime Minister's One Nation statement favoured road more than rail. The fact is that the Commonwealth's policy is not to favour one mode over another but to encourage each mode to undertake the tasks to which each is best suited. The emphasis on rail is therefore on the long distance carriage of bulk freight, with assistance being provided to the NRC to carry out this task. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A comment was also made that rail should not have to pay fuel excise. This was recommended by the Industry Commission in its 1991 report on the rail industry, which also acknowledged that this would have ramifications outside the rail sphere. The Government has this recommendation under consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The comment was made that the NRC should not be responsible for the cost of funding redundancies caused by the establishment of the NRC. The Government agrees and this principle is in fact enshrined in the principles set out in the agreement, which is found in clause B of the recitals. It was agreed by the Commonwealth and the States at the July 1991 Special Premiers Conference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Powell raised the possibility that the NRC may be privatised. The fact of the matter is that no private sector operator would be interested in being involved with a loss maker, as interstate rail freight is at present. If at some time in the future private enterprise is interested in investing in the NRC, rail will have been turned into a commercial success and this Parliament could take some credit for that achievement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Powell also raised the issue of the Melbourne road link from the ports to the Dynon terminal. I advise the honourable senator that this will be an internal road connecting the ports area, crossing Footscray Road to the rail freight terminal. It will reduce, rather than increase, traffic congestion in Melbourne. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Concerns were expressed that the 49 per cent cap on any individual shareholding was not conducive to a commercial approach. Such a condition was necessary to achieve agreement to set up the NRC and was agreed to as part of a mechanism that ultimately allowed a single shareholder to acquire more than 50 per cent of the voting stock with the concurrence of the other partners. Such arrangements are a common feature of companies with a small number of shareholders and are entirely consistent with the intention that the NRC will operate as a fully commercial body. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The claim was made that the Commonwealth should fund upgrading of the track sufficient to allow fast freight operations, to allow a nine-hour transit time terminal to terminal between Sydney and Melbourne. Such transit times would, it is claimed, allow rail to compete in the time sensitive express overnight freight market which is currently captured by road. The concept of the FFT would require further investment of more than $1 billion to put it in place. Before an investment of such magnitude could be contemplated, a full and comprehensive financial evaluation would be needed, including real market opportunities available to rail with transit times of nine hours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After all, road can offer a customer to customer turnaround time of as low as 12 hours in this corridor. The NRC will be undertaking a full study of its network needs and of the potential markets in which rail could effectively compete. It should not be forgotten that as part of the One Nation statement this Government has taken a significant first step in improving rail's performance and attractiveness to customers. The Government will be providing $454m over the next two years to complement the NRC's $1.7 billion investment program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By 1995 there will be a complete standard gauge main line network between Brisbane and Perth. Further, rail will be able to achieve a reliable 12-hour transit time between terminals in Sydney and Melbourne and a 16-hour transit time between terminals in Sydney and Brisbane. The most important benefit of all of this rail investment is that, together with an NRC-greenfields work and management practices approach, it will lead to a significant improvement in reliability and quality of service offered by rail. This is an essential first step in improving rail's performance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have addressed those matters of detail that were raised during the debate. I also tried to follow as best I could, via our technological marvels in the building, the last contributions made to the debate this afternoon. I heard the contribution made to the debate by Senator Tambling, the National Party senator for the Northern Territory, in respect of the Alice Springs to Darwin rail link and the support which the Department of Defence has consistently given to this project and&mdash;I might add&mdash;which Defence Ministers in this Government have given to this project over the years. Senator Tambling criticised the lack of commitment in the One Nation statement of the Federal Government in supporting the construction or providing for the construction&mdash;which I think Territorians would be more interested in&mdash;of the Darwin to Alice Springs rail link. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such an approach needs to be given some degree of clarification. One of the difficulties at the moment is that we do not actually have a proposal that could be sensibly supported by anybody. I know that it would not be supported by the coalition. The interesting thing about Senator Tambling's contribution to the debate this afternoon is that it is the sort of contribution we should expect to come from someone who is arguing from a position of some strength instead of from someone who, as Senator Tambling is, is arguing from a position of total weakness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To indicate just how weak his case is, I have in front of me a copy of a draft policy for the Northern Territory written by Senator Tambling, which no doubt he proposes to release at some time in the future. In ploughing through this document, I was interested to try to find some ironclad commitment by the Federal coalition to construct the Darwin to Alice Springs railway. I think that was a reasonable assumption on my part, considering that he devoted the majority of his speech this afternoon to attacking us for not providing such a firm commitment, as he put it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was not surprised that I did not find it. His leader was in the Northern Territory only a few weeks ago. The Northern Territory journalists chased Dr Hewson on this issue&mdash;up trees, down rabbit burrows, around corners&mdash;and tried to extract from him a commitment that a coalition government would construct the Darwin to Alice Springs rail line. Of course, they failed. How could they do anything other than fail, considering that the coalition has promised to tax us all 15 per cent on the things we buy, through a consumption tax&mdash;15 per cent on electricity accounts, 15 per cent on telephone bills, 15 per cent on motel beds, restaurant meals and everything else? It would only be able to maintain what is, by world standards, a horrendously high level of consumption tax by extracting multi billions of dollars out of public spending to pay for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is hardly a proposition that any coalition member could put with a straight face. To say, as Opposition senators do, that they will slash multi billions of dollars in restricted public expenditure&mdash;and that is the only way to maintain that horrendously high level of 15 per cent&mdash;when, at the same time, they know perfectly well that the only way to achieve that is by screwing down public expenditure to zero. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a nonsense. They may well argue for the rationale of such an approach in New South Wales or South Australia or, indeed, the southern end of Western Australia. I notice that a Labor colleague of mine, Bob Carr, at a recent Press Club luncheon here in Canberra, was advocating a per capita disbursement of Federal funding&mdash;in other words, to put the Federation clock back 100 years and take us back to being six fundamentally self-governing States, and to hell with any national vision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason why I make that point is that the adoption of this kind of policy is not something that is confined to one side of the chamber. But of course, there is one part of Australia which I unabashedly and unashamedly say would be devastated by such an approach&mdash;an approach, of course, advocated by the Opposition&mdash;and that is the Northern Territory. </PARA>

We need to have some clarified position that the Northern Territory Government&mdash;of course, having checked this out through its Treasury officials&mdash;is prepared to put its name to and endorse as being a proposal worthy of support before anyone, whether Labor, Liberal or National Party, could come even close to giving any kind of a commitment of support.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth, the taxpayer&mdash;I think that term should be used more often than not when we talk about the Commonwealth spending money; it is the taxpayers of Australia&mdash;is contributing equity of $296m out of a total of $415m over five years. It is expected that total assets in the order of $1.1 billion will be transferred from the Commonwealth and State railways into the National Rail Corporation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government, again as a reflection of its gross incompetence and its arrogance in respect to this Parliament&mdash;it could have brought in this legislation earlier&mdash;went ahead and formed the National Rail Corporation and then appointed its own auditor from outside. The Government expects this Parliament, as I am sure Senator Powell would agree, to be a rubber stamp. It is the sort of thing we have come to expect from people such as Senator Bolkus, who does it all the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This raises a fundamental issue of accountability. Although the Corporation will be entirely publicly funded, it was intended that it would operate under the provisions of the corporations law as a strictly commercial corporation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General, as well as the auditors from all the States involved, said that the Auditor-General should be the sole external auditor of Commonwealth owned or controlled equities.

It is our view, and this is reflected in the amendment before the Committee, that while the Commonwealth has such a large amount of money involved, while it has a majority holding, this role should be under the control of the Auditor-General, maintaining accountability to the Parliament and thus to the people of this country. That is the principle behind the amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not want to get caught in the cross-fire between Senator Parer and Senator Collins. Perhaps being this far away I will miss most of the flak. Last week during the second reading debate I said that I would move an amendment to ensure full reporting to the Parliament. As Senator Parer said, while the Commonwealth remains a shareholder in the National Rail Corporation it should be fully accountable to the Commonwealth Parliament. I said then that my amendment would allow the Corporation to choose its own auditor, and that is the case; on its own, it would.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, despite the bewilderment the Democrats feel about the Opposition's approach to these independent corporations being set up by the Government, since we tend to see the Opposition as a supporter of private enterprise and would normally, therefore, expect it to go down the track of independent auditing, we nevertheless would not want to look a gift horse in the mouth. So, as before, we will support the amendment which puts the Auditor-General in place as the watchdog of the public interest while ever the Commonwealth is a shareholder in the National Rail Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might say, in supporting this amendment, that the Democrats hope the Commonwealth will always be a shareholder in the National Rail Corporation. In other words, we do not support the concept of<EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS> a privatised corporation, even though this legislation makes that possible. I take the point made by the Minister for Shipping and Aviation (Senator Collins) in his second reading summary that there are certain impediments to that in place at the moment. I am sure we all look forward to the day when we will all have a much more efficient rail system which might be attractive to private enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that our rail system, firstly, will become more efficient&mdash;I am sure it will&mdash;and, secondly, will stay a public enterprise.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I indicate that, as well as opposing this amendment, the Government will be calling a division on it. We have an obligation to do so because the arrangements this amendment will change represent not simply the position of the Commonwealth; they also represent the position of all of the agreeing States. We need to make it abundantly clear in this chamber that it is not the Commonwealth that is breaching this agreement. The Committee, through the combined numbers of the Opposition and the Australian Democrats, is forcing us into this position outside the agreement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government does not accept the proposal to appoint the Commonwealth Auditor-General as the auditor of the NRC. Appropriate accountability arrangements under the corporations law are already in place. The NRC will produce a report and a corporate plan annually for consideration by the shareholders. Additionally, it will produce a publicly available statement of corporate intent setting out its objectives, the nature and scope of its activities, its accounting policies, information on its performance and any other matters the shareholders consider necessary. These arrangements provide for full and open scrutiny and provide an appropriate and adequate degree of accountability for the taxpayers' funds used by the NRC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The company's annual report and audited financial statements will be tabled in the Parliament, as are those of Qantas Airways Ltd, without there being any legislative requirement to do so. The company is jointly owned by its shareholders&mdash;the Commonwealth, New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia. No one shareholder controls the company. The shareholders have agreed that the company operate as a fully commercial organisation subject to all the normal disciplines and requirements to which a public company is subjected. The NRC is a public company and has no special privileges, additional liabilities or government subsidies and is jointly owned by all of its shareholders. As such, it should be able to choose its own auditor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill, in its current form, is supported by the other shareholders. The New South Wales Government, in particular, through Mr Baird, has made its views known in writing. I intend to quote from the letter where Mr Baird puts the arguments succinctly. They are arguments with which I agree. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the NRC is neither owned nor controlled by the Commonwealth, the Commonwealth's standing policy does not require that the Commonwealth Auditor-General be its auditor. The National Rail Corporation acted properly in appointing as interim auditor a large, successful and highly reputable private sector firm. The appointment was in accordance with company law and will be considered by shareholders at the NRC's first annual general meeting. As a package, the above arrangements impose rigorous standards of accountability on the NRC to ensure that the Australian taxpayers' interests in this new enterprise are properly protected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I guess I might also put a personal perspective on this. Apart from the gross inaccuracies of Senator Parer's statement about my work record, I come from a part of Australia where the Auditor-General's function is contracted out to private industry. That was an arrangement which I supported publicly at the time when the Government made it and I have supported it ever since. I might add that the sky has not fallen in in the Northern Territory in the many years in which that system has been operating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to conclude by quoting from the relevant sections of Mr Baird's letter which address this issue. In his letter to Senator Button, dated 9 December 1991, Mr Baird says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In my view the Auditor-General has missed the point in his attack and has ignored the basic intent of the Governments to remove interstate freight from the inefficiencies which have characterised Government rail systems involvement in this important national activity. The NSW Government has strongly supported the initiative taken in the Special Premier's Conference framework to place interstate rail freight at the forefront of future micro economic reform. It is certainly the intent of NSW that once the NRC reaches commercial viability that there will be no need for future Government involvement either by equity participation or oversight of its commercial operations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the same time I recognise fully that in its formative stages the shareholding Governments will be involved actively through their respective rail networks in supporting the operations of the NRC. In this regard both the Commonwealth and State Auditors General will be providing reports to their respective Parliaments on the relevant involvement of their rail systems.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has been reported to me that a view is also held that private auditors have not fully met their responsibilities in certain cases in the past and it is therefore prudent for the Auditor General to undertake the auditing role. In my view there is no evidence that the Auditor General is any more or less competent than his private sector counterparts. In fact I am sure that the accounting profession in Australia would take exception to any such claims.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In summary, the NSW Government is committed to the concept of the NRC being a fully commercial company with no special privileges or additional liabilities resulting from its establishment. In these circumstances I support the current Bill before the Senate in its present form.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Bruce Baird</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I have quoted as fully as I have from Mr Baird's letter simply to emphasise the point that the current arrangements in this legislation are an agreement between the participating States and the Commonwealth, which the Commonwealth is obliged to uphold.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we are debating in the Senate the Financial Legislation Amendment Bill 1991, which is a mechanical Bill. It deals with financial matters and thus it is relevant to the so-called One Nation statement that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) delivered last week. Naturally, one could not miss an opportunity to make comment on that because the debate regarding the One Nation statement is likely never to resurface in this chamber again, as is the case with the Budget debate and all other debates associated with it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is particularly ironic to have before us some highly specific changes to the Currency Act and the Financial Corporations Act when this Labor Government has put forward a program of sheer and utter economic disaster. I do not make this statement lightly and, of course, others have agreed with that statement that it is disastrous. It is not, however, a case of one nation as the Prime Minister would try to have us believe; it has merely been put together, pasted together, as a response to the coalition's Fightback package. Probably the person who summed it up most succinctly and accurately was a commentator who has not been known in the past for any great leanings towards us in the coalition, and that is Max Walsh, who simply described the One Nation statement as `reckless'. It is a cynical political document designed to buy votes at the Wills by-election and, of course, at the next general election without thought to the long term damage done to the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find it rather staggering that the Prime Minister can actually come into the Parliament and put down the One Nation statement and believe that all is well, that all of the years of damage and havoc that he has wreaked upon this country can suddenly disappear with one statement. The people of Australia are not fools; they cannot be treated as such. The One Nation statement is the program of a Prime Minister who claimed to control all the levers of the economy and, if he has done that, he and we and the people of Australia all know the direction in which he has pushed the economy. Of course, he is the Prime Minister who gave us the recession that we had to have, who knows the writing is on the wall for his Government, and therefore has decided to put a distinct vote grabbing exercise together in one document. </PARA>

The people of Australia know exactly what mess the Prime Minister has got us into. He is the one who has claimed to be the best Treasurer in the world; he is the one who has claimed that he has given us the recession we had to have; he is the one who has constantly claimed that he is in control; and he is the one who keeps on pushing the point that Australia can suddenly turn around and manufacture all the jobs that, as a result of his engineering, we have lost. </PARA>

How disrespectful can a Prime Minister be to go cuddling up to the Queen at an official reception and then a matter of days later to start poking the eyes out of the British. It is absolutely and utterly disgraceful for a person who is meant to represent all Australians. I found it somewhat disturbing to listen to some of the reports from overseas which categorised us all in the same way in which the Prime Minister, quite rightly, had been categorised&mdash;`uncouth, uneducated, ill-mannered'.

We are savings poor today, and yet suddenly the whole theory on which he based his statements but a few short years ago has been turned on its head. It seems all right now to have all the items of infrastructure while we are still savings poor. </PARA>

But does Prime Minister Keating care? No, not in the slightest, because all of this is going to be done on the chit&mdash;on the never-never plan.

But does that worry the Government? No, because once again we are just going to buy our way out of trouble. Where does the money come from?

Yet here is the Government saying that all is well. Here is the Prime Minister saying that nothing is going to be affected. I ask again: where is the money coming from? We make these predictions by using exactly the same economic model&mdash;the Murphy model&mdash;that the Prime Minister tried to use to discredit Fightback. Where is his consistency?

Yet we have Martin Ferguson from the ACTU saying that he wants real wage increases. Is that not great! He wants real wage increases. He has not a care in the world about how many more people that puts out of work. And the Prime Minister will not knock it on the head; he will not say, `No, there can be no wage increases'. He simply says, `We will think about it. We have not made a decision'. Yet, while the de facto members of Cabinet&mdash;Martin Ferguson and Bill Kelty&mdash;go running around this country saying, `We want more wage increases for the workers', they just do not have any understanding of the economics of staying in business and being able to afford the staff and all the infrastructure that goes with it. </PARA>

Not one, not two, but nine. He said that the only major exceptions to the goods and services tax are some education costs and financial services. That is an absolute lie. If he wanted to have a look at it and if he wanted to report to his constituents accurately, he would say that it is not only some education, it is all education, it is all financial services, it is health, it is charities and it is a whole range of things that are exempt from GST or zero rating. But, no, he tries to scare people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Beazley tells people that pensioners will get an extra 8 per cent to cover additional food and medical costs. That is not true. Pensioners will get an extra 8 per cent for an expected rise of 4.4 per cent, but he is implying that there will be additional medical costs. What he does not say is not only that medical costs will be zero rated&mdash;a la no GST&mdash;but also that there will be no extra medical cost because pensioners will still be entitled to bulkbilling. But, no. Will the Government tell the truth? No way, because it does not suit its cause. </PARA>

The Government still does not say that the Fightback package will abolish all of those sales taxes, replace them with a 15 per cent tax and then, additionally, abolish the seven other taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Beazley went on to say that the expansion of private hospital insurance will do nothing to reduce pressure on the hospital system. How absurd that is in itself. If we are going to get greater utilisation of private hospitals by getting more people into private hospitals, surely that is going to provide greater utilisation when the private hospitals are, in many cases, currently under-utilised. There are very few private hospitals around Australia that have 100 per cent occupancy. Many are at 40 to 50 per cent occupancy; many are on the verge of closing and will never open again. Yet Mr Beazley tells the great Labor lie that the system will do nothing to reduce pressure on the hospital system. Of course it will. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Beazley also claims that the 15 per cent goods and services tax will be on top of the price paid for the actual goods or services. He does not indicate that we are abolishing his hidden consumption tax: the 15 per cent, the 20 per cent, the 30 per cent wholesale sales tax. He does not say a word about that. He does not say a word about the 19c a litre fuel excise to the private motorist and the 26c a litre fuel excise to the business motorist. He does not say anything about that or the other taxes that are going to be abolished. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He also claims that lower income earners will receive smaller tax cuts. How on earth can he say that when people who are earning an income of $20,000 a year will get a 28 per cent reduction and someone on $90,000 a year will get a 15 per cent reduction? What he also fails to say is that there will be a 100 per cent reduction to 350,000 taxpayers who are affected by the raising of the tax threshold from $5,400 to $7,000.

The petroleum excise alone will continue to levy $3.6 billion on business, adding to the costs of exports to the consumer. Will the Government abolish the petroleum excise? No, it will not. It will still collect $3.6 billion on that factor alone. It is so easy to point out the differences between a program of reform where honest and visible indirect tax will replace those shonky hidden imposts and, of course, a grab bag of promises.

At the moment, that is exactly what happens. Under the hidden consumption taxes of this Labor Government, sales tax is charged at virtually every stage. If a manufacturer wants to buy some equipment, he pays sales tax. If he wants to buy a truck, he pays sales tax. If he wants to put tyres on the truck, he pays sales tax. If he buys spare parts, he pays sales tax. On the list goes. If he wants to buy a light globe for his factory, he pays sales tax. He pays sales tax all the way along the line. He cannot reclaim one cent of it.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the Fightback package all that sales tax will go and any goods and services tax that is paid on those business inputs will be totally refunded.

Therefore, all the trucks that carry all the produce, all the beef, all the sheep, all the cattle and pigs, all the Weeties and all the milk to the supermarkets will still pay 20 per cent sales tax. Under us, they will pay no tax, no sales tax and no goods and services tax because it will be fully refunded.

Is he trying to tell this whole nation that he and the Cabinet were the only ones who did not realise that Mr Hawke was going to quit? It is absolutely absurd. Mr Keating says, `Oh, no, we did not do this about Wills'. Oh, no. He can keep a straight face if he tries.

I do not believe that Australians are in the mood for jokes at the moment. It is a cruel joke Mr Keating is playing on the Australian people.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first thing the Bill proposes is to delegate the power of administering the statistical provisions of the Financial Corporations Act from the Treasurer to officials of the Reserve Back, although the Treasurer will retain a reserve power in this area. We do not oppose this measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second matter is the proposed amendments to the Currency Act 1965. This Act was previously amended in 1987 to facilitate the production of the same coin denomination in different metallic compositions. It is interesting what we get to talk about in the Senate&mdash;for example, the metallic compositions of coins. Again, this is not controversial, although those 1987 amendments are ambiguous in certain areas, and this Bill seeks to clarify those ambiguities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The more substantive matter relating to the production of coins is the proposal to alter the administrative procedures which are currently undertaken to approve new coins or to determine variations to designs or other characteristics of existing denominations. At the moment, all such procedures have to be done by way of regulation. It is claimed that the infrequency of Executive Council meetings and the amount of administrative work needed is causing problems with the marketing schedules of the coins. This Bill therefore proposes to transfer these powers to the Treasurer, although all decisions will be by way of a disallowable instrument which will be reviewed by this Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The need for this administrative change is the rapid growth in numismatic or collectors coins. In this area, the Mint recently won a contract to supply $9m worth of gold and silver coins to the International Olympic Committee's centennial coin program. We should congratulate it on that achievement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is always interesting to find unexpected little complexities hidden away in seemingly innocuous legislation. Senator Watson smiles; I admit that he is something of a master at it. I would ask Senator McMullan, if he were here, to clarify for the public record advice that has been given to a member of my staff from the Treasury that this legislative change means that any decision to remove the head of the sovereign from an Australian coin does not need to be agreed to by the Governor-General, who represents the Queen in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the current focus of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on Australia's republican future, one could ask whether this was a colourful extension of the debate. Given also the reciprocal fervour of the Opposition, I would have to say that I am a little surprised that members of the Opposition did not spot this possibility in a close examination of the Bill. It is left to the usual Democrat attention to detail to unearth this gem of a possibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to consider that, if we had followed our forward plan of last week, this Bill would have been debated at the time the Queen was visiting Australia.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Royal Australian Mint is one of the oldest institutions of the Commonwealth Government. It is not a separate entity but a business unit within Treasury. I pay tribute to some of the achievements of the Mint, as the opportunity rarely arises in this chamber for a debate in this area. The Acting Controller, Chris Mills, in the 1990-91 annual report to Parliament, described the Mint as `a light metals manufacturer with wholesale and retail outlets'. That is rather a quaint description, I think. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In April 1991 the Mint became the first and only mint in the world to gain accreditation to international quality standard ISO9002. This is an international standard which emphasises quality in production and excellence in quality control systems in the production process. I think we should congratulate the work force of the Royal Australian Mint on this unique achievement. It is another example of how public sector enterprises can be efficient and competitive if they are properly managed. Indeed, the Mint is about the only government enterprise that is not earmarked for privatisation in the Opposition's Fightback package. We hope it is safe. Certainly it should be, given that economic rationalism appears to be on the nose at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as the high level of quality control, the Mint now has one of the world's most advanced coin production methods. The Mint joined with the CSIRO to develop the optical surface profiler. This device can measure all the dimensions of a coin mould in about 15 minutes instead of the many hours using traditional equipment. This leads to higher quality products at a more competitive price and should lead to an increase in export orders in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A major issue of the moment, apart from the other one I mentioned, is the demise of the copper coin. The then Treasurer announced in the 1990 Budget that no new 1c or 2c coins would be minted or issued by the Mint from that time. From 1 February this year the Reserve Bank ceased issuing copper coins and the banks are now returning them to be melted down. The coins remain legal tender and the cent remains the smallest unit of account. Prices remain unchanged, although totals are now being rounded up or down to the nearest 5c.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is appropriate to take a few moments to reminisce on the prominent place copper coins have had in the financial history of Australia. Governor Hunter received the first copper coins in New South Wales in 1800, replacing the previous currency of rum, and they have been in constant use since that time. Since decimalisation, a staggering 5.5 billion copper coins have been produced, weighing 20,500 tonnes and with a face value of $79m. After the issued coins have been repurchased, it is estimated that the cessation of the production of the coins will yield about $6m a year in recurrent savings to the Mint. In addition, there has been a one-off saving of $20m resulting from the disposal of surplus coin stocks of other denominations which arose because of the moneybox effect of large numbers of 5c and 10c pieces which have been returned to circulation along with the smaller coins. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purchasing power of 5c and 10c coins is now much less than that of the 1c and 2c coins when they were first introduced in 1966, so I suppose we can agree that it is reasonable to phase them out. One undesirable outcome of the withdrawal of the small coins is the possible effect this will have on all the charity collection boxes that are placed in various outlets around the country. I think there are enough pressures on the resources of these organisations because of the recession without the further problem of falling donations in this way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final point I make on the subject of coins is the question of the under-representation of women on our coins. Apart from the Queen, there has been only one woman, Princess Diana, on Australian decimal coins, and she appeared along with Prince Charles. This is to be remedied in part this year by the release of a special $1 coin featuring a female javelin thrower, followed by a series of coins entitled `The Royal Ladies' commemorating 40 years of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II. It is good to see the imbalance beginning to be redressed, but I think it would be more appropriate if the considerable achievements of Australian women were also to be recognised on our currency. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In Alert Digest No. 17, the Committee noted that clause 4 of the Bill proposes to repeal section 13 of the Currency Act 1965 and replace it with sections 13 and 13A. Proposed new subsection 13(1) provides:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The standard composition of the coins of the denominations specified in the Schedule is, subject to subsection (2), as specified in the Schedule and the standard weight of those coins is as prescribed.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee noted that this means that, currently, the composition of the coins is set out in the Act but can be varied by regulation, as can the standard weight.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee noted that under the proposed new section 13, the composition of the coins would be, in effect, as set out in the Schedule or as the Treasurer otherwise determines. The Committee indicated that, as such, this was a `Henry VIII' clause, as it would allow the requirements regarding composition set out in the primary legislation to be amended by subordinate legislation. The Committee also noted that such amendments could be made by Ministerial determination rather than by regulation, as is the case under the existing provision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In making this comment, the Committee acknowledged that such Ministerial determinations would, pursuant to proposed new subclause 13(6), be disallowable instruments for the purposes of section 46A of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901. However, the Committee also noted that, in general, such instruments are not as well drafted as regulations, nor as readily accessible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Similarly, the Committee noted that proposed new section 13A provides:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Standard weight, design and dimension of coins</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">13A.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The Treasurer may specify in a determination more than one standard weight, design or set of dimensions, in relation to a coin of a particular denomination.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee suggested that, if enacted, this provision would allow matters such as the standard weight, the allowable variations from the standard weight, the design and the dimensions of the various coins specified in the Schedule to be amended by Ministerial determination. Under the existing section 13, standard weight could only be varied by regulation. The Committee suggested that, in either event, this is a `Henry VIII' clause, as it would facilitate the amendment of the primary legislation by subordinate legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee noted that it has maintained an in principle objection to the use of `Henry VIII' clauses. The Committee also noted that, in the present case, the `Henry VIII' process was being made even less acceptable by changing the method of amendment from regulations to Ministerial determinations. The Committee noted that, on the whole, regulations are well-drafted and, by virtue of their being published in the Statutory Rules series, relatively easy to find. The Committee suggested that the drafting of Ministerial determinations is often not up to this same standard and there is no such obligation to publish them, which can make them difficult to find.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee indicated that it would appreciate the Treasurer's views as to why it is necessary to change the method of amendment from regulations to Ministerial determinations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee drew attention to these provisions, as they may be considered an inappropriate delegation of legislative power, in breach of principle 1(a)(iv) of the Committee's terms of reference.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer has responded as follows:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It may assist the Committee if I briefly outline the reasons for the earlier amendments to the Act, as well as those currently under consideration. Under the original provisions of the Act, each time a new coin denomination was introduced or the standard composition (metallic composition) of an existing coin was varied the Act had to be amended, although other coin characteristics eg design, weight and size could be varied by regulation.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1981, in the context of amending the Act to provide for the issue of a new coin denomination, the opportunity was taken to amend the Act to enable all such matters to be determined in future by regulation. This was seen as providing for greater flexibility in the type of coin that could be issued without the need for additional legislation. The previous process was considered impractical from the viewpoint of enabling the Royal Australian Mint to develop its numismatic coin program, as approvals for new coins or variations to the composition of existing coins were required on a regular basis.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reason for now changing the approval arrangements from regulations to disallowable instruments reflects the changed situation with regard to coinage. There has been a substantial increase in recent years in approvals sought for new coins and variations to coin characteristics with the expansion of the RAM's numismatic program and the production of precious metal coins by the Gold Corporation, a statutory authority of the Western Australian Government.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The practicalities of successfully issuing collector coins into what is an extremely competitive market demands, inter alia, elaborate marketing programmes, maintenance of tight production schedules and adherence to advertised release dates. In light of this and the increased administrative burden generated by the expansion of the number of collector coins being issued, it was recognised that there was a need to simplify the administrative process. Considerable administrative effort is required to make regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Parliamentary Secretary goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee's other concern relates to the view that instruments are not, in general, as well drafted nor as accessible as regulations. While I appreciate the Committee's concern in this regard, I would point out that the Attorney-General's Department will be closely involved in the drafting of the instruments. Moreover, as the basic format of the present regulations and the proposed instruments are expected to be very similar, I see no reason why the quality of the instruments should suffer in comparison.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">As far as accessibility of instruments is concerned, while instruments under the Currency Act will not form part of the Statutory Rules series, the proposed amendments to the Act have been drafted so that all other avenues for scrutiny and accessibility currently applying to regulations made under the Act will also apply to instruments under the Act. The Treasurer's determinations will be tabled in both Houses of Parliament and be subject to disallowance, and will be published in the Gazette, as occurs at present.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Furthermore, I would emphasise that it is important to the issuing bodies, the Royal Australian Mint and the Gold Corporation, that such documentation is both well drafted and accessible as they are required to demonstrate to overseas authorities, as well as their wholesalers and dealers, that their coins have legal tender status. It is of particular importance in the case of overseas authorities, as without that status being established, they would be unable to obtain the necessary sales taxation exemption to enable them to compete with other numismatic products internationally. I would emphasise that exports are an important component of sales of collector coins.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The final area covered by this Bill is the repeal of the Special Employment-Related Programs Act, which implemented the job creation schemes that were funded by the public sector wages pause decided upon by the Fraser Administration during the recession in the early 1980s. It is in this area of job creation that the One Nation economic statement has been so inadequate and even callous.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Back in 1982 the Labor Party opposed the wage pause and the contingent job creation scheme. However, they did introduce an administratively superior job creation scheme, in my opinion, the community employment scheme, to address the problem of massive increases in unemployment which arise during recessions. The social costs of unemployment, especially long term unemployment, are huge and are largely avoidable if compassionate and responsible policies are implemented by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the moment we are witnessing a ratchet effect of an increase in the level of long term unemployed after each recession over the past 20 years. This tendency, coupled with increasing substitution of capital for labour and the export of jobs through the elimination of tariffs, will lead to the creation of a permanent underclass which will have disastrous social consequences. We know this. We do very little about it. There is a myth that any kinds of community-based employment schemes are not real jobs. I question that. Why are they not considered real jobs?  We have this cultural malaise in Australia of short-termism. Every member of Parliament has an employment span which is determined by the next election. Does that mean the short term of our tenure means that we do not have real jobs? Of course not. When there are no employment possibilities in the private sector, why is it wrong to create public sector jobs to carry out worthwhile local projects that improve the quality of life of local residents until private sector employment opportunities improve again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Local Government Association went to see Treasurer Dawkins to put to the Government a proposal to spend $1 billion to fund almost 600 urgent local projects, which would have created up to 100,000 jobs immediately&mdash;real jobs, meaningful jobs at the local community level. The Evatt Foundation proposed that about 200,000 jobs could be created by the Commonwealth spending about $2 billion via local government. We could have a real Better Cities program. But the One Nation package continued the Government's compassionless course and did not contain one initiative for a community-based employment scheme. This is a fact which I think will follow this Government to the next election, copper coins or not, republican agenda or not. </PARA>

I ask the Senate: how on earth can any reputable man stand in this Parliament, make a statement in which he calls upon the Australian people to work together to become one nation and then, the very next day, divide the country as it has not been divided for many years? According to David Jenkins in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In his seemingly off-hand remarks about the monarchy and his tilt at Britain's alleged betrayal of Australia in 1942, Paul Keating . . . has exhumed some of the class and religious antagonisms that divided Australia more than 50 years ago&mdash;and shown a sometimes shaky grasp of history.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Keating is from an Irish-Catholic, working-class background. . . . one can hear in Mr Keating's words an echo of the Protestant-Catholic divisions that persisted well into the 1950s, at which time, mercifully, successive overlays of migration began to make those differences seem less significant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an us-and-them aspect to the Prime Minister's recent remarks that belies his rhetoric about building "one nation". At the same time, there's something contrived about his newly minted nationalism.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Jenkins said a little later:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Suddenly he is out kicking heads wherever he can find them, at least for show. First the Americans, then the Japanese, now the British. The Indonesians must be getting twitchy.</PARA>
<PARA>I ask, which country comes next? Mr Jenkins says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not accurate to say that Britain failed to defend Malaya and Singapore. . . . . . . Nor is it accurate to say the British would not let us have our troops back when we needed them. As the historian Dr David Horner has shown, the 6th and 7th AIF Divisions were sent from the Middle East to the Far East at Churchill's suggestion. It was when Churchill wanted to divert them to Burma that Prime Minister John Curtin insisted they come home.</PARA>
<PARA>We all know, at least those of us who can remember, what strains Britain was under at that time defending the free world on her own. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tony Wright of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> on Saturday also made this comment, which I thought was most appropriate:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">How strange. In the same week as the Australian Government grovelled to hypersensitive Malaysia by dissociating itself from the film <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Turtle Beach</EMPHASIS>, the Prime Minister, Paul Keating, has attacked a member of the opposition as heirs to the old fogeys who grovelled to Britain. . .</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The old grovel to Britain is nothing but a historical memory to the majority of Australians.</PARA>
<PARA>We all remember very clearly Senator Evans standing there and grovelling, as he did in this Parliament a short time ago to Malaysia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that Mr Keating's statement proved beyond any shadow of doubt that he was running scared of Dr Hewson's reply to his statement. He believed that if he did not say something controversial to take the headlines, the damage that Dr Hewson would wrought on his statement would be quite exceptional. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me now refer to the financial statement that Mr Keating gave last Tuesday&mdash;that unfunded statement of $2.4 billion. It was, as I have said, completely unfunded. It was done on a surmise that something would happen, that there would be growth during the coming years, and that that would set everything right. No hard decisions were made, and there were no government cuts&mdash;not a dollar of government spending was cut. We all ask, as Senator Knowles did a short time ago, `Where on earth is the money coming from?'. The Government has asked that on many occasions, but on this occasion Mr Keating blatantly said, `No, I haven't costed it, I haven't funded it, I don't know, but I presume it will come'. All this was said at a time when one million people are unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be without any doubt a greater gap than there is already between the haves and the have-nots. What worries me particularly is that at the moment we have a million unemployed. Those with jobs are doing all right, even though the cuts in their living standards are quite considerable. But the very large number of unemployed&mdash;and they are becoming longer term unemployed&mdash;are a considerable concern. There is no mention in the fantastic financial statement of Coronation Hill, of the development of extra runways at Sydney Airport, or of anything else. There is no mention at all of those matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to deal with one particular area and to compare it with what we as an Opposition have already proposed in our Fightback package. I ask again what the Government has done for, to quote Senator Button, the terrible misery and distress. We all know that the Prime Minister has taken full credit for that. He has said that he engineered the recession; he organised it and believed that it was necessary; it was the recession that we had to have. He made all those statements, admitting eventually that it was organised by himself. But the Labor Party here was so insensitive that it then decided to elect that Treasurer, a man who was lacking in all credibility, to become Prime Minister. With over one million unemployed, well over a million under-employed, the Labor Party decided to elect as its Prime Minister this man who caused it all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has been done for those unemployed people? The Department of Social Security in Hobart rang my office at lunchtime on Tuesday and said that it would like to brief my staff. My staff was asked whether they could keep 10 a.m. on Friday free because the Department thought that would be a good time to brief them on the Prime Minister's statement. On Wednesday morning the Department rang back to say, `We will cancel that because there is nothing in the statement that we can brief you on'. That perhaps points out more clearly than anything I could say how the poor are being treated in this financial statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What have the poor in the community got? On 2 April there will be a one-off payment to all on family allowance. Of course, not only the poor get family allowance, but those on over $40,000 a year receive the allowance. There will be a one-off payment of $125 per child&mdash;a one-off excuse, a one-off `I am sorry' from Mr Keating&mdash;for causing this recession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Howe was asked, `What is the price of a pair of good quality running shoes?'. He said, `I am not up on those costs at the moment'. When the interviewer said, `Let me tell you, Mr Howe, it is $125, so that will be gone on one pair of running shoes', Mr Howe was not even concerned. The families of the poor will get $125 as a one-off `I am sorry' from Mr Keating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 2 April people will also get $3 per child for family allowance supplement. The people who get family allowance supplement, at least some of it, can earn up to $40,000 and can have assets of $359,250. So it is not the really poor who are getting some family allowance supplement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has decided that it will also give tax cuts, but the tax cuts do not come to the poor&mdash;not to the really poor. Senator Richardson was asked today in Question Time, `Why are there no tax cuts for people who are getting $350 a week and under?'. He said in his answer, `There is no need, we've already done that. We corrected their situation last year and the year before and ever since we've been in. So there is no need to give them any more&mdash;they're all right, they're in the boat, they're fixed'. Only those who are wealthier will get the tax cuts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are one million people unemployed. The former Prime Minister, as we know, said, `No child will be living in poverty by 1990'. In case the Labor members do not go out and have a look in the community, let me tell them that there are many children still living in poverty. This economic statement does nothing for them at all. I will give the Senate some examples. Someone on $350 a week, presently paying $49.20 in tax, will not get a tax cut under this Government. Someone on $400 a week, presently paying $60 in tax, will get a 10c tax cut in 1994. That is appalling, that is criminal, particularly when someone on $900 gets a $21.50 tax cut but someone on $350 does not get a cent. Most people could not believe it and, therefore, it took a couple of days before the welfare organisations started to show their concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I compare what the Government is doing for the community and what the Opposition, as a government, would do with its Fightback package. I will go into a little more detail with regard to tax. As I have already said, the Government is not giving any tax cuts to the poor. I refer again to the $350 a week family which does not get any tax cuts. Under us they would get $14.30 a week, which is a 29 per cent tax cut. On a lower income&mdash;say, $140 a week&mdash;they would get a 87.5 per cent tax cut. They presently pay $7.20; we would give just about all of it back&mdash;$6.30, an 87.5 per cent tax cut. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government starts at $400 with a 10c tax cut; that is, a 0.17 per cent tax cut for someone on $400. As the income scale goes up, the tax cut percentage increases. With $500 one would get a 4.27 per cent tax cut; with $700 one would get a 7.29 per cent tax cut; with $800 one would get a 8.40 per cent tax cut. It continues to go up, but under us at $140 it is 87.5 per cent. We go down as income increases; our percentage decreases as one earns more income. The Government's percentage increases as one has more income. It is something that I find extraordinarily difficult to understand and it is certainly against any philosophy on this side of the chamber. The poor should be helped, and the poor are those least able to pay tax, and therefore should be asked to pay tax less than those on higher incomes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I compare the packages for someone on, say, $20,000. Under the Government's system there will be no tax cut for the family on $20,000; under us the tax cut will be considerable. They will save $814. They will be paying 16.2 per cent tax instead of 20 per cent tax under this Government. Petrol excise will be abolished; the GST will be put on. Under the Government there will be no saving for this family&mdash;not a cent. They will still be paying 69c to 70c a litre for petrol. But under us there will be an 18c to 19c a litre decrease. They will not be paying as much for their petrol. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to the dependent spouses rebate. Under the Government there will be no increase in the dependent spouses rebate; under us there will be a $300 increase. I refer to the family allowance supplement. Under the Government there will be a $3 increase, but under us there will be a $3.29 increase for those with children under 13. For families with children over 13, the Government will still only give them a $3 increase, but under us it will be $4.79. There is no alteration to family allowance under the Government's package. Family allowance will be exactly the same. Of course, let us not forget that they get their one-off payment of $125. But under us the family allowance will be doubled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to superannuation. There is no alteration at all for superannuants under the Government; under us there are considerable incentives. I do not have time tonight to go into all of the incentives, but there will be incentives for people on an income of $20,000 to take out superannuation. Should people take a lump sum there will be no tax on that lump sum. Under-35s buying a first home will be able to use 75 per cent of any accumulated superannuation that they may have; under the Government they are not entitled to do that. Under us they will be given $2,000 to compensate them for building that home and 50 per cent of that building will be free of GST. Again there is nothing from the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to savings. Under us people will be entitled to earn up to $2,000 interest without any tax. That is not so under the Government. If someone saves a few bob they will be taxed to the hilt on it. There will be nothing for them under that. As I have already said, we will be abolishing not only the petrol tax but seven taxes in all: payroll tax, petrol tax, wholesale sales tax, lump sum superannuation tax, the coal levy, the training guarantee levy and customs duty. There will be a 4.4 per cent increase in living standards. </PARA>

This may be a surprisingly low figure but very few of our customers have realised the impact on food prices of the current wholesale sales tax, which will be abandoned by the Opposition when in government'. </PARA>

Because the excise and the 15 per cent will go on that truck taking the farmer's cream to the manufacturer, the cost of transport will be so much less that the price of butter will come down&mdash;not just from the reduction of payroll tax but from the transport taxes and wholesale sales taxes that presently apply to the trucks, to the spare parts, to the oil, to the petrol. The costs will naturally go down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Government members are very dishonest when they say that a 15 per cent GST will apply to bread and butter and all other supermarket items, because they know that that is incorrect&mdash;unless they are not thinking at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his statement, the Prime Minister pinched a  number  of  items  from our Fightback package. We do not mind him pinching them&mdash;they are good policies, and he has taken quite a few of them. We congratulate him on accepting them. The national power grid is a typical example. That was in our Fightback package. The Australia-New Zealand air market was in our package. The capital gains tax relief for business, again, was in our package. The one-stop development approvals, Dr Hewson has promised. Emergency relief for voluntary organisations&mdash;a good idea&mdash;was in our package. Training programs for the long term unemployed, again, was pinched from our package, as were assistance to non-Government schools, the foreign banks entry, accelerated depreciation for business, and more funding for TAFE. As I say, we happily let the Government take those. We would like it to acknowledge them and, as it takes them, at least say that it is accepting the correctness of the Opposition's approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the entire Fightback package cannot be taken unless the goods and services tax is also taken. Every single area of our Fightback package is funded. Every single area says where the money is coming from. The fact that the Prime Minister has not indicated one area of funding but relies on the supposed increase in growth is irresponsible in the extreme and, indeed, will only result in higher interest rates. As the Government has realised already, long term interest rates have already gone up by half a per cent. There will be higher interest rates, higher inflation and, as a result, the inevitable higher taxes. Mr Keating will not be able to deliver those tax cuts, any more than the previous Prime Minister was able to deliver his promise that by 1990 no child would be living in poverty. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank you for your consideration, Mr Deputy President. The Financial Legislation Amendment Bill, as I have just said, is an omnibus Bill which makes several amendments, most of them non-contentious, relating to the approval procedures for issuing new coins. It does other things as well, as I have just said, but so far as the procedures relating to the issue of new coins are concerned, at present the approval of new coins, including variations to the design and the metallic composition and weight, necessitates regulations made by the Executive Council.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Currency Act 1965 provides for the Governor-General to make regulations for the issue of coinage. Constitutionally, acts of the Governor-General are required to be made on the advice of Executive Council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill proposes amendments to streamline the procedures by authorising the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) to grant the necessary approvals for the production of new coins. One of the points that I think Senator Kernot mentioned, which we might take up in committee when Senator McMullan might be able to provide us with some answers, is set out in the explanatory memorandum which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendments to the Currency Act provide the Treasurer with the authority to approve new coins, or determine variations to design and/or other characteristics of existing denominations, by signed disallowable instrument, without reference to Executive Council. It is expected that these procedures will lead to considerable administrative savings.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Parliamentary scrutiny of new coins determined by disallowable instrument will, however, be retained as required under section 46A of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901. The latter provides for the same scrutiny as now exists for regulations made by Executive Council.</PARA>
<PARA>I would be interested to hear from the Government some quantification of the expected administrative savings in all that, because it marks a considerable change to the discretion given to the Government in a change to the coinage and could have not inconsiderable significance in that respect. But as I say, I foreshadow raising that in committee, depending on Senator McMullan's summary at the end of the second reading debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two other amendments in the Bill which are unrelated to the issue of coinage. The first is to the Financial Corporations Act 1974, which permits the Treasurer to delegate to the Reserve Bank the responsibility for varying and publishing the list of non-bank financial institutions which fall under the Act. This affects the procedure but not the substance of the Act. The other amendment repeals the Special Employment-related Programs Act 1982. That Act was introduced to appropriate money saved by the previous government, the Fraser Government, as a result of the 1982 wage pause arrangements and to use it for employment generating purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All the activities under that Act are obviously now complete and, indeed, have been since 30 June 1984 and all moneys paid out have been duly accounted for. As the Act serves no purpose, as the Government says, it makes sense to remove it from the statute books. These are commonsense measures and, naturally, the coalition does not oppose them. The first two amendments amount to a streamlining of administrative procedures, subject to the point I raised in relation to the currency, and the third removes an Act which is no longer required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the question of the roles and functions of the Reserve Bank, it is appropriate to point out to the Senate that, since the appointment of the new Prime Minister (Mr Keating), it is increasingly likely that Australia is returning to an era of political manipulation of the Reserve Bank. The Senate should not forget, nor should the people of Australia, that it was the Prime Minister who, when he was Treasurer, boasted that, `I have the Treasury in my pocket and the Reserve Bank is in my pocket'. It was the same Treasurer who also boasted, `The Treasurer, that is me, has responsibility for setting interest rates as is customary'. So there we have it. We now have a Prime Minister who, when Treasurer, openly declared his manipulation of monetary policy. Does anyone believe that he would not do so again for political reasons?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We saw further evidence of the Prime Minister interfering with the operations of the Reserve Bank for political reasons at a recent conference on monetary policy in Melbourne, where most contributors referred to the problems for the economy which were caused by monetary policy being influenced by short term political considerations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The work by academics, retired senior public servants and others has pointed consistently to the pattern of monetary policy being eased just before each of the past three Federal elections, only to be tightened afterwards in an attempt to correct the damage done. So, no matter how hard the Governor of the Reserve Bank might protest, I do not think the easing and tightening of monetary policy being influenced, at least, by the political cycle, on the empirical evidence available, can be denied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The experience of this Government's track record on monetary policy and the Reserve Bank's role in monetary policy and its relationship with the Government do not engender any optimism for the future. It certainly cannot be said that the Reserve Bank has placed the high priority on price stability that, under a Hewson led government, we would certainly give as a fundamental priority for the Reserve Bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looking at recent history from 1985 to 1987, Australia's inflation rate soared to three times the OECD average. That was no imported inflation. It was old-fashioned pump priming to artificially boost growth to make the Government look good in advance of the elections that were occurring at that time. I remind the Senate that these were the days when the accord was at its height; the same accord which was supposed to avoid inflationary pressures. Of course, we now all know that that failed very dramatically. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the question arises: what was the Reserve Bank doing? Why did it not use its powers to challenge Government policy? The answer can be found, in part, in the difficult relationship that the Reserve Bank has with government. That is occasioned by a variety of reasons, one of which is the Reserve Bank Act which stipulates the relationship between the Bank and the government. As I said earlier, the coalition in government will change the legislation to ensure that there is a much clearer separation between the Bank and the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other reasons as well. Looking at the composition of the board of the Reserve Bank, one sees some members for whom the objective of price stability would rate a long way behind protecting their positions of power and influence in other areas. I think my colleague Senator Kemp, who is following me in this debate, may say some things relevant to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us be quite clear about it: some members of the board of the Reserve Bank are there by the grace and favour of the past and present Prime Ministers. That is, always has been and always will be the Labor way&mdash;a special deal for your mates. Therefore, it is hardly surprising that questions are raised&mdash; increasingly nowadays, and have been for some time&mdash;about the setting of monetary policy and whether it has, indeed, been set in a way that is simply to take account of the needs of the economy, or whether there have been political motivations involved in some of the actions in relation to monetary policy as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a very important issue when we look at the situation facing Australia now. One of the top priorities that it is said both sides of politics share is a wish to place price stability and the maintenance of price stability as a top priority. It is certainly a top priority of the coalition&mdash;the next government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although it is said to be a priority of this Government, one must seriously question that that could be the case when one looks at the economic statement that was produced by the Prime Minister last week. Of all the criticisms one can make of that economic statement, and I believe that those criticisms are very considerable indeed, the No. 1 problem with last week's statement&mdash;apart from the fact that it has no direction for Australia, and no sense of vision at all for the future of this country&mdash;the single greatest policy weakness in it, was that in itself it has set the seeds for an inevitable upsurge in interest rates and inflation in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If a political party in government was serious in saying that it had price stability high on its list of priorities, it could not conceivably have introduced the economic statement that this Government did last week. To have a situation where it is generally accepted that we need to increase the level of savings in this country&mdash;in that context, the public sector has a major role to play&mdash;and to find in the economic statement last week that the Government is deliberately budgeting for a Budget deficit, therefore drawing on the pool of the nation's savings, over the next four years of $20 billion is fiscal irresponsibility and recklessness almost beyond the memory of most people in Australia today. We have to go back to the Whitlam years, which were a major blip on the historic economic policy calendar&mdash;</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As we debated a similar situation last week, I have to draw Senator McMullan's attention again to the fact that those percentage figures he is parading around to show that the deficit will be a very small proportion of GDP are based on a growth rate of the economy and therefore of the revenue collections that no-one believes. Senator McMullan cannot get up and say it, I know, but even he could not possibly accept the growth projections and therefore the revenue projections on which his scenarios for the next four years are based.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On Senator McMullan's own figures, the situation is that over the next three years the Government will have to go to the market to raise almost $20 billion, presumably in Commonwealth bonds. That $20 billion is on top of the existing outstanding debt denominated in Commonwealth bonds of $34 billion. In other words, over the next three years this Government will increase its demands on the capital markets of this country by no less than 57 per cent above the existing levels. There is no-one who would be prepared to say that the consequences of that will be other than major pressure on the market, major pressure on interest rates, and major pressure on the economic recovery that, hopefully, the private sector would have been able to expect to see coming out of this recession over the period ahead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the Government has done with its economic statement last week is to abort the private sector recovery that one would expect out of the economic cycle and the worst recession we have had for 60 years&mdash;a recession, I again remind the Government, caused entirely by the policy mismanagement of this Government. The Government is going to strangle the private sector, prevent it from getting on with the job of creating improved living standards, creating jobs, and doing something for the one and a half million Australians that the policies of this Government have rendered unemployed or underemployed and the millions of Australians who have suffered a loss in real living standards as a result of those policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government had the unbelievable arrogance to come into this Parliament last week and say that it was going to introduce tax cuts to benefit low and middle income earners. Forty two per cent of all income taxpayers in Australia earn less than $20,500. Not one of those taxpayers will get 1c tax reduction as a result of the announcements in the economic statement last week. No Australians will get a cracker until 1994. That will be the first instalment; the second one comes in 1996. On neither of those two dates is there any reduction at all in the income tax rates applying to the low income section of this community&mdash;a section which, I say again, is more than 40 per cent of the total taxpaying population in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, there was no provision in last week's announcement by the Government for paying back to taxpayers the insidious bracket creep, the tax creep, that has ripped $22 billion-plus out of taxpayers over the last five or six years simply because of the increased tax take as a result of inflation. In itself, therefore, it is an automatic reduction in real living standards. There is no lifting of the minimum tax threshold; it now stands at $5,400. There is no provision for that to be changed in the Government's economic statement. The coalition's Fightback proposals, on the other hand, lift that threshold from $5,400 to $7,000, which means that several hundred thousand more Australians will not pay any tax under us. Indeed, the other lower income taxpayers who earn between $7,000 and $20,700 will also experience significant reductions in their income tax payments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a so-called Labor Government to say seriously to the people of Australia, `We are concerned about your future, we want to try to help you find work, to have an economy that grows more, to increase your living standards, to find jobs, but we will not give you 1c in tax reductions' is unbelievable. The traditional base of the Labor Party must find words failing them to describe the attitude of a Labor government towards those people in our community who are in most need of the relief that tax reductions will give them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other fraud about last week's economic statement is that it will do anything meaningful to get the private sector going again. What has the statement done? It has done something by way of increased accelerated depreciation arrangements. These are good; we do not object to those. Indeed, the decision to have accelerated depreciation is contained in the coalition's Fightback proposals. But it is only a small part of what needs to be done to provide the incentive and the opportunity for business in this country to get taxes off its back so that it can lower costs and be more productive and competitive in an internationally competitive world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why did the Government not follow the coalition's proposals and abolish payroll tax?  Payroll tax is a tax on jobs, a tax on employment. That is why the coalition will abolish payroll tax. It will take $5 1/2 billion off the back of businesses and put it into business's scope to create jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why, if the Government is really serious about getting down the cost of business, does it not do anything about the exorbitant amount that it is raising, and has raised progressively over almost the past decade, from fuel excise? When this Government first came into office the excise on fuel was 6c a litre; now it is about 25c or 26c a litre. The coalition is going to abolish fuel excise because it has become a milch cow which has nothing to do with energy conservation and nothing to do with providing better roads for Australia. All it is is a way of raising revenue by ripping off motorists and the community, and adding enormously to the costs of business, in order to finance the spending binges that have been the hallmark of this Government in its period in office. It is because this Government is unable to control itself when it comes to expenditure that it has had to fleece the business taxpayer and the private taxpayer blind to attempt to meet those bills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real problem, the major one, is that despite everything that this Government said in 1985&mdash;despite everything that the now Prime Minister said when he was the most articulate exponent of a goods and services tax in 1985&mdash;it is now not prepared to introduce a goods and services tax.

Unless it does this, it is saying to the Australian people, `We are not prepared to take the decisions to bring the Australian taxation system into line with the modern world. We are not prepared to give our exporters a break. We are going to keep slugging our producers and our exporters with these hidden taxes, particularly the wholesale sales tax which cascades right through the whole cost system in Australia'. A goods and services tax would not be paid at all on business inputs or on exports. It would give an enormous incentive to the business sector to lower costs and therefore to be more competitive, to create more jobs, and to be able to compete overseas and against imports in the domestic market.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unless the Government is prepared to do that, then it really cannot claim to be getting towards first base in being fair dinkum about tackling the underlying fundamental problems that are the cause of our lack of productivity, our lack of competitiveness and, therefore, our lack of ability to compete in an internationally competitive world, and our lack of ability to create jobs for our existing work force, for our young people and for our not so young people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know how many members of the Government have visited parts of Melbourne such as the electorate of Wills and surrounding areas&mdash;the Labor heartland&mdash;in which my office and Senator Kemp's office are located. They should come and see the misery and the hardship that their policies have caused there. Come and see the 40 per cent plus of young people who cannot get a job. Come and see the 20 per cent of adult males who cannot get a job. Those opposite should come and tell them why they are not prepared to take the decisions that will enable business to be more competitive, to be able to create jobs, to get this country going again. Those opposite should tell them why they are not going to give them individual incentive, opportunity and hope for the future. Come down and tell them that.

But it is fundamentally important that these things be aired and debated because the future of this country is at stake over the next 12 months. The economic debate that is taking place in this country today and that will take place until the next election will determine the future of this country for the rest of this decade. We will have to poise as we wait to see what sort of a country Australia is going to be, what sort of a people we will be, and what sort of job creating nation or otherwise we will have as we go into the twenty-first century. So the debate is essential. I think it is very important that senators on both sides of this chamber take every opportunity we can to debate these fundamental issues.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the remarks made by my colleague Senator Short on the Financial Legislation Amendment Bill 1991 and to add to some of the points that he made. Senator Short referred to the behaviour of the Reserve Bank over the last five or six years and raised the question of whether it has acted in a manner which has aided or hindered the economy. To back up what Senator Short said, I would have to say that one of the important aspects of the Fightback statement that Dr Hewson brought down is the commitment to low or almost zero inflation. We are all concerned about inflation; in the last six months, Mr Keating has discovered that he also is concerned about inflation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a great pity that, despite the efforts of my colleagues to get a pledge from Mr Keating on his commitment to maintain low inflation, that pledge has not been forthcoming. In fact, it is very interesting to run the Keating `One Job' package through the famous Murphy model, which Mr Keating has drawn our attention to on a number of occasions in the other place. That model shows that under the `One Job' package that Mr Keating brought down, inflation will rise to over 6 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Short was quite right to draw our attention to the problem of the composition of the Reserve Bank board and the question of whether the Reserve Bank board is structured in a way that it can manage the clear goals that we think it must have. I was interested to receive today from Senator Button a long awaited answer to a question on notice regarding the appointment of Mr Kelty to the Reserve Bank board. I asked what was Mr Kelty's remuneration and travel allowance. I also asked for various other sorts of information. Senator McMullan will be very interested in the information that was forthcoming from Senator Button today. I notice that the remuneration available to Mr Kelty has risen from $16,857 in 1987 to over $22,000 from 15 November 1990. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pulled out some figures to see what wage rise Mr Kelty had received as a member of the Reserve Bank board. And remember that the ACTU is very concerned at the moment about the wage rises that are being proposed for consideration by the Industrial Relations Commission. I discovered that over that period the remuneration available to Mr Kelty had apparently risen by some 32 per cent. He is now receiving $22,282 for being a member of the Reserve Bank board. That figure is interesting because, as Senator Faulkner knows, some 70 per cent of the people in the electorate of Wills who have an income at that level or below will not receive any tax cuts under the `One Job' package that Mr Keating has brought down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I was saying, the increase that Mr Kelty was able to receive as a member of the Reserve Bank Board was some 32 per cent over that period. I guess we ask ourselves: what was the average increase in wage rates over that period? In other words, what did the average worker receive over that period? The answer is that it was not over 30 per cent; it was 23 per cent. It is interesting that the leaders of the trade union movement seem to have done pretty well out of this Government. I do not know whether Mr Kelty keeps the money that is paid to him by the Reserve Bank Board. Does this add to his salary as an officer of the ACTU, or is it paid into the ACTU coffers? The answer to that question would be particularly interesting because, if it was paid into the ACTU coffers, we would be worried about whether the ACTU was receiving yet another subsidy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wider issues involved here are interesting because, as Senator Short pointed out in his address to the chamber, there is a question concerning the credibility of this Government. The Government has made a lot of forecasts in the last week&mdash;the 800,000 jobs and the return of the Federal Budget, after a number of years, to a surplus position. Again, we have had a lot of promises. The interesting question is whether, after eight or nine years, those promises of the Labor Government can be believed. I will show that, over the last eight years, the Labor Government has created a pattern of blatant misrepresentation of the truth to the public at large. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In reference to my comment about Bill Kelty, I have in my hand Mr Keating's maiden speech. Now that he is the Prime Minister of this great country of ours, I think we all wonder whether Mr Keating is a man of deeply held principles, as some members of the Labor Party think&mdash;a view that, in fairness to the Labor Party and Senator Faulkner, not all members of the Labor Party have fully endorsed. We wonder whether he is a man of deeply held convictions and principles and commitment to the truth, or whether he is a chameleon who alters his colours, alters his views, as he reads the political circumstances of the day. I urge all members of this Parliament to read his maiden speech. Maybe in the years to come Senator Faulkner will regret what he said in his maiden speech. Mr Keating's speech is interesting in the light of Bill Kelty's position. Mr Keating said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The other basic social ill facing Australia&mdash;it is a by-product of the situation to which I have been referring&mdash;is the problem of workers having two jobs.

The 35 hour week is an even bigger joke.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Keating drew our attention to the situation of people having two jobs. Certainly Mr Kelty has two jobs. He was appointed to that Reserve Bank job by Mr Keating.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an issue here of whether the Government should be paying this large amount of money to officers of the ACTU.

On the other hand, if that happened, a number of people on this side of the chamber, including Senator Short, who has followed this issue very carefully, would be interested to know whether this is another way of giving a subsidy to the ACTU. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue I want to address is the credibility of the Government and its promises, and particularly the credibility of the Prime Minister.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would not buy anything from Mr Keating, and the Australian public will not buy the Keating One Nation, banana republic package that he has brought down. Let us go back to the credibility of the Prime Minister. Is this a man who can now be trusted to tell the truth? Senator McMullan, Senator Faulkner when he was here, and a few others took their lead in the last election campaign from Mr Keating. A central issue of that election campaign, Madam Acting Deputy President, as you will well remember, was whether there would be a recession. Mr Keating went on radio day after day claiming that there would be no recession. We have all those quotes carefully on hand to be used to remind the public that his last major promise to them was certainly broken.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can go also to many other commitments that Mr Keating has given to the public and to the Labor Party. I mention Australian Airlines. I wonder whether honourable senators remember that great day in September 1985 when this issue came up and Mr Keating said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we see no case for the so-called privatisation of the great public enterprises of this country.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what Mr Keating said in 1985. But what did the Australian Labor Party do just five years later? This is what was said in resolution at the ALP's special national conference:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the case of Australian Airlines, the Australian Government may sell up to 100% equity.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Keating, who in 1985 said in relation to Australian Airlines that selling off the great public enterprises of this country was a disaster, has now sold off and is in the process of selling off many of those companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, it does not end there. We have had debate on the issue, for example, of a consumption tax. It is an important issue at present for public debate. At the same time as Mr Keating was telling the public that there would be no chance of public enterprises being sold off, the very same man was out advocating that what Australia really needed was a consumption tax. I invite members of the public who want to receive the information on what Mr Keating said about the consumption tax to contact any Liberal Party member of parliament or senator as we would be very happy to supply them with the quotes of Mr Keating about his strong support for a consumption tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Mr Keating was proposing his famous option C, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposals for broadening the income-tax base and for introducing a broad-based consumption tax cannot be isolated from the substantial reductions in personal taxation they make possible.</PARA>
<PARA>I wonder whether, in the comments that Mr Keating is making today about a consumption tax, he remembers those quotes. Honourable senators may remember a White Paper that Mr Keating and Mr Hawke released to the public at about that time on the need for a consumption tax. As I have said in this Parliament before, five reasons were given by that famous duo&mdash;I should probably say infamous duo&mdash;as to why Australia needed a consumption tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Keating, the very same man who now wants us to believe him and his forecasts, was telling us in 1985 that a consumption tax would produce a fairer tax system with fewer tax avoiders and evaders; that it would lower income tax so that reward for extra effort was greater; and that an effective cut in total taxes for most wage and salary earners and a larger increase in pensions and benefits was needed to compensate for the consumption tax. Further, Mr Keating and Mr Hawke said that a more efficient tax system which does not discriminate so heavily against different products and different types of investment would help. If one reads the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of the other place today, one will see that it was said that Mr Keating said a consumption tax would help promote economic growth. So we see a man who has constantly misled the public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to a matter of concern in my own State of Victoria. Mr Keating went down there, as all Victorians would remember. I quote from a press release of Mr Keating of 19 September 1988 at the time of the election in Victoria. Madam Acting Deputy President, I guess that you and I were both down in Victoria at that time. In his press release, Mr Keating said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not only in Victoria's interest that the [Cain] Government be returned on 1 October. It is also in the national interest.</PARA>
<PARA>Just think about that. Mr Keating went down there and urged the election of the Cain Government. Honourable senators may well ask why he should not; he is a Labor member of parliament. But almost two years later, as the tragedy of the Cain-Kirner governments was becoming blatantly obvious even to members of the back bench of the Labor Party, Mr Keating said this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If it were not for the unquestioning loyalty which the Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>he blamed the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>, not himself&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">gave to the John Cain personality, and consistently, there might have been a greater expose by that newspaper of the decisions and policy of the Victorian Government.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Keating, who urged Victorians to vote for the Cain Government because of its record on economic management in 1988, ended up in 1990 bucketing the Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> for following the same sort of line that he was following at that time. In the last week he has ended up finding that he, as the Prime Minister of the country, has had to bail out the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are all concerned, as you certainly are, Madam Acting Deputy President&mdash;and I hope that the Labor Party is also concerned&mdash;about foreign debt. This has been an issue ever since Mr Keating's famous `banana republic' statement quite a number of years ago. It was interesting to read in 1987 where Mr Keating said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There has recently emerged an encouraging downward trend in our current account deficit. This will diminish our external debt and GDP ratio before 1990.</PARA>
<PARA>Let us just reflect on that. In 1987, Mr Keating predicted that foreign debt would start to decline by 1990. Madam Acting Deputy President, you and I know that foreign debt has not declined but has risen quite dramatically. Two years later, after the March 1990 election, Mr Keating said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is my expectation that we will stabilise the debt at the end of this current term.</PARA>
<PARA>That will not happen either. So we have this Prime Minister's persistent role of ceaselessly making assurances to the Australian people about what will happen under his Government, what will happen to taxation, what will happen to inflation and what will happen to jobs. We have these assurances, but time and again this man has been proved to have misled the public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at another example. Mr Keating said in August 1990 that employment would pick up. That statement was made in his Budget Speech of that year. Just five months later, Senator Richardson told us all&mdash;and we all knew it from the figures&mdash;that there was no doubt that unemployment would continue to rise. So I ask you, Madam Acting Deputy President, whether after eight years of this persistent misleading of the Australian people we should now put aside our experiences of this man and believe what he says in his One Nation statement. The answer to that must surely be an absolutely resounding no. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable senators can probably remember that at Question Time today we asked Senator Button about the 800,000 jobs that Mr Keating has again promised, whether we should treat those promises with more importance and whether there was any likelihood that his promises about privatisation, consumption taxes, recession, taxes, inflation, foreign debt and so on would be kept. We asked Senator Button today in this chamber where those 800,000 jobs would be created. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Button, as he is wont on these occasions when he is asked a question which requires a proper response rather than a general level of abuse, effectively said to us that he was not quite sure where they would be created but that they would generally occur throughout the economy. When pressed on the issue, he said that he believed that tourism was one area in which he thought numbers employed would continue to rise. He was then asked what the people in the north-west region of Melbourne where the electorate of Wills is situated could be told about the jobs which would be created. As honourable senators would know, Moonee Ponds, Coburg and Northcote are located in that region. The plain fact is that Senator Button was in effect urging us to take his promises and the promises of his Prime Minister on trust that somehow employment would be created for those people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Massive problems have already emerged from the economic statement that Mr Keating brought down in the Parliament last week. He has now launched on a very substantial program to spend up big. You and I who are from Victoria, Madam Acting Deputy President, have had experiences since the early 1980s of governments that spend up big. There is no question that if spending up big was able to create sustainable jobs we in Victoria would be the most prosperous people in this country, because no-one has spent up bigger than John Cain and Joan Kirner. As you and I know, that did not create sustainable jobs; it created a little fillip in employment and most of those jobs occurred in the public sector and areas related to the public sector. We now find ourselves in this once great State of Victoria in a state of penury and near bankruptcy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am reminded, as the Senate may recall, that there was a battle for some six months over whether Mr Hawke should go. In the end, the Labor Party decided to opt for Mr Keating. I was sent a little poem by a constituent, a gentleman by the name of Mr Greg Shalless, who I think has been described as Australia's ultralight poet laureate. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no explaining this mob,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For years they were captained by Bob,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But when the recession</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Became a depression</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They gave its designer his job.</PARA>
<PARA>Through that little poem Mr Greg Shalless reflects the concern of most Australians that the man who caused the recession, the man who delivered one million people to the dole queues, was not punished for that; he was rewarded. Mr Hawke, the man who to his undying misfortune appointed this man Treasurer and let him run the engine room, got dumped in the end and the Labor Party appointed the man who had run the ship on to the rocks&mdash;an astonishing feature of that party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I will draw one last statistic to the attention of Senator McMullan at the table. We now have one major constraint in expanding the economy which we did not have in 1982, which is the last time Mr Keating and Mr Dawkins spent up big&mdash;and boy did they spend up big in those years before they ran us into the currency crisis of the mid-1980s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a very interesting table published in this week's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS>. That table looks at the current account deficits as a proportion of GDP. It lists 13 major countries in the industrial world and notes their balance of payments positions. It is very interesting to look down this table. I ask honourable senators which country they think is in the worst balance of payments position of the 13&mdash;this is after one of the most severe recessions this country has had this century, and certainly the most severe recession for 60 years.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What country has the worst balance of payments record out of the 13 industrial countries? There are no prizes for this. The worst country is Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS> shows that the balance of payments deficit was 3.7 per cent of gross domestic product in 1981 rising this year to 3.8 per cent, and this is the worst of these 13 industrial countries. Yet it is on this basis that we hear Senator McMullan and all those who cheered on Mr Keating when he created the worst recession for 60 years. When one turns on the television one sees Mr Keating again telling us that he will pump up the economy and spend up big. There are no hard decisions there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They called Mr Hawke `Jellyback', but did Mr Keating, facing the crisis that we have, take the tough decisions? He took the decision which all politicians regard as fairly easy, which is to spend money. So, with our balance of payments crisis the worst in the industrialised world, he has decided to pump up the economy again. Within a short time we will be facing another huge balance of payments crisis brought on by this Government and a Prime Minister who has had no regard for the truth on central economic issues for eight years. Last week he asked us and the Australian people to believe him this time, but they will not believe him. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

In so doing, I wish briefly to make comment on the Martin inquiry into banking and deregulation, the conclusions and recommendations of which were published in a booklet entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Pocketful of Change</EMPHASIS>, which was distributed to members of the Parliament. I want to draw the attention of the Senate and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, Senator McMullan, hopefully, to a response to the conclusions and recommendations document issued by the Foreign Currency Borrowers Association in a booklet which, again, I think was distributed to all members and senators.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This matter has been raised in the Senate over a period. It has become more and more precise as time has gone on. It has brought to the attention of the Australian public the number of very honest and hard-working Australians who have lost everything as a result of the banking system and the foreign loans scandal, as some people call it, that occurred in this nation in the mid-1980s. What is so tragic about this is that the people who have really been hurt are those people who are the backbone of Australia. Many of them were farmers, small businessmen, people who had started with nothing and by a lot of hard work, a lot of enterprise, had built up quite considerable estates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the mid-1980s, at a time when this Government had allowed interest rates to blow out to what we then thought were exorbitant rates of about 15 per cent&mdash;and, of course, we know now that 15 per cent was pretty cheap compared with the rates eventually reached&mdash;these people, because they were struggling with interest rates of 15 per cent, succumbed to the lure of offers of foreign currency at 6 per cent. At the time this happened I was in practice as a lawyer in a small country town. I knew nothing about foreign exchange and foreign loans; I never pretended to and always knew where my abilities ceased. But it seemed to me, on looking at it, that it was just too good to be true. It just could not be that a person had to pay 15 per cent interest in Australia and then, suddenly, someone came along and offered that money at 6 per cent interest. There had to be a catch. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People consulted me about it and I sent them away to get better advice. I simply pointed out to them that it just did not seem that the world was like that&mdash;that the real rate in Australia was 15 per cent but that somehow they were going to get their loan at 6 per cent. A lot of people and small businessmen, who are much more clever than I at running a business, went to the people they trusted most&mdash;the banks they had dealt with for 50 years. For generations their families had dealt with banks, and banks in Australia at that time had an enviable reputation right around the world as being solid, conservative, honest and trustworthy and of doing everything in the best interests of their customers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These people went to their banks and in some instances were given good advice, but in other instances they were caught up with what the Foreign Currency Borrowers Association alleges was a push by some banks to maximise their profits. In the Martin inquiry it was suggested that, with deregulation of banking and with foreign banks coming in, there was a necessity for the Australian banks to compete. There was a belief that the banks coming into Australia with deregulation would offer these foreign currency loans and that, if the local banks did not compete, they would lose these long and valued customers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was the reason put forward by the banks for getting into this. The Borrowers Association has suggested that they got into it because there were huge profits to be made, considerable tax advantages to be gained and, in some instances, individual people within the banking system trying to make something out of it for themselves&mdash;not necessarily in money but in promotion and kudos within the banking system. It is against that background that I wish briefly to raise this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This booklet, which I think is very well done, put out by the Foreign Currency Borrowers Association, gives a definition of what foreign currency loans are all about. It quotes the State Bank of New South Wales as describing a foreign currency loan in this way:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a loan denominated in a currency other than in Australian dollars.</PARA>
<PARA>It then quotes what I think is a better description from the Commonwealth Bank, which indicates that a foreign loan is `a set of obligations'. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The particular obligation that is relevant is the obligation to repay the amount borrowed in the currency borrowed and to make all interest payments in the currency borrowed. The fact that both the principal and interest payments must be made in the currency borrowed attracts the exchange risk. The exchange risk is that every time a payment has to be made it has to be sourced from Australian dollar funds and the rate of exchange may not be the same at the times of payment as it was when the funds were originally borrowed. This can work in favour of the borrower or against the borrower.</PARA>
<PARA>That was what these loans were all about. I do not wish to come to a conclusion. I want to ask the Parliamentary Secretary to do something at the conclusion of my short speech. However, I do wish to raise a couple of matters that have been raised by the Borrowers Association arising out of the Martin inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many court cases were taken by the banks against their customers. Some were settled, some were won by the customers, and some were lost. There were allegations of very unequal contests in court. From constituents who came to me and showed me documents&mdash;and, as a lawyer, they mean a little to me&mdash;I know personally of situations where the contest was unequal. I myself have had experiences in my practice where, if one has a large corporate client who is determined to go the whole hog, that client can force someone out of the business because he has not got the money to carry on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Generally, the legal profession is a very honest one and one of very high standards. Most lawyers follow those very high standards and do their very best. But with some regret I must say that there are occasions when, on instructions from clients, and particularly in big commercial matters, big firms acting for big commercial clients will take every little point, every interlocutory action, to run the opponent out of the battle. That is cause for some distress, and I know it is a matter that is being addressed in the costs of justice inquiry. There were these unequal contests. There is this allegation of failure to discover documents. In fact, one prominent case has been sent back for rehearing on the basis that the bank would not discover documents which should have been the subject of discovery in the course of the trial. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of constituents who have come to see me are still battling it out with the banks. There are, of course, these last minute settlements that are offered by the banks when the funds of the borrowers are just about finished. In many cases that have already been settled, the borrowers have simply taken what they can get as the last straw because they are not in a position to keep going. They take a few bob just to save the house they live in, in many instances giving away the businesses for which they have worked all their lives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some friends of mine, who had very profitable hotel businesses in my own home town, fell victim to these foreign loans and just gave up. I have suggested to them that if they ever had the energy they might be able to take on the broker and the bank that gave them the money. But they have just given up. They have walked away from it. They have accepted bankruptcy after a lifetime of building up this business. I think that is very sad. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are allegations from the Association that banks, at times with reckless indifference, gave money to clients who should not have been given it and did not fully advise their clients. I do not want to make any judgments at this time because this is a very complex matter, but these allegations are around. There are allegations that the banks knew the Australian dollar was falling in 1984, that they predicted it in a few years but still went ahead lending money to their long and valued clients without even raising the possibility with them that the Australian dollar might fall. </PARA>

It has mediated, got rid of all its problems, and is only carrying on with those that are obviously quite fishy. There are a couple of other Australian banks which have not been quite as honest in their dealings, but of late it appears that they are coming more and more to the mediation process, particularly as recent disclosures come out. Every few months, and to a certain extent at the behest of the Foreign Currency Borrowers Association, more and more information is coming out. More and more evidence is being obtained as to what happened in those days in the mid-1980s with these foreign loan currency matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to see that the banks generally are looking a bit more closely at mediation and trying to resolve some of these issues. I can only urge that the banks generally do that, and not only with the people they are fighting in the courts at the moment, but also with some of those who have already settled, either voluntarily or semi-voluntarily, and even with those who have been to court and who have had judgments against them or judgments that were not quite what they had hoped for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are allegations in these documents and in many court cases too&mdash;I do not give credence to them, but simply raise them&mdash;that banks were getting secret commissions; that is, that they were being paid more than once for the same job. There are allegations of banks point taking&mdash;taking additional interest, additional rewards over and above what they were entitled to. There is some evidence in this material that the banks were simply just picking a figure. If they had lost money on other foreign currency transactions on that day, they simply loaded it on to these people without any rhyme or reason, without any particular scale to follow. It was simply that if they had lost so much on other dealings that day, they had to retrieve it or jobs might have been on the line, so that they just plonked it on these small people&mdash;the little people, the farmers, small businessmen, the one or two million dollar asset people who have borne the brunt of this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are allegations, I understand&mdash;and I do not understand this matter as fully as some&mdash;that the banks were actually trading themselves with their customers' money. It is alleged that they were making profits out of trading with themselves on behalf of their customers and making money that way. There are also some fairly serious allegations of tax evasion having been undertaken by some banks. As I have said, I do not want to give credence to them, but the Martin inquiry has heard evidence of them and has made comments. The Foreign Currency Borrowers Association in its quite detailed and well presented submissions also refers to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I shall not keep the Senate for much longer. I wanted to raise the issue now. It is unfortunate that this is an inquiry of a House of Representatives committee. It means that unless we manufacture some courses to enable us to talk about the matter in the Senate, it will not come before us at this stage. I intend to look into the matter and pursue it further at a later date. I have been approached by a number of constituents. I am watching and am trying to assist where I can so that they can come to some conclusions with the banks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not pretend to give legal advice or to be in any way expert on the matter because it is a matter of great complexity, but I intend to watch with interest what happens and hope that matters can be resolved. I hope that the banks will look seriously at mediation and get to just solutions in all those issues. If it appears that the banks are not responding, if the Martin inquiry feels that there are other matters that should be looked at or if the Foreign Currency Borrowers Association feels that there are still matters that need close scrutiny, it may be that the Senate should set up its own inquiry into various matters raised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Foreign Currency Borrowers Association report has called for a number of things. I shall not take up the Senate's time by reading them out, but I would refer honourable senators to the first and second pages in the covering letter which sent the document to us all. The Association indicates in that letter what it wants. It wants a royal commission. The Martin inquiry was not too much in favour of a royal commission. I am not sure that a royal commission is the way to go, but the matter does require further examination. Possibly a Senate committee might be the avenue for a close look at some of these serious allegations. I hope that this may not be necessary. I hope the matters can be resolved amicably so that the banks can get on with their business and to a certain extent resurrect the high regard that they used to have in the minds of the Australian public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask Senator McMullan in his reply to indicate what is the Government's attitude to the conclusions of the Martin inquiry, particularly to the submissions made to all members of Parliament by the Foreign Currency Borrowers Association. I do not know whether Senator McMullan personally has had the opportunity of glancing through the submission or whether he has asked his officers to do so, but I would like some comment from him as to where he feels we should go from here and as to the Government's attitude. I imagine that the Government will be making a response to the Martin inquiry's recommendations, but I would appreciate it if at this stage he could give some indication on these matters. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I go any further, I should like to support what Senator Macdonald has said with respect to foreign currency borrowing. Honourable senators may remember that I have spoken before on this matter, which was brought to light by former Senator McLean from New South Wales. He made it quite a project while he was here. I fully support everything Senator Macdonald said tonight. I have gone into this pretty well with borrowers from Western Australia, Queensland and New South Wales. In fact, I will be seeing the Foreign Currency Borrowers Association in Queensland the week after next. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bank which seemed to get all the blame from former Senator McLean was Westpac. Honourable senators will remember the Westpac letters. I have said before in the Senate and I will say again that when all of the washing is hung out, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia will make Westpac look like a kindergarten outfit. In addition to the book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Comments and Further Submissions to the Parliamentary Banking Inquiry</EMPHASIS>, another book is being sent to everyone called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Which Banks are Still the Bastards?</EMPHASIS> I recommend it to people. It makes very good reading and gives a different insight. I will be interested to hear what Senator McMullan has to say at the end of the debate with respect to Senator Macdonald's comments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The debate this evening has ranged far and wide with respect to the One Nation package. I intend to address briefly a number of points. If Senator McMullan wants to take a point of order because I am wandering away from the subject, I will let him do so and you can rule on it, Madam Acting Deputy President. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The One Nation statement delivered last week was intended to turn this nation around. As I have said before, I thought we already had one nation, but in the last ten years this Government has made it many more than one nation: it has created about ten. One way or another, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is trying to bring it back. I can see that the Government's advisers are amused about this subject but I will continue on this line until I am stopped.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no joy whatsoever in this statement for the agricultural and mining industries. I have read the statement from front to back. It is simply a package designed to answer the Hewson Fightback package and it has done very little in that regard. In fact, it is not within a bull's roar of the Hewson package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the main thrust of the package is to reverse a lot of the ill-advised decisions this Government has made over the past three years, and I will list some of them. Let us look at the measures the Government has included. The first is what I refer to as the Nissan effect&mdash;the wholesale sales tax on cars. The tax has been dropped by 5 per cent&mdash;from 20 per cent to 15 per cent&mdash;on cars under a wholesale price of about $30,000, or about $45,000 retail. That is an admirable way to go. After all, the Hewson package will eliminate sales tax altogether. In this case, the Prime Minister has just picked those cars which cost up to $45,000 retail on which to drop the tax from 20 per cent to 15 per cent. The luxury car tax still remains at 30 per cent on cars over that value. Honourable senators will remember the decision, which was reversed not long ago, with respect to the super-luxury tax of up to 50 per cent. The Government found that fewer cars were sold so it backed off on that tax quite some time ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has reduced the tax on cars by 5 per cent. If it wants to encourage business and the selling of cars&mdash;and Senator Button omitted this today in Question Time&mdash;that 5 per cent reduction in wholesale sales tax on vehicles should apply to trucks, delivery vans, utilities and motor cycles, which are used in delivery service businesses and so on. Those vehicles continue to be taxed at 20 per cent. If the Government wanted to stimulate business and cut business costs, it should have included those vehicles in the 5 per cent reduction. It is patently stupid to have a vehicle&mdash;which one could say has a certain luxury about it because one could use public transport&mdash;which delivers goods, delivers messages, delivers come what may, still attracting tax at 20 per cent, or 5 per cent higher than for a sedan. It is one of the most ridiculous measures in the whole package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to the accelerated depreciation schedule that we have heard so much about. I am in favour of accelerated depreciation to stimulate business, but what has the Government done? How much has it accelerated? We have not had the legislation for the previous system, which was to start on 1 July 1991, but it will come and it will apply to plant bought after 12 March 1991. Taking that as the standard at the present moment, a machine with an effective life of from three years to less than five years can be written off at 2.5 years under the old system&mdash;the one that has not come in yet. Under the new system it is 2.5 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to a machine with an effective life of from five years to less than 6 2/3years. This applies to most machines with a motor in them&mdash;whether it be a tractor, a header, a bulldozer, a scraper or whatever. Under the old system, the previous rate, including the loading, was 36 per cent, with a write-off period of 4.2 years. Under the new system it will be written off in 3.75 years. How accelerated is that? It is patently stupid to say that it is accelerated. It is only six months. What further encouragement does that provide for someone who is thinking of buying bigger plant or extra plant? I cannot see any reason whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next category is machinery with an effective life of from 6 2/3 years to less than 10 years. The previous rate was 27 per cent, with an implied write-off period of 5.6 years; the new one is 5 years. So the Government has brought it down by six months. That is not worth having. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the night Senator Button delivered this statement in the Senate he said that machinery being written off over 20 to 30 years had come down to a maximum of seven years. That is a good move, but it still will not make a great difference. If someone writes off machinery much beyond seven years, inflation will have an effect on it. If someone is writing off $100,000 over 20 years to 30 years as compared to seven years, inflation has eaten away the effect after seven or eight years. So the Government has not given the businessmen as much as it seemed at the time. I appreciate the little measure the Government has proposed, but it is nowhere near as accelerated as it makes out. I turn now to business company tax deferral. </PARA>

This was debated in this place last year, and Senator Cook, who led for the Government, would not listen for one moment to the argument that a 12 1/2 per cent wool tax was too much. Now the Government is making a big deal with the farmers by giving them back their wool tax, giving them back their own money. How much has disappeared under administration?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Next year the biggest projected deficit&mdash;1.9 per cent of GDP&mdash;is, by Australian historical standards and by international standards, a small deficit, particularly during a recession.

For the first time we can start to see the fear in their eyes. Those are matters that we will all have lots of time to talk about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to say something about Senator Macdonald's contribution before I come back to the only question that was raised that relates to the Bill. I will do that as soon as I can. Although Senator Macdonald assured me that what he was saying did relate to the Bill, I do not think it did. Nevertheless, I accept that it was important. I agree with a large part of what he said about the nature of advice given to some of the people who got in trouble with foreign currency borrowings. I do not know so much about their relationship with the banks; that is a fairly esoteric question. His advice to people to be cautious when what looks like some sort of magic potion is presented to them by their financial advisers was sound advice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Macdonald asked me particularly about the Martin Committee report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A Pocket Full of Change</EMPHASIS>&mdash;the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration. The Government has given a commitment to consider and respond to the recommendations of the Standing Committee. As Senator Macdonald remarked, most of the recommendations are things for the banks to do rather than things for the Government to do. They are recommendations&mdash;Senator Macdonald directly referred to many of them&mdash;about the way in which the banks should change their practices. Some of them are already doing so. Those responses that refer to the Government are being considered, but I cannot give an announcement about a timetable at this stage. I can indicate, as I have indicated to this chamber in debate before, that I for one will not be supporting proposals that we should be moving in the direction of a royal commission. That is entirely the wrong thing to be doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the point raised first by Senator Kernot. Although I heard a large part of her contribution, I did not pick this point up. The telephone started running hot from people who misunderstood what she said or perhaps she misunderstood the Bill. From what I heard, she asked a fairly straightforward question about which some people got excited because they misunderstood her point. Senator Short, whom I did hear, raised the same question. It is a concern about whether there is something more significant than appears on the surface in the nature of the changes to the approval process for coinage under the Currency Act. At the moment, as people who have been involved with debating the Bill would know, the procedures under the Currency Act 1965 require regulations to issue. These will be changed to ministerial determinations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no substantive change whatsoever to the checks and balances that are available within the system. The key check is here. The key check is that the Senate has the capacity to disallow determinations, particularly under this legislation. It is made explicit at proposed new section 13(6) under clause 4 of the Bill that a determination is a disallowable instrument for the purposes of section 46A of the Acts Interpretation Act. There is nothing that the Government can do under the Currency Act as it now stands that it cannot do with the amendments and vice versa. There is nothing the Government can do under the Bill that it does not already have the power to do at the moment. All that has happened is that a procedure by which the decision made by the Treasurer has to be processed via the Executive Council and then back to tabling is removed to simplify the process with no substantive effect on the checks and balances available to the chamber, to the Parliament, or the information available to the people more widely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Short asked me a specific question about the extent of the savings. I do want to exaggerate that. I expect the administrative savings to be very small. The amount of work involved in this is increasing a bit. I deal with it most times. The number of times that it is happening is increasing as the coinage increases because of the role of the Mint and Gold Corp in producing precious metal coins and those sorts of issues over and above the traditional coin issuing. I think there is a small element of saving. We should make those savings we can, but let us not exaggerate the significance of that. I have also seen a potential problem with regard to the commercial arm of the Mint and the commercial corporation, Gold Corp, that marketing of these coins is time sensitive. There are niches and marketing opportunities. It is very difficult for a body pursuing such a time sensitive commercial operation to have to go through the somewhat, for that purpose, cumbersome but, for other purposes, entirely appropriate procedure via the Executive Council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can reassure the Senate that there is no intention, and there is no possibility, to change the ability of the Parliament to review these initiatives or the capacity of the public to express any concern that they may have about the nature of changes. That is unchanged by this process. There is nothing that the executive arm of government can do under the legislation as amended that it could not do under the Act as it currently stands.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise a matter which was brought to my attention by a short article headed `Bio-fuels may save EC farmers' which appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> on 19 February this year. I was attracted to read the article&mdash;and I will quote briefly from it&mdash;because it raises an issue which has received attention from time to time in this place and in other parliaments throughout Australia, that is, alternative fuels which may be distilled from the surplus crops that our farmers sometimes have. We have heard this matter discussed quite often in this place, particularly by senators from Queensland, and I know that Senator Kernot has often introduced this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The plight of our canegrowers results from the low world market price for sugar and the inability of our farmers to seek alternative markets. The solution may in part lie in the fact that we could seek alternative crops to be grown on the same land that canegrowers are committed to, but we also may be able to solve this problem by seeking alternative uses for the sugar cane which is grown there. This has been alluded to in the article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>. It suggests that the European Community Commission wants Europeans to start fuelling their cars with corn, rapeseed and sugar beets, all products which, in past years, have been grown to some excess in Europe, producing a surplus for which there has been little use. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> article states that the European Community Commission has a plan which represents the EC's latest effort to placate its 10 million farmers. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>We are told that these 10 million farmers fear their jobs are at risk because of current efforts to reform the world trading system. Here we see an imperative that is brought into this argument which is a unique way of solving things. Rather than build up mountains of excess production, which has been the traditional response of the Europeans; and rather than plough in excess production, which has sometimes been used as a so-called solution in Australia; the use of this bio-mass, this organic produce, to distil and produce ethanol for use as an alternative fuel is being considered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the immediate advantage to any country adopting this practice would be to improve its balance of payments if it imports oil at all.

The fact is that the European Community Commission is actively considering this possibility right now. We should make a much more concerted effort to look seriously at this potential solution to the problem we have with disposing of the produce of our farms in an economical and beneficial way. I hope to take other opportunities to introduce ideas from overseas that we should be taking advantage of. </PARA>
