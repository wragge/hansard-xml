That is a matter that may need some further consultation in future. I think the way that the Government interpreted it in the last instance was that the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button) got up after one hour and said, `Time's up', and I anticipate that that is what the Government will do again today.

Given that the major issue in the recent Victorian election was the financial mismanagement of the Cain-Kirner Government, why did the Federal Government then conspire with the Victorian Labor Government, and the Minister in particular, now that we know that he knew of this matter, to hide the massive borrowing breach from the Victorian electorate?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;These beautiful pejorative words that Senator Hill conjures up in his questions are not appropriate and I do not concede the relevance of any of them. The Commonwealth Government, in its view, was not provided with accurate information about the extent and size of Victorian Government borrowings until yesterday. That information is now in the hands of the Commonwealth, as I understand it. In the period leading up to the Federal Budget&mdash;I have a list of the published correspondence&mdash;there were meetings between the Federal Treasury and officials in Victoria regarding the borrowings. Those were initiated by the Commonwealth. Just as these sorts of inquiries and discussions have been initiated by the Commonwealth in the case of other States, so they were in this case.</PARA></TALK.START>

The Standing Orders provide that a Minister will answer questions in relation to his administration. What he is now doing is seeking to interpret our policy, as he knows that matter is on the agenda for debate later this day. That is when it will be debated. That is the proper time for debate.

The Minister is not answering the question as to whether he would adopt the Opposition's policy, which was the guise under which he sought to bring the answer within the Standing Orders.

There is a very big gap between what the Opposition policy says and how Mr Howard explains it to the electorate. It is not a policy about enterprise or workplace bargaining. It is a policy about reducing workers to individual work contracts or saying, `Sign here and get the sack'.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to that question is that if there had been a publication of figures which were regarded as inaccurate in relation to Victoria at that time, it would probably have had an extraordinary effect on the market. One need only look at the present situation and the discussion which has taken place in the last week or two and market response to that. The rule is that if there is a breach of global borrowings, as was suspected at that time, and no solution in place to that problem&mdash;that is, the problem of the State finances in Victoria&mdash;that would have had a very adverse effect on market perceptions. The fact of the matter is that that is true, and it is consistent with the behaviour of the Commonwealth in relation to the State Bank of South Australia, for example, and in relation to the State Bank of Victoria.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have noticed press reports to the effect that the Victorian and New South Wales health Ministers are trying to hold up the implementation of the next phase of the Medicare agreement, which, of course, would provide health care for all Australians on an equitable basis. They are doing this in order to get recognition of the role of private insurance into that Medicare agreement in a way which would simply provide a foundation for the policy of the Federal Opposition. This policy is to require and coerce Australians to take out private health insurance to cover their medical and hospital costs, with some subsidy offered to certain categories of those forced and required to take out that premium for private health insurance, in addition to their ordinary taxation and Medicare levy payments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question is: where will the money come from for those subsidies which the Opposition says it will offer in respect of some private health insurance premiums?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These moneys have to come from somewhere. The Commonwealth, under the Opposition's Fightback proposals, would take the money direct from the public hospitals&mdash;which, of course, provide for the health care and hospital treatment of Australians, whether they are public patients or private patients taking advantage of the public hospital structure&mdash;and put it into private health insurance premium subsidies for some categories of some of those forced to take out such private health insurance.

I refer to the Treasurer's letter of 30 October to the New South Wales Premier, Mr Fahey, in which he strongly supported the need for improved Loan Council procedures, including greater scrutiny and regular publication of all borrowing by all government bodies, and explicit penalties for any breach of agreed borrowing limits. I ask the Minister: first, does he acknowledge that the Government's position on the Loan Council is totally inconsistent, having claimed at different times that to publicise government borrowings would both undermine and promote market confidence? Secondly, did the Treasurer become aware that at least some of the Victorian Government's $1.3 billion of extra debt had been on-sold to the private sector in time to have that recorded in this year's Budget Papers? Finally, given that the operation of the Loan Council is based entirely on gentlemen's agreements and rubbery figures, does he accept that establishing public confidence in the financial transactions of the public sector must be the top priority, requiring a thorough and public review of the Loan Council operations?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I might try to work through the three points of the honourable senator's question. First of all, the Government's position on this has been consistent at all times; that is, to act in the national interest. This question was asked in part by Senator Short. At all times we have maintained that it was critically important to Victoria and the nation as a whole that when the extent of the Victorian debt problem became publicly known the Victorian Government had in place a strategy to solve the problem&mdash;a strategy that the Commonwealth Government and the other members of the Loan Council could support to ensure that markets had confidence in that strategy; a strategy to solve the problem.</PARA></TALK.START>

That is the second part of the honourable senator's question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to repeat that at the time of the preparation of the Commonwealth Budget the Victorian Government contended that the $1.267 billion was not subject to the authority of the Loan Council.

<PARA>Senator Hill replied:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yes.</PARA>
<PARA>The assumption revealed in this exchange, that the end of the cold war has somehow reduced the need for Australian&mdash;and by extension, international&mdash;efforts in the disarmament area, is both naive and dangerous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is naive because of the way in which it comprehensively underestimates the historic opportunity which now exists in the post-cold war world for giving some practical reality to the disarmament and arms control agenda which for so long was utterly strangled by superpower confrontation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is dangerous for Australian security interests, quite apart from anybody else's, in as much as the achievement of a number of key objectives in that peace and disarmament agenda is absolutely necessary if we are to have a comfortable security future in what is a very much more fluid and dynamic environment in our own region now that the gridlock of that superpower confrontation has been lifted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are several particular aspects to this issue. The first is chemical weapons, in relation to which Senator Hill did acknowledge the Ambassador for Disarmament had done some useful work. What he failed to acknowledge was that a great deal of work remains to be done over the years ahead to translate the agreement&mdash;which has been now so laboriously constructed with a lot of crucial input from Australia&mdash;to implement it, and to make it work. Work is now being carried forward by our Ambassador for Disarmament who, among other things, chairs the international group that is spearheading the implementation of the chemical weapons convention. If Senator Hill had his way, the Ambassador would be out of a job and we would be unable to play that role.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, there is no more crucial item on the world's peace and disarmament agenda at the moment than the extension of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, which up until now has been the world's most important single disarmament measure. It is up for review when its sunset period operates in 1995 and it is absolutely crucial to get it applied to a number of threshold nuclear states which are not presently  party to it. There is no more important diplomatic task for the world than that in the present environment. That is another crucial role for our Ambassador for Disarmament to play.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Associated with that is the question of a comprehensive nuclear test ban, which again is closer to achievement than it ever has been. At the moment it is the subject of a resolution on which we are leading the charge in the United Nations, again with our Ambassador for Disarmament playing the crucial diplomatic role. A successful implementation of the resolution would in itself be the most crucial single diplomatic thing that we could do to create the environment for an effective extension of that nuclear non-proliferation treaty.

While Mr McLachlan has been going around the country saying that $350 to $400 will be saved from the price of a car by abolition of payroll tax, this report says the figure is $200 to $250. Going through each of these figures one by one, one sees that the justification for the policy and the figures which have been argued are wrong.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is that I am quite satisfied with that statement on the Budget and I agree with it, because over a number of years, as the honourable senator admitted in his supplementary question, it was this Government that brought about the publication of Forward Estimates; it was this Government that introduced a whole range of measures relating to financial management; it was this Government that pursued the States about their State instrumentalities and their finances; and it was this Government that, in regard to the State of Victoria, asked for the Nicholls committee to be appointed to look at the State finances. In all those situations it has been this Government that has taken the initiative. So I do not retreat from those words on the Budget at all. It is no good for the honourable senator to flap his arms at me; the fact of the matter is that that is true, and I do not retreat from that.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. I refer to the formerly secret AIDAB report of 22 June 1992 which found that Australian advisers are training mobile squads of Papua New Guinea police in military style operations on Bougainville, possibly in breach of the PNG Constitution. I ask the Minister whether he is aware of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Background Briefing</EMPHASIS> program of 25 October, in which one member of a mobile squad said that Australian advisers had trained him to use an M60 machine-gun which he fired from an Australian supplied Iroquois helicopter on Bougainville. Did the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development, Mr Kerin, approve the second phase of Australian aid to the PNG constabulary without having read that AIDAB report? Will Australian aid to the PNG police be reviewed in light of the report and the details from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Background Briefing</EMPHASIS> program?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Such training as has taken place of Papua New Guinea constabulary in their special services group, or the mobile squads or the riot control squads, has been training that in some way approximates to military training to the extent that it involves fieldcraft, weapons handling and matters of that kind. But it has not been training for Bougainville at any stage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the case that some of the people so trained have obviously deployed those skills in the situation in Bougainville, but there has been no question of the Australian advisers, whether civilian policemen or military advisers, actively being involved in training people for the conditions they might confront on Bougainville.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point to make is in reference to the M60 machine-gun issue. Although there has been some assertion to the effect that individual police officers have been trained in the use of that weapon by Australian personnel, I am advised that there is no truth whatsoever in that. While it may be the case that some police officers, in the course of their service on Bougainville, have used M60s in their work with the military there, they have certainly not been trained in the use of any such weapon by the Australian advisers involved. That is denied absolutely by the Australian personnel. The M60s are no part of the armoury of any of the police officers concerned, and that seems to be something about which there has been some comprehensive misunderstanding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to Mr Kerin's approval of the second phase of Australian aid to the constabulary, the first phase has gone on for some five years and has involved the expenditure of some $30m. It has been a very important element in Australia's contribution to try to enhance the discipline and effectiveness of the law and order authorities in Papua New Guinea. The training of the special services division has occupied the time of only five of the 44 advisers involved, and that special services division is itself only a small component of the total constabulary of some 4,000 people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second phase of the total Australian effort is intended to go for another five years and to involve rather more substantial expenditure. It was the subject of a detailed evaluation report. The conclusions of that report were amply summarised in the material that was given to Mr Kerin when he made his decision to approve the second phase.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was moving on from the sleaze to give a specific substantive response. As to the timing, Mr Dawkins first raised with me the question of a possible diplomatic appointment for Mr Boucher, including possibly the OECD post, back in July, at the time we were preparing for the Budget. It was just part of the informal exchanges that were occurring about that time. It was subsequently formally conveyed to me&mdash;his intention to proceed down this path, if I agreed&mdash;in a phone call early in October which was followed by subsequent correspondence from him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to who made the decision about the appointment of Mr Boucher, diplomatic appointments of this kind and other kinds are made by the Governor-General on my recommendation. I decided that this was a perfectly appropriate appointment to make because Mr Boucher is a senior public servant with strong economic qualifications and because, in particular, of the nature of the OECD's role, focusing on economic policy experience in industrially developed countries. He is an outstanding public servant who justifies none of the calumny that has been foisted upon him, without any sustaining or supporting evidence, by Senator Bishop. He is someone in whom I and the Government as a whole have absolute confidence, as is the case with the community as a whole. The formal recommendation has not yet gone to the Governor-General. It will in a matter of days. But certainly I have made the decision. I will be making such a recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far as Mr Borthwick's position is concerned, it is not a matter of Mr Borthwick being recalled so much as Mr Borthwick being offered and having accepted a senior position back in the Treasury, of which he is a career officer. It needs to be appreciated that the OECD post is one that in practice has rotated between DFAT appointees and Treasury appointees, the formal decision in each case being made on my recommendation but on the matter of informal arrangements agreed between Foreign Affairs and Treasury.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Mr Borthwick is a career Treasury officer. He has done an excellent job in Paris in the time he has been there. It is perfectly appropriate that he should be looking forward to his longer term future in Treasury by accepting a senior post that has now been offered to him. It is not a matter of him being recalled; it is a matter of him advancing his career in other ways. Both he and Mr Boucher are outstanding public servants. The timing I have indicated gives no credence whatsoever to Senator Bishop's disgraceful performance on this matter.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This arises from the answer by Senator Evans to the dorothy dixer relating to the Australian Ambassador for Disarmament. What I said in the radio interview is that Australia can no longer afford three ambassadors in Geneva. There is an ambassador to GATT. I said there was a good case, in the current circumstances, for an ambassador to GATT. We also have an ambassador to the UN, and a separate ambassador for disarmament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I said is that the time has to come when Australia takes account of the cost of these positions. There is no reason at all why Australia's ambassador to the UN in Geneva cannot fulfil the disarmament functions that Senator Evans outlined to the Senate today. The result would be to save the taxpayer a lot of dollars, and that would have been sensible Government policy. Interestingly, a couple of years ago it was exactly what Senator Evans wanted to do and he was dissuaded from it at the last moment. So he knows the merit of the case. He knows it is an extravagance that Australia cannot afford in the contemporary circumstances in relation to disarmament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That does not mean that the work in relation to the chemical convention treaty should not continue, as I said in that interview. I also accept the importance of the NPT and work on other such conventions, but it does not require a third ambassadorial position in Geneva. At the time that the Government is withdrawing our ambassador in Berne&mdash;bearing in mind that Switzerland is our third or fourth largest investor in this country&mdash;because the Minister said we could not afford the position, he maintains three ambassadors in Geneva, and that simply demonstrates distorted priorities. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Transcript of Item Broadcast On:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3RN Saturday National 7.14 am 31st October, 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Interview with Senator Robert Hill, Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs, discussing Australians appointed to overseas posts and if the cost and numbers of personnel are warranted; and what steps they would take, when elected to government, in the area of foreign affairs, both overseas and in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Presenter:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And it's been a week of tooing and froing for people with what we could term rather cushy jobs. The New South Wales Agent General in London Neil Peckard(?), was hastened home, allegedly as he tripped about Europe in a chauffeur driven motor, while the Federal Government was recalling its ambassador to the OECD so outgoing Tax Commissioner Trevor Boucher could have the job.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I couldn't help wondering just how many people are rattling around the world in Government backed jobs. And are they in the right place for the job that has to be done these days?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Now the Australian Trade Commission, or AusTrade which has four hundred and eighty one people overseas in fifty countries, has come in for some criticism being too heavily based in Europe and Asia, but they have strengthened Asia where there's ten regional personnel often called barefoot trade areas, because they're pretty spartan on office trappings, but strong on the hard sell local style.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When it comes to Consulates and High Commission offices a quick look at our Foreign Affairs list shows sixty two different overseas posts, who knows how many staff. And no-one would argue that we don't need representation abroad but are our people in the right places?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Robert Hill, Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs joins Saturday National. Senator Hill thanks for your time. Let's give the listeners on radio the extent of the Government payroll abroad for trade and diplomacy. How many people are we talking about and in what different areas?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Robert Hill&mdash;Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has about nine hundred overseas, and engaged . . . has . . . has about two thousand locally employed people overseas. Total cost to the taxpayer is about two hundred million.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The AusTrade, our trade promotion, is on . . . is on top of that, and the . . . the exact cost of their overseas operation, I'm not sure, but it would be I suspect around about the one hundred million.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Presenter:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Now do you believe that this money is being wasted? Or a percentage . . . percentage might be wasted through duplication, or say misplaced priorities?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Let's start with trade. It was week when we saw the New South Wales Agent General in London, Neil Peckard being told by his Premier to pack his bags and come home. And . . . and this position of course is being described as a . . . a colonial throw back. Do you think that each State really needs a representative in the UK alone?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I mean our pri . . . priorities have shifted to Asia, haven't they?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Hill:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well they could probably say it's none of my . . . none of my business. But in the . . . in the old role that they played I . . . I would doubt it. Providing tickets for visits to the Royal Horse Guards or . . . or whatever. The question is, I guess, whether they are really producing a trade or economic benefit for the States and they will have to make their judgement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There has been something of a trend in recent years to look to the opening of State posts within Asia, I mean Japan . . . that have partial successful. Some States have tried to do it through agencies. So there has been that . . . there have been that shift, but there is a concern about duplication of . . . of resources. These posts do cost a lot of money. The question is whether the Australian taxpayer is getting the best benefit from the resources when they are duplicated.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Presenter:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well you talked about AusTrade. Could AusTrade do the job?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Hill:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yes it . . . it . . . well that's it's function as trade promotion generally, but the . . . it's . . . there's traditionally rivalry through . . . between the States under which they have thought they have needed additional resources to, particularly represent their interest as opposed to other States.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And I'd . . . I wonder whether in the longer term Australia can afford that, but that is a decision that the States will have to make.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Presenter:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Now Senator you have been heard to use the expression, "Complete shambles", when it comes to government spending on foreign affairs. The question is, I suppose, do we have the right people in the right places in these areas?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Hill: </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well we've got very . . . very good people, but my criticism would be that the posts have been insufficiently trade(sic) and economically related. Too much of the reporting is on . . . is on other matters and basically I think too much paper is produced.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is . . . there is . . . there is still not a totally satisfactory trade intelligence network producing for Australian industry . . . business and industry, the figures on markets and market opportunities that they would like. So I'd like to see greater emphasis in that.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We've actually talked about restructuring the whole of the department to give a greater emphasis to our . . . our trade interests by bringing, you know, bi-lateral trade experts back into the department. And . . . but apart from that I think there is also the question of orientation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It's interesting that we still have more . . . more posts in Europe than we have in Asia, but our largest posts are still places such as London, which is the largest. I'll give you one example.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">London costs . . . costs the taxpayer about twenty million dollars a year, whereas Kuala Lumpur, a key regional post costs us three and a half million dollars. And I . . . and I just think that it's disproportionate and I think it's got to be looked at.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Even within Europe I would have though these days, a key post, if not the key post is . . . is Brussels because of the European Commission and . . . and it's key role in trade policy. And yet Brussels is only about one fifth of the size, in dollars terms, of our London post. So I do think that these questions need to be looked at and . . . and looked at seriously.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Presenter:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well it seems when . . . when you do look at the situation at first glance, it seems like a sensible cost cutting measure for some . . . some embassies to close down. I'm thinking of Lisbon now. But do you . . . I believe you're not that keen on the fact that it was closed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Hill:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well we closed about . . . about three closures in Europe in this . . . in this last budget, and my concern is that it doesn't seem to be developed as part of a wider strategy. We . . . we closed Bern for example, and yet Switzerland is either our third or fourth largest financial investor. And yet we . . . and yet we have three ambassadors in Geneva working to the UN to the GATT, to disarmament and to the UN generally. So, again, it seems to me that that's getting the pri . . . getting the priorities wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The other thing I criticised was that we've . . . we've got into this pattern of opening posts and then closing them. We opened Prague two years ago and have now closed it. The end result of that is that we look silly. It looks as if we don't know what direction we're seeking to take in foreign policy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We did it in relation to Berlin, the other way around. We closed Berlin and then a few years later we . . . we opened it again. And it's that sort of lack of vision that's coming through the post openings and closures that I've particularly criticised.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I've also said that sometimes it's false economy, because the costs of closing are almost as great as the costs of maintaining, because the functions are moved to somewhere else, in the case of Lisbon I think they are now moved to London, it's either to London or to Paris, and it'll be serviced by diplomats flying backwards and . . . backwards and forwards.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Presenter:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It makes you . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Hill:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So these issues really do need to be looked at very carefully and I don't think they were looked at carefully by the Minister or his department.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Presenter:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It makes you wonder, doesn't it, about some of these diplomatic positions. They . . . they seem to, as you say, outlive their usefulness, but they're maintained may be because that it's comfortable political appointment for a Government paying individuals, per se, a few things.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Hill:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well there's been . . . thankfully not too many of . . . of recent times. I've been . . . I've been critical of some. My . . . my approach has been that if . . . if . . . the person who is best qualified should . . . for the job should have it, and . . . and even in the case of some of the . . . this Government's political appointments, I've said that they have been people who have been well qualified.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I can remember former President of Senate in London. I can think of another example of a diplomatic appointment of a former politician to San Francisco, which I criticised, because I said that I didn't think he was the best person for that particular job.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So these decisions should all be made based on . . . on merit. Sometimes they are and sometimes they aren't, and if they aren't they shouldn't be made.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Presenter:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I remember a few eyebrows were raised when Gough Whitlam was . . . was . . . took up that position in Paris with UNESCO. Is . . . is that position still going?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Hill: </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ambassador to UN . . . to UNESCO?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Presenter:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yeah.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Hill:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I . . . I think we have downgraded it and now . . . and now the . . . I think the Deputy in Paris . . . for our mission in Paris has the task of leading the delegation to UNESCO.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Presenter:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Are there many other jobs like that UNESCO one?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Hill:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well there . . . there are. I mentioned there were three ambassadors in . . . in Geneva.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Presenter:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yeah.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Hill:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Now the . . . the Ambassador for Disarmament, whereas we are all in favour of disarmament it is . . . and there are still difficult challenges in wrapping up the chemical weapons convention, but nevertheless the way the world has gone with the end of the Cold War, I would think it's now hard to justify that . . . that sort of position.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And . . . and these . . . these have to be re . . . reviewed, I readily accept that because they do cost a lot of money and the taxpayers, particularly in our part of circumstances has got to get value for his or her dollar.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Presenter:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well Senator if all goes well for you at the next election, would you be trimming much fat from around the world?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Hill:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well we have to trim a bit, because we . . . we've pledged to reduce the administration costs of DFAT and that will require some . . . some closures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But what I said is . . . to you is certainly given the . . . given the hint but not only . . . not only will we be restructuring the department in Canberra, so that it is better able to meet our requirements on economic and trade matters, but we will be looking to our posts overseas, giving a much greater emphasis to that important aspect. Because that's where I think the Australian taxpayer will get best value for their dollar in the light of what I see will be the real difficult issues for Australia in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think that the chances are in the next ten years most of the major foreign affairs issues facing Australia will be trade or economic related, and it's politically important that the . . . the department has the capacity to maximise our benefit in these areas.  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Presenter:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So we might see the position what, of Ambassador for Disarmament go?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Hill:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yes, yes. I think that that would . . . that should . . . that should now appropriately downgraded and that not to underestimate what's occurred in the past.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Presenter:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Hill thank you very much for sparing us your time today. I'll let you go off and catch that plane now.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The regulations contain provisions that extend the circumstances under which the employees of the Australian Postal Corporation may disclose information for several purposes, including disclosure to ASIO and law enforcement bodies of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory. They also provide for the trial of a system in Queensland which, if successful, may lead to the introduction of a national change of address service whereby, as the explanatory statement notes, on the written election of a person, the person's new address is given to mailers in possession of the person's former address.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee had a number of concerns about the regulations and, therefore, decided that it should hear evidence from the officers from the Department of Transport and Communications.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The matters which concerned the Committee included the need for and width of the powers provided in the regulations; the incorporation of the wide provisions in regulations rather than in the principal Act; and whether the Privacy Commissioner had been consulted in respect of regulations. On 16 September, the last day for giving notice, the Committee gave notice of disallowance of the regulations for 12 sitting days after that day to enable it to examine matters further in the light of evidence given.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having further considered the evidence, the Committee advised the Minister that unless its concerns were met, it would bring forward the notice of motion to disallow the regulations to the first week of sittings in October. In the meantime it wrote to the Privacy Commissioner seeking his comments on the matters of concern to it. The Minister then agreed to repeal and remake the regulations, to limit the period of the trial of the national change of address scheme and to narrow its operation. The circumstances in which information may be released to ASIO and law enforcement agencies would also be limited, preparatory to the introduction of a Bill in the Autumn sittings next year so that Parliament could debate this whole issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although this response substantially met our concerns, the Committee asked for further clarification of several matters because of the sensitive issues of personal rights involved. The Minister provided this information and also undertook to provide a sunset clause for the ASIO and law enforcement provisions. While the Committee did consider leaving its disallowance motion in place until these undertakings were fulfilled, section 48B of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 provides that regulations the same in substance as existing regulations may not be made while a notice of disallowance is on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>. However, the Committee understands that the new regulations will be made within a number of days.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the broader matter, the Committee draws particular attention to the general comments made by the Privacy Commissioner to the Department of Transport and Communications concerning the sheltering by certain departments behind the lowest common denominator provisions governing disclosure under the Privacy Act. The Committee foreshadows that it will be giving close attention to the principles raised by the Privacy Commissioner as they affect Commonwealth administration and the operations of the Committee, and it will report to the Senate in due course. As usual I seek leave to incorporate in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> its correspondence with the Minister and letters from the Privacy Commissioner which will show our concerns and the cooperation received from the relevant Minister, Mr Bob Brown. I add for the record that again the Regulations and Ordinances Committee is a truly bipartisan committee of the Senate and, indeed, is always concerned with people's rights.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Regulations were prepared to enable the disclosure of information in the following circumstances:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">to an authorised officer of ASIO in connection with ASIO's functions;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">where it is reasonably necessary for the enforcement of the criminal law, Commonwealth laws imposing a pecuniary penalty or protection of the public revenue; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">where the fact or document relates to the affairs or personal particulars (including any address) of another person and:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the other person is reasonably likely to have been aware that such information is usually disclosed in those circumstances;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the other person has consented; or</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">disclosure is necessary to lessen a serious threat to life or health.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the issues that led to the making of the regulations concerned the need for details about holders of post office boxes to be able to be disclosed for law enforcement purposes when those boxes are used for the purpose of defrauding consumers or the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An example of the latter has been the use of post office boxes as contact addresses by persons illegally operating radio transmitters, or failing to pay their transmitter licence fees. The regulations will enable Australia Post to provide address details concerning such persons when it is reasonably necessary to do so to enforce offences under the Radiocommunications Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A second issue prompting the making of the regulations concerned Australia Post's proposed National Change of Address Scheme. This scheme will provide for an Australia Post customer's new address to be given to mailers who are in possession of the customer's former address. The scheme will only apply with the express consent of the customer. The scheme will also only apply to mailers who subscribe to the scheme. The scheme is being trialed in Queensland. Australia Post advises that since the introduction of the new change of address form in Queensland in July 1992 around 90% of applicants have authorised the release of their new address.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Additionally 40% of applicants have requested Australia Post to pass on their new address to Priority Address Notification subscribers listed on the form, ie Commonwealth Bank, Credit Union Australia, Queensland Teachers Credit Union, RACQ and Suncorp. The Queensland trial is expected to run for 6 to 9 months. The trial can only proceed because the regulations that have been put in place allow the disclosure of address information.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The width of the exceptions under the Regulations</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Regulation 20(a) enables disclosure to an authorised officer of ASIO in connection with ASIO's functions. This exception, which enables disclosure for national security purposes, is in the same terms as the exception in paragraph 88(3)(c) of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Telecommunications Act 1991</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Regulation 20(b) enables disclosure where it is reasonably necessary for the enforcement of the criminal law, Commonwealth laws imposing a pecuniary penalty or protection of the public revenue. This provision is in the same terms as Information Privacy Principle ll(l)(e) in section 14 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Privacy Act 1988</EMPHASIS> and paragraph 88(3)(g) of the Telecommunications Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Regulation 20(c) enables disclosure where a fact or document relates to the affairs or personal particulars (including any address) of another person and:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the other person is reasonably likely to have been aware that such information is usually disclosed in those circumstances;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the other person has consented; or</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">disclosure is necessary to lessen a serious threat to life or health.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This provision is in similar terms to IPP ll(l)(a), (b) and (c) respectively in section 14 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Privacy Act 1988</EMPHASIS> and paragraph 88(3)(e) of the Telecommunications Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Attorney-General's Department has advised that the regulation is legally consistent with the Privacy Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Were any limitations to the width of the power contemplated?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The provisions of the proposed regulations are permissive, enabling disclosure of facts or documents only in the circumstances set out.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In practice, disclosure of information under these regulations will be additionally limited by Australia Post's own internal policies. For example, under the National Change of Address Scheme, disclosure of information will occur only with the express prior consent of the individual concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia Post is subject to the Privacy Act as it is a Commonwealth agency. The internal policies will themselves be subject to the requirements of the Information Privacy Principles (eg information storage and security systems required under IPP 4) and the jurisdiction of the Privacy Commissioner. Under IPP 2, where Australia Post collects information, it will be required to ensure that the individual is aware of its usual disclosure practices with respect to such information. It is intended that this notification would include notification of permitted disclosures for which consent is not required such as disclosures under paragraphs 20(b)(i), (ii) and (iii) and paragraphs 20(c)(i) and (iii).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Why are the exemptions included in regulations rather than in an enactment?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Postal Corporation Act 1988</EMPHASIS> was enacted, the Parliament included a specific power in paragraph 92(2)(d) to enable further exceptions to the anti-disclosure provision to be specified in regulations. Presumably this was done in recognition that not all the circumstances in which the public interest would require disclosure could be identified in advance and that there should be the flexibility to include further exceptions as required.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, if the Committee is of the view that it is more desirable that the exceptions be included in the Act rather than the Regulations, the Government will give consideration to the possibility of amending the Act to do so. Something similar occurred when the Telecommunications Act was rewritten last year. Regulations made under the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Telecommunications Act 1989</EMPHASIS> in the same terms as regulation 20 of the Australian Postal Corporation Regulations were incorporated into section 88 of the 1991 Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Was the Privacy Commissioner consulted on the regulation?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Privacy Commissioner was consulted in the drafting of the regulation. The Commissioner raised two concerns with the proposed amendments:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">whether the Information Privacy Principle 11 disclosure exceptions are sufficient for defining the level of secrecy that should attach to the mail; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">whether the exceptions have the effect of ousting the oversight role of the Privacy Commissioner.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to the first concern, this Department took the view that the appropriate balance for the disclosure provision for Australia Post was that agreed to by the Parliament when it adopted the Privacy Principles in the Privacy Act. At the practical level, we do not see scope for the erosion of privacy protection arising from the regulation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Privacy Commissioner's concern about protecting the secrecy of mail is primarily dealt with by provisions other than section 92. In particular, subregulation 3(1) of the Australian Postal Corporation Regulations prohibits opening of a postal article other than in accordance with the regulations. The regulations only allow the opening of mail in a narrow range of circumstances, such as:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">opening an undeliverable article to obtain sufficient information to deliver it;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">opening an article to repair it;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">where there are reasonable grounds for believing the article contains contraband or dutiable items.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The disclosure regulations are expected to operate mainly in relation to address information. The disclosure regulations will not affect the existing restrictions on the opening of mail.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second concern was that the amendments may have the effect of ousting the jurisdiction of the Privacy Commissioner. This Department has received advice from the Attorney-General's Department on this point. That Department has advised that if information is disclosed contrary to regulation 20, the disclosure would be inconsistent with IPP ll(l)(d) (that is disclosure would not be disclosure `required or authorised by or under law') and thus it would be a matter that the Privacy Commissioner could investigate if a complaint were made by the individual concerned. The making of this regulation thus does not affect the Privacy Commissioner's jurisdiction with respect to Australia Post.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, as has been noted above, Australia Post employees will be required to follow internal guidelines. The Privacy Commissioner will have jurisdiction to ensure that those internal guidelines provide an appropriate protection for individual privacy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In this regard, Australia Post has been consulting with the Privacy Commissioner on the establishment and implementation of the trial National Change of Address Scheme. In addition, the Privacy Commissioner has been invited by Australia Post to participate in an analysis of the trial results of the National Change of Address Scheme when implemented.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister conveyed the specific concerns of the Privacy Commissioner to the Chairman of Australia Post on 24 June 1992. In particular, the Minister drew attention to the need for Australia Post employees to have regard for the Information Privacy Principles in implementing the regulations. A copy of this letter is attached.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Minister</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer again to correspondence about the Australian Postal Corporation Regulations (Amendment) (Statutory Rules No. 132 of 1992), concerning disclosure of information. In particular, I refer to my letter of 14 September 1992, which indicated that the Committee intended to examine the matter further at its next meeting and foreshadowed a protective notice of disallowance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I now advise that the notice was given on 16 September, for 12 sitting days after that day, to preserve the Committee's position. An extract of the relevant Hansard is enclosed for your information.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee having considered the matter at its meeting of 17 September, as planned, has concluded that the questions it has raised are too serious to await the expiry of the days it has allowed before a motion may be moved and the fulfilment of the promise made at its hearing of 10 September that a proposal would be put to Government to include the matters of concern in principal legislation to enable full Parliamentary debate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It understands, of course, that the Postal Corporation needs legislative authority for the trial of the proposed National Change of Address Scheme. It has, therefore, asked me to seek from you an assurance that the present regulations will be repealed, and new regulations made to provide for that purpose only, such regulations to operate for the duration of the trial period.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If your assurance that the new regulations will be made as a matter of urgency, together with an expected timetable for their making, is not forthcoming by Tuesday, 6 October 1992, on behalf of the Committee I shall seek the leave of the Senate to bring forward the notice of disallowance to 7 October, to enable the Senate to give consideration to disallowing the regulations in question. As you will be aware, no regulations the same in substance as regulations which have been disallowed may be made within 6 months of such disallowance unless a permissive resolution is passed by the disallowing House.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In order to assist you in your deliberations on the matter, I enclose for your information:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator Loosley</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your letters of 14 and 17 September 1992 informing me of the notice by the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances to disallow the Australian Postal Corporation Regulations (Amendments No. 132 of 1992) concerning the disclosure of information.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I note that the Committee has expressed concern over the breadth of the circumstances under which disclosure of name and address information by Australia Post employees may be permitted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am able to provide the Committee with an assurance that the present regulations will be repealed and a new regulation made that will enable Australia Post to continue its trial of the proposed National Change of Address Scheme in Queensland for a limited period.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendments would repeal Regulation 20 of the Australian Postal Corporation Regulations. A new provision would prescribe more narrowly the circumstances under which an Australia Post employee is permitted to disclose name and address information under the National Change of Address Scheme. I would propose that the amended regulation be drafted along the lines of the attached drafting instructions to the Attorney-General's Department. The Privacy Commissioner's Office will be fully consulted in the drafting of the regulations and has already advised that the Privacy Commissioner has no in-principle concerns with the text of the proposed new regulation 20.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is my intention that the new Regulations will be submitted to the Executive Council meeting scheduled for 19 October 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You will be aware that the legislative program for the Budget sittings is full. It is likely that the earliest time that amendments to the Australian Postal Corporation Act 1989 could be brought to Parliament is the Autumn sittings of 1993. I propose that the new regulation will permit the trial scheme to operate until 30 September 1993. This would enable the results of the trial scheme to be fully evaluated in consultation with Privacy Commissioner, and to enable further regulations or legislation to be enacted, if the Privacy Commissioner is satisfied that the operation of the trial has provided adequate protection for privacy interests. This approach would also ensure that Australia Post would not suffer financial detriment if the trial scheme were ultimately to be extended on a national basis. The Office of the Privacy Commissioner has indicated that it would have no objection to an extension of the evaluation period for the National Change of Address Scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to disclosures to officers from the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation and disclosures for the purposes of criminal law enforcement, it is recognised that the effect of regulation 20 is wider than intended. Following repeal, I propose that it be replaced with a provision which addresses what are understood to be the Committee's concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government considers there to be a clear distinction between the disclosure of information relating to address information or ownership of post office boxes, and the disclosure of the content or substance of mail. It is therefore proposed that a new regulation be made which will authorise the disclosure of information (other than the contents of mail). The Privacy Act complaint procedures would apply to disclosures made under this provision. Further legal advice confirming this position is currently being prepared by the Attorney-General's Department.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is intended that a further provision be included to enable the disclosure of the contents of mail to law enforcement agencies, only where authorised under the requirements of a Commonwealth law, or pursuant to the issue of a search warrant under State or Territory law, or under the ASIO Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed provisions are considered important to ensure continuity in authorising the access of ASIO and law enforcement agencies to information necessary for the enforcement of Commonwealth law, until legislation can be brought forward into the Autumn sittings of Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I trust that the proposed amendments will meet the Committee's concerns.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AUSTRALIAN POSTAL CORPORATION ACT 1989&mdash;REGULATIONS</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DRAFTING INSTRUCTIONS</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 1 June 1992 the Executive Council gave assent to regulations made under section 92(2) of the Australian Postal Corporation Act 1989 that extended the circumstances where an employee of Australia Post may disclose information to enable disclosure to ASIO, law enforcement bodies and in certain other circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances has given a notice of disallowance to take effect from 7 October unless new regulations are made (copy of the letter of 17 September is attached).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To give effect to the Committee's decision, Regulation 20 should be repealed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A new regulation 20 should be substituted which provides that subsection 92(1) of the Australian Postal Corporation Act does not apply in relation to a disclosure made by a person:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">where the disclosure is of the name or address of  another person; and</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the disclosure takes place during the period that the trial is being conducted in Queensland from 1 July 1992 to 30 September 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Such a provision would enable Australia Post to continue to operate its trial National Change of Address Scheme in Queensland under Regulations until such period as legislation can be brought forward into the Autumn sittings of Parliament to enable the results of the scheme to be assessed in consultation with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Minister</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your letter of 6 October 1992 on aspects raised by the Committee of the Australian Postal Corporation Regulations, Statutory Rules 1992 No. 132. Because of your expeditious response, the Committee did not need to take the action in the Chamber foreshadowed in its letter of 17 September, and was thus able to give further consideration to the matter at its meeting of 8 October.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has noted the drafting instructions attached to your letter, which appear to meet its requirements, subject to the following clarifications:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)The Committee would appreciate further advice on the proposal to extend the trial of the National Change of Address Scheme in Queensland from 31 January 1993 to 30 September 1993. This is dealt with to some extent in paragraph 6 of your letter, but we would like more information about the reasons for the proposal for the scheme now to finish not before the Autumn sittings 1993 commence, but rather well into the Budget sittings 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)We would also be grateful for your assurance that the expression "specific prior consent" in the drafting instructions for the NCOA Scheme is intended to bear its plain meaning and that it is not intended to require people to "opt out" of the trial. We share the same concerns about this as the Privacy Commissioner.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee assumes that it is these instructions, and the attendant draft, which have been referred to and accepted by the Privacy Commissioner, as mentioned in paragraph 4 of your letter. The Committee notes, however, that the drafting instructions do not reflect the matters raised in paragraphs 7, 8, 9 and 10 of your letter, dealing with disclosure other than for the NCOA Scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As you are aware, the Committee's primary concern as discussed with your officers at the hearing of 10 September was the inclusion of such broadly-based provisions in delegated rather than primary legislation. The Committee notes that these were also the concerns of the Privacy Commissioner. It was the Committee's intention at that time that only the provisions relating to the continuation of the NCOA Scheme should be the subject of new regulations and that all other matters be included in primary legislation to be dealt with during the Autumn sittings. The Committee is thus unclear as to the intentions conveyed in paragraphs 7 to 10 to your letter, and as to whether these matters too have been laid before the Privacy Commissioner for consideration. Our unease was increased by the comments in the letter which appeared to indicate that information about addresses or ownership of post office boxes was less important than the contents of mail. The Committee is concerned that this view may not demonstrate an awareness of the potential for such information to give rise to domestic violence or other criminal violence, and expresses its disquiet.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As you are aware, the Committee continues to have a notice of disallowance on the Notice Paper. It appreciates that there may be some difficulty in re-making the regulations to accord with the drafting instructions while the notice is still in place. However, given the concerns the Committee has about the possible additions or amendments to the regulations, the Committee intends to take no action to withdraw the notice until the above matters are clarified. On behalf of the Committee, I therefore ask that you respond to the matters raised not later than Tuesday afternoon, 13 October 1992, to enable it to consider the matter at its next meeting.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CANBERRA ACT 2600</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator Loosley</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your letter of 8 October 1992 concerning disclosure of address information under the Australian Postal Corporation Regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has sought clarification on a number of matters related to Australia Post's Queensland trial of the National Change of Address (NCOA) Scheme and disclosure of information for law enforcement purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I indicated in my letter of 6 October 1992, the earliest that amendments to the Australian Postal Corporation Act 1989 could be made would be the 1993 Autumn sittings of Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the regulations were to be sunsetted on 31 January 1993, there would be a minimum gap of two to three months (perhaps more if current legislative priorities alter significantly, or if the Autumn 1993 sittings were interrupted) before the passage of primary legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia Post advises that if this were the case, it would suffer financial detriment because it would be unable to provide continuity of service to individual customers and to its corporate clients participating in the trial scheme. Australia Post's has a significant investment (around $1 million) in training and network system configuration that would be reduced in value if the trial process was halted prematurely. In addition, the employment of thirteen casual staff would be terminated if the trial concluded in January 1993, with the prospect of a further five staff requiring redeployment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, because the new regulation will make clear that positive consent by an individual is required, Australia Post advises that the NCOA form will need to be modified for the trial period. (The use of the term "express consent" used in the drafting instructions, is intended to bear its plain meaning and is not intended to require people to "opt out" of the trial). There will thus need to be a further period of evaluation in view of the new form, and to enable consultation with the Privacy Commissioner on the effectiveness of the trial.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A sufficient period of time therefore needs to be provided so that any modifications can be properly assessed. I understand that the Office of the Privacy Commissioner has indicated that the operation of the trial to 30 September 1993 provides a reasonable trial period in which to assess the service. The extension of the trial to 30 September 1993 does not preclude legislation being introduced and passed earlier.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to disclosure of address information for law enforcement purposes, I note the Committee's concerns in relation to the privacy implications of proposed disclosure of information for law enforcement purposes. The issues raised in paragraphs 7 to 10 of my letter of 6 October relating to disclosure of information for law enforcement purposes were canvassed with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner. The views of the Privacy Commissioner will be sought in the drafting of the proposed regulations. I note however, that the proposal is consistent with the exceptions set out in the Information Privacy Principles relating to criminal law enforcement and protection of public revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In my view, it can be argued that a distinction should be made between the disclosure of the contents of mail and other information such as the ownership of post office boxes. However, in terms of intrusion into individuals' private dealings, I note and appreciate the Committee's concern about the need to control strictly the release of information about addresses or ownership of post office boxes. The Privacy Act complaint procedures would apply to disclosures made under this provision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In particular, it is important to note that any disclosure would only be authorised to authorities with responsibility for criminal and related law enforcement, as well as to ASIO. I am advised that section 93A of the Australian Security Intelligence Organization Act 1979 removes disclosure by all Commonwealth agencies to ASIO from the operation of the Privacy Act 1988. Proposals for disclosure to ASIO are therefore consistent with the Privacy Act. I understand that the Privacy Commissioner does not oppose this view.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, I am advised that the Privacy Commissioner will have supervision over the disclosure of information including the contents of mail (which will only be disclosed where authorised under the requirements of a Commonwealth law or a search warrant). I also note that the agencies likely to make use of this provision have strict internal and often legislatively based disciplinary controls over the unauthorised use and disclosure of information.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Federal Police (AFP) and ASIO have advised that access to this information is essential in assisting in the identification of people in groups involved in criminal or national security related activities. One obvious application in the Commonwealth area is in the investigation of drug trafficking. In relation to State and Territory authorities such a disclosure provision could also be extremely useful in investigating for example, paedophile groups exchanging information about the availability of children and child pornography.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Privacy Commissioner will be consulted on the drafting of the proposed regulation. The matters set out in paragraphs 7 to 10 of my 6 October letter have already been raised with him.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I intend that the proposed regulations include requirements that each disclosure be recorded and that the disclosed information be treated confidentially by the agency to which it is released. In addition, I propose that a sunset clause be included in any regulations authorising access to information for law enforcement purposes, while primary legislation is developed. Because the legislation will need to be developed in consultation with State and Territory authorities I would propose that the regulations be made for a 12 month period to allow time for adequate consultation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Representatives from the law enforcement and national security agencies have offered to provide in camera evidence to the Committee, should this be considered useful. It should be noted that law enforcement matters relate primarily to the portfolio responsibilities of the Attorney-General and the Minister for Justice, and I would propose to seek their views before such witnesses could be made available to the Committee.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Commissioner</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has been examining the Australian Postal Regulations (Amendment) (Statutory Rules 1992 No. 132) concerning disclosure of information. The Committee had such concerns about the regulations that it asked officers of the department of Transport and Communications to appear before it, to explain the reasons for making them. A proof transcript of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">in camera</EMPHASIS> hearing, which the Committee has authorised for release to you and the relevant officer or officers of the Commission, is enclosed for your consideration. The Committee reminds you that the evidence may not be divulged to any other person without further authorisation from the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You will note, from page 61 of the transcript, that the departmental officers offered to provide a copy of your advice to the Committee, in response to questions about the level of consultation with you. The Committee has further noted, after receiving a copy of your letter of 7 July, that you made strenuous criticisms of the already extant regulations, criticisms which, as you will observe from the matters the Committee raised with the officers, were shared by the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yesterday, the Committee gave a protective notice of disallowance, to enable it to give further consideration to the regulations and to consult you about them. I enclose the relevant <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> extract for your information. The Committee would appreciate any comments you may have but, specifically, it would be interested to establish from you:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)when and how you discovered the existence of the regulations;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)when you received the request for advice in respect of the regulations, referred to in the first paragraph of your letter; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c)whether as yet you have been in touch with the relevant Minister. If so, when, and is it possible for your advice to be made available to the Committee?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the Committee wishes to resolve the matter during the next sitting week, commencing 6 October, your urgent advice would be appreciated.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have forwarded a copy of this letter to the Minister for Land Transport, the Hon. R.J. Brown, with whom the Committee is corresponding on the matter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yours sincerely</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator Loosley</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your letter of 17 September l992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As to the three questions that you raise:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"(a)when and how you discovered the existence of the regulations;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">My office was notified on 26 May l992 by the Department that it was considering amending the regulations. It provided its draft text. It requested comment by the next day, 27 May. Preliminary comments were provided as requested; and a detailed response was given on 7 July. Both letters are enclosed.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">My office received no further advice from the Department as to whether it intended to proceed with its draft regulations. So, I was a little surprised to discover that the regulations had in fact been tabled.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"(b)when you received the request for advice in respect of the regulations, referred to in the first paragraph of your letter;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">See my answer to (a) above.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"(c)whether as yet you have been in touch with the relevant Minister. If so, when, and is it possible for your advice to be made available to the Committee?</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">No, I did not proceed to contact the relevant Minister. I might have done so had I been aware that the regulations were proceeding.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I should add that I received, on 14 September, a letter dated l0 September from the Department making further comments in respect of my letter of 7 July 1992. I also enclose a copy of that letter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have now received from the Department a copy of its proposed revised draft regulation, designed to enable the national Change-of-Address trial occurring in Queensland to continue. I will be indicating to the Department that I have no difficulty with the proposed text of the regulation. I will also be indicating to the Department that I do have difficulty with the view that the customer "consent" to the disclosure is adequately met by the relevant clauses contained in the address form currently in use. For information I attach a copy of the form currently in use with the clauses about which I am concerned marked.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have, on a number of occasions, expressed my concern to Australia Post over its reliance on presumed consent which can be withdrawn through an "opt-out" facility which requires the individual to write "do not authorise". If it is thought that such an arrangement is sufficient to constitute "consent" for the purposes of this regulation, then I may wish to put proposals for tightening of the regulation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If you wish to contact my office to discuss this issue the relevant officer is Mr Nigel Waters, Head, Privacy Branch, (telephone 02 229 7665).</PARA>

<PARA>What has become apparent during the last several days and what has come out of the disclosure in relation to the unsatisfactory nature of the Victorian loans affair, as it has become known, is that the issue is much broader than this. The whole conduct of the Australian Loan Council with respect to the records which are kept by State governments and made available between State governments and between the State governments and the Commonwealth is totally unsatisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday two Treasury officers came before the Democrat party room, and with respect to material which appeared as supplements to the Budget Papers made statements to the effect that the figures which are provided by the States are so unreliable that they would place no confidence in them whatsoever. Indeed, the officers went on to imply that over some time they had given general advice to successive Treasurers that perhaps it would be better not to publish them at all because there was so little confidence in those figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also have the situation from June until the present time, well referenced in letters between the Federal Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) and the former Victorian Government, in relation to the matter of almost $1.3 billion worth of loans. The indications are that throughout the whole of that time the Federal Government and the State Government of Victoria had a different view with respect to whether those loans fell within or outside the terms of the Loan Council. We have learnt only since last night, when Mr Kennett came to Canberra and spoke with the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Treasurer, that indeed those loans of $1.3 billion should not have been entered into and should have been included within declarations made by the Victorian Government to the Loan Council and, through the Loan Council, to other governments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that the Loan Council handles large amounts of money, running into billions of dollars, and given that this country is in dire financial straits, with debts running in excess of $150 billion, it is absolutely staggering to learn that the conduct of a major part of this country's financial arrangements is left with a council best described as an old boys' network which operates in a nudge nudge, wink wink way without any proper legislative backing. Indeed, the hands of the Federal Treasurer, who one might have thought had some overall responsibility for the financial health of this country, are largely tied when it comes to obtaining information which would allow him or her, as the case might be, to find out whether loans&mdash;and in this case, loans of $1.3 billion&mdash;were inside or outside the global limits. That situation is totally unsatisfactory, particularly when we have this very large and growing foreign debt hanging over our heads. It is clearly one which needs to be addressed and tightened up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are of a view that clearly there must have been a presumption over some months on the part of Treasury and the Federal Treasurer that the $1.3 billion did fall within the ambit of the Loan Council, that it should therefore have been taken into account, and that Victoria should have been brought into line earlier in a similar way to the way in which the former Federal Treasurer, now the Prime Minister, brought Queensland into line when Mr Ahern threatened to go outside the limits of the Loan Council. Putting the best complexion on it, the Treasurer claims that he could not be sure, even up until yesterday, whether even a single dollar of that money was actually passed on to the private sector&mdash;that it was not all held within the public sector&mdash;therefore falling outside the ambit of the Loan Council. That situation is quite intolerable and we believe it needs to be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now that we know that the $1.3 billion does fall within the ambit of the Loan Council, the following question, which I put earlier today, can be validly asked: what assurance and certainty did the Federal Treasurer have earlier on and before the Budget about whether that $1.3 billion was within or outside the Loan Council arrangements? Back in June was he already 90 per cent certain that he was dealing with something which fell outside the Loan Council arrangements? If he was reasonably certain&mdash;and I think the evidence now points to the fact that he could have been reasonably certain at that time&mdash;in our view he should have taken a much stronger action with respect to the misdemeanour of the Victorian Government. As also indicated at Question Time today, he could have insisted that a footnote be put in the Budget Papers and that much stronger letters be written to the Victorian Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not wish to pursue that matter in isolation because we believe that the matters are much more serious than that and really go to the heart of the whole functioning of the Loan Council itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Federal Treasurer, Mr Dawkins, has said&mdash;and indeed the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button) this afternoon repeated in Question Time&mdash;that at a meeting in December the Loan Council will be beginning its own inquiry into how better to manage its affairs. We find this approach quite unsatisfactory. It really is Caesar judging Caesar. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Loan Council is an `in' group; it is a cosy little group. We believe that it is quite naive for the Federal Treasurer, or indeed anybody, to expect that the State Premiers will impose upon themselves the sorts of sanctions that clearly, in our view, need to be imposed upon them. It remains to be seen whether this is done by a much tighter agreement on the definition of what falls inside and outside loans, the way in which loans can be raised, the reporting procedures, or whether it needs legislative control. But appropriately that should be done in a much more open way than within the confines of the Loan Council itself. So we believe that the Federal Treasurer's proposal, good as it might be, simply does not go far enough; it needs to go very much further. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Addressing the other aspect involving the confidence that the public can have in the Loan Council and in the markets, one finds an enormous degree of inconsistency in the Treasurer's remarks. On the one hand, the Treasurer seems to have claimed, as I think Senator Button claimed again this afternoon, that to release information before there was a solution in place would destabilise the markets by decreasing confidence in the Australian dollar, would increase interest rates, and would make people generally less confident in the operation of the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, we find that Mr Dawkins himself is writing to Mr Fahey suggesting in fairly strong terms that there be a continuous process of disclosure to the Loan Council by the various States. Clearly, under such a process those disclosures would occur before any ameliorating processes were put in place at all. Yet the Treasurer in his letter to Mr Fahey is claiming that that disclosure procedure would lead to greater confidence in the operation of the system and greater certainty in the way in which the markets responded to the information which was disclosed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasurer cannot have it both ways. If we look at evidence of concealment, we see that Mr David Parker, who was a Minister in the Western Australian Government during the Rothwell's scandal and with particular reference to the petrochemical industry in Western Australia, said&mdash;and I understand this is a direct quote&mdash;that concealment was `a necessary technique used by all governments'. That seems to be the name of the game over there. One can only point to what happened in Western Australia where concealment led to a much worse situation eventually when the facts came out, with a very great loss of confidence in both the Government and the administrative processes of Western Australia, quite apart from any effects on the economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not believe concealment is warranted. We feel that concealment for any time at all leads eventually to corruption and further corruption, and then eventually to greater destabilisation of the market. So we certainly would support the Treasurer to the extent that he is arguing for greater disclosure by the States one to another and by the Commonwealth to the States through the Loan Council so that the whole process by which loans are raised, the amounts of those loans and their purposes are much more clearly understood. That would indeed lead to a great deal more confidence in the process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I reiterate that to expect that the Loan Council members themselves are actually going to undertake that sort of restructuring of the Loan Council is really cloud-cuckoo-land; I do not think it will happen. It is something that needs to be pressed for from outside the Loan Council through the sorts of processes of a Senate inquiry, which is now being addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a couple of other issues I would like to just throw in here because, while they have not yet been raised, we in the Democrats think that they are relevant. The Victorian situation appears to have arisen, to some extent at least, because of the building of another power station, the Loy Yang power station. We are aware that other States have also got into problems&mdash;or potentially might get into problems&mdash;with the building of new power stations. In discussions yesterday the proposed coal-fired power station at Collie was mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been a source of continual upset and disappointment to the Australian Democrats that the record in relation to the building of more power stations and the effect that they have on the State debts and the national debts has been evident for some time. I do not have a current figure but not so long ago the figure for the amount owed by State  electricity utilities around Australia amounted to $26 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is abundant evidence, both within Australia and from overseas, that we do not need to build more power stations; that we can in fact achieve a greater level of energy security if we pursue more vigorously the energy efficiency path. Indeed, it was one of the subjects that came out of the greenhouse reference to the Industry, Science and Technology Committee of this Senate and it also came out very clearly in the ESD process. What is required is for the Federal Government, again, to take firm control of an energy policy for Australia, an energy policy which is built around conservation and the more conservative and wiser use of electricity&mdash;a very expensive form of energy. Had that happened, some of these problems&mdash;and I stress the word `some'&mdash;may not have arisen in relation to foreign debt. A very considerable saving can be made should that procedure be followed. I urge again that the Government revisit the greenhouse committee report and the ESD committee recommendations in relation to the lack of need to build more power stations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite conceivable that in the very near future Queensland will be in a similar situation with respect to the Loan Council. In the last week that I was up there during the last fortnight break I found that the North Queensland Electricity Board wants to extend the grid into Far North Queensland up into the Daintree at an enormous cost per consumer&mdash;money which is simply going to be wasted because there are far better and far cheaper alternatives. It is about time this Federal Government developed and imposed on the States a far more sensible and rational national energy policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other matter to which I turn is the advice which was given to the Federal Treasurer by Treasury and on which the Treasurer very solidly depended in relation to the Victorian loans affair. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Treasurer could make a public announcement regarding Victoria's breach of the Loan Council arrangements and distancing the Commonwealth from Victorian borrowing arrangements. However, this could have (unpredictable) adverse market consequences in respect of Victoria's debt.</PARA>
<PARA>We accept that, given that advice, it was reasonable that the Treasurer behaved in the way he did. However, in view of the reasonable certainty that he had that that $1.3 billion was inside the Loan Council arrangements, we believe that it would have been more appropriate for the Federal Treasurer to have been tougher in his approach to Victoria. That is our judgment, and it is one from which, clearly, one can differ; but our judgment is that he should have been much firmer with respect to that matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation, of course, is now desperate with respect to Victoria. Again, I just reiterate that had the Minister taken action much earlier, of course, we would not be in this situation. We believe that a Federal Senate inquiry is an appropriate way of dealing with this; it is a public and open way of dealing with it. That is far more appropriate than the Loan Council internal inquiry suggested by the Treasurer, and we think that this should be proceeded with as rapidly as possible. Accordingly, and in view of the very heavy legislative program we are now facing, we have suggested a reporting date of 1 March next year, which we think will allow the Committee, through the Christmas break, to deal adequately with this matter&mdash;to call the witnesses and to report. We hope that out of that we will be able to really put some cement into this very loose hole which now lies right at the very heart of the whole financial administration of this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak in support of the motion moved by Senator Coulter, and I will come back to that in a moment. The reason why I have pleasure in supporting that motion is that it enables consideration of what is without any doubt, in the coalition's view, a major conspiracy between the Keating Government and the previous Kirner Labor Government in Victoria&mdash;a conspiracy to conceal the truth from the electors of Victoria, from other Premiers and Chief Ministers of the States and Territories of Australia, and from the financial markets of Australia&mdash;and, therefore, for all of those reasons, a conspiracy to conceal the truth from all Australians about a matter that goes to the core of proper government in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the Keating Government and the former Victorian Labor Government have done was to gravely damage the credibility and integrity of the Loan Council, a body which is absolutely crucial to the orderly functioning of financial markets in Australia and which, as a result of that, is absolutely crucial to the functioning of the Australian economy, the growth of the Australian economy, the provision of jobs for Australians and the growth of our export markets. Everything that happens in the Australian economy has a relevance to the functions of the financial markets in Australia, and the operation of the financial markets in Australia can be efficient and effective only if those financial markets have confidence and can trust the basic financial institutions, particularly those financial institutions of government&mdash;and the Loan Council is perhaps the most central of those financial institutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have seen quite clearly from the material that has come out up to date is that Mr Keating&mdash;both as Prime Minister and in his former capacity of Treasurer, but particularly in recent months as Prime Minister&mdash;and his Treasurer, Mr Dawkins, were parties to this conspiracy. There is no less weight, no less result, that can attach to the evidence that has already been revealed. It appears from his answers to questions in the Senate today&mdash;and I must express amazement at this&mdash;that the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Button, is arguably a party to that conspiracy as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Button told the Senate today that he knew in July of this year about the matter, at least to the extent that the Government&mdash;of which he is the third most senior member&mdash;had communicated with the Victorian Government about the breaching of the global limits. For Senator Button to say as he did in Question Time today that he did not know anything more about it until it all broke in the last few days&mdash;I am glad to see Senator Button here in the chamber&mdash;is, quite frankly, something that boggles the imagination in its credibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Who else knew about this? We have a pretty senior Federal Minister from Victoria in the form of Mr Willis. He, after all, is the Minister for Finance of this country. He, along with Mr Dawkins as the Treasurer, are the double responsible for the economic management of this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As my friend Senator Parer points out, we had another notable Victorian&mdash;I will come back to this a little later on&mdash;in the form of Mr Jim Cairns who had one or more fingers in pies of this nature in times gone by. What did Mr Willis know about the matters that are of such grave concern as to have led to the motion for the establishment of this committee? Mr Willis is one Minister above most others who has not yet disclosed his hand and who really does need to come clean about what he knew about this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Mr Willis knew about the illegal breaching of guidelines by the Victorian Government, then he stands indicted of conspiracy to defraud the Australian people along with the Prime Minister and the Treasurer. If he did not know, then it is an even greater indictment of Treasurer Dawkins for not having communicated with his key colleague on the economic and financial management of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the brief background to the reasons why the coalition supports this motion before us today. Indeed, the motion is a welcome response to the coalition's call late last week for the establishment of just such a committee. It was the proposal initially of the coalition, particularly of my friend and colleague the shadow Treasurer, Mr Peter Reith, that there be a Senate select committee established to deal with this matter. Ideally, we would have liked to see a joint parliamentary committee with representatives from both the House and the Senate, but that was obviously never going to be on since the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the Government's acolytes in the House would under no circumstances allow the establishment of such a joint committee as they have been spending the last few months doing all they could to conceal the truth of this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So a Senate select committee is the only way we can go, and we welcome that. It is by no means a second choice, although it would have been better, of course, to have had a joint parliamentary committee. But Senate select committees in the past have performed very important roles indeed, and I have no doubt that this committee will do the same. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put it on the record that, following discussions within the coalition late last week, I raised the matter on Saturday with Senator Kernot, the Treasury spokesperson for the Democrats. Some suggested broad terms of reference were provided to the Democrats. The matter has since evolved in that we had very useful and valuable discussions with the Democrats yesterday. As a result of those discussions, this motion has come forward, and I welcome the positive response of the Democrats to the initiative of the coalition for the establishment of this committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw attention to the fact that there is a 1 March 1993 reporting date. We would wish the committee to start its work immediately. The terms of reference for the committee provide in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the committee may report from time to time its proceedings and evidence taken or any interim conclusions or recommendations arising from its inquiry, and may make regular reports on the progress of its proceedings.</PARA>
<PARA>I hope the committee will quickly commence its work and provide the Parliament and, indeed, the Australian people with progress reports on its activities and findings. A great deal of information may still emerge. We have only found the information available to us now by drawing it out tooth by tooth in the last couple of weeks. The Government was not going to disclose anything. Then it trickled out a few papers. We pressed the matter further and it was forced to trickle out a few more papers, and it has gone on and on. The material we have before us now is the result of about half a dozen separate extractions from the Government of material. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Heaven only knows what else is still to come. One thing of which we can be sure is that we have probably only scratched the tip of the iceberg in terms of the information about this matter. How much more has been covered up? I do not know how much more has been covered up. No-one knows how much more has been covered up&mdash;with the probable exception of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer. They are the chief conspirers. It is absolutely vital that this committee do all it can to draw out that further information. I put the Government and the officials of government&mdash;both at the Federal and, I hope, at the State level&mdash;on notice that we will be expecting the fullest and frankest disclosure and presentation of material to the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The motion goes further than just the Victorian debacle, conspiracy, of recent months. It is a conspiracy that has in fact been going on for about three years now. Without getting into too much detail, the simple point is that short term, temporary borrowings by a State government are excluded from the guidelines and the requirements of the Loan Council. The Loan Council relates basically to the medium and long term borrowings that States agree each year in trust and confidence with each other in meeting with the Commonwealth to borrow for the ensuing year. It now transpires that the Victorian Government, as long ago as 1987-88, has been borrowing on a short term basis but continually rolling over those short term borrowings so that those short term borrowings have become in fact long term borrowings. In that sense, it has been breaching the guidelines of the Loan Council for all that period of time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the truly monumental conspiracy arose this year with the conversion by the Victorian Government of the short term borrowings of $1.3 billion&mdash;we are talking not about bikkies here but about huge sums of money&mdash;without telling anyone, although the Commonwealth eventually found out that it had converted to medium and long term debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The matter was not raised, as was required, at the Loan Council meeting on 12 June. Figures were not submitted to that meeting. They were submitted to the Federal Treasury five days later, on 17 June. But the Treasurer did not raise the potentiality of a breach when he was alerted by the Treasury, by his own advisers, in March of this year or when he had concern expressed to him by the then New South Wales Premier Greiner in April of this year. He did not even respond to then Premier Greiner's letter of concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this point let me welcome very warmly indeed the call by the Acting Treasurer of New South Wales, Mr Wal Murray, today for precisely the type of Senate inquiry that we are now in the process of establishing. New South Wales has seen what can happen when States do not play fairly or openly with each other, when the Commonwealth engages in conspiracies with particular States to hide the truth from other States. New South Wales has seen it at first hand. Queensland has seen it at first hand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The remarkable and disgraceful thing is the double standards of hypocrisy regarding the Keating Government's treatment of this matter and its treatment of Queensland in 1988, when Queensland sought to borrow beyond the borrowing guidelines and the global limit&mdash;borrowings sought frankly and openly from the Commonwealth Government&mdash;and was refused. Indeed, the Commonwealth passed an Act to amend the Financial Agreements Act to stop Queensland from doing so. That was, of course, a non-Labor government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet we have Labor's mates in Victoria, the Kirner Government, desperately anxious to try to survive the unsurvivable&mdash;which was the last election result in Victoria&mdash;being assisted in every way possible by Prime Minister Keating, Treasurer Dawkins, and the other conspirators here in Canberra. The double standards and the hypocrisy that mark the difference between those two are absolutely incredible. I remind the Senate again of the Queensland situation in May 1988, when Paul Keating was then Treasurer Keating and when the Queensland Government wanted to borrow outside the guidelines. As I say, the Commonwealth was then prepared to insert a special clause into the State's Financial Agreements Bill to prevent it doing so. At that time Treasurer Keating said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the national interest it cannot accept that any State can seek to take financial advantage contrary to the benefit of the nation as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA>If Treasurer Keating believed that in 1988, when the then Queensland Government came forward openly and honestly, how on earth can he live with his conscience or credibility with the situation over the last six months, where he has deliberately worked and conspired with the Victorian Government to conceal the truth from the Australian people, from the Victorian electors just before the Victorian election, and from all the other States? Not only that&mdash;he did it in a way where he fiddled the books, where he provided a Commonwealth Budget which did not have the necessary explanatory footnotes to keep that Budget honest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Prime Minister and Treasurer fiddled the presentation of the 1992 Budget and they have been caught out, how do we know how many other fiddles in that Budget there may well be? We have never been able to trust the arithmetic of this Government. It has never got it right. Now we find we cannot even trust its honesty in attempting to get its figures right. That is a dreadful indictment of the Government. It is a matter of the gravest concern because it means that no longer can the electorate, can financial markets&mdash;either here or overseas&mdash;or can the economy have any faith that what is in the Budget is honest, that it is the full truth and nothing but the truth. If one cannot have faith and confidence in what is presented in the Budget documents, if one cannot have faith that they were honestly put together, even though they may be wrong, with the best will in the world, then the consequences for our nation are really very grave indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been argued, and Senator Coulter picked this up in his comments, by the Government and by some in the media, some of whom have been sufficiently gullible to go along with this line&mdash;fortunately, a lot of others have been much more responsible&mdash;that the Government's concealing the truth of what it did was necessary to enable markets to have confidence and not to be unsettled. Could one ever find a more monstrous distortion of reality? We have seen it happen before. I come back to Jim Cairns and the events of 1974 and 1975. Do honourable senators know what Prime Minister Whitlam said at the start of the Khemlani loans affair? I think Senator Button was around in those days. He looks as though he is going to be here for two conspiracies by one of his governments in his lifetime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Button knows what Gough Whitlam said. He said that we cannot provide the material because the markets will lose confidence&mdash;`We cannot tell them about the Khemlani affair because the markets will lose confidence'. Look what happened as a result of that. Look what happened to Australia. Look what happened to the Whitlam Government&mdash;thank heavens&mdash;as a result of it. Those events set Australia's place in the world and its reputation in the world back by, I would say, a period of time which has not yet even been erased. We are still suffering from the consequences, the events, the distortions, the untruths, the concealments and the conspiracies of that time. Markets can operate efficiently and effectively only on the basis of full knowledge and full trust and confidence. If they do not have that, then there is no way that markets can provide the basis for an effective, competitive, growing economy that is so essential for the well-being of each and every Australian. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet we have the actions of the Victorian Government which have concealed the true situation in Victoria. Premier Jeff Kennett and his team have inherited a situation which they knew was going to be bad&mdash;they made no bones about it&mdash;prior to the election. But they inherited a situation which exceeded their wildest anticipations of what could have been the worst scenario. They inherited a State which is absolutely bankrupt as a result of the actions of a Labor Government which was great mates with this Federal Government right throughout its nine or 10 years in office, a government which this Federal Government went out of its way to try to protect and nurture right along the way, knowing full well that it was a rotten and corrupt and improper government. </PARA>

What is the spirit of the Loan Council arrangements? This is well described in a public document that has been made available by the Secretary to the Treasury. In that document, he refers to the Commonwealth Treasury providing the secretariat of the Loan Council and contacting States about various matters. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These discussions are based on a perceived need for mutual cooperation rather than any sense that the Commonwealth Treasury has an auditing role over State finances.

Where is the accountability in respect of that company? We do not hear much about that from members of the Liberal Party, and for very obvious reasons&mdash;it was presided over by the President of their party. So when we talk about accountability on these issues we have to not build it up too much in our enthusiasm to establish what Senator Jim Short has originally called a conspiracy.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of issues have been raised in passing, some of them by Senator Coulter. There is a comparison sought to be drawn between events in Queensland in 1988 and the present situation which has developed in Victoria. What happened in Queensland was that the Premier of Queensland announced publicly that he was going to take on the Loan Council arrangements, which I referred to in the letter from the Secretary of Treasury, and he was going to break them. The Commonwealth Treasurer, as Chairman of the Loan Council and custodian of those arrangements, said, `You are not going to break them'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The different situation in Victoria is simply this: in response to a series of inquisitions and a series of interrogatories of the Victorian Government from the Commonwealth Treasurer, as custodian of the Loan Council arrangements, he did not get answers. He did not get the correct answers, and that is the difference between what developed in Queensland and what developed in the State of Victoria. I do not think we want to spend too much time on that point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point is this confusion about short term borrowings and medium term borrowings, which has been raised by a number of speakers. It does appear that the Victorian Government of the time sought to characterise some of these borrowings as short term borrowings which would be rolled over quickly. When one talks about the global limitations of borrowings by the States, one is talking about the figure which they have to arrive at as at 30 June this year&mdash;the end of the financial year. If the Victorian Government was rolling over short term borrowings beyond 30 June in each year, then of course they begin to take on the character of medium term borrowings and from that they become subject to Loan Council discipline. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the confusion which the Victorian Government has presented to other governments and the Commonwealth Government in relation to this matter; a confusion between short term borrowings continually rolled over, and medium term borrowings which are, of course, subject to the global limitations and Loan Council discipline. </PARA>

In these matters the Commonwealth has a responsibility to act sensibly in the national interest and not rush in and create situations which are detrimental to the national interest in terms of financial management.

It is only in the last few years that this Commonwealth Government has started to lean on the States for better accountability, better reporting, better responses in terms of government business enterprises and so on.

The former Queensland Premier, Mike Ahern, said that he was unhappy with the limitation on the global borrowings and he proposed to breach it. That was immediately followed by a press statement from then Treasurer Keating saying that if that were the case, the general grants legislation in respect of Queensland would be reduced by the amount to which he exceeded the agreed upon global limit. As if his threat was not enough, he then introduced legislation specifically aimed at Queensland which said precisely that; to the extent that the Queensland Government exceeded its global limit, its general grants would be reduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This time Mr Dawkins could have introduced legislation, because he knew about it in June.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A Federal Labor Government has been in office for almost 10 years and it has allowed massive foreign debts to be run up.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to reflect on an editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS> that was published on Monday this week; I am sure that Senator Cook will be particularly interested in it.

<PARA>I put to you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that there was a major cover-up in order to attempt to protect the discredited Kirner Government. No objective observer who has surveyed the record has endorsed the limp-wristed actions of the Treasurer, Mr Dawkins, apparently with the approval and support of Mr Keating and Senator Button, and probably with Mr Willis as well. These men were involved in a disgraceful cover-up&mdash;an affair which has been likened appropriately, in my view, to the disgraceful loans affair of 1975. One issue that Senator Button tried to raise in his remarks was that of confidentiality&mdash;that it was important that this matter be kept under cover until a solution was established and could be released. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to read what, for example, the Executive Director of the Macquarie Bank, Mr Garry Burrell, said on the confidentiality issue. It ties in with the remarks of Senator Crichton-Browne. Mr Burrell said this:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And by not informing the other members of Loan Council about this breach of Loan Council global limits, the Treasurer has committed one of the greatest improprieties of the global limit arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA>I repeat those remarks of Dr David Chessell:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Treasurer has committed one of the greatest improprieties of the global limit arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA>That is why I believe it is important to have this select committee established. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to fully investigate this disgraceful affair. As Senator Coulter pointed out, it is important that we look carefully at the arrangements which have governed the Loan Council to date to see whether new and improved arrangements can be put in place to avoid the catastrophe which has befallen my home State as a result of the disgraceful mismanagement of the Cain and Kirner Labor governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The need to retain confidentiality is an argument which will ring loudly to those who were involved in the investigations of the disgraceful 1975 Khemlani loans affair, which again directly involved another Labor Government. It is interesting that, on 13 February 1975, the notorious Rex Connor used exactly the same type of arguments that Senator Button put to this chamber today. Rex Connor said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I noticed a report concerning this matter in one metropolitan journal. Matters relating to the currency, loans and the commercial credit of the nation should be handled with the utmost discretion. I am acting accordingly.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the need to retain confidentiality to protect the currency was the argument which was used time and time again by Rex Connor until there was a full expose of the disgraceful borrowing activities of senior members of that Labor Government. Former Prime Minister Whitlam, running a similar line about the need for confidentiality, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I will give the same answer to him as he would have given to any question directed to him while he was Treasurer or Prime Minister on matters concerning the credit of our country. Open government has never applied in respect of loans or valuations of the currency.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe it is important that we establish this select committee and that we get the chance to look at all the issues involved. One issue which will be of particular importance is to fully look at all the advice that the Federal Treasury gave to the Treasurer. It is fairly clear, as a result of material which has been selectively put on the public record by Mr Dawkins, that there are a large number of other papers and advices which the Treasury submitted to Mr Dawkins. It will be interesting and important to find out just what those advices were and whether the representation and the `spin', as they say in modern jargon, that Mr Dawkins is trying to give to the Treasury material which has so far been put on the record are correct. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It reminds us of the fact that what happened in Western Australia in the past 10 years should not be allowed to happen again, not only federally but also in any other State in Australia. It is important that parliaments resume their role in scrutinising the role of executive government and enhancing that role wherever possible. It is very important that individual members and senators take their role very seriously in scrutinising the role of the Executive, be they backbench members of the Government or the Opposition. Oppositions generally have a very active role in scrutinising what executive government does because there is a political motivation to do it.

They do not want to have to pick up the newspapers every day and find out what disasters their Premiers, Treasurers and political players are wreaking on the confidence in their nation's economy. It does not help financial markets to have the Labor Party in government which just cannot be trusted to manage money.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Button made a point about the fact that the Loan Council procedures had started to unravel in the last few years. I make what is probably a most partisan political point, and that is that the Loan Council did not have these sorts of problems before we had the Labor Party in government in most of the States and in government here in Canberra. I am referring to the conspiracies, the cover-ups, the stretching of the rules, the breaking of the rules, all of these new financing mechanisms, leasing back trains and doing partial privatisations so that the global borrowing limits guidelines and global borrowing limits agreements had to stretch from only a few pages out to these huge documents, describing all of the interesting financing mechanisms which State governments could use to try to get around the global borrowing limits. This is where this country started getting into trouble. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We started coming into this era of trouble when one had Labor governments doing what they always do best and that is just taxing and spending. When they run out of the will of the people to raise taxes, they start spending and then coming up with new and interesting ways of financing that spending. We have seen that in Western Australia. Senator Cook knows we have seen that in Western Australia where Premier Lawrence came out and said she was going to fund the massive debts for the State of Western Australia, which the poor old taxpayers of Western Australia have to find, by making payments each year to pay back those debts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the first year that she was meant to make a payment for those debts, she brought down in her budget complicated financing methods to show how she was trying to pay this debt back. Within a few hours of analysis of her budget by independent analysts it was found that she had turned equity into debt, debt into equity, changed various borrowings from short to medium term, medium to long term, long term to short term, and used a few complicated financing arrangements basically to cover up the appalling debt of the Western Australian Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the people of Western Australia are not being fooled any more, as the polls will show with the Labor Party over there rating about 34 per cent, the Liberal Party and National Party both polling about 50 per cent, and Premier Lawrence coming over to Canberra last week and saying the Labor Party federally is even worse than that. So the people are not being fooled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the only brake on these political institutions is an election every three years and when one cannot rely on these Labor governments to tell the truth about their financial state, then those elections are not the only way that one can scrutinise government finances. This is what this committee will be looking into. It will be examining the adequacy of the Loan Council functions, the global borrowing limit mechanisms and trying to see the role of the Commonwealth as the chairman of the Loan Council and particularly the role of the current chairman, Mr Dawkins, and his complicity in a cover-up and a conspiracy with his Labor mates in Victoria before their election. </PARA>

They accompanied each other down the hallway in that historic footage, which I will never forget because Senator Crowley was there. I thought,`With advice like Senator Crowley's, he can't go too far wrong'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me remind the Senate of one of the promises the Prime Minister made, and perhaps Senator Crowley whispered it to him as he walked down that hall outside the caucus room. Indeed, I think he made three promises to the Australian people, but I forget the other two and probably the Prime Minister has forgotten them as well. One promise was that he was going to tell the Australian people the truth. He was not going to tell fibs any more; he had given up all that; it had gone out when he ceased to be Treasurer, so he was going to tell the truth. Probably for the first time in his 20 years or more in Parliament, the Prime Minister was going to tell the truth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the Prime Minister, who has admitted that he knew about this loans affair and admitted that he shared that knowledge with the Treasurer, was also complicit in covering this up and, indeed, in not telling the truth. So it is no surprise to me that he has broken one of his promises; I have forgotten the other two. Maybe Senator Crowley can tell me what they are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Kemp made the important point as to what the people of Australia must remember when they go to the ballot boxes, whenever that election may be in the next few months.

It has been proved in Western Australia, Victoria, South Australia and, with one million people unemployed, massive foreign debt and now this 1975 Khemlani style loans cover-up saga with the Treasurer and the Prime Minister intimately involved, clearly one cannot trust this Labor Government in Canberra. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have noticed, Mr Acting Deputy President, that the only speaker to defend this reprehensible act of Mr Dawkins is Senator Button. Does Mr Dawkins have no friends&mdash;no-one who will stand up and say, `He behaved in an honourable fashion, as an honourable man'? Or is he, like Brutus, without friends? When Senator Short spoke and used the word `conspiracy' there was much debate from Senator Button. A good working definition of `to conspire' is, I think, quite useful in this debate. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Oxford English Dictionary</EMPHASIS> defines it as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To combine in action or aim; . . . To . . . concur, co-operate as by intention . . . </PARA>
<PARA>And that has been the meaning of the word since 1538. A secondary meaning of the word is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To plot . . . devise, contrive . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I think that what has happened in this affair really fits all those working definitions of the term `to conspire'. We saw a conspiracy which saw, prior to the election in Victoria, a cover-up of the fact that the Victorian Government had exceeded its borrowing limits by nearly $1.3 billion. This document&mdash;Budget Paper No. 4&mdash;refers to the gentleman's agreement entered into with regard to the global borrowing approach. It outlines in a nice narrative the way the system works. It has tables that show the reader what those limits are. It shows them as a percentage of State gross domestic product. It gives the reader all sorts of information that would be needed to make a decision about the sorts of instruments and borrowings that were being made in Victoria. And there was a deliberate, knowing omission of the fact that short term borrowings&mdash;the sort we learned about in the Khemlani affair&mdash;had been converted to medium term borrowings and therefore became outside the so-called gentlemen's agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This conspiracy, or knowingly intending to deceive the Australian Parliament and the people, became obvious when Mr Dawkins admitted it from his own mouth in the press conference that he gave on 28 October. I will quote his words. He was asked by a journalist:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Treasurer, did you hide from the Victorian public the fact that their Government was borrowing more than was considered prudent, or wise, or both, and were you forced to release the correspondence in a vain attempt to prove otherwise?</PARA>
<PARA>After a bit of bluster the Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the first time we became aware of the fact that the Victorian Government had exceeded its global borrowing limits was about the middle of June.</PARA>
<PARA>In fact, on 17 June, Treasury was formally apprised. Incidentally, I noticed Senator Button's very interesting dissertation earlier in the day when he tried to say that there had not been any formal notification. I think that a good look at the meaning of the word `formal' will show honourable senators that, when the Director-General of the State Treasury calls on the Treasury of the Federal Government, that is pretty formal. On 17 June that is precisely what happened. Indeed, the Federal Treasury was informed that the guidelines had been broken and that the borrowings were outside the permitted limits. Mr Dawkins himself was formally briefed about this on 6 July. Yet on 18 August the Budget Papers&mdash;I repeat: `circulated by the Honourable John Dawkins, M.P., Treasurer of the Commonwealth of Australia for the information of honourable members on the occasion of the Budget'&mdash;deliberately and knowingly omitted to include that fact. There is plenty of room in the `Notes' section to make reference to it. There is plenty of room in the narrative section to make reference to it. It had to be, and was, a deliberate act not to include it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are discussing here is an inquiry as to how we will remedy this situation. Indeed, it was at the initiative of the Opposition that this inquiry was sought. We are delighted to see the Democrats not only come on board but actually move the motion today and set out very good guidelines whereby we will indeed be able to get at some of the truth of these matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope people will remember that the Democrats have indeed come out and supported the Opposition in its call on this occasion. We are happy that we are in agreement on these terms of reference. The problem we have here is that the Treasurer properly should resign&mdash;or, at worst, just as Gough Whitlam had to sack Jim Cairns, the Prime Minister should sack John Dawkins. But will he? No. Why will he not? Because Mr Keating, too, was complicitous in knowing in advance that the Australian people were to be deceived. To hear the Prime Minister of my nation say on radio, `I had to lie to the Australian people to protect the markets'&mdash;and, by doing so, corrupt the markets&mdash;makes me ashamed. I am ashamed at what is happening to this nation. When people look at the Western Australian experience and try to blame the Westminster system, I say: don't blame the system; blame the people in it; blame the people who let the executive arm of government cosy up with the bureaucracy so that matters could be hidden from the public gaze. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why should we be surprised that the Government&mdash;both Mr Dawkins and Mr Keating&mdash;has acted in this way? Let us take a look at the record and some of the material we have been dealing with recently in another forum. Let us look at the way in which, after the Fitzgerald inquiry began, it asked the Tax Office whether it could have, pursuant to legislation introduced in 1982 by Malcolm Fraser for the purposes of the Costigan and Stewart inquiries, access to tax records. Mr Nolan, a first class officer in the Australian Tax Office, wrote a very proper advice pointing out that there was power under the 1982 legislation to let the Queensland Royal Commission have that information. One of the reasons he thought it should have it was that it could be of benefit to the revenue. However, there was further advice from the Attorney-General which said that the preferred way to go was, in fact, to enact specific legislation to allow that information to be passed on to the Fitzgerald inquiry, stopping section 16 being invoked to protect individuals. But clearly it was his view that there was power under the 1982 legislation to do that. Within one month of that advice being given we had legislation pass through the Parliament, supported on a bipartisan basis in the interests of getting to the truth of matters, and the information was passed to the Fitzgerald inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then, on 12 April 1991, we had a similar occurrence when the Western Australian Royal Commission asked the Tax Office whether it could have similar access to that given to the Fitzgerald inquiry so that it, too, could pursue its inquiries in a proper manner. What was the response? Mr Nolan was not asked for advice this time. Mr Boucher gave the response&mdash;and he gave what can at best be described as a political response. He said that there was no power to give it and that we should protect the privacy of individual taxpayers. Yet within only a week an amendment was made to section 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act which was designed to give access to that material to authorised bodies, which strangely omitted the Western Australian Royal Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A little after that we had a further amendment. But at every stage none of us knew about this at all until one year later when the Western Australian Royal Commission came out and said that it was denied access to this material. At that stage Paul Keating, the then Treasurer, came out and said that he had relied on Mr Boucher's advice. But the matter had been hidden and buried from the public view until the Royal Commission came out and said itself that it was denied access. Yet the reason for giving access remains the same in each case: very simply, there is a benefit to the Commonwealth revenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where was that advice dealt with by Mr Boucher? Funny thing: it was not there. So why should we be surprised that we have seen an utter cover-up of the fact that this debt existed and it is denied in the public published official documents that accompany the Budget Papers and the Budget Bills? It is no good Mr Dawkins and Mr Keating saying, `It might have been published somewhere else or someone else might have alluded to it'&mdash;no good; irrelevant. This is material published by Mr Dawkins for the information of honourable members on the occasion of the Budget deliberately misleading the Parliament. Do not blame the Westminster system for failing; blame the people in it. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Button cited Elders Finance as an example of the private debt, which he thought the coalition was unconcerned about, compared with the Victorian Government's debt. Whether it is Elders Finance or the State Government, both have exhibited the excesses of deregulation which have resulted in this debt of $150 billion. Let us not lose sight of the fact that, while 30 per cent is public debt, 70 per cent is private debt. I do not think we should moralise therefore about the comparative excesses of some State governments exclusively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have not only the excesses of deregulation but also the added bonus of self-regulation whereby State Treasurers simply fax off to the Federal Treasurer the amount of their short term and long term borrowings with no auditing. State governments report what they choose to report: `Dear John, this month we borrowed $1.6 billion, but only in the short term, and our auditor does not really know the extent of this. Trust us and just go ahead and put the aggregated amount in the Federal Budget, no questions asked'. That is how this country is run. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What seems to have happened in Victoria is that debt was moved around within some sort of coalition of public sector financing funds so that the technical requirement to disclose gross new money borrowings from the private sector was complied with. Just knowing that that has happened is sufficient for me to say that it is time we had a good long look at this gentlemen's agreement. As the terms of reference state, we should ask: what are the reasonable functions, powers and operation of the Australian Loan Council? What is the role of all governments?  What is the right of members to know the information which is provided to the Council? Where is the public's right to know about the information? In the administration of global borrowing limits set by the Council, what sorts of things should be included? For example, should sale and lease-back arrangements be counted? As to the responsibility and power of the Federal Treasurer, as chairman of the Loan Council, when should the Treasurer act in respect of breaches or potential breaches of the global borrowing limits? Where is his responsibility in the effect of these things on the national economy?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot has been said about the role of the Treasurer. To be fair, he came to this position in January of this year. I think he can demonstrate that all the way through, technically, he behaved appropriately. In saying that, his defence is that he could not take action without the Victorian State Government making formal application for a special addition of funds. His argument is that he chose to act behind the scenes in the meantime by way of letter. His judgment was that he should not disclose the amount of the debt until he had in hand a strategy from the Victorian State Government for medium term debt recovery, such strategy to be announced hand in hand with the disclosure. He has argued that this was in the national interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can place some credence on that argument, but the Democrats feel quite strongly&mdash;and this applies to the explanation that the Treasurer has given about his obligation to disclose in the Budget&mdash;that the Treasurer could have been expected to go beyond meeting the technical obligations and to have exercised the sort of authority one expects of the Federal Treasurer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true to say that in the Budget the Treasurer met the obligation of disclosing to Parliament the extent of public sector borrowing. Markets were able to see up or down movement and the balance between the states. In tables 1 and 2 of statement 6 of Budget Paper No. 1, we were able to see the total structure of public borrowing. However, I do not think one should have to put several reports together to work out how to disaggregate them. The Treasurer had an obligation to put a footnote to these figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The select committee represents a significant step in the quest for greater accountability of public and private debt in this country.

Somehow, according to the Treasurer, it is the coalition's fault that the Australian dollar has collapsed, that interest rates for government borrowings are under pressure. It is not its fault.

I am advised that, if they are listed in the resolution, then those powers ascribe to this Senate committee the power, I suppose you could say, to subpoena documents. However, there is very little likelihood of any State or Territory government producing those documents for the Commonwealth. The consequences of this Senate committee could be the Commonwealth's QC, on at least $2,000 a day, versus the QCs from every State and Territory, no doubt at an extra $2,000 a day, at great length arguing about who had the power to subpoena what and whether or not any State government ought to produce these documents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we would see run in this Senate committee would be exactly the kinds of constraints that are already there on the Loan Council. I believe that we would have no further advancement on what is already there. You may indeed have a lot of fun groping around within the documents from the Federal Office but you would not achieve the sorts of things you want to go to. That is a reasonable point of objection in opposition to this motion&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) The functions, powers and operation of the Australian Loan Council in co-ordinating all financial transactions by all Commonwealth and State bodies, including government business enterprises, instrumentalities and other authorities, that involve a call on the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA>Before we go on to any of the other points in this motion, one has to wonder about exactly what the Opposition says in the Fightback package. It says that it endorses a competitive federalism, where each State and Territory will be responsible for its own revenues, including borrowings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members of the Opposition come in here and, in complete contradiction to their own Fightback package, say, `Let's have it all out. Let's actually move to a central government. Let's have a look at a central tabling of all the documents. Let's have a look at all the borrowings, Commonwealth and State&mdash;not some, not even the government ones, but all borrowings including borrowings by government business enterprises, instrumentalities and other authorities'. Those opposite are a very interesting lot. Do they want the States to have independence? Do they want them to have what they call competitive federalism or do they want to move to the centralism that this motion endorses?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats are consistent in their approach. This motion is entirely consistent with the approach of the Democrats. Whether or not one agrees with it is a separate thing. But the Democrats are consistent, which is exactly what those opposite are not. This is opportunism writ large. Senator Kemp should be ashamed of himself. He does not believe in this one iota. The Fightback package spells out exactly the contrary position and yet those opposite&mdash;bleeding hearts the lot of them&mdash;have the gall to stand up in here and try to convince us that they seriously believe it. To those listening to this debate&mdash;and there are not many&mdash;I report at this stage that all the Opposition senators are smiling, which means they are in agreement with the point I am making. What a hollow lot; what a lot of sham men over there, trying to pretend that they actually believe all of this. They do not. </PARA>

From my reading of the terms of reference, it is very unclear what the committee will do. What on earth would this Senate committee do? What recommendations could it make? What documents and information could it have access to? One could be absolutely sure that it would receive no information of any seriousness from the States and Territories; it would have no capacity seriously to resolve anything; it could make only hollow recommendations after going through a hollow exercise. As I say, the Democrat approach is consistent and the Opposition approach is totally hypocritical. I suppose that those approaches are not without precedents. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why did not members of the Opposition want to tell us about the Gray Government in Tasmania? What happened when the Gray Government's books were examined by an incoming Labor Government? The Gray Liberal Government borrowings led to a totally unsustainable debt. It never actually told anyone about that, and I notice the Opposition senators here have not told anyone about that either. Selective quoting is like the sin of omission: it is almost as bad as that terrible thing&mdash;a lie. Senators opposite did not tell us about the Gray Government and the problems it got into with its borrowings and levels of debt. They did not tell us about how that Government contravened and went outside the general rules&mdash;that it broke the gentlemen's agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At least Victoria allowed Nicholls to examine its books. In fact, some other examples could be cited which the Opposition has also forgotten and overlooked. The former Premier of New South Wales, Mr Greiner, exceeded the borrowings by $1 billion in respect of the harbour tunnel. What was proper about Mr Greiner and what was proper about the process was that, having gone completely outside the guidelines&mdash;</PARA>

Opposition senators did not give us this example of how it can be done and has been done. No, they did not look at that&mdash;they selectively quoted. They have taken the high moral ground. Senator Kemp, with his hand on his chest, is feeling his heart beat with passion and commitment. Goodness me&mdash;they are very, very hollow!</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One could give other examples of States and Territories approaching the Federal Labor Government in respect of extensions or movements of borrowings outside the Loan Council guidelines. The Ulara resort in the Northern Territory is another good example. The Country-Liberal Party of the Territory and the Liberal Government of Mr Greiner were able in negotiation to reach a resolution in respect of those exceeded borrowings. That has been perfectly well accepted and managed by negotiation between the two. That is perfectly possible and it is the process that has applied up until now. The Opposition is misrepresenting the facts. It has selectively emphasised what it thinks will make a good story. The Opposition is confusing people by misrepresenting these facts and withholding information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last point I would like to make is that the Opposition is very good at always ascribing motive or intent to others. That practice, which is actually against the Standing Orders, is used so often that we do not always call points of order. One cannot know what is in another person's mind. One can judge whether a person's behaviour is acceptable, but one does not have the ability to go to that person's intent unless it is expressly written down or stated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats have said that they found the explanation as to why information was left out of the Budget Papers sufficient but perhaps not enough. There is absolutely no conclusion by the Democrats that the Treasurer deliberately intended to misrepresent or lie. But Opposition senators want to make the point that withholding the information carries with it the deliberate intent to lie or mislead. The Opposition is so good at ascribing intent to others. It is important for the Opposition to look to its own house. Opposition senators have come in here to support a motion that is completely contradictory to their own policies in Fightback. I will be interested to see how they wriggle out of that one. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That, of course, is precisely the point. Here we have, as we now know, $1.3 billion of borrowings which should have been included within the Victorian declarations to the Loan Council. They were not included, and the Commonwealth could not discover the truth over some months. That is the very point; that is why we need the inquiry. Rather than being a defence, as Senator Button seemed to be saying, really it is the point at issue&mdash;the point as to why we need the inquiry. He also seemed to question whether I and others knew the difference between the Queensland situation of 1988 and the present situation in Victoria. Again, I know very well the difference. In the case of Queensland, Queensland declared openly to the Loan Council that it would go outside the Loan Council and its rules and borrow, and it was brought smartly into line. In the case of Victoria, Victoria obsequiously and secretly went outside the rules of the Loan Council and did not tell anybody. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point here is that once the Treasurer had become reasonably confident that that was the situation&mdash;and I think from what we now know that, at least from June of this year, the Treasurer should have been reasonably confident that that was the situation&mdash;then he should have taken much stronger action with respect to Victoria. That is the point at issue there; although he could not have actually taken action in relation to that as he did in Queensland, at least he could have threatened similar sort of action. He could have threatened that if Victoria did not get its act together then, of course, it would have its allocations through the other part of Federal allocations withdrawn or curtailed in some way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not share with the Opposition the feeling that this, in fact, amounts to a conspiracy but we would certainly go so far as to say that the Treasurer, in our view, had enough reason to become much tougher with Victoria over the last few months and simply failed to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point that I want to pick up in conclusion is this question of openness and the confidence which the public has in the financial system, in the loans system and in the borrowing system and, through the confidence which the public has, the confidence which the Australian and international markets would, or should, have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, Senator Button seems to have obfuscated the issue. He has claimed yet again that it is necessary that the extent of borrowings or financial misdemeanours by the States not be revealed to the public or the market until there is a solution which can be put down at the same time. To do so would cause the markets to lose confidence and would, therefore, make the markets jittery and have effects on the value of the Australian dollar, interest rates and various other financial indicators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But we have this letter from the Federal Treasurer to Mr Fahey, the Premier of New South Wales, dated 30 October. In it, the Federal Treasurer is speaking of potential improvements in the Loan Council arrangements, and says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For instance one proposal could be that the Loan Council Secretariat be asked to scrutinise in detail all financial transactions by all State and Commonwealth bodies that involve a call on the private sector, including short term and temporary facilities and so-called "creative" financing instruments. As you will appreciate such an approach will require far more frequent and detailed reporting.</PARA>
<PARA>Yesterday we were told by the Treasury officials that one of the reasons why States could not reveal to the Loan Council this sort of information was that they could not have confidence in the Premiers from the other States not using this in a political way, revealing it, therefore, to the public and destabilising the market. Yet we have here the Treasurer saying that that revelation should be considered a reasonable part of the function of the Loan Council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If that is the case, the Treasurer here is clearly identifying that that process would lead to more confidence by the public and more confidence by the financial markets, and the Treasurer simply cannot have it both ways. Neither he nor Senator Button can claim that to reveal this information would have led to destabilisation, and yet, at the same time, call for a system in which there will be regular and detailed revelation of that information, presumably including those instances in which the States have gone outside the global limit requirements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude on this point. The Treasurer goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Regular publication will make for a better informed market in this area than we have ever previously seen. This will impose its own discipline on governments which might be considered to be borrowing too heavily. Consideration might also be given to the need for more explicit penalties for any breach of agreed borrowing items including offsetting reductions as grants.</PARA>
<PARA>It seems to me that here the Treasurer is clearly identifying what needs to be put in place. I repeat, our remaining concern is that it is not appropriate for the Loan Council itself to attempt this sort of investigation. We feel that it is very unlikely that the Loan Council would impose on itself the sorts of penalties and strictures which would be necessary to ensure this financial accountability. Appropriately, a Senate select committee should be set up with the terms of reference which we will give to it in a moment when we vote on this motion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those terms of reference will ensure that there will be, on the public record, a process which will be seen to be a much better and more accountable one. It will be a process which will lead through the sorts of pressures that will then be on the Loan Council to invoke just those sorts of stringencies, just this sort of accountability and just this sort of information. It will lead to a greater level of confidence by the public and the markets and, therefore, greater certainty in relation to the financial future of this country. That is one thing that we need and one thing that we have not got at present. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We can hear the chirpy interjections from the Minister for Industrial Relations, who has been renowned in recent weeks for his conflicting remarks about the Jobsback policy. Before I touch on that matter, it is important that we put the background of the Jobsback policy into perspective.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over 12 months ago, because of the economic climate in Australia, with its record unemployment, its foreign debt that was growing out of all proportion&mdash;and which is continuing today&mdash;and its record youth unemployment and with no light at the end of the tunnel, it was imperative that someone did something in this country. The Government had run out of ideas and had no policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Based on the country's position at that time&mdash;which has currently got worse&mdash;Fightback was introduced into Australian living rooms. The whole basis of the Fightback program was to create real jobs in this country and not the phoney or bandaid type of work that is carried out by the Government to hide the real unemployment in Australia. Fightback was introduced to give a big adrenalin injection into the private sector, because only a thriving and growing private sector&mdash;which is the wealth creator in Australia&mdash;can get Australia out of the mess it is in today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This mess has come about as a result of 10 years of Labor and a former Treasurer who is now the de facto Prime Minister of Australia with failed policies. There are four or five major aspects to the Fightback program, but one of them is to remove some $20 billion worth of taxes from the private sector which will enable it to become more competitive, not only in regard to increasing exports, but also to enable it to produce more of the goods and services in this country that Australians want to buy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other part of Fightback was the well-known GST. As everyone knows, despite the scaremongering of the Labor Party, the net inflationary effect of the GST as calculated by the Treasury itself was 3.6 per cent. It was not in the order of 15 per cent, which is the figure that the Government initially tried to lie its way around the country with. The Government found it was going nowhere and has dropped it to some degree. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An equally important, if not more important, part of the package was to restructure the industrial relations system in this country. I would say that, even though all aspects of Fightback are important, if we had to categorise or prioritise them, number one would have to be the reform of the industrial relations system. Without that, and with all the other benefits offered by Fightback, there is no doubt that we will not achieve the sorts of results that we on this side want for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We want this not only for ourselves, but also for our children and their children. We do not want to leave this country to our children in a worse state than it was when we were young ourselves. That is exactly the way we are going and this is the basis of the Fightback policy and Jobsback itself. It is interesting that the Jobsback policy has been acclaimed by industry and employers throughout Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before dinner, we were debating the coalition's Jobsback program, which simply exists to create real jobs for all Australians and to result in higher real wages. The campaign has been run, not unexpectedly, I suppose, by leaders of the trade union movement, who have attempted to run a scare campaign. One claim is that the coalition's intent is to wipe out the unions. Nothing could be further from the truth. Trade unions have been with us for a long time and they will be with us for many years into the future. Of course, how long they exist and how strong they become will depend on the service they offer, because the Jobsback program opens up the union movement to competition, and that is anathema to them. I suppose that the program has the potential to break down the power base if they do not offer Australians the incentive to join a particular union.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With any group&mdash;it does not have to be a trade union&mdash;that has had a monopoly over a long time, there is a resistance to anything that opens it up to competition. I suppose that an analogous comparison would be as outlined today in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> by Senator Peter Walsh under the name of `Cassandra', where he talked about breaking down the marketing authorities and the resistance there was to that. Once a group of any sort has a monopoly over any group of people, it has power over those people. It is then only a matter of time before those people become unimportant and power becomes the important thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As has been pointed out by Mr Howard, it is worth noting that no political party, no religious denomination and no other community group has guaranteed adherence in our society. The same must apply to trade unions. The Jobsback policy quite clearly states that we will ban compulsory membership, but that in itself does not make the policy anti-union. Over the last few years we have made it very clear that we will fight for the right of people to join a union in the same way that we will fight, and with the same passion, for those who do not wish to join a union. It is a basic freedom. It merely gives the worker a choice and the freedom to make that choice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unions should not have a monopoly on bargaining power on the workers' behalf. If they offer the features that people want in life, people will take them. But they will not be compelled to do so under the coalition's policy; that is the vital difference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Remarks have also been made about enterprise based bargaining. Senator Cook said that the Labor Party opposed enterprise based bargaining in 1983 or 1984, when it was first proposed by the coalition. His claim is that the timing was not right then. However, after the passage of a few years, it was supposedly adopted by the Labor Party. The coalition's enterprise based bargaining was never adopted by the Labor Party, because the thrust of the coalition policy is that employers and employees would have the right to be able to negotiate between themselves the work conditions, et cetera, that they need to run a successful operation. The difference is that the Labor Party has introduced a Claytons-type enterprise based agreement where the worker takes a secondary role and the primary relationship is between the employer and the union. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nothing could have brought this home clearer than the recent debacle on the Gold Coast with the Gazal enterprises. I believe that the owner of the business is Mr Chawki Gazal. The enterprise had concluded that there was a slack time in the year, which comes towards Christmas, and that the way for the enterprise to be more successful was for the people who normally work there&mdash;some 125 or 130&mdash;to work on a casual basis around that slack period and then go back to full time work when there was demand for the company's product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was exactly what both the employees and the management of Gazal enterprises wanted, so they formed an enterprise agreement to that effect. To the surprise of everyone, this was taken awfully seriously. Ms Anna Booth, from the ACTU, flew from Melbourne, confronted the management and workers and told them that it was not on. Here was a clear example of a proper enterprise based agreement between the workers in what I believe, from reports given to me, is a very happy workplace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not forget the television program where the workers of Gazal said to Ms Anna Booth, `Anna, will you please leave us alone and go back to Melbourne; we want to go back to work'. Of course the union did not want a bar of it, because it talked of all the old things that have caused all the problems in Australia over the past 20 years under the existing system. Concern was shown by Ms Booth that this arrangement could flow on. The old flow-on problem has probably cost more jobs in past times with the exponential growth in wages that went from one to the other. Under the coalition's enterprise agreements, this would not occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A claim is made that workers will be exploited under enterprise based agreements. I will not go into the safety net issue, because a safety net has certainly been put within the Jobsback policy. What I will say&mdash;and I say this from the experience of my whole working life&mdash;is that I have yet to see an organisation survive which exploited its workers. One problem is that once a third party, such as a union, comes in and makes the rules for an organisation, in effect, the workers are put on the outskirts and the employer finds himself or herself in the position where he or she gives them their rights and nothing more and nothing less. This dehumanises the organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One problem with unionism as we have known it over many years is that it exacerbates the `them and us' position. This attitude comes not from within the organisations; it arises because of the will being imposed from outside that what is good for the organisation is good for the employee. In other words, an expanding, growing organisation with increasing productivity reflects itself in the workers and the remuneration they get. So a growing organisation not only gives stability and continuity of work, which is terribly important in any society, but also a share in the profit increase that comes with increased productivity&mdash;not wage increases that are not based on productivity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Support for Jobsback has come from a whole range of people and organisations. As I mentioned earlier in this speech, this is not because of self-interest but because of a recognition that, without a program such as Jobsback, we in Australia will not recover and our business enterprises will not be able to offer our young people jobs. The 1.1 million people unemployed will be entrenched and growing. Many people would argue, quite correctly, that the real level of unemployment is probably closer to two million than one million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Support has come from the Tourist and Travel Corporation; the Gold Coast Visitors and Convention Bureau, which is a major tourist growth area; the United Graziers Association; the Australian Business Council president, Mr John Ralph, who, as I understand it, is also the Chief Executive of CRA; the National Farmers Federation; the Master Builders Construction and Housing Association; and the Queensland Confederation of Industry and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the problems under the entrenched existing system&mdash;I know Senator Cook says that the Government has addressed it&mdash;is that the Government has a long way to go. Probably one would have to argue that it is almost impossible to handle it. Indeed, it is said that there is nothing wrong with the workers or the management, but that the system is up the spout. Before I came down here I looked up an engineering award out of Queensland and I obtained a recent copy. In addition to the normal wages and things provided, there were 44 extra allowances. I will not go into them because my time is about to run out, but they cover such items as dirty conditions, dirty timber, explosive power tools allowance and motor drivers allowance. The award is so bad that an extra employee is needed just to keep track of the additional allowances for someone working in the engineering business. Most engineering enterprises are probably guilty of some sort of default, because it is a bizarre situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regrettably my time has run out, but I feel that we should continue this debate at some later stage.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two weeks ago, at a $100 a plate breakfast in Sydney, the Opposition released its much awaited industrial relations policy. We have waited for it since November 1991 when the consumption tax proposal, called Fightback, was first announced by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson). We were told that the missing centrepiece of Fightback was the industrial relations policy, that all things would be explained by the industrial relations policy and that all problems would be solved when it was released. We were told that the fiscal holes that could be punched in Fightback&mdash;holes to the level of $6.3 billion&mdash;would be solved by industrial relations issues. We were told that all the damage that is done by the Fightback proposal&mdash;the consumption tax, in which 70 per cent of Australian families are worse off&mdash;would be solved by the release of the industrial relations policy. We were told that the inflation boost that the consumption tax would give the Australian economy would be fixed by the industrial relations policy. We were told all those things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The car manufacturers in Australia, who criticised the tariff regime proposed in the consumption tax package, were told, `We'll fix that problem with industrial relations'. The Catholic Social Welfare Commission, which raised reasonable questions on behalf of people on welfare in Australia, was told, `That will be solved through industrial relations reform'. The banking and finance quarters that criticised the consumption tax were told similar things, as was the tourist industry, which was its most vehement and recent critic, and as was the manufacturing industry which worried and fretted about tariffs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we waited. We even heard Tim Fischer, the Leader of the National Party, tell us on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS> one night that all the problems in trade, including the North American trade treaty, would be fixed by the industrial relations policy of the Opposition. It is a wonder it did not claim that it would fix dandruff as well. It laid claim in the lead-up to the announcement of this policy that this missing centrepiece, once revealed, would be so stunning as to sweep aside all questions and all problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What do we have? We have a policy which in large part has pinched some of the language of the Labor Party and the Labor Government to disguise a policy which is nothing more than a low wage, high price, low skill, high confrontation policy. That is what we have. It is not a fair policy, because it removes fairness. It is not a decent policy that respects decency among ordinary Australians; it undermines decency. It is not a policy that is coherent; it has gaping holes through which one could drive a coach-and-four. Moreover, it is a policy which  probably most fundamentally protects unscrupulous behaviour by employers and enshrines that with all the panoply of protections of the common law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Mr Howard in dreaming up this policy is to be characterised as an alchemist, he is laboured with the lead and dross of the political theories and doctrines of the Liberal Party. But he has not produced gold; he has only produced more lead in the saddlebags of the coalition as it runs to the polls, whenever the election is called. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The centrepiece could not be explained by the Leader of the Liberal Party, Dr Hewson. On the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> interview with Laurie Oakes, the Sunday after the policy was released, Dr Hewson when asked about the minimum wage and protections did not have an answer. The leader did not know. He was unable to explain how the safety net worked. Nor were we helped by his spokesman, Mr Howard, who on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS> the next day produced a series of alternatives, any one of which could be true. Finally he fudged it by saying that the awards could be moved and that unions could change the awards and that would provide the safety net. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Industrial Relations Commission, the independent umpire, the body which would make the awards and issue them as acts of law, is to be made voluntary. Its powers are to be effectively undermined, it is to be marginalised and removed from the ability to make binding awards where there is found to be an industrial dispute by the proper process. But, more importantly, the awards themselves become accessible only where both parties agree. This is the abomination at the centre of this policy. If there is a hole of any sort that can be more readily identified than any other, this is it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is it being said that workers can be entitled to the legally determined minimums provided for in an award after due process before an arbitrator, in which both sides have stated their case, adduced their evidence, presented their witnesses, inspected the premises and completed their arguments? When the arbitrator withdraws and, using the principles of justice, equity and the substantial merits of the case, brings down a decision which is then binding, do Opposition members seek to remove ordinary Australians from the coverage of that decision and to block their access to the Commission to resolve disputes or to provide them with properly determined rights unless both parties agree? If that is the case, it amounts to a veto by unscrupulous employers on the right of ordinary Australians to have access to proper and fair minimums determined in a proper and fair manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet we are told in the doublespeak that the Opposition has perfected in selling this policy&mdash;some of the language it has pinched from us to try to make its policy more palatable, some of the salesman's gimmicks, the sweet platitudes and the honeyed words that the Opposition uses to try to reassure ordinary Australians that somehow they will be protected&mdash;that the minimums that are being offered are substantial. I make it clear to the Senate that they are not substantial; they are shams and they are false. To believe that they offer any protection is to believe a myth. There is a huge gap between the language used by the Opposition to try to sell this policy and gull the credulous and the content and the black letter of what this policy actually says. Should there be any dispute, I commend the policy and a reading of it. If we simply read what the commitment is, then we can see the fallacy of the Opposition's position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In short, not only did Dr Hewson not know and could not explain what a minimum wage was and not only could Mr Howard not adequately cover his leader but also last Sunday on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program we saw an interview between Laurie Oakes and the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party, Mr Peter Reith. What did we have from Mr Reith? Mr Reith did not even understand what his cousins in Victoria, crude though they be, were doing when it came to the removal of the annual leave loading and weekend penalty rates. When asked the direct question, he gave an answer which was just not true and which caused the interviewer, Laurie Oakes, to blanch and all viewers to wonder whether this Party knows what it is talking about and whether it follows the industrial relations debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But perhaps the best answer was given on the day after the policy was unveiled with a drum roll and flourish of trumpets. On 23 October the Sydney<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> Telegraph</EMPHASIS> newspaper conducted a write-in poll of its readers to see whether or not the policy had been well received. The verdict of the electors, those people polled by that newspaper, was that three-quarters of the Australians responding rejected the policy. Is it popular? The answer was no. Seventy-five per cent of the respondents in that poll gave it the thumbs down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Premier of Victoria, Mr Jeff Kennett, has been condemned by Mr Howard and Mr Reith as a liar&mdash;condemned by them as someone who said before the election he would do certain things and, once in power, dishonoured his word and did other things.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is there anything more sickening in public life than the sight of Mr Gude, the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Government in Victoria, justifying his $8,500 pay rise, put through the Victorian Parliament at 4 a.m., because, he said, he worked hard and he needed a career path?  At the same time, he is ripping the annual leave loading off all Victorians; as well, he is ripping weekend penalty rates off those Australians who work on weekends.

What did he do at a cost to pensioners in Coburg who pay the same rate as the sharp practising lawyers in Toorak? What did this man, who said that $100 for everyone was fair, do? He reinstituted the silver service, the white glove waiters in the parliamentary dining room, for the Cabinet. That is Liberal philosophy on display&mdash;`We will have the lurks.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before these events became known, we had a statement from Mr Howard that the policy in Victoria that the Kennett Government was about to introduce was, give or take a few commas or punctuation marks, the same policy that he intends to introduce.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Victorians were told, `No-one will lose a cent'. All of those people will lose hundreds of dollars.

That is what Mr Howard would do were his policy applied. One does not have to be Einstein to know that. Opposition spokesmen have said so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may well be that Victoria is the social laboratory. But while the tragic black comedy being played out in Victoria may differ in terms of a few decimal points or a few commas or dashes, it is inspired by exactly the same ideology and is on exactly the same theme and wavelength as the so-called Jobsback, properly entitled `Jobsack', package. In Victoria we are having a foretaste of what we would see if we ever had a Federal Liberal government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have produced a formal detailed point by point critique of the Opposition's industrial relations policy. In order to discover the true meaning of that policy, I commend to the Senate the critique which is entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Unfair and Unnecessary</EMPHASIS>. But, more importantly, I have produced a portfolio statement entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Best and Fairest</EMPHASIS>&mdash;best because we want the best economic system available; fairest because it has to be fair to all people and not just to those who happen to be born to the purple, have some higher income or somehow are regarded by the Opposition as being among the chosen privileged few. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Best and Fairest</EMPHASIS> talks about fair to ordinary Australians while producing the best and most efficient economic outcomes. </PARA>

It picks on migrant workers because they too are similarly exposed. How can a migrant woman worker called into the boss's top office be expected to negotiate her independent employment contract, as the Opposition would require her to? How could she be expected to deal with an employer, know her rights and even understand what was being said? How could that be regarded as a bargain struck between equals? The notion itself, the very idea, is offensive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition's industrial relations policy picks on shift workers for all the reasons that I have mentioned. It picks on people who work overtime. Their entitlement to overtime payments would be automatically removed under the Opposition's policy. It picks on people who attract any form of penalty rates. We had it again tonight from Senator Parer. It picks on people who want to work a normal day or a normal week because one of the rights that one would lose under the Opposition's industrial relations policy is the right to work a normal spread of hours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Howard himself says one can work 12 hours a day if necessary&mdash;no special payment, just the same flat rate. And one could work seven days a week&mdash;no special payment, just the same flat rate. Is this supposed to be fair, reasonable and decent? This is disreputable. It picks on all of those people who have annual leave. It will remove their ability to go away with the family&mdash;the wife and kids&mdash;and have a holiday in the caravan park, the chalet or somewhere else because they will not be able to afford to do so. They will lose the 17 1/2 per cent annual leave loading. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition's policy picks on training and skill. This is, in many respects, one of the worst sins of the policy. In this country we have been coaxing a very highly skilled, specialised work force which is able to adapt its skill to new technology so that it can produce a highly sophisticated product, get high returns for that product and be paid high wages. There is nothing, not a single word, in the Opposition's policy about encouraging the formation of skills in this country or training our young people to take their place in a highly technological future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is there any vision? No, there is none. The coalition will shoot the umpire, the Industrial Relations Commission, which has been responsible for nearly a century now for refereeing the combatants in industrial relations in this country, bringing fairness, conciliation and mediation into play and, where necessary in the event of an intractable dispute, arbitrating the differences and making an order binding the parties. The umpire will be removed. There will be no access to fairness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said in answer to a question in this chamber a few weeks ago, what this policy means is that the person who is screwing you has to give permission for you to be able to get to the umpire in order not to be screwed and to have fairness brought in. One has to get the permission of one's employer to have access to the umpire, the Commission, if one does not agree with what one's employer is doing. If that employer is unscrupulous, as many are, then you will not get access to the umpire and fairness will not enter the bargain. That is what the Opposition's policy would do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not all employers in Australia are unscrupulous; many of them are very good people. Many of them have come out and made it clear what they think of this policy&mdash;and many of them have rejected it. But if you are a good employer in competition with a bad employer and he is undercutting you because he is screwing his work force's wages down, you will be faced with this awful choice: do the same or go out of business. That is what this policy does. It does not work with people to improve this country; it works against them to reduce living standards, as if visiting pain on the backs of ordinary Australians is a way to the recovery.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating the proposition that the following matter proposed by Senator Parer is a matter of urgency:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The need for the Government to abandon its failed big unions, big government, compulsory centralised wage fixing system which has contributed to record unemployment, and adopt `Jobsback', the Coalition's worker friendly, enterprise based, high wage new jobs policy.</PARA>
<PARA>Essentially, that motion asks the Government to abandon its system. I suggest that such an action would be irresponsible and not practical. To start with, it is not at all easy to determine exactly what the Jobsback policy is. It changes regularly, it contains many inconsistencies, it is expressed in generalities and it would be rather difficult to implement in its present form. The action that is suggested in this motion would be irresponsible in the extreme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the adjectival terms Senator Parer uses to describe the system. The first is `big unions'. I will not disagree with that. It is my opinion that the union amalgamation process that has led to the numbers we have in unions now has meant that the system can accurately be described by the term `big unions'. I would suggest that it is not possible to agree with the next adjectival term that is used; that is, `big government'. In the Democrats' view, we do not have a `big government'; we have a government which is deregulatory&mdash;a government which admits and takes pride in the fact that it is non-interventionist and does not want to increase its powers of intervention in either the economy or the social welfare obligations that a government should have. In fact, this Government is privatising, corporatising and backing away from its fundamental responsibilities of government. I think we should pay a little attention to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, I will cite an example which stretches across Australia to illustrate that the Government's attitude is not one that can be described by the term `big government'. The Government's attitude is such that it is leading to a lot of government business enterprises and even government responsibilities being fobbed off and handed over to other instrumentalities&mdash;either to the private sector or, in a halfway step to that, which I do not believe is satisfactory either, to corporatised instrumentalities such as the Federal Airports Corporation. That body is being directed to adopt this corporatisation philosophy which removes it from its original responsibilities to administer airports and asks it to make a profit. Of course, in the process we see such debacles as the one in Tasmania that I know something about, whereby the Federal Airports Corporation is changing the arrangements it has with hire car firms, attempting to make a dollar out of the operation involving access to airports. We do not have government any more; we do not have responsibility for the administration of airports; we have an organisation that sees its purpose in life as being to make a profit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable senators may remember the incident of the Scottsdale Materials Research Laboratory whereby the Government's responsibility to research into foods to provide for the defence forces was planned to be subsumed under the aim of being economically efficient, rather than looking at the effectiveness and value to the community in general, to Australia as a whole, of the fine research that was done at that establishment and the fine service that was provided to our armed forces. That was driven by this corporatising, hands-off Government&mdash;this Government for removing government from the responsibilities which it should rightly exercise and for seeking to justify things in terms of economic rationalism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I disagree with the description of this Government as a `big government'. It is not a `big government'; it is abrogating its responsibility to lead, to provide opportunities and to direct encouragement to enterprises which can develop and create employment for Australians&mdash;yet another responsibility that is fundamental to good government that is not being accepted by this Government. It is backing away from being a big government&mdash;trying to wash its hands of its responsibility, trying to get smaller and to take on fewer responsibilities. It has abrogated its responsibility to use all of the economic and trading levers at its disposal to nurture and protect Australian enterprises. We see evidence of that in its attitude towards tariffs. Aided and abetted by the coalition, the attitude has developed that we should be looking for some sort of international level playing field. That is a faulty attitude or philosophy, and it has been demonstrated as being to no advantage to Australia. So I submit that the `big government' description contained in this motion is a wrong description and that this Government is one which is backing away from its responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next adjectival phrase used to describe this system is, `compulsory centralised wage fixing system'. This is another myth which has been perpetuated by certain members of the coalition. In this regard I can refer to no greater authority than Senator Walters, who made that claim recently in the Hobart <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mercury</EMPHASIS>. In her letter she said that there is `no flexibility to allow work outside normal hours without penalty rates applying'. I think Senator Walters has been misled there. That is not true. There is considerable flexibility within the present system to negotiate and to in fact work outside normal working hours without penalty rates applying. In fact, there have been several enterprise agreements registered with and certified by the Industrial Relations Commission, many of which contain exactly those provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are reminded of that in an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> of yesterday&mdash;that is, Monday 2 November&mdash;by Mr Mike Taylor. In that comprehensive article about industrial relations he points out that a considerable number of major Australian companies&mdash;including Broken Hill Pty Ltd, ICI Ltd, ANZ, Ford, Bridgestone Australia, Toyota Motor Corporation, Mayne Nickless, National Australia Bank and Taubmans, to name but a handful of the several hundred&mdash;have enterprise agreements in existence. He points out that virtually all of them `have been achieved in highly unionised and organised areas', with trade unions playing `an integral part in achieving those agreements'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He goes on to tell us that there have been broad similarities in the way those agreements have been achieved and the way agreements have been struck in Japan, Germany and the United States. It seems that many big Australian companies like the sorts of results that can be achieved. Then he editorialises to some extent to tell us:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem with the Opposition's policy is that it does not offer them&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is those companies I quoted earlier&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">a continuation of what many of them now perceive as being a successful and versatile system. For this reason, some of the companies who have successfully managed to negotiate enterprise agreements will be looking to a Coalition government to accommodate them.</PARA>
<PARA>By `them', I assume he means those very agreements that have been previously negotiated. He continues:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If that accommodation cannot be made, then the Coalition may find that its policy cannot command 100 per cent employer support. More importantly, it will find that its policy lacks the necessary commitment from some of Australia's largest companies.</PARA>
<PARA>As Senator Parer quite rightly observes, the author of that article is there speculating. I pass no judgment of my own, but those agreements actually exist and the editorialising that the journalist applied is there for all to see. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of further enterprise agreements exist in which there is flexibility to work outside normal hours without penalty rates, which is the matter Senator Walters mentioned. We have several hundred examples of other flexibilities: changes to the hours of work, whether there are production processes&mdash;previously the subject of demarcation disputes&mdash;changes to work processes, whether the hours provide a basic core arrangement or a certain number of hours a day. Even the infamous rostered day off has been dealt with. For example, the Toyota agreement introduces a number of innovative changes to hours of work and rostered days off. These can now be scheduled to coincide with festivals or community events that may affect the majority of employees and which would previously have impacted on absenteeism. These sorts of flexibilities are in existence. It is foolish and narrow-minded to deny their existence and even perverse to suggest that it is now a system that does not allow flexibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to be very careful when considering the coalition's proposal that Jobsback would provide a suitable replacement to that which exists now. As I mentioned earlier, the Jobsback proposition contains its own internal inconsistencies. One of the early statements made by the Opposition spokesperson on industrial relations, Mr John Howard, was the fundamental suggestion that the Opposition would move away from a centralised wage fixing policy. It has been demonstrated that the coalition would need under this proposition to find a basic minimum, whether that relates to the awards or is a minimum determined by some other means. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are told that it is there by Senator Parer, but we are not told the mechanism for altering, improving or changing in any way those basic minimums which are proposed at the moment. We suspect, of course, that any change would be determined by nothing other than a centralised system. Whether that centralised system would be with reference to the system which has established the basic minimum awards for Australians for almost a century, as Senator Cook told us, or whether it would be determined with reference to the ultimate centralised system which the coalition has not yet identified, it would remain the centralised system. To me, that is a huge inconsistency which has yet to be addressed by proponents of this arrangement.</PARA></TALK.START>

We also strengthened the legal sanctions which already existed against coercion to join unions and we will continue to work for industrial democracy where workers become more closely involved in the management decisions of their enterprise.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I cannot accept this amendment moved by Senator Bell to the urgency motion. It is just a glossy way of putting what currently exists. The amendment will do absolutely nothing to address the serious problems in this country in industrial relations of lifting productivity to anything like world competitive standards. I will refer to that later. The motion before us reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The need for the Government to abandon its failed big unions, big government, compulsory centralised wage fixing system which has contributed to record unemployment, and adopt `Jobsback', the Coalition's worker friendly, enterprise based, high wage new jobs policy.</PARA>
<PARA>We must look at a number of things. What has this Government delivered to employees in this country during its term in office? It has delivered a 2 per cent fall in real wages. One cannot walk away from that. Across the water in New Zealand, since it went that further step and introduced real reform to industrial relations, a real wage increase of 1.3 per cent has been delivered in less than six months. That is what we are here to talk about and that is what Jobsback is all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at a specific example of the meat industry, which has been absolutely paralysed by big unions, big government and the compulsory centralised wage fixing system. It is worth noting that back in 1990 the Harrison inquiry was put together to try to overcome the problems existing in the meat industry. The meat industry has the potential in this country to be huge, to value add in a meaningful way and to supply those markets very close to us in Asia. The Harrison inquiry reported over 12 months ago. What has happened since then?  Very little. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at some of the figures. Despite the Harrison inquiry into the problems of the meat industry, we are still looking at $65,000 a year to provide a meat inspector for the meat industry. We are still looking at almost $93,000 a year to provide veterinarians to service the industry. Back in 1990, in the United States&mdash;and the situation is similar in South American countries and in other competing countries&mdash;its cost of processing beef was 10c a kilogram. In Australia it was 45c a kilogram. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the current figures and what the industrial relations policy of this Government has delivered to us, along with a fall in real wages of 2 per cent. In America the cost of processing beef has increased to 13c a kilogram. Yet in Australia our costs are still 42c a kilogram. When it comes to the big ticket items, the big issues, the areas where we can make real gains, little or nothing has been done. Each time attempts have been made to tackle this situation, because of the AMIEU and Wally Curran&mdash;with the support, unfortunately, of the ACTU and others&mdash;those attempts have failed totally. When we look at this in the broader perspective we find that we can bring up case after case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look further at what happened with the Harrison inquiry and the Full Bench when the decision was made. The AMIEU was instructed by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission&mdash;and this is where the Industrial Relations Commission is powerless&mdash;not to break any of the agreements that were put in place between MATFA and the ACTU and the AMIEU, and they turned their noses up at it. They turned their noses up at President Joe Riordan. The Australian Industrial Relations Commission, when looking at the Harrison report, once again recommended that a consultative committee be put in place. What happened with regard to that consultative committee? It was torpedoed once again by Mr Curran and the AMIEU&mdash;a repeat of what happened three years ago. Then Senator Cook and Mr Crean decided they would set up their own private little consultative committee&mdash;it is a pity that the Minister has left the chamber&mdash;and one might well ask what has happened to that. It has been torpedoed once again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So when people get up here and pick out small examples of areas where they claim their policy is working, they are not looking at the total picture. They are not looking at what can be done on an industry by industry or broader basis. They just pick a selective little case in most instances where many of the employers have been coerced into a position where they have no option but to go along with the forces that the big unions apply to them at a particular time. Their other option is to go bankrupt. And of course that is what has happened to many of the export abattoirs around this country, particularly in Victoria. Victoria now has less than half the number of export abattoirs that it had 10 years ago. Yet not long ago, when the wool crisis was on, many stock in this country were shot because there was not a competitive processing industry that could take them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All Senator Bell's amendment will do is facilitate our current problems. The problems of the meat industry in Victoria extend to Western Australia, South Australia, the Northern Territory, Tasmania, New South Wales and Queensland&mdash;right across this whole nation. They have not been addressed by the so-called conciliatory process of the current Government, nor will they be addressed by Senator Bell's amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to talk about some of the changes we have to make to our current position, a position that Senator Cook regularly misrepresents. We have put in place a number of safety nets to allow much more freedom of choice in industrial relations, freedom for individuals to work out their own arrangements. The first safety net is that, if both parties wish to stay in the current system, they may&mdash;but both parties must wish to stay in. The second safety net is that, if one or other party does not or cannot reach a workplace agreement, then the award conditions of that day will remain as if a contract had been formed and will not be varied until both parties agree. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third safety net, which has already been enlarged on here today, is that where a workplace agreement is formed, that will be subject to some minimum standards. The first one is the minimum hourly rate, the second one is in terms of holidays, the third one is in terms of maternity leave and the fourth one is in terms of sick leave. I shall enlarge on those at another time. The fifth one is something which does not exist now, and that is an employee's advocate. The role of the Office of the Employee's Advocate will be to look after problems regarding unpaid wages, agreed entitlements or people unfairly dismissed or treated. So there will be protection there; a safety net will be in place. The sixth one is that, in the event of the breach of a contract or a workplace agreement, a $5,000 maximum will be put in place on which any action under common law can be taken. That, once again, is a first in terms of safety nets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our industrial relations position is such that, unless we are prepared to face the issue of lifting productivity in Australia, not only will we continue to see the fall in real wages that this Government has delivered to employees in this country but we will also continue to see one million people unemployed. That is what this Government&mdash;those people on the other side, the Minister Senator Cook and others&mdash;has delivered and will continue to deliver. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight we are debating as a matter of urgency the motion moved by Senator Parer in which he urges the Government to adopt Jobsback&mdash;as he puts it, the coalition's `worker friendly, enterprise based, high wage, new jobs policy'. It is quite interesting tonight to watch the metamorphosis of Senator Parer. He has gone from being a decent bloke to a salesman. Senator Parer as a salesman is a unique thing in this place. Sure, he might starve as a salesman, but still, it is a new job he has taken on. It is to sell this new package, this new product called Jobsback. It is worker friendly&mdash;as if it is cuddly, it is lovable and it is so good and so safe that you can even give it to your kids. That is what he has tried to sell&mdash;Jobsback.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that in Senator Parer's attempt to sell this proposal he has no option but to move further to the right, just as the whole Hewson Opposition has moved further to the right of industrial relations matters at a time when the rest of the world, the USA, the United Kingdom&mdash;those countries that have experimented with the sorts of things that the Hewson Opposition is proposing&mdash;have moved away from the sort of approach that Dr Hewson wants to take. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, it is a bit of a problem for the Opposition because the timing is not so good. Jeff Kennett ends up being elected as Premier of Victoria. The worst thing about the election of Jeff Kennett in Victoria is that Jeff Kennett has put into place exactly the sorts of industrial relations propositions that the Liberals have been floating in Fightback and Jobsback. That is embarrassing because, as Peter Reith said the other day, `we had a deal'&mdash;and I know what the deal was. Peter Reith, representing the Federal Liberals, had a deal that, presumably, Jeff Kennett would not implement its so-called hard-line industrial relations reforms, the sorts of things that are contained in Fightback and Jobsback, before the next Federal election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The worst thing about it is that if Premier Kennett introduces them, the people of Victoria&mdash;and now the people of Australia&mdash;will suddenly start to realise what the industrial relations policies of the Liberals look like in practice, rather than in some thick book which presumably all the Liberals take to bed with them each night and read for comfort. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What stands out clearly about the way Jeff Kennett has approached industrial relations? The first thing that stands out that has so much similarity with the Hewson package is the need to take away the sort of things that people have held to be important and to take them away overnight. The second thing that stands out and is related to the first is the Opposition's disdain for one of the essential components of successful industrial relations. I refer to the need to consult and to bring all sides into the discussions. The Opposition's whole package&mdash;theoretically or in the practice that Jeff Kennett has put into place&mdash;has shown that the Opposition looks down on the concept of discussion and negotiation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third feature of the Opposition's package and the package that Jeff Kennett is putting into place is that those opposite look down on the necessity to negotiate with people. Opposition members look down on labour because they treat it just like any other commodity&mdash;money, computers, products. Somewhere along the line labour gets put into the cost arrangements. Those opposite think that somehow or other dropping wages, depressing the power of the union movement, depressing the workers into a position where they have no bargaining power, are essential components of a new economy. They think that we can follow the trail of Indonesia and all these other low wage countries. That is not the future for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When those opposite look at the record of this Labor Government, obviously they are embarrassed. They are embarrassed because we have listened to some of the things that Opposition members used to say. We have even listened to people on the other side who have shown sensitivity in this area and a certain degree of sensibleness. We have said to them, `Okay, some of the things you have said in the past have been right'. Unions have even listened to what management has been saying, to what those opposite have been saying, to what some people in our Government have been saying and they have said `Yes, enterprise bargaining is an acceptable way to go'. But the difference is that this Government has brought about those changes or encouraged those changes at a pace which is acceptable to the Australian community and to the players in the industrial relations world. I refer to the workers, unions, management, and also government. We have been prepared to preside over an evolving industrial relations system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Everyone recognised in 1983 that the industrial relations system in this country had to change; I do not think anyone had any doubts about that. The difference was that we said that change has to be at a pace which is acceptable to the community, that one cannot impose change by government decree or by Fightback or by son of Fightback. Those opposite cannot just take some sort of dogmatic prescription laid down in their little book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS>&mdash;which they take to bed with them every night&mdash;as the way to go and say, `This is what we will impose on the community', especially those people in the industrial relations arena. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If those opposite think this is just a member of the Government speaking, then they should look at what some other people are saying. I am thinking of people who have had long experience in this area, people who have to employ other people, people who have to create jobs, people who have to have a decent bottom line and of what they have had to say about this Government's industrial relations policy.

<PARA>The point is that it has been done already under this Government. The reporter asked Brian Loton:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Does that mean you're quite happy for a weakening in the IRC, and indeed the unions?</PARA>
<PARA>Brian Loton said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No, I'm not talking about a weakening in unions. I am talking about enterprise bargaining where the people in the enterprise are able to have an adequate say in the arrangements that obtain in their workplaces, which is what we do in BHP right now and have done it for many years . . .</PARA>
<PARA>I can add to that `and under a Labor Government'. It happened because we encouraged it, the union movement sought the opportunities and because it was prepared to talk. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We started workplace reform about four years ago, about 1988/89, and we have spread it around most of our sites now. We have got 28 sites that have now got an enterprise agreement in place . . .</PARA>
<PARA>He further said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The union leadership at the top has been very enlightened and helpful and supportive of these sorts of moves.

<PARA>Garry Brack of the New South Wales Employers Federation was the most dubious about the Fightback proposals. He said that the coalition policy was neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for industrial progress and improved productivity. He said that making laws is not relevant, but that changing cultures is. That is exactly what we have been talking about in this Government for a long time. Cultures are changed not by imposing them from the top, by government, but from beneath&mdash;from the middle and from the top, altogether. That has been achieved under this Government. This Government was the first anywhere in the world to set in place a social contract, a social award, called the accord. That accord has lasted, in various ways, over nine years. </PARA>

We have had workplace agreements proceeding positively around this country. In the last 12 months 360 individual workplace agreements have been approved by the Industrial Relations Commission. Superannuation, as part of the increased wages component, has given many more people in the Australian community&mdash;many more workers&mdash;an opportunity for superannuation and a decent retirement than ever before.

That is an acute personal problem, not only for the million that are a consequence of the policies that Senator Aulich has labled as having been successfully implemented by this Government, but it is also an acute national problem. This motion states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The need for the Government to abandon its failed big unions, big governments, compulsory centralised wage fixing system which has contributed to record unemployment, and adopt `Jobsback', the Coalition's worker friendly, enterprise based, high wage new jobs policy.</PARA>
<PARA>The reason for the motion is the very serious failure of the industrial relations policy of the Labor Government. It is always disappointing in a debate like this, where there should be some content, to follow a speech as devoid of content as that that we have had from Senator Aulich. I just hope that in his new career as a writer he does not suffer from the same sort of block when he is writing his novels, because things would be a little hard for him if he did. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point is that Australia is now at one of the great change points in its history. We have seen a similar situation in the last 45 years. We saw the period after the end of the Second World War, between 1945 and 1949, when Australia had become an industrial country. We had a Labor Government in place and it was totally unable to get its affairs organised and to maximise, for the benefit of Australian citizens, the great advances made industrially throughout the Second World War. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Government was voted out in 1949 and we went into the golden age of Australian politics of this century under the Menzies Government. We had in place a system which gave rising living standards, year after year; a greatly expanding population; and zero unemployment. Throughout that period of great economic growth we had social stability and we did not have the crime levels that we have now plaguing the Australian society. We have a similar change point before Australia at present. There are great changes in the international trading pattern. We have seen the end of the Cold War and the breaking up of the trading blocs. We need to change. We have got to be competitive, in the jargon of the times, with best international practice. We must change the way we do things. If we do that we can prosper, and we certainly could do it if the Government would move. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen the end of the labour intensive manufacturing industries and the growth of the service industries&mdash;the tertiary sector. That requires a totally different management scheme to the big jack-booted, big unions, big government style that this Government knows so well. People have to be treated as individuals and provided with incentives in order to get the best out of them. In fairness to this Government, I do think it recognises that to some degree. The problem it has is that it only went halfway down the path. It did deregulate the financial markets but clearly did not do that properly because the checks and balances necessary in that system were not implemented. But what it can never do is deregulate the labour market, and these two changes must go hand in hand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The power of the union movement is still paramount in too many industries. We have the archaic systems that Senator Parer talked about with a centralised wage system. No other country in the world sets a wage for a similar task right across the country. To do so, means that many industries do not get started. People working in country towns can afford to work for less because their rates, travel expenses and property values are a lot lower than in the centre of a capital city. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one looks at what has happened in the United States this century, one will see that many world giants started in small towns. A small town, Cedar Rapids, produced Collins Radio, which is now part of the Rockwell Corporation, one of the giants in the international communications world. That started because of the cheap workforce in a country town. Those sorts of things clearly cannot happen under Labor's policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had 20 minutes of Senator Cook. He was talking about the problems as he saw them with the coalition's policies. I have to say that my mind turns to an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> dated 22 October which was headed, `Assault on coalition's IR policy damaged by Cook'. The first paragraph reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The federal Minister for Industrial Relations, Senator Cook, yesterday badly hurt the Government's assault on the coalition's industrial policy by first arguing it would greatly disadvantage workers and then accusing the Opposition of stealing the Government's ideas.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Cook's speech tonight showed that that confusion still exists in his mind, and that there is no coherent policy coming from the Government at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 10 years that we have now had a Labor Government, we have seen no changes in Australia's productivity. We still have one of the lowest increases in productivity, year by year, of any country in the Western World. Certainly we have seen some change on the waterfront, and the waterfront is crucial to us. We are moving more containers an hour, but the cost to the shipper is still the same&mdash;the money has not gone back in the form of lower charges for shippers as a consequence of that change. We still do not meet the movement rate for containers that is met in Singapore, and do not let us have any of this business that Singapore is a cheap, low wage, sweated labour country. Average weekly earnings now in Singapore are higher than in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The big problem has been that the Labor Party is the political wing of the union movement, rather than the union movement being the industrial wing of the political party. The union movement tells the Labor Party what is to be done. In fairness, too, to the leaders of the ACTU, they recognise the need for change but they have been hamstrung by the huge, inert, uninformed mass of the Labor movement. They have tried to move the Labor movement along a bit, but the load is just too great for them to bear, so nothing much is happening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The big chance for us is the production of the Jobsback policy by the Liberal and National parties. It will go most of the way towards reforming the work practices in Australia. If all the procedures are implemented in government, we will see a reformation in work practices in Australia. We will see the return of rising living standards instead of the falling living standards which have characterised the years of this Government. We will see a high productivity, high wage policy. We will see the removal of restrictions on working hours and, most importantly, we will see the end of compulsory unionism. People will be able to join a union if they want to and they will not be discriminated against in any way at all for exercising that right. But those who do not want to join a union will be able to take up workplace agreements and they will be subject to compulsory minimal standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In everything that will be done to change industrial relations under a Liberal-National Party government there will be a secure and complete safety net so that people will not be held to ransom by unreconstructed eighteenth or nineteenth century capitalistic employers. As well as the other procedures, we are going to set up an Office of the Employee Advocate which will give free advice to any worker who feels he has a grievance against his employer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When those changes are implemented, we will see Australia start to develop, to grow, and take its rightful place in the world, and we will see a reduction in that huge legacy of one million unemployed&mdash;which is only the consequence of the failure of the Labor Party to deal with a changed Australian and international industrial scene. We can do it; we are well able to do it. The only obstacle between Australia and the goals that we have been outlining is the Labor Government. Come the next election, the Labor Party will go just the way the Labor Government did in 1949, and it will go for precisely the same reason: a total inability to react to demands placed on it by a changed society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party might be all right at running the status quo&mdash;and I have great reservations about that&mdash;but, given the magnitude and scope of change that is before us now, the Labor Party has proved in the last 10 years that it is utterly incompetent and inadequate at coming up with anything that is satisfactory for the needs of Australia. The fact that we have over a million unemployed out on the streets today is living testimony to that. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The need for Government to abandon its failed big unions, big government, compulsory centralised wage fixing system which has contributed to record unemployment, and adopt `Jobsback', the Coalition's worker friendly, enterprise based, high wage new jobs policy.</PARA>
<PARA>I strongly support this motion because I strongly support the need to pay higher wages and salaries to Australian workers. I strongly support the need to create more jobs and a more competitive Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to contrast that with the attitude of the Labor Party. I was interested in the concession, albeit a small concession, that Senator Aulich made in his remarks that the Labor Party had listened to the comments that we and many other people had made on its policies and had moved to address those concerns. I remind you, Madam Acting Deputy President, of what Mr Keating said just some three years ago, almost to the day, about the Metal Trades Industry Association. On 31 October 1989, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Those organisations know what enterprise bargaining means: it means that they get cut to ribbons. They are in the eye of the storm.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Childs will remember that all through the campaign leading up to the last Federal election there was this constant attack on enterprise bargaining. Again, Mr Keating said in the Parliament:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Does anybody believe that in an economy with any growth, particularly such as we have had, the enterprise bargaining model would do anything other than lift wage rates and inflation way beyond the levels at which they are now?</PARA>
<PARA>It is interesting that enterprise bargaining in 1989 was going to lift wage levels. Senator Childs will remember that. The Opposition was attacked because, under its policy of enterprise bargaining, as it then was, wages would supposedly rise too far. The 1992 attack is that under the workplace agreements real wages would fall. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can see, once again, the big scare tactics of the Labor Party. But I think it goes a little further than that. We now have a government that has been in office for some 10 years. We have a government whose model of managing the Australian economy has been tested. It has had the time to show us what its policies will deliver. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I started my remarks by saying that I am concerned about the need to lift the living standards of Australian workers. I have had some statistics pulled out by the Parliamentary Library to see what has happened to the living standards of the average Australian worker under the union controlled Keating Labor Government. What has that done to the average incomes of Australian workers? One way of measuring this is to look at what has happened to real average weekly earnings. It is interesting&mdash;and these are in 1989-90 dollars, so we are comparing like with like&mdash;that in 1982-83 real average weekly after tax earnings were $24,718. Almost 10 years later, in 1991-92, the comparative figure is $24,346. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So over this period of the accord&mdash;it is the Labor Party's accord; it is the Labor Party's policy; it is what the Bill Keltys and Martin Fergusons of this world developed to run the Australian economy&mdash;what did it do for Australian workers? The first measure is: what did it do for living standards? We find that over that period, on the latest figures that are available to me, real average earnings did not stabilise or increase marginally under the policies of the Labor Party; they fell. That is why I believe the Australian public will reject the Labor model. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But we know there is some debate about whether average weekly earnings is the best measure of living standards. I have discussed other measures in this chamber, and Senator Cook has repeatedly failed to take up my challenge because he knows the fact is that the Keating Labor policies have cut the average weekly earnings, the living standards, of Australian workers. That is one measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second measure is: what has the Bill Kelty-Martin Ferguson-Paul Keating accord done for jobs? It is an important issue, and we can see that unemployment in this country has risen to record levels under the Labor Party's policies. A table published in the latest <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist </EMPHASIS>measures the unemployment statistics of 24 countries. Where does Australia come? I will just go through the main ones that have a better unemployment record than Australia: Japan, Ireland, Switzerland, Portugal, West Germany, Greece, Austria, Sweden, Norway, Holland, Turkey, United States, Belgium, Italy, Britain&mdash;Britain has a better unemployment rate, at 10.1 per cent, despite all the comments by Senator Button&mdash;New Zealand, which also has 10.1 per cent, and France. Then there is Australia. Australia has an unemployment rate of 11 per cent under Labor Party policies. All those countries I mentioned have done infinitely better running their economies than the Labor model has done running this economy. So the Labor Party has failed to increase living standards and lower unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at productivity and see whether Labor Party policies are making us more competitive. I can draw on the very extensive work of the Australian Chamber of Commerce. It has noted during the 1990s that the productivity growth in Australian industry has been about half that of other industrialised countries. So when we take those three statistics&mdash;the fall in living standards, unemployment, the miserable productivity growth&mdash;and compare them with the disastrous foreign debt which has grown up under the Labor Government, we can see what Labor policies have produced. Jobsback is a policy which is designed to tackle that problem effectively.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yes, the Government has made some gains and has moved&mdash;albeit very marginally&mdash;towards our policy. The trouble is that, as the Australian Chamber of Commerce says, even though Australia may be running faster in a number of areas, our competitors are running even faster and Australia is therefore still falling behind in commercial, economic and trading terms. That is what the Government's model has produced&mdash;failure, failure, failure. That is why Australians need new hope and a new policy and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Jobsback</EMPHASIS> offers that policy. </PARA>

<PARA>I reject that motion, but I want to thank Senator Parer for the opportunity he has given to Senator Cook, Senator Aulich and myself to describe the steady progress of the cooperative industrial relations system that has developed under this Government; a system that has built multiskilling, training and education into the work force for the first time. It has created career structures in industry for the first time and changed the industrial culture of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The consistent reduction of industrial disputes is one of the best indicators of our success and in the last decade we have seen more positive change in this country than in the previous 40 years. During many of those years the conservative parties occupied government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to congratulate Senator Parer for not smiling when he described the coalition's Jobsback proposal as `worker friendly'. I really want to congratulate him because the phrase `worker friendly' is really creative, but it is a creative camouflage. If this coalition were ever to be successful and become the Government, it would introduce a GST led increase in prices and an industrial relations system that would reduce wages. The term `worker-friendly' is as sincere as Premier Jeff Kennett's election promise. Jeff was worker friendly before the election and, of course, he breached those promises, as others have pointed out. He is now following the coalition's real program of prices up and wages down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Parer has said that that is a number one priority of the coalition. I welcome that, because industrial relations is, under the coalition, a key part of their program. Of course, the other part of it is something Dr Hewson and Premier Kennett are devotees of, that is, trickle-down economics. This is the style of the coalition. It is to help the rich and belt the battlers. It does not work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The policies of greed and selfishness are being rejected across the world. Tomorrow Clinton will become the President of the United States because the Reagan-Bush policies which Hewson and Kennett have followed have left American industry stagnant. In the United Kingdom Prime Minister Major has followed the same slash and burn ideology as the coalition and he is in a terminal state as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. The coalition is still going on with the same big bang policies and economic fundamentalism which has been abandoned elsewhere in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to draw attention to Jobsback and Fightback and the policy that the coalition is putting forward of moving people away from the award system. New contracts only have to contain minimum requirements and for annual leave, sick leave and maternity leave the lowest minimum award rate will apply. Therefore, employers can present employees with agreements which cut people's pay by reducing hourly wages, abolishing annual leave loadings and eliminating penalty rates and shift and overtime allowances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Parer talked about where he worked in his previous employment. I have done shift work and, as far as I am concerned, when people have to work shift work or work over the weekends and their life is disrupted by those conditions, then they are entitled to be recompensed for that. They should not have those conditions arbitrarily taken from them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, eliminating penalty rates and shift work and overtime allowances is absolutely scandalous, just as removing the limits on daily working hours is unfair and unjust. That is what the coalition is setting out to do and, in addition, it will reduce casual loadings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minimum wage proposal does not protect employees' existing incomes. Apart from putting overtime, penalty rates and shift rates up for grabs, it is only the lowest minimum base rate in the award which is guaranteed. In a typical minimum rates award, the base rate, plus any supplementary payment, are added to produce the award rate of pay. The term `base rate' is used in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Jobsback</EMPHASIS> and the Victorian legislation. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For many workers, the difference between their classification rate and the lowest base rate in the award is significant. It would be financially devastating for them. This is not worker friendly; there is no way it can be. For example, the minimum award rate for a metal industry trades person would fall from $417.20 per week, including supplementary payments, to $284.80 per week with no supplementary payments. </PARA>

Perhaps that assumes that the worker will be offered a full 38-hour week. When workers understand this there will be a riot, because of the unjustness of reducing wages from $417 to about $284. Moreover, once the term of the initial contract has expired, employers will be able to withdraw from the agreement and so remove any lingering legal necessity for an employee's existing entitlements to be preserved.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">John Howard, the spokesman for the Opposition, has stated that he expects an employer's terms to be the abolition of penalty rates and shift and overtime allowances, as I have said, and the expansion of working hours. Today Senator Cook has pointed out that the Opposition has never attempted to reconcile its claims that no worker will be worse off with its proposal that employers should be able to run their business 24 hours a day, 365 days a year without penalty, because they are irreconcilable. This is the hidden agenda that Premier Kennett introduced. We have had a taste of what it would be like if the Federal coalition were to be elected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In contrast, I wish to refer to the Government's focus on industrial relations which is based on fairness and a central distinction between its approach to industrial relations and that of the Opposition.

These agreements cover matters such as a change in the organisation of work; introducing more flexible conditions of employment to match fluctuations in demand and workloads; assisting workers in balancing work and family responsibilities; and improving the working environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most significantly, these agreements cover the acquisition of skills and training. As Senator Cook has pointed out, the Opposition just does not comprehend that point. There has to be trust and an agreed arrangement. It is something that has to be done between equals if the skills of the work force are to be upgraded. It is a glaring omission in the coalition's package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other features of the Government's approach include the better use of plant and machinery. Therefore, there will be an increase in flexibility in the current industrial relations system of this country. The flexibility the Opposition wants is to drive down earnings. That is what Jobsback is all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Changes in the Industrial Relations Act by the Government this year were designed to encourage and facilitate the use of certified agreements. There are simple criteria to be met: there will be no disadvantage to the employees; dispute settling provisions; consultation by unions with effective members; and, unlike the policy of the Opposition, the Government allows flexibility in bargaining arrangements while protecting the socially desirable minimum standards. These new certified provisions of the Act ensure that a significant freedom is now available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition policy ignores the question of who has power in the employment relationship. It assumes that individual employees are in a position to bargain on an equal footing with an employer. Around the developed world, systems of labour law have been established to overcome the natural power imbalance between employers, who have the power to hire and fire, to direct investment and design the workplace, and employees, who have only their skills to sell. That is really the key to it. It is a worldwide phenomenon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's industrial relations system is designed to overcome this obvious power imbalance. By abolishing mechanisms that exist to ensure that bargaining is relatively fair and equitable, the Opposition policy undermines the ability of employees to bargain effectively and defend their interests. With high unemployment, many workers will not be in a position to bargain with their employer but will be forced to accept whatever employers offer. That applies particularly to young workers, women workers in many situations and people with a migrant background. It is the opposite to industrial democracy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, when speaking tonight, many Opposition senators indicated a lack of understanding of how people exist in industry at this moment. They believe and postulate that people with a migrant background, often with little English, could go into negotiations with an employer, with all the resources of the employer at his disposal, and negotiate fairly. That is just not true. The Opposition policy of trying to undermine trade unions and prevent them from being the voice and the weapon of workers to gain a fair result is just unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I oppose the proposal that has been put by Senator Parer. This Government will not abandon the centralised but flexible industrial relations system because it is fair. Jobsback is not worker friendly and will be rejected by the Australian people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to wrap up this debate. In urgency motions, we normally expect the Australian Democrats to come in here and make some sort of a pious amendment that normally neuters the urgency motion. I was somewhat intrigued to see what they would do in this instance. In view of their past practice, which means they really do not support one party or the other, and the fact that they never come up with any of their own policies, much to my surprise when I read this amendment and following discussions with my colleagues, particularly Senator Crane, it was apparent that, with very minor semantic exceptions, the amendment moved by Senator Bell totally supports the coalition's Jobsback program. For that reason, we will support the amendment that was moved by Senator Bell.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thought it was best to point this out. Senator Bell's amendment talks about the need to accelerate the pace of industrial relations reform. That is what Jobsback is all about. The current system, the system that is promoted by the Labor Party, is adversarial. It promotes the proposition that East is East and West is West and never the twain shall meet, because it promotes unions negotiating instead of relationships being built up between workers and their own employers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrat amendment talks about streamlined enterprise agreements. We use the word `workplace', but that is a question of semantics and I am happy to accept the use of the word `enterprise' instead of `workplace'. But that is exactly what Jobsback is all about. It encourages cooperation between the participants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Who are the participants in any factory or workplace? The management and the workers. That is exactly what occurs, for example, in successful countries such as Japan. The attitudinal position is such that there is a recognition that if an organisation succeeds, so too will the people who work in that organisation. If it fails, they fail. So there is a common interest in promoting the success of the enterprise itself. The amendment goes on further to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . in the labour market, whereby enterprise agreements would function in a system which safeguards minimum award wages and conditions . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Again, Jobsback is all about safeguarding minimum award wages and conditions. That is the starting point for any workplace-type agreements. Naturally, there are benefits to both sides in being able to increase productivity and having everyone share in that increased productivity, be it the workers at the plant or the shareholders themselves. Of course, it ensures that the public interest is maintained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By way of summary and reinforcing what I have said, the Jobsback policy restores people to the heart of the industrial relations process. Australia's future lies not with institutions but with individual working men and women. The policy is a high productivity-high wage policy. Workplace reform will be driven by the enhanced personal freedom and flexibility contained in this policy. There will be the largest personal income tax cuts in Australia's history under the Fightback program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The removal of restrictions on working hours will make it easier for parents to blend their family and workplace responsibilities, which is a cry we have heard for years. But, because of the inflexibility of the current system, people have not been able to go along with those sorts of changes. The coalition policy ends compulsory arbitration. Employers and employees will be able to choose between awards or workplace agreements. That is their choice. What is wrong with giving individuals that freedom?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Workplace agreements will be subject to compulsory minimum standards. Employees will be given a free grievance service through the new office of the employee advocate. Where an employer and an employee cannot agree on either an award or a workplace agreement, the award will terminate but the employee will continue to enjoy all the benefits of the award until further agreements between the parties are made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not go into the final issues because I am running out of time. However, I should point out that membership of all organisations will be voluntary. Likewise, those who join unions will be protected against victimisation, the closed shop will be prohibited, as will union preference clauses in awards and agreements, and the convenient `belong and roping in' features of the present system will disappear. </PARA>

<PARA>I would like to bring to the attention of the Senate a number of factors relating to the 1991-92 annual report on the operation of the Bankruptcy Act and highlight what I would term a tragedy equal to unemployment in this country. We have just had a debate on the need for some effective change in the industrial relations area. Page 15 of the annual report sets out what has occurred in Australia and the blame for this must rest firmly and squarely with those opposite and their State counterparts, particularly in Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we compare the bankruptcy figures in 1991-92 and 1990-91, we find that there has been an overall increase of 28.2 per cent.

At a hearing on youth unemployment last week in Perth in Western Australia, we were told that 35 per cent of youth are unemployed and 33 per cent are underemployed, which means that 31 per cent of youth there have a full time job.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA>I table the report and wish to make a statement in relation to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth noting that the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade recently tabled in this place a report on Latin America. Indeed, I had the opportunity to present some very fresh-off-the-press copies of that report in Argentina and Brazil. So the report of our delegation is closely related to that report, and is timely because it reinforces the message of the Latin American report and also strengthens ties between Australia and Argentina and Australia and Brazil. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From my point of view the delegation was very successful, enjoyable, informative and friendly. As far as I know, the only book that will be written about this trip is the one honourable senators have in front of them. I should particularly like to thank the secretary, Ilze Svenne and Jessie Byrne-Hoffman who accompanied us from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and also the staff and ambassadors at the embassies, as well as our parliamentary liaison people who helped set up a very useful and busy schedule for us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My view of Argentina and Brazil is that they are first world countries with third world underbellies. They have great wealth and natural resources, but the wealth of both countries has been squandered over recent years. Both countries confront a very challenging time in their own history of trying to regroup their political and social resources as well as their natural resources to try to create better prospects for their peoples to participate in that wealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both countries have experienced military government. The Argentinian Government is of more recent history and it was a much more brutal one during its time in office. As a consequence of that recent history, both countries are very strenuously opposed to the return of the military. Although in view of the more recent history and the crueller nature of the military government in Argentina, I felt people in Argentina were just a little clearer in their messages of total opposition to return to military government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both countries are very strongly committed to democracy, and both made that very clear to the delegation. Both too are committed to reforming their economies, in particular trying to hold down inflation. It is fair to say our delegation found that Argentina was managing this better than was Brazil. Both countries are looking to privatise some of their service provisions and moving towards a mixed economy much more than they have at the moment. Both countries are acutely aware that if they cannot hold down inflation and send coherent strategies for managing their economy, then they will not draw in the foreign investment which they desperately need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also important to know that both countries are supporters of Australia, particularly in the GATT Round. They also support the same position in terms of the chemical weapons ban and the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. So there are many reasons why this delegation enjoyed a particularly useful time in both countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While Australia, Argentina and Brazil line up as friends, particularly in the face of the common enemy of the United States and the European Community in trade in commodities such as wheat and primary produce, my view is that the present is a useful time for Australia to work out its future relations with these two countries because that would be better facilitated while we are friends. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once international trade changes, we will certainly find ourselves in competition with both Argentina and Brazil because we provide and supply very much the same commodities to international markets. But the delegation can certainly report that we were made very welcome, we were taken very seriously, and the points of discussion were not marginal to any of the countries involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Argentina, President Menem gave the delegation a session with him of almost one hour and he was very free and open in strengthening the message we had been getting from many parliamentarians and Ministers of their commitment to democracy and an open economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its visit to Argentina the delegation was particularly focused on meeting with parliamentarians and people at ministerial level, so we perhaps did not have a quite sufficient opportunity to talk with non-government organisations or to get a flavour of the country or the people themselves outside of the main government buildings and the parliament. One thing that very much entertained and delighted me was our visit to Cordoba, which is about an hour's flight from Buenos Aires. When we went there we visited its parliament&mdash;a provincial parliament very much akin to our State parliaments. Cordoba is a town which was established in the time of the first forays of the Spanish and Portuguese into that country. It has a university which was established by the Jesuits way back then&mdash;some 400 years ago&mdash;and a parliament to match. But these people have a bicameral parliament and only one chamber&mdash;and they were delighted to tell us that the lower house sits on Tuesday and the upper house sits on Thursday and on Monday, Wednesday and Friday they have committee meetings. It struck me that this would be a particularly useful way of tackling problems in other countries, but I do not know that it will be adopted in too many other places. The other interesting thing about that parliament is that one had to approach it through a mall to get to some of the entrances, so quite clearly one had to rub shoulders with the people whose parliament it was. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this debate continues at another time, there will be more opportunity to spell out the flavour of the countries. They are countries of great energy, optimism and liveliness. Certainly if one goes to a soccer match in Buenos Aires one comes away with the sense that music, song, dance and ceaseless movement and energy are particular characteristics of that place&mdash;and I think very much the same applies to Brazil. We were there prior to the decision by the Brazilian Parliament to move to the impeachment of President Collor. Certainly a flavour of that was in the air, so it added, if you like, an air of excitement to our visits to the Brazilian Parliament, and certainly some anxiety as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to briefly mention the concerns I had about the huge tracts of slums inhabited by poor people. In Argentina the poor areas or slums were called `villa miserias'; in Brazil they were called `favellas'. Nobody could tell us how many people were in those tracts or slums, and therefore we could not be sure of what government finances over the years would be committed to expenditure in terms of housing, schooling, provision of health services and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One statistic that stays with me&mdash;and the figures that we have in the report give a higher number&mdash;relates to the number of illegal abortions. We were told in Brazil that there were 150,000 deaths from abortions over 10 years. That is 15,000 women who die each year in Brazil from illegal abortion, and I am very concerned that those numbers seem to be not a matter of concern or international recognition. Indeed, some would put the figure higher than that, but I wonder what would happen if 15,000 men were dying of AIDS in Brazil. I suspect we might have a different international recognition of the tragedy involved in that number of deaths.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I might say again for Senator Harradine that they are qualified figures; one cannot be sure. In Argentina we talked about the very significant changes with the foreign Minister, Dr di Tella. He told us that in Argentina they had conducted a significant debate about a referendum to delete the requirement for the President and Vice President to be catholic. I would have thought that that is very significant in a catholic country and a matter of ongoing debate in terms of its constitutional reform. Apparently the country can cope with that. It has also been able to cope with the debate about divorce law reform and decriminalisation of homosexual rites between consenting adults. But, as we say in our report:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He did not believe that the country was yet mature enough to enter into a debate on abortion.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a matter of great concern when, as we were given to understand, so many people in those tracts of slums, particularly women, survive by prostitution. No-one is sanctioning that, but one of the consequences of living with that sort of poverty is that there may be many unwanted pregnancies and decisions about abortion. I would hate to leave you with the sense that our delegation was overwhelmed by that tragedy, but it could not ignore it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the time available to me I have not been able to say anything about the concern and commitment we picked up in relation to things environmental. It was very useful for the delegation to go to Manaus on the Amazon River and get some sense of the size of the environmental concern and problem. Cutting down trees is a worry in the Amazon Basin but not nearly as much of a worry as the gold mining and mercury poisoning that comes from the many gold panners, with that amount of mercury now beginning to accumulate in the tributaries of that great river system. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">MIGRATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Effective management of the migration program is essential in ensuring that planned program outcomes are not exceeded.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Act currently provides for two broad program control mechanisms. Namely, the power to suspend processing in specified classes and a system of passmarks for the Independent and Concessional Family categories. This passmark system, which is currently in operation, controls visa issue by allowing for the approval, "pooling" and rejection of applications.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The suspension power in Section 28 of the Act has not been exercised but it forms a powerful administrative tool in ensuring that program levels are not exceeded. However, it is also a very blunt one. There is no facility to set a numerical limit. It also unnecessarily suspends all processing, even where that processing would not result in the program being exceeded. Resorting to an across-the-board suspension power would cause very uneven workload patterns at overseas posts and, given the processing delays involved, would lessen the capacity of the program to be increased readily.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill will remedy these problems by supplementing the visa suspension powers. The new provisions permit the imposition of numerical ceilings, or caps, for a class or classes of visas and allow the processing of applications up to the point of grant. The cap would be gazetted by the Minister for a financial program year. Once the cap is reached, no more visas in the capped class or classes will be able to be granted although other processing would not be impeded.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In order to ensure that the cap is not inadvertently exceeded the Bill permits the Minister to implement an effective administrative mechanism which allows the orderly grant of visas while the cap is in place. This mechanism will, for instance, allow the Minister to impose ceilings on the number of visas that can be granted at overseas posts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will allow the Minister to determine orderly release of visas to fill places when the cap is lifted. The Minister may target the grant of visas in accordance with the priorities of the migration program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consistent with section 28 the new capping provisions will not apply to certain classes of visas in the Preferential Family category.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also corrects a minor technical error of reference in the Migration Amendment Act (No.2) of 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I present the explanatory memorandum for the Bill and present the Bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sections 3(1) and 3(2) of this Bill contain consequential amendments to section 26 of the principal Act resulting from changes in schedules 7 and 8 to this Bill. Section 26 allows consumer price index adjustments to be applied to beer, certain spirituous liquors and tobacco and petroleum products.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Schedule 1 to the Bill is operative from the first of January 1988 and contains amendments to correct anomalies which were created upon Australia's accession to the harmonised tariff. It provides a free rate of duty for aquarium aerators, transmission shafts and cranks for outboard motors and master recording blanks.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Schedule 2 corrects an anomaly caused by the implementation of the concessional tariff provisions of the Florence agreement on the first of July 1991. This change provides a free rate of duty for instructional books for certain games.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Schedule 3 is operative from the seventh of May 1992 and reduces the customs duty on aviation gasoline by 1 cent per litre. The decrease in duty begins the phasing out of the collection of that part of the duty on aviation gasoline attributable to the aerodrome cost recovery program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Schedule 4 is operative from the first of July 1992. It contains changes to schedules 3 and 5 to the principal Act to put in place government initiatives to assist footwear manufacturers. The changes remove quota restrictions from certain parts of footwear and introduce a new 10 per cent duty for the subject goods. These changes are accompanied by the accelerated phasing out of preference for goods from Hong Kong, the Republic of Korea, Singapore and Taiwan Province.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This schedule also contains the extension of quota restrictions on certain types of cheese. Administrative changes have been made to the duty free importation of pick-ups and utilities of thirty years or more of age and to components for passenger motor vehicles.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Government initiatives to assist food packaging and food processing industries are also contained in schedule 4. These changes will provide new duty free concessions to allow processors to import the latest overseas technology for use in these industries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Schedule 5, which is operative from the nineteenth of August 1992, increases the duty on certain tobacco products by $5.00 per kilogram, as announced by the Treasurer in his Budget speech. The duty on aviation gasoline is further reduced by 1.1 cents per litre. This results from the phasing out of the collection of that part of the customs duty attributable to the aerodrome cost recovery program and reductions in civil aviation authority costs of providing rescue and fire fighting services at airports.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As announced by the Government in March last year, quota arrangements for textile, clothing and footwear goods will be abolished from the first of March 1993. Schedule 6 contains a series of amendments to give effect to this policy. Goods previously subject to quota will be subject to ad valorem rates of duty. Concessional treatment of industrial crafts will also be abolished from the first of March next year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">New concessional item 61 is inserted in schedule 4 to the principal Act to give effect to the Government's overseas assembly provisions scheme. This scheme will allow designated manufacturers to export Australian made textile parts and to re-import the exported parts duty free in made-up articles.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Schedule 7 is operative from the first of July 1993. It redefines the rate of duty applicable to certain spirituous liquors of chapter 22 from Hong Kong, the Republic of Korea, Singapore and Taiwan Province.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The customs component of duty on imported beer is to be removed in schedule 8 to this Bill. In future imported beer will attract the same rate of duty as does locally brewed beer. This change will operate from fourteen days after this Bill receives royal assent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other changes contained in this Bill are of an administrative nature and in the main combine those national subheadings where the same rate of duty applies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Summaries of the amendments contained in this Bill have been prepared and are being circulated for the information of honourable senators.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research Amendment Bill 1992. The Opposition will be supporting this Bill. We actually think that the Centre has done an excellent job to date. The Centre was established in 1982 by the Fraser Government with the aim of creating a small, tightly focused organisation to coordinate the creation of cooperative projects in agricultural research. A sunset clause built into the legislation was an indication of the intention to create an organisation with a clear charter rather than just another bureaucratic body which would grow and take on a life of its own.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The review of the operation of the Centre which was carried out recently by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade with the specific purpose of making recommendations relating to whether the Centre should continue found that it had achieved many significant results within its modest budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many examples that can be cited of the immense benefits of well targeted research. I pick up one which I note the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) also referred to in his second reading speech&mdash;the CSIRO's well known expertise in entomology used in a cooperative project in Sri Lanka to control the salvinia water fern which had infested many ponds and irrigation channels. In less than 12 months the introduction of a beetle feeding on salvinia was able to destroy the dense mats that choked irrigation channels and reservoirs. I understand that, for expenditure of funds of $800,000, it is estimated that there will be returns of $25m over the next 25 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The beneficiaries will be rice farmers, fishermen and rural people generally who will suffer less from diseases spread by mosquitos breeding in the salvinia infested waters. There are many other examples that can be cited. The benefits to Australia should also be noted. The opportunity to work with scientists in other countries with conditions similar to ours can bring benefits for Australian agriculture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another example&mdash;coincidentally, I notice this was also mentioned in the Minister's second reading speech&mdash;is where Australian scientists were able to work in Thailand on projects developing tests for foot and mouth disease. That is one such instance which has helped to prevent the spread of foot and mouth disease in our region while providing Australian scientists with the opportunity to gain experience in fighting the disease without introducing the virus to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The benefits of this to Australia are obviously considerable. It has been estimated that the potential cost to Australia of an outbreak of foot and mouth disease would be $5 billion in the first year. What is particularly pleasing about such benefits is that they are in no way at the expense of benefits to the recipient government, and this is a characteristic of so many other ACIAR projects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another pleasing aspect of the Centre's mode of aid delivery is that it is extremely cost effective. Australian research institutions are required to contribute resources of their own, as do developing country partners. This gives incentives to the research organisations in both countries to select projects only of the highest priority to both sides. Such a commitment is an important ingredient of success. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Noting the success and cost-effectiveness of ACIAR, the Joint Committee review recommended that the Centre in fact receive an increased share of global aid budget from a level of around 1.3 per cent to 1.4 per cent, as it is at present, to 3.5 per cent in 1997. In dollar terms, the funding of the Centre is only about $17m, as I recall it, which against a foreign aid vote of somewhere around $1,400m gives an indication of what a small part it is of that considerable sum of money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In principle, we would accept that the share of the aid vote appropriated to this organisation in light of its record to date should be increased, and that would be the approach we would take into government after the next election. We think it is an example to other organisations to exist on such a modest budget with a staff of only about 30, yet be able to achieve so much for recipient Third World countries, as well as bring such credit and also practical returns to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do stress that in increasing the Centre's funding we would not wish to see it lose its lean, tightly focused method of operation. We believe that the tight funding which has been imposed on the Centre has no doubt acted as a discipline in sorting out priorities. However, it may also have meant that some valuable opportunities have been lost. Therefore, any increase in funding we hope will pick up the lost opportunities rather than contribute to any growth in a bureaucracy. We therefore wish to see ACIAR's funds expanded but not beyond its capacity to engage in the careful groundwork needed for the planning and development of successful projects.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My contribution is nearly complete. I think there will be a few other succinct contributions. If we can cooperate to help the program, we are happy to do so, provided that it does not take too long. The Bill also gives the power to the organisation to expand its function in a couple of ways. One is to implement development activities arising out of its research work. Another is to engage in training activities that, in effect, carry its research work further into practical application as well. The third area is to expand its capacity for dealing with other international agricultural research organisations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the first two, we support that extension but we do so with some caution. We wonder why it is necessary, and whether it is as a result of AIDAB having failed adequately to take up the opportunities for Australia's aid program through the research work of this organisation. Therefore, although, as I said, we support that expansion of function, we do so with that caveat&mdash;that we hope that it is not going to seek to become an aid delivery body when there are already existing aid delivery bodies that have been designed for that function. That is an issue that should be looked at carefully as the organisation proceeds in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, we have recognised that to be, as the Minister says, a lean, professional and efficient organisation with an excellent approach to its task. That has been the determination by the Joint Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee of this Parliament. This body has, therefore, certainly earned the right to continue after exhaustive examination of its performance and, as I said, it seems to have provided a lesson to other organs of government, particularly those within the foreign aid, research and delivery areas. I certainly wish the Centre well for the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats also believe that ACIAR has done an excellent job, as Senator Hill has just said. Indeed, on recent visits to South East Asia, the benefits of ACIAR's work in these areas have often been pointed out to me. The benefits to Australia are also very substantial. ACIAR gives very good value for expenditure. We would agree also with Senator Hill that perhaps the budget could be increased to some advantage to Australia and, indeed, to our region.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also note on the sunset clause the Government's response to recommendation 14 of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade when it looked into ACIAR. That recommendation was that the appropriate parliamentary committee inquire into the role of sunset clauses for statutory authorities, as the sunset clause in this Bill was quite useful. The Government's response is that it would be appropriate for the Joint Committee to draw the matter to the attention of the Presiding Officers of Parliament. I can only say that the Democrats believe that that is a very good idea, that sunset clauses should be in with statutory authority legislation. We look forward to seeing it in far more of the Bills that we see. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak in support of this Bill and in support of ACIAR. I was Chairman of the subcommittee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade that conducted the inquiry under the reference given to us by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to review the work of ACIAR in view of the sunset clause that operated on ACIAR. The Committee's recommendations, we are delighted to note, were overwhelmingly accepted by the Government, and that is why the legislation is before us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view, ACIAR is one of those good news stories that does not get the coverage in the Australian media, unfortunately, that organisations like it should get. The evidence we had before us was overwhelming that, on a cost-benefit analysis, for an expenditure of relatively modest amounts of money, substantial benefits were given to both Australia and overseas to developing countries. I draw the attention of the Senate to the report that was tabled earlier this year by the Joint Committee. At appendix 4 on pages 85 onwards there is a list of selected projects by ACIAR that have been so successful. We saw a number of those projects as members of the Committee. I remember the description of the project called `The Biological Control of Salvinia Water Weed in Sri Lanka, 86-89'. The project that was undertaken there involved Australian scientists with CSIRO. We met those scientists and were very impressed with their dedication. One of them spent a couple of years in the swamps of Brazil trying to find the appropriate beetle that would destroy the salvinia and was successful in that. We saw plenty of evidence that there had been a startling improvement in the destruction of the salvinia weed in Sri Lanka and other places in the South East Asia region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear that many members of the Committee believe that the issue we had to deal with, the sunset clause, had made ACIAR a lean and hungry organisation. The sword of Damocles, in a sense, hanging over it, I suspect made it a better organisation than many other public bodies that do not have such a sunset clause operating. But in the end, the Committee recommended that the sunset clause should go because it would be unfair to have one statutory authority with a sunset clause continuing when the great value of its work was clear and when practically every other statutory organisation did not have a sunset clause. So although we recommended the removal of the sunset clause we also recommended that an appropriate parliamentary committee should conduct a wider investigation to see whether sunset clauses in general should become a major part of the operation of other similar statutory authorities. I hope that the Government and the Parliament can take up that inquiry some time in the near future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, as Chairman of the subcommittee on ACIAR and on behalf of the Joint Committee, I say that we are delighted that the Government has accepted all of our recommendations to ensure that such an excellent body that has done an enormous amount of good for Australia and many countries overseas is going to continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also note that in the recent Budget the Australian Government increased the funding for ACIAR, and the figure has increased quite significantly over a number of years. We hope the recommendations we made for increased funding over a longer period of time can be met by the Australian Government as it is quite clear from the report that we get enormously good value for every dollar spent by ACIAR. Indeed, we get back tens of dollars for every dollar that is spent. I support the legislation before the Parliament and hope that it will be passed unanimously. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also am pleased to support the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research Amendment Bill 1992, which will extend the life of the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research. In common with Senator Schacht, having been a member of the subcommittee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade which undertook the review of this very worthwhile organisation, I strongly support the conclusions and recommendations that came out of that inquiry which are contained in the report of the Committee. It is on the basis of those recommendations that this legislation has been introduced by the Government, and I certainly welcome that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This body is a very lean and efficient organisation for the delivery of a section of Australia's foreign aid. Indeed, with a budget in the order of $17m, it provides undoubtedly high quality aid to various countries overseas. Some 82 per cent of the annual funding of the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research is delivered directly as research and is of a direct benefit to those countries receiving the benefits of that research. Less than 17 per cent of the total budget of the organisation is eaten up by administration and other expenses. That indicates the efficiency with which this body has operated since its introduction in the early 1980s by the then Fraser coalition Government. It is on that basis that the Committee recommended that its life be extended and that the Government has responded in a positive way with this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I do have a concern about the amount of research and the amount of funding which is allocated to certain institutions in Australia. As a South Australian, I would like to see some South Australian institutions have a greater opportunity to participate in the research that is undertaken on behalf of the Centre and be involved in the foreign aid that is delivered through the Centre. On that basis, I particularly draw attention to recommendation 4 of the Committee's report which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that ACIAR's primary focus remains South East Asia and the South Pacific.</PARA>
<PARA>If they do remain the primary focus, institutions in Queensland in particular will retain the lion's share of involvement in research. That recommendation continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, as funding permits, ACIAR should foster collaborative projects of mutual importance in other parts of the world, including Africa, the Middle East and South America. North Africa and the Middle East, in particular, should be a priority because of Australia's expertise in dryland farming.</PARA>
<PARA>It is the research institutions and consulting bodies in South Australia in particular which do have a high level of expertise as far as dry land farming is concerned. Therefore, I would particularly like to see ACIAR, as it continues its worthwhile operation under the legislation which we are debating tonight and which will extend its life, take heed of that recommendation and become involved in research and aid beyond South East Asia and the South Pacific, although I agree they should be its primary focus. Thereby I trust that South Australians who have particular expertise in dryland farming&mdash;which will be of benefit to those other areas that I have just mentioned, namely, North Africa and the Middle East&mdash;will also become actively involved in the work of ACIAR. While ACIAR delivers benefits to the countries receiving the aid which its research provides, there is also undoubted benefit to Australian scientists and research institutions because of their capacity to be involved through this institution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, I commend the scientists who have been involved in the programs of ACIAR for their dedication and contribution.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking briefly to the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research Amendment Bill 1992, I add my support for the work done by this institute. By any modern standard it is an efficient organisation and has been established so that it remains that way. Its charter gave it an initial life spanning from 1981 to 1994, with a review to be undertaken in 1991. This review was undertaken by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, whose activities have been mentioned by Senator Schacht and Senator Chapman.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The importance of agriculture to a country like Australia does not need any clarification. The work that ACIAR does is an extension of the research capacity of Australia; it provides leadership to the region in an area that Australia ought to be in as a pathfinder. It provides an end use for our research efforts through over 60 new projects each year, in places like China, Thailand, Indonesia and in various South Pacific countries. It helps to establish better relations for Australia with our near neighbours in a productive and cooperative exercise and it provides consultative and advisory roles for Australians to expand and develop their expertise in their chosen field. That is to be commended. All this has to be of direct and relevant benefit ultimately to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of sound financial management, ACIAR by any comparison is lean and streamlined. This Bill will not impede this efficiency, but will provide security for those engaged in the projects associated with it. In addition, the Bill will allow ACIAR to operate its own training projects and to implement projects which apply the results of research initiated by collaborative programs. Some concern has been expressed that the Bill could adversely impinge on the role and the function of AIDAB. My personal view is that any activity that gives particular focus to strengthening and improving Australia's role in agricultural research needs to be supported and encouraged. Whatever concerns or conflicts have arisen or have the potential to arise between AIDAB and ACIAR, I hope that agricultural research per se does not suffer. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Because of the time, I will be brief. However, that should not be regarded as a reflection on the importance of the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research Amendment Bill that is now before us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As honourable senators will know, I have spoken about the crucial importance of agricultural research in the area of overseas development assistance. Agricultural development is a, if not the, crucial factor in the development of underdeveloped countries or, as they are sometimes called, less developed countries. Besides providing the basis for food production, which is absolutely essential in these areas, it goes to an industry which clearly, many, if not most, people in those developing countries are intimately associated and familiar with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will just zero in on a couple of things. The range of activities of ACIAR has been quite impressive. Its definition of agriculture, as has been indicated previously in this debate, covers crops, animal sciences, forestry, post-harvest technology, plant nutritions, soil and water management, land use, economics, farming systems and fisheries. Undoubtedly, this organisation has had considerable success. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also point to its support for international agricultural research centres. The research that has been conducted in a number of those centres is quite outstanding. I refer, for example, to the technology that has been developed for rice, wheat and maize production. As has been indicated already in this debate, around three-quarters of Australian wheat sown today comprises varieties derived from international research, that research supported by Australia and ACIAR. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The value of increased wheat productivity since varieties were introduced in 1974 is conservatively estimated at $2 billion. In anybody's language, that is an important contribution. It is not only an important contribution to the less developed countries, but it is also an important contribution to Australia's capacity in food production. This is a clear example of where the best interests of Australia are served, as well as the best interests of the countries which, I suppose, the agricultural research is primarily intended for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not suggesting in any way that our overseas development assistance should necessarily, or even less, always, have an aspect of benefit to Australia. Not at all. I think our overseas development assistance should be on the basis that we have a number of gifts which should be shared with other less endowed countries and people. But in this particular instance, clearly, there has been a benefit to Australia resulting from ACIAR's work. So in anybody's language, this has been a successful organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite what has been indicated in the debate about possible conflicts with AIDAB, I believe that credit should be given where credit is due. I believe that AIDAB, particularly its Director, Dr Dun, has realised the significance and importance of agricultural research in the whole focus of overseas development assistance. The support that has been given to the centres that I have mentioned, and to ACIAR, has resulted in what we now have before us, and that is, a Bill which has the unanimous approval of this chamber. I support the second reading, and I will support the passing of this Bill into law. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tomorrow in Parliament House a seminar will be conducted by the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, the National Consumer Affairs Advisory Council and the Trade Practices Commission. The topic will be reform for consumers. Therefore, I thought it might be appropriate tonight to raise a challenge, or make some observations, about what is the appropriate level of funding for superannuation liability.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 8 October, speaking on the report of the Senate Select Committee `Super and the Financial System', I raised the question of the extent of the funding of the Queensland Government funds. Tonight I wish to canvass the question of what constitutes a fully funded superannuation fund and, in so doing, use this opportunity to examine the Queensland Government funds. The issue is important because I believe the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation may unintentionally have been misled by a witness when appearing before the Committee, and that witness came from Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Senate that in the late 1980s there was an inquiry headed up by an eminent Queensland chartered accountant, Sir Ernest Savage. That committee was concerned that the real cost of government funding of State service superannuation was ill-defined and led to misinterpretation by the public. That committee went on to recommend an in depth review of superannuation arrangements in the Queensland State public sector. To my mind and from my examinations, little has changed since that report. I believe that statements that have been made by successive government Ministers, actuaries and others have not been all that reassuring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I indicated earlier, in that previous debate on superannuation I foreshadowed that I would bring to this chamber some of the concerns about public sector superannuation funding in Queensland. I remind the Senate that on 21 March 1992 at the Brisbane hearings of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation the Director of the Queensland Government Superannuation Office, Mr Trevor Hennessy, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our Government funds are fully funded, both from the employee and the employer perspective, and the funding is kept up-to-date. Both the employee and employer funds and contributions are assessed by the State actuary every three years.</PARA>
<PARA>After some examination, I believe that this statement is not a completely true reflection of the arrangements in that State. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, in both its second and third reports, has traversed the issue of unfunded public sector superannuation. In its third report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Super and the Financial System</EMPHASIS>, the Committee stated that under a fully funded arrangement money is set aside by both employers and employees and invested to generate benefits for retirees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee concluded that most public sector schemes in Australia are unfunded or only partially funded. I believe that perhaps we gave Queensland some credit it may not have been entitled to at the time. In other words, no fund exists into which the employer component is contributed as a superannuation liability for an employee accrues. If we use this logic it is natural that one would be able to point to a fund into which the Queensland Government employer contributions&mdash;and I put the emphasis on `employer'&mdash;have been deposited. I have had some difficulty in finding such a fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Employee contributions are, however, paid into one of the following easily identifiable funds: the State public sector fund, the Government officers superannuation fund, and the State service superannuation board fund. Each of these funds then transfers moneys designated for investment to the Queensland Investment Corporation, which has a statutory obligation to carry out the funds management role. The Queensland Investment Corporation also holds moneys arising from the activities of the workers compensation fund, the motor vehicle insurance nominal defendant fund and the Queensland Government. It might interest honourable senators to know that during the past three years the fund has actually returned 11.8 per cent to investors, compared with an InTech survey average of 9.7 per cent for pooled superannuation funds for the same period&mdash;which is a good result by any standard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Queensland Government Superannuation Office annual report for the year ended 30 June 1991 stated that $1.465 billion had been invested by the QIC on behalf of the three major superannuation funds. The annual report states that in the case of the State service superannuation fund, the largest of the funds, the employing authority is required to remit employer contributions to the Treasury for credit to the Consolidated Revenue Fund fortnightly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rate of employer contributions for the year was 2.31 times the standard rate of employee contributions. These employer contributions, together with investment earnings, finance the remaining (5)/(7) proportion of members' benefits and are transferred to the State service superannuation fund at the time the benefit payments are made. This is consistent with the statement in the financial statements appended to the 1991 annual report, which notes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Employer and member's contributions comprise amounts due and receivable to the close of the financial year. The employer's share of contributions is not payable to the State Service Superannuation Fund until the emergence of the benefit and is brought to account in the period in which it is receivable.</PARA>
<PARA>Therefore, according to the publicly available statements, the Consolidated Revenue Fund appears to be the mechanism by which full funding is actually achieved. The Consolidated Revenue Fund, as at 1 July 1992, had an accumulated surplus of $3.6 billion. There is no indication in the Budget Papers that this surplus has been accumulated to cover future superannuation liabilities. So it would appear from what we have said that no separate and quarantined fund exists into which employer contributions could be deposited to cover future liabilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore I believe that it is very difficult to sustain the case that full funding has been achieved, certainly in respect of employer contributions. Until there has been a publicly declared actuarial examination of the level of accrued liabilities relating to public sector superannuation in Queensland and until clarification is given on the extent to which the surplus on the Consolidated Fund for that State is designed to cover superannuation liabilities, questions can legitimately be asked about how fully funded government superannuation in that State really is. If the surplus on the Consolidated Fund, which is expected to reach $4.095 billion in June 1993, has been earmarked to cover superannuation debt, it is difficult to cover all past service liabilities for those members who have retired and are still in receipt of a defined benefit pension as well as those who will retire in future years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As there is no publicly available actuarial or audit information on the extent of past service liabilities, one is therefore placed in a position of having to approximate roughly their possible level. Using a factor&mdash;and this could be dangerous&mdash;of 2.5, or a (2)/(7) to (5)/(7) level of contributions, to calculate the level of employer support relative to members' contributions, one could multiply the $1.4 billion of member funds in the QIC by this factor and conclude that an approximate accrued liability to those members still in the Queensland Public Service is in the order of $3.5 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, that figure would not take into account those who are in retirement and have taken their contributions from the fund but who are still in receipt of a defined benefit pension which has been paid from consolidated revenue. One can only guess what this figure would be over the next 20 to 30 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, the lack of an actuarial assessment of future superannuation debt is serious and the comment of the Queensland Auditor-General in his report on public superannuation funds is something which causes even greater concern. In his first report for the year ended 30 June 1991 he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I have indicated in previous years, and reiterated in section 8 of this report, not all audits performed on superannuation funds are carried out under legislative authority. A number are performed on a by arrangement basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The matter of the unfunding of the Queensland public sector was naturally taken up by that keen accountant and prolific writer on such matters, Professor Bob Walker from the University of New South Wales. In an article in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Business</EMPHASIS> on 23 December 1987 he noted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some Queensland public service managers involved with the schemes deny there is any problem: they claim the State has already set aside funds sufficient to meet its commitments. But the identity and value of those investments is a Treasury secret.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its third report, the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation has recommended that a super summit be convened by the Commonwealth Minister for Finance to discuss the matter of unfunded superannuation. The summit would come to an agreed position on what constitutes superannuation debt, publish comparative cost data and, hopefully, set in place a strategy to reduce debt levels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Senate that the United States Government Accounting Standards Board provides one with some guidelines for reform. For example, under its guidelines, public sector schemes have to disclose pension benefit delegations or defined benefit funds, and further require disclosure of pension liabilities representing the actuarial present value of credit projected benefits pro-rated on service considering both salary progression and step rate benefits. In addition, the US rules require reporting of a 10-year summary of information about net assets available for benefits, accrued liabilities and a comparison of revenues by source to expense by type. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question that is frequently asked, but which still remains unanswered, is why has there not been a proper pooling of the employee and employer contributions into some identifiable funds? The identity and value of the investments and the liabilities today remain, as Professor Walker said in 1987, still very much a Treasury secret. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One has the feeling that the Commonwealth Select Committee may have been misled by this witness and in our report and utterances we may have given recognition which may have been misplaced. I am aware of one letter to the editor in one notable paper where the Queensland Government was commended for fully funding its liabilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Senate that estimates or calculations by actuaries of surplus are not the same as funded assets in a trust account or separate independent entity supervised by properly constituted trustees and audited and assessed on a regular basis by the actuary. I believe that this is perhaps an appropriate issue for this seminar which is being conducted in Parliament House to examine, because governments have to set a standard and certainly set a better standard to ensure a proper funding of all their accrued liabilities in this area. </PARA>

The Government's political master, the ACTU, will not allow it to change the current anomaly ridden tax system to a more simplified and rort free tax system such as that which we are proposing. The only way the Government can overcome this problem is to try and scare the electorate witless. It is trying to tell the business community that its compliance costs will be extreme and it is trying to tell low income earners, pensioners and welfare recipients that they will be worse off.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last Wednesday night Mr Ron Edwards, the member for Stirling and Deputy Speaker in the House of Representatives, had a debate in the seat of Stirling in Western Australia, which is Labor's most marginal electorate. He had a debate against the endorsed Liberal candidate, Mr Eoin Cameron. It was interesting because not only did Mr Cameron answer absolutely all of the furphies put up by Mr Edwards, but he also performed exceedingly well and won the evening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the fact remains that, only a matter of days after our industrial relations policy was released, Mr Edwards had the temerity to stand up in that debate and say that, if people did not enter into an enterprise agreement with their employers, they would be sacked. This is a total and utter misrepresentation of the package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Cameron was trying to be generous and give the benefit of the doubt, after the audience had loudly groaned at this misrepresentation, but, as he said, obviously Mr Edwards has not read the policy, because he would know that it is quite the reverse and no such thing is contained within <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Jobsback</EMPHASIS>. The same applies to Fightback. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In today's article Mr Dawkins says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Opposition's economic reforms focused on the second order issues and proposed big cuts to the social security and health safety nets.</PARA>
<PARA>Wrong, wrong, wrong! He knows full well that we are increasing benefits for those on social welfare and providing incentives for people to take up private health insurance while retaining Medicare and improving upon it, so that people who need to get into hospital can do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Dawkins goes on to say that there is a shift away from negotiation toward confrontation in industrial relations. His own Industrial Relations Minister, Senator Cook, blew the whistle on that the other night by saying that it was his idea to have enterprise bargaining agreements. Whose idea was it? Does it really matter? If the system works, it works. But now Senator Cook is trying to claim benefit from it by saying, `It was my idea. Am I not a smart little Cookie?'&mdash;pardon the pun. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nonetheless, smart little Cookie has been gazumped yet again, because Mr Dawkins is now saying that what smart little Cookie has done is wrong. But the fact of the matter is that this Government, the ABC and Laurie Oakes are bitterly disappointed with our industrial relations policy because it did not abolish minimum awards, leave loading, holiday pay, maternity leave and sick leave and all those things. So what were the counteracting remarks of the Government? Just fib about it; it does not really matter. Just tell fibs and try to scare people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this article today, Mr Dawkins said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new tax will also tilt the economic balance away from small business in favour of big business.</PARA>
<PARA>What nonsense! Mr Dawkins, as Treasurer, really should know better. If he should not resign over a whole raft of things that he has already done wrong, he should at least resign over the fact that, as Treasurer of this country, he does not know the difference between small and big business and their compliance costs and how they are spread and amortised across all their operational activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Dawkins said that business would face an administrative burden because it would have to keep detailed tax records. Dear, dear, dear! Someone has just dropped the penny in the slot and he has realised that business should keep tax records. One big advantage of the goods and services tax is that people would now keep better records than before. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Dawkins went on to quote Mr Anderson from Arthur Anderson and Co. The worst thing that Mr Anderson could say was that the goods and services tax would take some time to get used to. Well, wacky do! Is that not a good reason to vote against a goods and services tax. Who said that it would not take time? It might take time, but does that mean that we should not stop and get rid of a system that is full of anomalies and that we should just keep on with the same?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The thing that fascinates me about this Government is that it is full of criticism for every solitary thing we do. Not a day goes by in the whole of Question Time in both this chamber and the other which is not consumed by the fact that this Government is full of criticism for what we do. This Government has seen this country go to its knees. It has seen many more than a million people unemployed. The official statistics indicate a figure of one million people. How about those who work one hour a week or less? How about those who have a spouse working, because they do not come on to the files? How about those who have been shoved onto sickness benefits or other benefits to take them off the unemployment queues? If those people are added on, the total comes to many more than a million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not on one occasion on one day out of seven days every week do we hear this Government, which spends every waking hour criticising our policies, say, `We cannot go on like this. We have to change. Our alternatives are these'. The only alternative of this Government is more of the same economically, educationally and on the health basis. You name it&mdash;it is more of the same. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This article by Mr Dawkins that was published today also says that British tax analysts made a detailed study of the costs to British business arising from consumption tax paperwork. He found that, for the biggest businesses, these costs amounted to only 0.003 per cent of turnover and 0.78 per cent of turnover for smaller businesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what Mr Dawkins does not say in this article is that the British tax system and the VAT system are not the same as the one that we are proposing. But to say that would be to tell the truth and to make it clear, and we cannot have that. He also tries in this same article to draw the similarity between what we are proposing and the Canadian system. Our system is nothing like the one in Canada. But to say that would be to tell the absolute truth. We cannot have that, because we have to blur the subject and try to make people believe that what the coalition is advocating is the VAT or something similar to the Canadian system or whatever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What Mr Dawkins judiciously does not say in this article is that the VAT system is multi-rated, multi-exempted and everything else and that the VAT system has tried to go through the hoop of trying to exclude various essentials of life. Let us not forget that there was the celebrated case of McDonalds a number of years ago. It went to court because bread was exempt from the tax but meat was not. It said, `But all we are doing is selling the buns and giving away the meat'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government tries to say that the system we are proposing is full of the same anomalies. It is not. Therefore, the compliance costs are reduced.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Dawkins went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When you see the accountant, the lawyers and the computer salesmen rubbing their hands with glee at the prospect of a GST&mdash;remember it's all your pockets they expect to thrust their hands into . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That would be a jolly sight different from what they have had in the last 10 years, would it not, because all they have had in the last 10 years is Mr Keating and Mr Dawkins thrusting their hands into their pockets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But this snide little comment presumes that many businesses still do not have some form of computerisation or accounting system. That is just nonsense. I do not know too many businesses today that do not have some form of accounting system and even the most elementary computing system of one form or another.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But Mr Dawkins was not satisfied with that little lot. He went on to say that `they'&mdash;meaning `we'&mdash;propose a dramatic cut in tax concessions for contributions to superannuation schemes. The tax rate on superannuation fund earnings would also be increased from 15 per cent to 25 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here he is; the saint from on high. This is the guy who has been putting businesses out of operation at the rate of 38 a day for over 10 years. Part of the problem now arises because he has imposed this superannuation levy on businesses and employers, yet he criticises our superannuation policy. Why does he not look at the effect that it is having on businesses? Why does he not look at the fact that he is sending 38 businesses broke per day and that he has been putting 55 young people on the dole queues every solitary day for the last 10 years? Why does he not look at the fact that his and Mr Keating's youth jobless army is 130,000 while the regular army is 30,000? Why does he not look at some of those facts before criticising our policy? Why does he not also look at the reality of what Mr Keating said in 1985, which is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would argue that if this tax&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>He was talking there about a goods and services tax&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">were to be contemplated with exemptions in significant areas, that would make it complex and administratively costly and would substantially delay its implementation. I would not want to proceed with it.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a remarkable statement. The same day he was quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am killing it&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, speculation on exemptions&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">stone dead. There is no prospect of the Government ever buying exemptions in this tax. It is not open to negotiation, it is not a matter of a negotiating ploy, it is just not on. I would rather not have the tax than have it with exemptions, but we must stop dealing with symptoms. The tax laws are in need of radical surgery.</PARA>
<PARA>They are Mr Keating's words. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I will quote a few words about the reality of what has happened in New Zealand. We should remember that New Zealand only abolished the wholesale sales tax system and reduced personal income tax levels. It did not abolish seven taxes, as we will do, and reduce personal income tax levels. Yet this is what New Zealanders say. One of the chief executives of Westpac said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">GST is the most simplistic tax available. I love it.</PARA>
<PARA>The fundamental planks were, in his opinion, wide in its embrace, certain in its impact, simple in its application and easy in its administration. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fear of high cost compliance has not come to fruition.</PARA>
<PARA>In relation to completion of the form, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Four hours every two months.</PARA>
<PARA>He also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If you structure your accounting system right there are no problems at all.</PARA>
<PARA>And later made the point:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">GST has increased business record keeping, making it much better&mdash;one of the biggest boons of all.</PARA>
<PARA>Then there was a GST accountant from the Auckland Chamber of Commerce, who said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There were miles more anomalies in the wholesale sales tax system than GST. It is much more equitable from a manufacturer's point of view. The cost of compliance to manufacturers would be $500 per year.</PARA>
<PARA>That is not per week or per month, but per year. The accounting profession has not blossomed since GST. In his words, it has probably slimmed down. He also made the comment that business keeps records up to date, which is a huge advantage. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The best thing that's happened to the accounting profession in decades. It has flushed out the total black economy.</PARA>
<PARA>Then there was a gentleman who used to be the head sherang of the tourism industry. He is still very much involved with the tourism industry. He said that it fought tooth and nail with the Government before the introduction of the GST to get the industry exempt, and it is pleased it did not. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There should be no exemptions; it makes it clumsy.</PARA>
<PARA>He also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a very fair tax because we get it back.</PARA>
<PARA>Then we go on to the Salvation Army. A Salvation Army major said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It became more efficient because they went to computers.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I realise that it is getting late, but if his Treasurer decided to tell the truth on the goods and services tax, Fightback and Jobsback, it would be unnecessary for anyone to do this.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . would not abolish GST because it is a fair tax but had difficulties on introduction.</PARA>
<PARA>With each quote it will be noticed that everyone says how fair it is. Yet here is this Government trying to say that it is the same as VAT and the same as the Canadian system. The future competitiveness was predicted at a Christchurch business breakfast. The competitiveness prediction for Australia was 12.8 per cent and New Zealand was 65.6 per cent. That is a bit indicative of something. One of the vice-presidents of the Christchurch Chamber of Commerce mentioned that the whole system had improved the quality of accounting and that the opportunity to avoid the tax was very difficult. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the other things that was significant was that the growers and manufacturers did not have any problem with it. An electrical manufacturer and wholesaler said it was the most efficient tax to collect. The New Zealand public had accepted it as a way of life because it was a `fairer tax system'. Macfarlane and Growers also said to us:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It's a fair tax; I like it.</PARA>
<PARA>The electrical manufacturer and wholesaler used to have a manufacturing plant in Melbourne but closed it. The reason it closed it was that its oncosts in New Zealand were 17c for every dollar it spent and its oncosts in Australia were 51c. That is absolutely remarkable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite clearly, Mr Dawkins's little expose in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> is as fallacious as are all the other utterings that we get from the Government on the goods and services tax.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to pay tribute to a great man and a great Novocastrian, Mr Donald McKinnon Geddes, OAM, whose funeral I attended on 27 October. Don Geddes was a former acting Lord Mayor of Newcastle and the longest serving alderman on the Newcastle City Council. He held that office and many others with such distinction and dedication that he became much more than a representative of the people of Newcastle; he became a true friend of the people of the city.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Don Geddes was a true believer in local government and he put enormous effort into representing Novocastrians. Having been elected to Newcastle City Council in 1977, he served until his death on 24 October 1992. Don Geddes' contribution to his city was great because he cherished Newcastle and he believed that he had something to give it. In addition to his work as an alderman, he also carried out a practice as a barrister and solicitor. It was in this occupation in particular that he showed he believed in and was prepared to work for the underdog. At the time of his death he was the honorary legal officer for more than 400 city organisations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He also accepted the position of controller of the Newcastle State Emergency Service and still held that position at the time of his death. When honourable senators put this in the context of the Newcastle earthquake, they can appreciate the time and effort he gave unstintingly to his city. To quote the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Newcastle Herald</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">History will probably record Don Geddes' greatest contribution to Newcastle as the cool-headed command he displayed in the hours, days and weeks after the 1989 earthquake.</PARA>
<PARA>Leaving his home&mdash;where his family had been entertaining friends&mdash;immediately after the earthquake hit, Mr Geddes holed up in the SES Newcastle headquarters. In the first seven days after the earthquake, he worked for more than 100 hours making up to 20 decisions every few minutes and supervising over 1,000 people. His friend and SES colleague, Mr Allan Bryant, said that volunteers would catch a few hours sleep during the earthquake clean-up only to return to find Mr Geddes still on deck after 20 hours. Service to people in need was indeed his hallmark. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This also applied to his professional life. A former legal partner said that Mr Geddes was `notorious for taking cases where he often did not have a snowball's chance in hell of getting paid', particularly in the days before legal aid. Half the time he did not even render a bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, Don Geddes was a wing commander in the Royal Australian Air Force Reserve, a judge advocate and a Defence Force magistrate. He was involved with many ethnic groups in Newcastle; he was president of the Newcastle Australian Football League and president of Charlestown Skillshare; and he was involved for more than 20 years with police youth clubs and ex-service groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At his funeral, eulogists and mourners repeatedly described Don Geddes as everyone's friend. The 1,500 people who attended his funeral, the largest seen in Newcastle in 60 years, ranged from convicted criminals to police inspectors, migrant women to politicians, bikers to dignitaries, schoolchildren to pensioners.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A close friend and former alderman, Mr Ian Campbell, was quoted as saying about the funeral:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Everyone here was his personal friend; he was a man who generated friendship.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Don Geddes was a family man. His wife and four children heard at the funeral of the pride that Newcastle had for Don Geddes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thought I should register a tribute tonight to a great Novocastrian who loved his city and its people, and I am sure honourable senators join with me in expressing condolences to his wife, Maria, and their four children. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Some children are treated with growth hormones for up to 10 or 15 years if they are diagnosed with growth hormone deficiency at an early age, but as the average age children enter the program is between 9 and 10 years, the average duration of treatment will be approximately five years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Based on (1) the likely average cost of treatment for a child on the program is $110,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The development and support of the OZGROW data base (a system designed to audit the use of growth hormone in Australia) by Australian Paediatric and Endocrine Group and the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services, is helping to address the scientific issues raised in this question. At the meeting of Paediatricians and Endocrinologists in Canberra in May 1992, OZGROW data was presented on the effect of growth hormone therapy on different diagnostic groups. It was found that children diagnosed with partial growth hormone deficiency had identical responses to children with genetic short stature.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The result of a five year study examining the effect of growth hormone on slowly growing children is due to be published in October 1992. Analysis of the first three years of this study showed that the estimated mature height increased by between 6 and 8 cm depending on the dose (0.6 units/kg/wk to 1.2 units/kg/wk). Although long term effects have still to be ascertained, there clearly has been a short term benefit for these children. It must be noted that a rigorous scientific study is actually extremely difficult to perform because of the ethical issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) There is no evidence that androgens are as effective as growth hormone in the treatment of growth problems present in girls with Turner's Syndrome. Androgens have been used since the 1970's to promote growth in girls with Turner's Syndrome and when the literature is examined it is difficult to document any significant effect on the final height of these girls.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Androgens, in particular Oxandrolone, however have been shown to be most useful synergistic agents with growth hormone in Turner's Syndrome by causing an increase in growth velocity compared to growth hormone alone. This may have the benefit of achieving a final height at an earlier age so that other medical therapy can be instituted at a more appropriate age.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) Yes. The major concern relates to the issue of what will be the long term effect of growth hormone on these children. The importance of OZGROW cannot be too highly stressed in evaluating these long term effects. Currently, Australia's use of growth hormone per head of population is identical to that of Japan, France, Spain and less than Sweden. It is greater than some small countries where figures are known including New Zealand, Belgium and Finland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of cost to the medical system does concern all the physicians who prescribe growth hormone and every effort is made to maximise the effectiveness of growth hormone by regularly reviewing the Guidelines that apply to the program.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1)  Sucralose is a chlorinated carbohydrate and is therefore not directly or chemically comparable with the classes of chlorinated aliphatic or aromatic organic compounds linked with adverse health and environmental effects. Extensive testing of both the potential health and environmental effects of sucralose has been undertaken, with particular regard to this concern. Expert evaluation of this data by toxicologists of the Commonwealth Department of Health Housing and Community Services, the former Food Science and Technology Sub-committee of the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) and of the National Food Authority and consideration, twice, by the Committee on Toxicity of the NHMRC has resulted in the establishment of an Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) for sucralose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This corresponds to the daily level of consumption, taken over an entire lifetime, which is determined, on the basis of the data available, to be without appreciable risk. A similar conclusion has been reached by the Joint FAO/WHO expert committee on food additives (JECFA) and the Canadian Department of Health and Welfare. In addition, the Food and Drug Administration of the USA (USFDA), in consideration of the environmental effects of sucralose has issued a finding of no significant impact. The use of sucralose, as proposed, does not present any appreciable health or environmental risk.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The Australian Food Standards Code requires that the label on, or attached to, a package containing food shall contain a statement of the ingredients and components of the food contained in the package. This requirement extends to all foods in which the approval of sucralose is proposed. In addition any food which contains an artificial sweetening substance must be labelled "artificially sweetened". Consumers are therefore able to determine from the label whether food they wish to consume contains sucralose and may make an informed choice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) All intense sweetening substances permitted in Australia, including sucralose, are approved, in line with Codex Alimentarius guidelines, to enable the production of foods for consumers with special dietary needs. These include low joule foods and reduced joule foods for consumers on energy controlled diets and carbohydrate modified foods for those, such as diabetics, who cannot tolerate glucose. Because of its high energy value and intolerance by diabetics, sugar is not a suitable sweetener for such products. However sucralose is unique amongst intense sweeteners currently permitted as it is manufactured from sugar.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Resources has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The Royal Commissioner, Justice Woodward, in his report of the Royal Commission into the Australian Meat Industry said that Appendix H to the report contained findings of fact, and some comments, on nearly all the specific instances of malpractice investigated by the Royal Commission. He further indicated that, with the exception of the investigation of allegations of pet food substitution for export meat, most of those persons investigated have not been named but their identity would be readily ascertainable in the public records of the Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The substitution of kangaroo meat for beef did not cause our beef exports to the United States to come to a complete halt. Following the discovery of horse meat in beef, immediate steps were taken to retain, both in Australia and the United States, meat from the establishment in question. Further quantities of horse  meat were found, as were quantities of kangaroo meat. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) then took steps to locate, examine and sample all Australian boneless beef in the country. As a result of this testing, which continued from 25 August until 30 October 1981, a total of 3 establishments were delisted by the USDA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further 6 establishments were delisted by the then Minister for Primary Industry, Mr Nixon, following investigations in Australia. Access to the United States market for other establishments was not affected other than by the requirement for product to be tested during the period mentioned above.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Some people who gave evidence before the Royal Commission (although not necessarily named in Appendix H) are still involved in the kangaroo trade in NSW. However, none of these people were charged with offences arising from the Royal Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) As the licensing function currently rests with the NSW Government it will be a matter for that Government to determine the eligibility of companies or persons to be involved in the production of kangaroo meat for human consumption in NSW. The Compliance Program of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) will continue to provide any assistance required to contribute to the continued integrity of Australia's meat industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) In making his recommendations the Royal Commissioner, Justice Woodward, ordered that "Appendix H to the report should not be published until any criminal proceedings against persons referred to in it have been finalised". To date Appendix H has not been publicly released as criminal proceedings have not been finalised. As the Royal Commission into the Australian Meat Industry operated under Letters Patent issued by the Governor-General together with the Governors of Victoria and the Northern Territory, the decision to release Appendix H is one to be made jointly by the governments of those jurisdictions.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answers to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The report presented to Parliament in February this year by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, entitled "Genetic Manipulation: the Threat or the Glory?", made no specific recommendations regarding labelling of products derived from genetically modified organisms (GMOs), but did conclude that:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">". . . there should be labelling of some products which contain GMOs or are produced by GMOs. However, this should be decided on a case-by-case basis. . . ".</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the Parliamentary Committee did not make any formal recommendations on the basis of that conclusion, the Government considers labelling an important and complex matter requiring active consideration and consultation with the community as well as various Federal and State agencies. This will be made clear in the Government's response to the report, which is expected to be presented to Parliament on 15 October 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Australia, the National Food Authority (NFA) is responsible for advising the government of food safety issues. The NFA is currently developing guide-lines for foods produced using genetic manipulation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) As far as I am aware, there are no products derived from GMOs on the Australian market for human consumption without an information label.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under NFA guidelines, no food product may be produced for consumption unless the foods/additives used in its production are covered by the Australian Food Standards Code. No GMO products containing whole or viable genetic material are listed in the Food Standards Code to date.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Processing aids, however, are generally not covered by the Food Standards Code. This is because they are not an additive that will form part of the final food product but are only an aid used to cause a certain reaction in manufacture. However, companies themselves do approach the NFA to seek approval and cover under the Food Standards Code for processing aids.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The NFA has advised that the only case in which approval has been sought and given to use a GMO derived product was in relation to a processing aid. Amendment 11 to the Australian Food Standards Code (Gazette No. P22, 14 August 1991) permits the use of chymosin. This coagulating enzyme is produced from three GMOs and can be used in the production of Standard H2&mdash;Cream and Cream Products (thickened creams), and Standard H9&mdash;Cheese and Cheese Products (general cheesemaking). The chymosin is an alternative to rennet from bovine stomach extracts or to a lesser extent from bacterial sources. The approval for its use was given by the National Health and Medical Research Council, before the NFA took responsibility for this area on 19 August 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The NFA is not aware of any Australian cheesemakers using the product at present.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only food additives are required to be listed on product labels&mdash;there is no requirement to list processing aids. There is therefore no labelling requirement to list the use of chymosin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Chymosin is a processing aid and no viable genetic material is transferred into the finished product. It is not possible to detect which coagulating agent (chymosin or rennet) has been used by analysis of the finished product. Indeed, the only significant difference is that the GMO derived chymosin is considerably purer. As such, foods produced with the aid of chymosin could ultimately be perceived to indicate a significantly better product. Given these factors, there is a possibility that the use of GMO labelling could also be used fraudulently by cheesemakers using non-GMO rennet, and vice-versa. In other words, labelling cannot be policed effectively in this case and was not, therefore, deemed to supply the consumer with useable information.</PARA>
