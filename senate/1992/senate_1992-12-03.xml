<PARA>I begin by pointing out several preliminary things. Senator Chamarette will not be here today. She has been kind enough to write me a letter which, in part, says that she supports all the Democrats' proposed amendments and sincerely regrets that she will not be present to vote for them. Senator Chamarette has gone to Queensland to speak at the symposium on Burma at Griffith University. While she is not here, I draw the Committee's attention to the fact that she is supporting these amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also draw the Committee's attention to the very wide support that all these amendments have attracted. The World Wide Fund for Nature, Greenpeace Australia, and the Nature Conservation Council of New South Wales have all written in recent days strongly supporting the amendments I will be moving. </PARA>

<PARA>One can promote something at various levels. One can promote something strongly or weakly; it is still promotion. The Bill should be seeking to ensure the recovery of species and ecological communities. The amendment seeks to make it quite clear that the object of the Bill, the intention of the Bill, is to take the strongest possible action to ensure&mdash;and I stress `ensure'&mdash;the recovery of species and ecological communities that are endangered and vulnerable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all recognise that that object may not be achieved. Nonetheless, it is better to set out with a piece of legislation with a much stronger intention than it is to accept simply the words `to promote', because that can indicate any sort of weak action that the Government might choose to take. I strongly urge this amendment on the Government and the Opposition. I think both of the old parties recognise the importance of this legislation and I call on them to support this amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government will not be supporting this amendment, although we will be supporting a number of Democrat amendments, and we have given the Democrats notice of our intention to do so. We will not be supporting this amendment because it imposes upon the government of the day a totally unrealisable goal, that is, the need to ensure the preservation of a species. All that it is within the Government's physical power to promote is the preservation of a species. By the very promulgation of this legislation&mdash;which has been attacked by people who are anti-conservation&mdash;we do promote the preservation of a species.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I cannot really accept what the Minister has said. Every piece of legislation that we deal with in this place has certain objectives and we all know that those objectives are frequently not met. But that is not an argument for not setting out to attempt to ensure&mdash;and I use that word again&mdash;that those objectives are met. To argue that under this legislation we would have to stop cyclones is ridiculous. The Act clearly sets out the mechanisms by which these objectives are to be encouraged or processed. The rest of the Act sets out those procedures. But we are talking about the objective of the Act and that surely should be to ensure the survival of species.

<PARA>The second amendment of the Australian Democrats, which is also to clause 3 of the Endangered Species Protection Bill, seeks to insert another paragraph after paragraph (1)(b) to ensure the protection of habitats of endangered and vulnerable species and endangered and vulnerable ecological communities. The Bill recognises both species and ecological communities. This amendment will insert the notion that habitats also need to be protected. Again, it uses that word `ensure'. There are two aspects of this amendment: first, it seeks to strengthen the intention of the legislation by using the word `ensure'; and, second, it seeks to extend the notion of protection to habitats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most people in this chamber would be aware that a species cannot be protected in isolation and that the preservation of a species ultimately depends upon the protection of its habitat. I draw the attention of the Committee to an AAP report yesterday which is headed, `Mulga land degradation costing millions'. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Land degradation in Queensland's south-western Mulga region is costing $52 million a year in failed production . . .</PARA>
<PARA>It talks about the enormous problems of soil erosion, which bears very much on the habitat of animals such as the bilby&mdash;a very endangered species that was in plentiful numbers roughly a century ago. We strongly argue that the notion of habitat protection is crucial, if one is to effectively protect either species or ecological communities to which the Bill in other parts refers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This clause sets out the objects of the Bill. This is the introductory clause which sets out what the Bill is attempting to do. In our view, it is desirable to make those objectives as clear and as forceful as possible so that nobody reading those objectives is in any doubt as to what this legislation seeks to do. To leave out the notion of habitat is to ignore what any biologist, and I think anybody in this chamber, would recognise as an absolutely essential component in the proper protection of endangered species.</PARA>

Therefore, I strongly commend this amendment to the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are strongly in favour of the protection of habitats but we recognise that this is a process that involves scientific examination in cases for and against.

There may be some instances where that matter should be argued&mdash;where scientific evidence should allow a situation that did not ensure the protection of all vulnerable species. I recognise that there is a clear link between habitats and species.

We are concerned to see that, all things being equal, that does not happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Coulter has suggested that instead of the word `ensure' we should use the word `promote'. That would have been an interesting matter for us to have discussed had we had any time to do so.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must say that, intellectually, I am attracted to the idea of promoting the protection of habitats; it appeals to me. But because I have not had an opportunity to examine the amendments in detail or to get any sort of advice from the experts on the environment with whom I discuss these matters, and as I am the representative of the shadow Minister, who himself has not had the opportunity to examine these amendments, it is unfair and unreasonable of Senator Coulter to come in and require us to divide on this kind of issue so that he can say, `These people did not support us on this major question of protecting habitats'. If the Democrats are to require us to divide on this matter, I find it a very unattractive political stunt, because it is seeking to create a view of our position which is simply false. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very concerned that in going through this legislation, if the Democrats are going to divide on all of the amendments, we face the prospect of something like 20 divisions, with the Democrats getting their numbers up in terms of the number of times the Government and coalition have voted together against the Democrats. If that is what this is, then I would be correct to say that it is a political stunt, because it is obviously one basic piece of legislation. If the Democrats are doing this to get their numbers so they can say, `It is wrong for the coalition to claim the Democrats support the Labor Party most of time', and to use this as an example of where they do not, when in fact it relates to one bit of legislation, then I must say I find it not an attractive intellectual exercise and one in which one could look for a level of intellectual dishonesty. </PARA>

The process that has been undertaken is one whereby, for example, lots of bodies external to this Parliament were aware of the Democrats' proposals, at least in draft form, last Friday when they wrote to us&mdash;and presumably before last Friday because they had to take a view on them. We were not. I express my disappointment that, on the face of it, this sort of activity seems to add up to a situation where, for political purposes, the Democrats are seeking to force the Opposition to vote continually with the Government on matters that it simply has not had the opportunity of properly examining.

He did so quite dishonestly because, as he would know, the Government very often does not call divisions when we vote with the Opposition. So the dishonesty really lies with the Opposition with respect to that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the suggestion that we take out the word `ensure' and put in the word `promote', I am not sure how I could have put that to Senator Baume several days ago when it is an amendment that has only just been lost in this chamber. The acceptance of the word `promote' instead of `ensure' only 10 minutes or so ago immediately suggested to my mind that the second leg of my amendment might be acceptable if we were to change that word. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Coming to the more substantive point which the Minister has made, he is quite correct when he says that the word `habitat' and the notion of habitat protection is mentioned elsewhere in the Bill. I draw his attention specifically to clause 58(2), on page 26 of the Bill, under `interim conservation orders'. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For the purposes of paragraph (1)(d)&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, ensuring that particular activities do not adversely affect a listed native species or listed ecological community, or habitat significant to the survival of a listed native species&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . activities affecting the habitat of a listed native species or a listed ecological community are relevant only to the extent that they adversely affect features of the habitat that are significant to the survival of the species or community.</PARA>
<PARA>It is an incredibly limiting clause. So while the Minister is correct in saying that `habitat' occurs in several places throughout the Bill, nonetheless the notion that a species cannot stand alone without the protection of its habitat is severely limited in this legislation. Senator Baume quite correctly drew attention to the example of a crustacean that lives in mangrove swamps and the question of the clearing of the mangroves, the mangroves themselves not being a threatened species. There are mangroves in many parts of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that none of the arguments put by either the Government or the Opposition really bear on the importance of bringing this forward&mdash;I stress it again&mdash;into the objects of the Act. The object of the Act should be to protect the habitats of the species and of the ecological communities which are endangered or vulnerable. That should be essentially the third leg of the protection of endangered and vulnerable species. Without that habitat protection, we simply cannot achieve the other objectives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as what Senator Panizza was saying is concerned, I think it is a point that Senator Baume touched on earlier&mdash;that including such a clause would somehow lock up the whole of Australia. That is absolutely ridiculous. The Bill quite clearly says that it is the protection of habitats in relation to endangered and vulnerable species. So it is not all habitats; it is habitats in relation to endangered and vulnerable species. It is quite clearly qualified. I say to Senator Panizza through you, Mr Chairman, that a species which was vital in a particular habitat but which itself was not vulnerable or threatened nonetheless might be a key species in a particular habitat in which there was a threatened or vulnerable species. In that particular habitat, that species itself would need to be protected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think Senator Panizza really has not caught on to the interlinking relationship between threatened species in ecological communities and habitats. Again, I strongly put this notion of habitat protection.

They opposed the creation in North Queensland of pine plantations on the basis that the tree-climbing kangaroo could not find a home in the pine plantations, only in eucalypt forests.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That exposes one of the real weaknesses of this proposal. The weakness is that the amendment would basically restrict the ability to deal with certain habitats which may happen to contain vulnerable species. We should make it very clear for all those who are listening that this provision does not seek to protect all of the habitats of all vulnerable species, but it would restrict the ability to deal with an area in which the habitat of a vulnerable species occurs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The perfect example of this is the pebble mound mouse, to which I referred in the second reading debate on this Bill. The pebble mound mouse was raised as an objection to mining at Marandoo. The value of the Marandoo iron ore mine is in the vicinity of $36 billion. The objection was raised to mining at Marandoo because the pebble mound mouse is found there. The pebble mound mouse was vulnerable in that one habitat, but it can be found in other places in Western Australia. I think the Labor Government in Western Australia made the right decision to go ahead with the mine. I think that is something on which Senator Collins and I may actually agree. It made the right decision. This amendment moved by Senator Coulter would prevent that sort of thing from taking place, and that would be unacceptable. </PARA>

Firstly, if he had read the legislation, he would see that the processes which this legislation envisages are quite properly protected by scientific committees, advice and everything else.

It has already been recognised as a threatened and vulnerable species. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The argument in relation to Marandoo really comes down to quite a different argument. Senator O'Chee is not being honest with this Committee when he uses that example. There are vast resources of iron ore in the Pilbara region which, throughout the last several decades of his life, Mr Lang Hancock tried to open up for development and which, in fact, do not involve any threat to the pebble mound mouse whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The argument is really quite a different argument. There is no reason why iron ore development should not go ahead, but it needs to be recognised that there is a particular area where the pebble mound mouse occurs which would be interfered with if that particular proposal were to proceed. It might simply be much better to exploit iron ore somewhere else so that the pebble mound mouse is not extensively interfered with. </PARA>

Again, the net is sought to be cast far too widely.

That really means that there is no certainty for the future of the timber industry in this country because this would be yet another opportunity for the extremists in the environmental movement&mdash;people who do not reflect the mainstream concerns of those of us in the coalition&mdash;to seek to impose their views over the reasonable people in the Australian community who want to protect endangered species but who also want to protect them in a reasonable fashion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make two points. Firstly, we are talking about species and ecological communities that are endangered or vulnerable. A species that exists quite widely and in other habitats would not fall within that definition, so the fears expressed by Senator O'Chee are really unfounded. Secondly, Senator O'Chee fails to recognise that the legislation is built around proper scientific assessment processes. Unless he is arguing that the scientific committees and so on that will be advising the Minister will be composed of extremist environmentalists, there is more than adequate protection in the Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More fundamentally, Senator O'Chee seems to be arguing that, provided we have one breeding pair of, say, the larger bilby in Australia, we are quite okay; that because we have one breeding pair of that species in a zoo somewhere, it is no longer endangered and vulnerable. Senator O'Chee does not seem to recognise that, once the number of interacting animals in a community drops below a certain level&mdash;and that number can be quite large and can range over quite a large area for some species&mdash;that species becomes very vulnerable. Some species require relatively large areas; some require smaller areas. Some require very large populations to maintain that level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I point out to Senator O'Chee the plight of the gouldian finch. Two or three decades ago there were literally tens of millions of gouldian finches across the whole of northern Australia. Yet now, for reasons that are not at all clear, the numbers have dropped, and so the issue of whether the Mount Todd goldmine, which was mentioned in the second reading debate two days ago, would impact on the gouldian finch becomes a significant question. I use this opportunity to make the point that Zapopan has satisfied me that that goldmine will not make a significant impact on that threatened species. Nonetheless, it becomes an issue for proper consideration because that finch&mdash;a very important and very beautiful animal&mdash;has dropped in numbers absolutely catastrophically in the course of several decades. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that case we need quite large numbers to be protected so that we have a community that will sustain itself indefinitely into the future and be able&mdash;and this is an important clause that occurs elsewhere in the legislation&mdash;to continue to evolve as a species in response to the inevitable changes that will occur in the environment in any case. Some of these changes will be human induced, some will occur quite naturally. Climates and weather patterns change irrespective of human intervention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need relatively large populations which can continue to evolve so that 10,000 years in the future they may be different in some significant way from the species we have today. We are not looking in this legislation, nor should we be, simply to protect museum-type specimens locked into 1992 and unable to evolve in response to changes to the environment which will inevitably occur. Therefore&mdash;and I come back to this point&mdash;the natural habitats in which animals and plants occur are an important element in their protection. They need to interact with their habitats. That evolutionary process will continue without the intervention of human beings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will not have to take away animals and store them in zoos and so on. I point out to Senator O'Chee that trying to retain these species under such highly artificial circumstances is very expensive. We will not be doing that. They will continue to evolve in their natural environments. They will still be there for future generations to enjoy. After all, one of the fundamental foundations on which the whole notion of ecologically sustainable development is based is the idea that future generations will have available for their enjoyment, pleasure and genetic information for scientific purposes at least the same range of species which we have available to us today. </PARA>

However, I would just like to draw the attention of the Committee to one thing, and that is the way in which Senator Coulter likes to put up a straw man when he debates these points. I have been talking about particular communities and particular species, and the impact of some of these things on the timber industry. Senator Coulter, out of nowhere, suggested that I would believe it would be satisfactory to have one breeding couple of any species in a zoo.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government does not disagree with anything that Senator Coulter said about the importance of habitat. As I have said before, and as Senator Coulter has acknowledged&mdash;and I want to refer to the clause in the Bill he quoted from&mdash;habitat is specifically mentioned in the legislation. In every one of those cases, a rigorous scientific assessment will have to be made. If an assessment determines that a particular habitat is essential to the survival of the species that is being considered for protection, the recovery orders that will be issued will contain that prescription in respect of the habitat.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to detain the Committee any longer than necessary by talking about individual examples, but it is a scientific fact, as Senator Coulter would have to acknowledge, that a species cannot exist without the features of its habitat that are essential for its survival. But, in every case, not each and every feature of that habitat is necessary. In some cases&mdash;and I am happy to talk about it in detail, if Senator Coulter wants to&mdash;the features of the habitat are not even relevant to that species. There are some parts of the habitat that the animal does not use for protection, food or anything else that affects its survival or daily life in any way at all. Subclause 58(2) on page 26, which Senator Coulter quoted from, is a sensible and reasonable acknowledgment of that. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . activities affecting the habitat of a listed native species or a listed ecological community are relevant only to the extent that they adversely affect features of the habitat that are significant to the survival of the species or community.</PARA>
<PARA>It incorporates the concept of community. So it can go beyond the single species to an ecological community but, scientifically, it does not need necessarily to include each and every feature of the particular habitat that the species lives in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Coulter knows, that is a matter that the Government has, of necessity, put in the hands of the scientific community. The legislation provides for a rigorous scientific assessment of the species that are being considered. As Senator Coulter has acknowledged, it provides of necessity that that assessment, the orders that are made and the recovery plans that are then drawn up involve consideration of the habitat in which the species lives. But it is not scientifically correct to say that each and every aspect of a habitat has to be either necessary for the survival of the species or, in some cases, relevant to the life of a particular species in a habitat. That is simply a sensible acknowledgment of the situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by reiterating that the Government is not only well aware of the points that Senator Coulter correctly makes about the importance of habitat but also asserts that the legislation, which has been carefully negotiated and, as I think Senator Coulter would also acknowledge, controversially negotiated&mdash;because it is a controversial piece of legislation&mdash;quite properly takes habitat into consideration. We are perfectly prepared to accept the decisions of the scientific assessment that is made as to what parts of the habitat would be required to ensure the continued survival of the species or the ecological community that is being considered. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats will be seeking to remove this whole section which refers to impact assessment conservation orders. As the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins) alluded to earlier, in the genesis of this legislation there was a great deal of controversy regarding the way in which other Ministers and other departments might become involved. The part to which clause 3 refers invokes the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act and, under the clauses dealing with that Act, the action Minister with respect to threatened species becomes not the Minister for conservation and environment but the Minister responsible for the proposal for development. We find that quite unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In considering the social and economic implications of any action which arises from this legislation for the protection of threatened or vulnerable species or ecological communities, it is appropriate that other matters be taken into consideration and that processes be put in place for that to occur. Those processes are in place in the legislation. But to remove entirely from the purview of the Minister for environment the clauses dealing with the impact of assessment conservation orders and thereby removing the ability of that Minister to make the judgment seems to the Democrats to be going far too far. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a mark of the position to which the Government has come. It has moved substantially away from its concern for the environment and towards greater emphasis on what it sees&mdash;we think mistakenly&mdash;as the need to protect economic activity. As far as the Opposition is concerned, it fits very much with its, in our view, great over-emphasis on economic activity such as mining, forestry and various other activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We would like to see this legislation strengthened very considerably by bringing it back, with respect to these particular and recognisably very important objectives, to the protection of the unique flora and fauna that this country contains&mdash;flora and fauna which, in the main, as I said in my speech in relation to my own legislation, are not found elsewhere in the world, which have evolved in Australia over 40 million years, a long period, and over which the present generation of Australians are the custodians, not only for all future generations of Australians but for all future humankind from now until humankind ceases to exist on this planet, perhaps 500 million years hence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are the 1992 custodians of that unique flora and fauna. We have an enormous responsibility to protect it. Accordingly, the Democrats think that much greater emphasis must be given to the Minister in this respect. This legislation does come under the Minister for the environment, with the exception of these impact assessment conservation orders where that very important power is removed from the Minister and placed somewhere else where the emphasis may well be, and is very likely to be, something quite different from the protection of threatened or vulnerable species or ecological communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accordingly, we would press this series of amendments. They are all interrelated. Amendment No. 57 would delete the whole section dealing with impact assessment conservation orders. We pick it up in amendment No. 3 only because this is the first reference which is made to that particular section. Amendments Nos 3, 5, 23, 34, 37, 38, 51 and 57 are interrelated. I most strongly stress that, if this legislation is to have any teeth at all, if it is to be firmly grounded, not in the protection of economic activity, but in the protection of endangered and vulnerable species, and endangered and vulnerable economic communities, then it must lie with the environment Department and the environment Minister to make those sorts of assessments, given the scientific advice that in this case she would have. It should not be farmed off to one of the pro-development Ministers, one of the pro-development departments, to make an assessment and judgment which they are really not competent to make. </PARA>

<PARA>When I discussed this yesterday with Senator Baume he drew attention to the word `interacts' and expressed concern that `interacts' might refer to the community interacting with something outside itself. The words in the definition in clause 4 of `ecological community' are that it means `an integrated assemblage of native species'. `Interacts' is clarified in our amendment as either an identifiable functional unit or an identifiable spatial unit or both. Paragraph (a) still stands, `inhabits a particular area in nature', as does paragraph (b), `meets the additional criteria specified in the regulations made for the purposes of this definition'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not a major change in the legislation. It is simply an attempt to make it clearer. The idea of an ecological community is certainly well ensconced in biological circles. But the words `ecological' and `ecology' have come to take on a somewhat different meaning out in the community, particularly perhaps in some of those more extreme groups to which some Opposition senators have referred. So it is important to tie the definition back to something closer than the sense in which biologists use the words `ecology' or `ecological'. Therefore, we feel that it is desirable to insert this improvement into the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA>Clause 7 is headed, `Vulnerable species'. We wish to add the words `and ecological communities'. `Ecological community' is picked up in the definitions, and that is one of the things we have just been discussing. I suppose a lot of this argument relates to the argument we were having over habitat; that is, if species are to be protected, the ecological community of which those species form a part also needs to be looked at and protected. We cannot protect the species in isolation. It is important that the provisions which fall within each of these clauses be extended from vulnerable species to include ecological communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also draw attention, as I indicated earlier, to the last line of clause 7(1) in the Bill where reference is made to `threatening its abundance, survival or evolutionary development'. I think that is a very important concept. I must praise the Government for ensuring that this concept is in the legislation. It bears very much on the idea of an ecological community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we seek to protect species in isolation, we will simply have species that are genetically locked out of that continuing evolutionary process. Therefore, we need to protect the environment and, specifically, the ecological community of which they form a part&mdash;that is, the other species with which they are interacting. It is that process which will most significantly affect their further evolutionary development and continue to allow those species to be properly adapted to the environments as those environments inevitably change. It is for those reasons that the notion of ecological communities needs to be written into that particular clause. Amendments 7, 10, 12, 13 and 18 are all related to that same point. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effect of these amendments, as Senator Coulter has said, is to extend the coverage of the Bill to vulnerable ecological communities as well as endangered ones. It is a fact that the classification of ecological communities is far more controversial than the classification of species in the scientific community.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One would have to agree to some extent with what the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Coulter) has just said about there being a certain degree of arbitrariness to where one actually puts species. From time to time, one even has a species that one thinks is extinct and suddenly it is rediscovered. There is a possum in North Queensland, just south of Cairns, which was thought to have been extinct but was discovered after quite some decades.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nonetheless, I do not think the Minister's argument has substance. One of the principles which underlies the notion of ecologically sustainable development is the idea of erring on the side of caution&mdash;the so-called precautionary principle. If in doubt, one seeks to at least move so that one retains the option of taking stronger action if that becomes necessary. If in doubt, one does not continue to impact on that environment, on that vulnerable species, so that it moves inevitably from being vulnerable to being endangered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In light of the precautionary principle, I think the Minister should really reconsider what he just said and recognise that if a species has got to the point of being regarded as vulnerable&mdash;recognising that that in itself is an arbitrary definition, but recognising that there is a sufficient body of scientists who consider that species or that ecological community is vulnerable&mdash;the precautionary principle should operate in line with ESD principles. I believe one should take that line rather than the alternative line of saying, `Because it is arbitrary we do not need to go so far', and possibly tip a species from being vulnerable to being endangered and possibly to becoming extinct. I stress to the Minister the precautionary principle to which this Government has assented under the ESD process. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make that point without any disrespect at all for the work done by the many dedicated environmental groups around the world for what has been a new acknowledgment&mdash;there is no question about it&mdash;and a growing acknowledgment of the importance of environmental protection by the community. It has always been my view, and I have expressed it before, that the shift in opinion in the electorate at large was not due to any work done by the environment groups, Greenpeace or any of those organisations. It was that substantial body of world scientific opinion that coalesced on matters such as protection of the ozone layer, greenhouse gases and global warming&mdash;and, in particular, the outstanding work done in Australia by the divisions of the CSIRO in this area&mdash;which led substantially to that shift in public support for environmental protection. </PARA>

<PARA>This amendment refers to the operation and application of acts which occur outside Australia. The Government has indicated that it wants to make Australians who engage in, say, paedophilia in foreign countries, subject to the Australian law when they return. In other words, Australian nationals committing acts in a foreign country which are illegal in Australia could get caught. We are attempting to ensure that if an Australian goes to a place outside Australian jurisdiction and commits an act which is illegal according to this legislation, that act would still remain illegal within Australia when that person returns. We feel that that is consistent with what Senator Tate said the other day in relation to sex crimes in other countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is particularly important here. One could imagine a situation in which a species was listed as endangered or vulnerable on one of the international lists and we recognised that that was the case, but if the particular foreign country to which an Australian citizen went did not recognise that list, and that Australian person then committed an act against one of those threatened species, that act would become illegal under this proposed amendment. For instance, if China were not protecting the giant panda but the giant panda was accepted everywhere else as a threatened species, and an Australian went to China and proceeded to shoot giant pandas, under this particular clause that person, on returning to Australia, would be liable to retribution under the law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We feel that this amendment is consistent with current Government thinking. We think it is appropriate and we think it is a section which is not likely to be invoked very often. One hopes that Australians do not do these things when they go overseas, but no doubt some would. It is appropriate that those people simply should not engage in those sorts of activities. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason I make that point is that the fundamental objective of this Bill is for Australia to first get its own house in order. We obviously want to see all countries around the world adopt similar legislation. However, to propose at this stage that we should be amending our legislation to make it an offence in Australia for an Australian citizen to do something overseas which would be an action negative to the well-being of an overseas endangered species is simply, at this point in the development of this kind of protection, taking it to the stage where it would be impossible to police; and it would divert resources unnecessarily away from the primary object of the current proposal, which is for this country to first get its own house in order. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The coalition will be supporting the Government in this matter. We recognise that there are problems, as Senator Coulter has quite rightly pointed out, in allowing Australian citizens to do overseas what is illegal in Australia. Our objection to Senator Coulter's proposed amendment is that a problem is created when an animal or bird or whatever it is that is endangered in Australia is not endangered overseas. It may not be that the laws of some other countries are lax in not classifying a certain species as endangered; it may well be that that species is in plentiful supply in those other countries. Migratory birds are a classic example. In Australia, there may be very few of a particular kind of migratory bird because its habitats have been wiped out, but there may be many of that species in New Zealand or some other place where those habitats have not been removed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that, unless we are confident that the situation would not emerge where a species had been declared endangered in Australia but was plentiful somewhere else, we are at risk of imposing unreasonable burdens on Australians. It seems unreasonable to go down what, on the face of it, is otherwise a very reasonable track. I take Senator Coulter's point that one should not allow Australians to do overseas what is illegal in Australia, but there may be cases where it is not illegal overseas for very sound, rational reasons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would need to examine the implications of the sort of amendment that Senator Coulter has proposed before I would go along with it. I am also a little concerned that it probably does not achieve what it is seeking to achieve in terms of Australian citizens. I do not know whether the definition of `Australian citizen' would include Australian companies. If an Australian company wants to do something which is illegal in Australia but not illegal overseas, it does not seem to be captured by this amendment. I do not think it is a terribly well constructed amendment and I am not certain of its consequences. I do not believe that it necessarily will achieve its objectives, and I am not certain that in all instances its objectives should be achieved. </PARA>

When that person returned with `trophies', that person was very much pilloried by most Australians as having engaged in an activity that they find totally repugnant. Of course, no action could be taken against that person. It seems to me that there are instances, albeit rare, of Australians going overseas, committing acts which would not be acceptable here and then coming back and gaining by those acts with impunity in this country.

For instance, one could not go to Africa and shoot elephants and bring ivory back into this country. As I recall the particular instance, at the time I do not think it was illegal to bring that trophy back into Australia. So neither the trophy that was brought back, which I think was the skin, nor the act in the foreign country was illegal. One would hope that this provision would not ever be invoked.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is concerned about activities of Australians in places such as the Philippines and Thailand in committing sexual acts with underage boys and girls. It regards that as unacceptable behaviour and, as I understand it, is seeking to invoke Australian law to make those sorts of acts illegal. It seems to me that the burden should also be placed on Australian citizens going overseas to not do things which in this country would be illegal. They should not escape the legal consequences of acts which we have rightly made illegal by law in this country simply by committing those acts in a foreign country. That is what we are seeking to catch in this amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to Senator Baume's concern as to whether the amendment extends to Australian companies, I would have thought that in the law generally `Australian citizens' is taken to extend to Australian companies. I would have thought they also would be caught by that. If Senator Baume is suggesting that we include Australian companies, then we would be very happy to include that also in the amendment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think we are talking about actually sinking any ships in this case, but if it were an Australian vessel and it engaged in activities which were threatening endangered or vulnerable species we believe it should be caught by this legislation, even though those things occur in international waters. I am rather pleased that the Minister used that expression, because perhaps it is in international waters that that offence is more likely to occur. For instance, the green sea turtle in Australia is recognised by most people as a threatened species, but it is still quite acceptable in Indonesia to take that species. As I understand it, most of the predation on that species is occurring in Indonesia. I would certainly not like to see Australians who are keen on turtle soup going to Indonesia and taking that species to escape the consequence of the Australian law. They should be prevented from doing that to the extent that this legislation is capable of achieving that objective.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>We are now dealing with amendment No.9, which relates to clause 14(2) on page 9 of the Bill. We are seeking to omit subclause (2) and substitute a different subclause. We want to change the scheduling somewhat. I draw this particularly to Senator Michael Baume's attention. I am sure that he will agree to some change in the scheduling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part 2 of this Bill deals with the listing process. Clause 14(1) states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Part provides for listing the native species, ecological communities and threatening processes with which this Act is concerned.</PARA>
<PARA>Clause 14(2) states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Division 1 provides for Schedules 1 to 3 to set out lists of native species, ecological communities and key threatening processes.</PARA>
<PARA>We seek to delete that subclause and put in its place:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Division 1 provides for schedules 1 to 3A to set out lists of native species, ecological communities, key threatening processes and non-native species.</PARA>
<PARA>This, in a sense, is a triggering amendment in relation to schedule 3A, which relates to the non-native species. This is a significant addition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendment No. 11 deals with clause 17 on page 10. It refers to part 1 of schedule 3A, which contains a list of non-native species that are listed as being endangered and part 2, which contains a list of non-native species that are listed as being vulnerable. That again amends the scheduling process. Amendment No. 77 refers to clause 173 on page 71. This again refers to scheduling. In passing, I note that clause 173 also provides for international assistance, something that we were debating only a moment ago. With respect to amendment 77, clause 173.(1) reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Subject to subsection (2), the Director may provide financial assistance to governments of, and organisations in, foreign countries for the purpose of assisting the recovery and conservation, in those countries, of non-native species included in lists established under agreements specified in Schedule 4.</PARA>
<PARA>Amendment No. 77 seeks to insert the new schedule 3A so that it reads, `Schedules 3A and 4'. The last amendment in this group, amendment No. 80, states:</PARA>

<PARA>The earlier amendments, Nos 9, 11 and 77, refer to the scheduling process, particularly numbers in the schedules, whereas amendment No. 80 seeks specifically to insert schedule 3A, which includes non-native species that are endangered and non-native species that are vulnerable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point is quite simply that Australia may come to contain species which are non-native, but which are nonetheless endangered or vulnerable either globally or in the country of their natural habitat. I can think of quite a number of instances of this; for example, species in zoos may well be rare, endangered and vulnerable. This amendment provides that those species would be recognised as vulnerable or endangered, even though they are non-native. It will allow this legislation, through the scheduling process, to extend to those species so that Australia can take some action in relation to their protection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that a number of these species will be picked up by schedule 4, which relates to agreements between Australia and other countries. In situations where we have an international agreement with another country&mdash;and a number of those agreements are listed in schedule 4&mdash;certain species would be picked up. But other species would not be picked up by those bilateral agreements, and Australia should turn its mind to their protection. As these animals are more likely to be in zoos and similar situations, in the past their protection has, in the main, been handled pretty well. Those animals have been protected and looked after, recognising that they are rare and, in some cases, exist only in zoos. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is appropriate that recognition be given to those non-native species that are endangered or vulnerable under this legislation. After all, this is, and will become, the umbrella under which threatened and endangered species and ecological communities will increasingly be protected. It is, therefore, appropriate that it be made as comprehensive as possible. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition does not support these amendments either. It does seem that, under the Democrat amendments, Australia may well be prevented from wiping out rabbits and foxes. There is every prospect that that could happen under that proposed amendment, and yet that would be a desirable objective. In fact, it is even recommended in schedule 3 that they be regarded as animals that are causing massive danger. But if they, as non-native species, came down to a very low level of existence in Australia, they could be protected as endangered non-native species.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That could cause considerable distress among farming communities. Early on in the history of white settlement in Australia it was only a few rabbits that escaped that generated the rabbit disaster we now have. There is no way we could accept a situation that could see the elimination of rabbits and foxes in Australia frustrated by this kind of legislation. On top of that, there is the general problem of species being endangered in their country of origin but not being endangered in Australia because of either their feral activity or some other thing. We would be obliged to follow external processes, even though they were not endangered in Australia. On all grounds, we totally oppose the amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. It is extremely difficult to imagine the rabbit, which was the example he used, becoming essentially extinct in every other country and so profligate and of such great fecundity in Australia that it was overrunning the country and causing so much damage. I do not think that situation is likely to develop. I cannot really imagine the circumstance in which that would occur&mdash;that we would have an animal here that is so prevalent it is causing damage and we need to wipe it out but is non-existent, or virtually so, anywhere else.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If that were the case, it would be appropriate for Australia to reduce the numbers here and to assist the reintroduction of that species back into the country of origin so that it could take its place in its original habitat. I think the rabbit originally came from South America and was taken to Europe in the seventeenth century or thereabouts; of course, it has overrun a number of countries. For argument's sake, if in South America the rabbit became an endangered species, it would be appropriate for Australia to provide assistance for the reintroduction of rabbits from Australia back into South America. Indeed, clause 173 of the legislation provides for just this sort of assistance. It reads, under `International assistance':</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Subject to subsection (2), the Director may provide financial assistance to the governments of, and organisations in, foreign countries for the purpose of assisting the recovery and conservation, in those countries, of non-native species included in lists established under agreements specified in Schedule 4.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, schedule 4 includes only those cases where there is a bilateral agreement with respect to species. The whole point about including schedule 3A is to make that process much broader. There are clearly recognisable species and ecological communities that would fall outside schedule 4 but should correctly be caught by the ability of the Director to provide financial assistance to the governments of or organisations in foreign countries. Those species would be non-native to Australia by definition but would not be caught under schedule 4. It seems to me that the Government has accepted the principle of this by putting in clause 173 but is tying it to a much narrower schedule&mdash;a schedule which does not comprehensively contain endangered species or endangered ecological communities&mdash;than is desirable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, it is appropriate that we put in this other schedule that allows the operation of section 173, which the Government itself has put in, allowing this financial assistance to other governments or organisations in foreign countries to allow for the taking into account of comprehensively endangered species or vulnerable species, or endangered or vulnerable ecological communities or, for instance, species listed in the IUCN Red Data lists. It is simply not a new concept in this legislation. It is an extension of the concept the Government has actually built into the legislation, and it is an appropriate extension of that concept. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my private member's Bill, which we debated several weeks ago, I also sought, quite appropriately in that legislation, to provide assistance to foreign countries. We need to recognise that there are many countries around the world that recognise and want to protect threatened species but, particularly in the Third World, are financially incapable of doing that. It is appropriate that we are capable of providing that sort of assistance. We as Democrats have said that part of our foreign aid program&mdash;which incidentally should be substantially increased&mdash;should be targeted towards the protection of species and environments in foreign countries, particularly Third World countries, so that they do not continually degrade their environments, which ultimately impacts very severely on their ability to sustain their human populations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment we have moved is not breaking new ground. It is doing something the Government has recognised as desirable. The Government has built it in by way of clause 173 and schedule 4 of the legislation. We are simply seeking to extend that notion to a more comprehensive listing process. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, it is not breaking new ground; it is simply widely extending that ground. The current schedule 4, which Senator Coulter has correctly referred to, is deliberately aimed, as we can see from reading it, at extending protection to a number of other species, but in our region of the world, and I think that is the proper focus. Obviously Senator Coulter would be pleased that the Government has extended the ambit this far, and clearly it is something the Government itself strongly supports. But the primary focus, and I think sensibly, as I said earlier in debate, has to be to our own region in terms of that area of the world over which we can sensibly exercise some policing and some responsibility and actually get a result.

I would not expect, within the limited financial framework of the Government at this time, that with respect to either schedule 4 or an expanded schedule 3A, an enormous amount of assistance would flow in that direction. We can see from the amendment that no species are actually listed in that proposed schedule 3A at this stage.

There is a period of up to 30 days between the time the Scientific Subcommittee provides advice on the listing to the Minister and the time that the Minister must make a decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point of this amendment is to provide some protection during those 30 days for species recommended for listing by the Subcommittee. The protection relates only to subclause 24(2) which provides for the Minister to actually list the species. The reason for this quite simple. Under this legislation, the Scientific Committee or other members who become aware of the fact that a listing process is in the pipeline are not permitted to divulge information. Nonetheless, that information might well become available to others outside and unless there is some interim protection there could be a situation in which, during that 30 days, the species or ecological community is wiped out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recall a specific instance in South Australia where, under the native vegetation clearance regulations brought in under the planning Act, a rare species of plant in one region of Kangaroo Island was destroyed. In the process leading up to the protection of that particular area, the farmer concerned went in with a bulldozer and completely destroyed the area and the plants in that area. There have been other cases in South Australia where, while people did not impact specifically on endangered species of plants and animals, nonetheless, in anticipation of the introduction of regulations which prevented clearing of native vegetation, they went in and cleared native vegetation so that they would not be caught under those regulations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this particular case&mdash;recognising that we are dealing with endangered and vulnerable species and ecological communities and given that there is an interim period during which the Scientific Committee is providing advice and the Minister is still making a decision&mdash;it is important that there be, within that interim period, protection for those species and ecological communities so that no pre-emptive strike or vindictive action is taken against them. Therefore, this particular amendment proposes to address that issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should point out that there will be another amendment to clause 24B. The two proposals are listed together in the amendments which I circulated. They deal with quite separate issues. This amendment No. 14 really deals only with proposed new subclauses 24A(1) and (2). Again, I strongly stress the importance of this interim listing process to the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise on a matter of considerable public importance. It relates to the Criminal Justice Commission in Queensland and the retirement last weekend of Sir Max Bingham. After three years as Chairman of the Criminal Justice Commission he&mdash;in the words of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Australian</EMPHASIS>&mdash;fired `several parting shots' at Premier Wayne Goss. In doing so, he also attacked the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS>: he said that it was a `deplorable rag', `close to becoming an arm of government', and `a propaganda arm of the Government'. There may be some truth in this because Peter Beattie, a sitting Labor member of the State Parliament, when he delivered the Dennis Murphy memorial lecture on 14 November, said:</PARA></TALK.START>

I am pleased to note the presence in the chamber of my three colleagues Queensland Liberal Senators Parer, Macdonald and MacGibbon, because they support my remarks. I would refer particularly to the record of proceedings in the Queensland Parliament on 7 May which contained material relating to a transcript of a tape recording of conversations between Mr Angelo Vasta and Mr Santo Coco between 13 November 1989 and 16 November 1989.

A perusal of those documents which have now been incorporated will reveal that in fact Mr Mackenroth was given $5,000 in cash&mdash;and a recording of that conversation between Vasta and Coco is in the documents incorporated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Mackenroth was appointed Minister for Housing and Local Government in September after the last State election and, following that, Mr Newnham did withdraw his application for reappointment as Commissioner of Police. If people read those documents they will understand why Mr Newnham is now vindicated on his stance. History will record that he followed on the long tradition of his previous history with the Victorian police department and, now that this matter has come to the public notice, it will vindicate his position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The transcript shows that $5,000 in cash was given to Mr Mackenroth on 15 or 16 November 1989 and it could easily have been interpreted as a bribe. This was referred to by Sir Max Bingham in the interview in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Australian</EMPHASIS> of 28-29 November 1992. Sir Max Bingham said that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Mail</EMPHASIS> attempted to denigrate him when it reported a minor motoring infringement 14 months after it had occurred. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Australian</EMPHASIS> it was reported:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the story was given legs after Goss endorsed a call by his police minister, Mackenroth, for a full report `to satisfy everyone the law is applied equally'.</PARA>
<PARA>The staff at the Criminal Justice Commission believed that the story had been planted to discredit Sir Max Bingham because of the travel investigation. Of course, following that travel investigation Mr Mackenroth had to resign as Police Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I could elaborate further on this material, but because of the time constraints I think it will be necessary to review the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> that I spoke about previously in this chamber. As a result of the various statements that have been made, both by Sir Max Bingham and Mr Noel Newnham, there are a series of questions that need to be asked. I challenge the media of Queensland to ask these questions. The first question is: why did Mr Goss mislead Parliament on 7 May 1992 when he said that Commissioner Newnham had not raised a donation with him? He then said that he had been approached in mid-1990 while Mr Mackenroth was overseas and we now know that Mackenroth was not overseas. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> newspaper of Thursday, 8 October states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Newnham directly contradicted the Premier's version of events when he said he had told Mr Mackenroth that he was going to see Mr Goss.</PARA>
<PARA>The second question is: why did the Premier have his comments expunged from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of 7 May 1992 in Queensland? That has never occurred before and to my knowledge it has not occurred in any other State parliament in Australia. There are serious questions that must be asked about that transcript and the contents thereof. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third question is: why did Mr Goss mislead the public when he claimed last December that the travel expenses inquiry had exonerated his Ministers? This has been repudiated by Sir Max Bingham who said he had only told Mr Goss that none would be charged with criminal offences. There is an obvious disparity between the two reports. The fourth question is: why did Vasta and Coco pay Mackenroth $5,000 in cash? Was this connected with Mackenroth's support of Vasta in Parliament in an attempt to have Vasta reinstated to the Supreme Court?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is obviously beyond the scope of senators in this chamber to investigate these matters further. They go to the very heart of government in Queensland and the administration of justice. They go to the continuation of the problems that were revealed in the Fitzgerald inquiry, because it is evident that this material has been covered up and not investigated as it should have been. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS> last Saturday that senior appointments have been made in Canberra. Mr Wallace Brown was appointed national affairs editor of Queensland Newspapers. Wallace Brown is known to us all. He is a very senior member of the Canberra press gallery and he has been the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS>'s correspondent since 1961. He is well known and well respected by, I am sure, all in this chamber. He was a foundation member and President of the National Press Club. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Peter Charlton, who is well known to Queenslanders, has been appointed the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS>'s Canberra correspondent.

He is another very highly respected member of the media. I challenge both those gentlemen to do all within their power to highlight the material that has been presented today in the Senate chamber because I also note that the masthead on the editorial of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS> which was present for many years was dropped in October this year when the page was redesigned.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Arguably, Queensland has the most open, most honest, most accountable, most consultative government in its history.</PARA>
<PARA>I find that unbelievable, given the evidence that I have presented this afternoon. There is a major disparity between the action of the Government, the attempt to cover up by the expunging of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record and the material that I have presented, together with the disavowal of Premier Goss's comments by the former Police Commissioner, Mr Noel Newnham, a highly respected man who has been denigrated in the press and hounded out of office in Queensland, and the public approval rating of the Premier and the attack made on him by another senior figure, Sir Max Bingham, QC, on his resignation last weekend. In addition to that, there needs to be further investigation of the $5,000 in cash that was given to Mr Mackenroth, who is now a member of the Cabinet in Queensland. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to put on the public record alongside the concerns of Senator Herron my concern at recent activities within the Queensland Parliament. I do that without any hesitation or apology because the Senate is primarily a States House and it is quite proper that these sorts of matters are raised within the Senate. Also, in the light of the evidence tabled by Senator Herron, we clearly have a Federal involvement in so far as we have advice that the Australian Federal Police was involved in this matter. Of course, the point at issue relates to the Queensland police force.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is not much point in us, as legislators, even though we accept unreservedly the separation of powers, being negligent in our oversight of the police forces. There is a case for eternal vigilance. The Parliament must always be observant of the police forces to make sure that there are not undesirable or unlawful elements within the police forces themselves and to make sure that a police force does not involve itself in unlawful activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know the history of the immediate past few years when the Fitzgerald inquiry delved very deeply into the Queensland police force and laid on the public record all the shortcomings that were apparent at that time, but I have a view that the Queensland police force would be no worse than any other police force in Australia. There is a need for constant oversight of the police forces but I do not think the Queensland force was worse than that of any other State. When I look at the furore of the last couple of days over the appointment of a commissioner for Victoria, I have some concerns as to what might be going on in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The relevance of all of this is that the present Queensland Government was elected, not once but twice, on a policy of a higher moral code than anyone else in the history of Australian parliamentary democracy. Now there are some very real questions that have to be asked; questions that go right to the probity of the Queensland Government and right to the probity of the Premier of Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Maybe there are some explanations for the inconsistencies that are now on the public record. The Queensland public are entitled to hear those. I should point out the seriousness of the charge that Senator Herron has laid against the Premier. It is on a matter on which the Premier has misled the Parliament, and consistently misled the Parliament. If he is wrong and has made a genuine mistake, the Parliament affords the opportunity for any member to appear before it and to apologise to the Parliament and say, `The facts were wrong as I presented them'. Certainly Mr Goss has had that opportunity on many occasions this year to have redressed the balance, if indeed the facts as he saw them were wrong, but he has not taken any steps at all to correct the record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So in the circumstances, we really have to press these questions, because they cannot be swept under the carpet. If they are kept under the carpet, you will find that the carpet slowly unravels and takes Mr Goss and his Government with him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those questions are as Senator Herron said: why did Mr Goss mislead the Parliament on 7 May, when he said that the matter was raised with him by the Police Commissioner in mid-1990, when the Minister for Police was overseas? He also said it was done in a backhand way, a sneaky way. It was done furtively by the Police Commissioner going around the police Minister to the Premier himself. The proof is on the public record that the first approach from the Police Commissioner and the first meeting of the Police Commissioner with the Premier were indeed in February 1990, not June 1990. At that time the Minister for Police was not overseas. Moreover, the Minister was advised by the Police Commissioner that this matter was being taken to the Premier. There are three very important questions there that the Premier has to answer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point is this extraordinary move of expunging something from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record. I am not aware of anyone in this Parliament having the authority to go to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> and have a record altered, let alone expunged. From my limited knowledge of history, I know that under the Curtin Government, in the darkest days of the Second World War in 1942, there was a secret meeting of the Federal Parliament and I would presume that, because it was a secret meeting, there was no <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record published of that. But the reasons for that were of great national importance. We were in the midst of a war, we were fighting for our lives, and I presume that the purpose of the secret parliamentary meeting was to acquaint the members of parliament with the military situation and the threats facing Australia at that time. But I can think of no other occasion where secrecy was invoked by altering a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record. Certainly Mr Keating could not do it here, and he can do most things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The excuse that Mr Goss gave was that the item raised in a question was sub judice. That is transparently false. Nothing in the questions that were raised by either Mrs Sheldon, the Leader of the Liberal Party, or Mr Borbidge, the Leader of the National Party, identified the matter which was the subject of the question with any court actions at that time, nor could they have been linked. Over and above everything else, the matter of sub judice has no standing in the parliament, any more than commercial in confidence has. It is a matter of convention that parliament exercises a responsible position and on the evidence, reading the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard </EMPHASIS>from Queensland, I think that those members of parliament involved in the questioning did exercise a responsible point of view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am left with two questions. Firstly, why would Mr Goss do it, why would he have a record expunged from <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>? Secondly, how could he do it? I do not know the answers to those questions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We come to the other question: why did Mr Vasta and Mr Coco pay Mr Mackenroth $5,000, in cash, in used banknotes? Everyone has the right to support a political party, but for most people who are dealing with sums of money over $50, the normal response is to write a cheque, rather than make cash payments of thousands of dollars. In the transcript made by the Australian Federal Police, Mr Vasta and Mr Coco, when talking about the $5,000, say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is good insurance in case they get in.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not wish to quote the entire transcript, but clearly `they' refers to the Goss Labor Party and `get in' refers to the election. The intention, as was borne out in a subsequent trial by the Crown Prosecutor, clearly was that Mr Coco, in giving this $5,000 to Mr Mackenroth, wished to put Mr Mackenroth under an obligation. He knew at the time that these people had been charged with the serious offence of attempting to bribe Commonwealth Taxation officers. This claim was that it would be good insurance. The questions that surround the payment of that $5,000 need to be answered frankly by the members of the Australian Labor Party in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said a few minutes ago, these questions go to the heart of the probity of the Queensland Government. They go to the heart of the probity of its leader, Mr Goss. That Government was elected because of its high moral stature, and unless those questions are answered, and answered unambiguously, the public in Queensland is entitled to think there is an accelerating decline in the standards of public morality in Queensland. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to support my colleagues Senator Herron and Senator MacGibbon for raising these very important and serious issues in the Senate. I raised these issues before when the Queensland Government used the extraordinary measure of expunging <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> records. The questions are now even more important because of the information which Senator Herron has incorporated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> in the form of a Federal Police transcript of conversations between Mr Santo Coco and Mr Vasta. Mr Vasta, incidentally, was formerly Judge Vasta, and Mr Coco is a close relation of Mr Vasta.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The expunged record, which was subsequently incorporated by me in the Senate <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> on 20 August 1992, contains a number of questions which must now be answered. When Mrs Sheldon asked Mr Goss on 7 May whether Commissioner Newnham ever raised with the Premier the possibility of the illegal donations, Mr Goss said no. Joan Sheldon then asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Is it a fact that Commissioner Newnham forwarded directly to you a copy of a Federal Police transcript&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>which has now been incorporated in the Federal <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">of a telephone conversation in which a $5,000 bribe was discussed by the former disgraced police Minister, the member for Chatsworth. . .</PARA>
<PARA>That is, Mr Mackenroth, who was required to resign because of his involvement in travel rorts, and who has now, following the win of the Goss Government at the last election, been reinstated. She continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Is it a fact that following this advice from Commissioner Newnham arrangements were made for the $5,000 to be listed as a legal donation to the Australian Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA>What is hard to reconcile is that, in the transcript which Senator Herron has incorporated, Mr Coco&mdash;the person who gave Mr Mackenroth the $5,000 in cash&mdash;complained about the fact that he could not get a receipt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Subsequently&mdash;and I will come to this further because we find that there are some inconsistencies in all that&mdash;Mr Goss in his response to those questions responded by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . sometime in 1990, I think it was one or two days after the Minister for Police had gone overseas. . . I received a request from the Police Commissioner if he could see me in the Minister's absence.</PARA>
<PARA>As pointed out by Senator MacGibbon, it turned out that Mr Mackenroth was not overseas at the time. More importantly, the Minister was aware that the Commissioner for Police was going to see the Premier. Mr Goss went on further to say that he came behind the Minister's back. I have just pointed out that that is not correct. There is another inconsistency; another question that must be answered; another question that must be asked. Mr Goss said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Commissioner came to see me to show me a transcript indicating a certain individual, had discussed in a phone conversation with another individual, not the then Minister at all, the making of a donation to that member's election campaign.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Goss said, and I find this absolutely quaint&mdash;if ever I have seen anything like Caesar on Caesar&mdash;`it certainly warranted investigation by myself'. I emphasise, `by myself'. Here is a man who, in the years prior to getting into government in Queensland, was incredibly critical of the then government of the day for what turned out were relatively minor issues, but for which some ex-Ministers went to gaol. Mr Goss said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would expect such a donation to be declared. . . I would expect, particularly if the payment was in cash&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>cash totalling $5,000&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that, instead of what happened in the past where it is put into somebody's pocket, that the second test would be, that it be fully documented and accounted for in the normal accounting records.</PARA>
<PARA>He then went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I made inquiries and I found, I was able to confirm that in fact, there had been a declaration of the donation by the member in his declaration of pecuniary interests. . . had simply been passed on to the Electoral Executive Committee in the normal way that all donations are passed on, in various political organisations and in the Labor Party, and was fully receipted and accounted for. . . </PARA>
<PARA>This raises a number of additional questions. It was `fully receipted'. Who received the receipt? Was it Mr Mackenroth who received the receipt? Apparently, from the police transcript, it was not Mr Coco. Part of the transcript that is fairly important to Messrs Coco and Vasta is that they got the receipt, because it enabled them to be able to go back and collect at some later date. Now Mr Goss said it was receipted and I repeat the question: to whom was the receipt given? Mr Goss said he decided to discuss the matter with the Chairman of the Criminal Justice Commission, Sir Max Bingham. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I laid the facts before him and Sir Max Bingham advised me that in his view, the member concerned had acted with complete propriety, and acknowledged to me.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And I remind you that Sir Max Bingham is a former Liberal member of parliament, and confirmed to me that it was quite a normal political donation that had been handled in a normal way. . .</PARA>
<PARA>This raises a number of other questions. What facts did Mr Goss lay before Sir Max Bingham? Did Sir Max, for instance, know about the Federal Police tape which clearly Mr Goss knew about? Another question that must be asked; another question that must be answered. What in fact did Mr Goss tell Sir Max Bingham&mdash;what facts did he lay before him? During the trial of Mr Coco, who was tried for seeking to bribe a taxation officer&mdash;that was the background of the trial&mdash;the question was raised by the Crown Prosecutor, Mr Weinberg, who told the trial of Mr Coco:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The material&mdash;that is the Mackenroth tape&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>which none of us has seen until now&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">discloses that between the 13th and 16th November 1989, there were several communications between Coco and Mackenroth by phone and in person.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Justice De Jersey of the Queensland Supreme Court then asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What did you say? It shows an attempt to confer a bribe on Mr Mackenroth?</PARA>
<PARA>The Crown Prosecutor replied:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It shows a willingness to have the money which has been handed over treated as a bribe.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Crown says it shows a willingness on the part of those two accused, who have handed over a sum of $5000 in cash, indeed a preference as far as Coco is concerned, to have the money retained as a bribe.</PARA>
<PARA>It is not our position to judge matters like this, but we do have a responsibility to air them when these sorts of things occur and when the implications become known. There is no doubt, from the transcript which Senator Herron has incorporated, that Coco and Vasta clearly intended the $5,000 to be a bribe; and there is absolutely no doubt whatsoever that Mr Mackenroth took the money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, these are very serious matters. Over the last few years the matter of propriety in government has become&mdash;quite correctly, I would say&mdash;a very major issue, and something in which the general public has a very keen interest. Now that this information is known, simply to restore propriety of the elected representatives in Queensland it is important that these questions be asked and that they be answered. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join with my Queensland colleagues in raising this matter of very serious public interest about some things that appear to be happening within the Government of Queensland and within certain elements of the Labor Party in Queensland. There is a smell coming from that area, and I think this should be raised in the public interest before it becomes a stench. Madam Acting Deputy President, you would be aware of allegations of wrongdoing in connection with the Labor Party and its shareholding in Jupiters Casino. Those sorts of things, as I understand, are currently under investigation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the matter that Senator Herron and my other Queensland colleagues raise today is also one that requires much further investigation by people concerned with good government in Queensland. I was concerned about some of the material that came out in the trial of Mr Santo Coco, and I want to quote some sections of it which are of particular concern to me. The Crown Prosecutor in that trial told the court:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The material&mdash;that is the Mackenroth tape&mdash;discloses that between the 13th and 16th November 1989, there were several communications between Coco and Mackenroth by phone and in person.</PARA>
<PARA>The trial judge, Mr Justice De Jersey, then asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What did you say? It shows an attempt to confer a bribe on Mr Mackenroth?</PARA>
<PARA>The Crown Prosecutor, Mr Weinberg, replied:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It shows a willingness to have the money which has been handed over treated as a bribe.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Crown says it shows a willingness on the part of those two accused, who have handed over a sum of $5000 in cash, indeed a preference as far as Coco is concerned, to have that money retained as a bribe.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The evidence contained in the Mackenroth material, however, shows that Coco was serious about having Vasta restored to the bench, and that Vasta was serious about having his position reviewed by the ALP when it came into government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Mackenroth conversations occurred between 13 and 16th November 1989 at the very same time as these two accused are allegedly engaged in a conspiracy to defraud the Commonwealth by bribing the two tax officers to reverse sham transactions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(This was) in order to be able to shout from the rooftops before the election that Vasta was wrongly found to have engaged in sham transactions and the professed aim being to have him restored to the bench.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is the conspiracy the Crown alleges.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Coco was himself highly desirous of Mackenroth keeping the money without a receipt and treating it as a bribe.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They (Coco and Vasta) had an association which was far from innocent with Mr Mackenroth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That causes me some concern. As honourable senators will recall, Mr Mackenroth, the Labor member for Chatsworth in the Queensland Parliament, resigned in disgrace over some travel rort allegations and left the Queensland Ministry. I might say that this followed what I suppose could be called, to put it mildly, an indiscretion by Mr Mackenroth when he used the government plane, after years of criticising the previous Government for using the Joh jet for political purposes, and flew to Port Macquarie to try to get the Labor member for Nundah to withdraw his resignation from the Queensland Parliament because the Government did not want a by-election there. Mr Mackenroth, after criticising the previous Government, saw no hypocrisy in then using the government plane for a purely political matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, as a result of the travel rort allegations, Mr Mackenroth resigned in disgrace. Unfortunately, he has just recently been reinstated as the Minister for Housing and Local Government. I would have thought that was an unusual step for the Labor Party in Queensland. It did not reinstate other people who resigned at the same time. For example, Mr Ken McElligott, the Labor member for Thuringowa, which is up my way, also resigned over what I would have thought was a fairly innocuous set of allegations. He resigned, admitting some wrongdoing, but he expected to be put back on the Government benches after the election. He was not, but Mr Mackenroth was. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now the rumour doing the rounds of the Queensland Parliament is that the current Deputy Premier, Mr Tom Burns, will announce his retirement in the not too distant future, and the further rumour is that Mr Mackenroth is favoured to take on the new Deputy Premier's role. That also causes me some concern. I join my colleagues in simply raising these matters and asking questions that really do need to be answered. Why, for example, did Mr Goss say that Newnham had gone behind Mackenroth's back to report these allegations when, in fact, Mr Newnham denies this? Why did Mr Goss say that Mackenroth was overseas at the time?</PARA>

Why did Mr Goss mislead the public when he claimed last December that the travel expenses inquiry had exonerated his Ministers? This was repudiated by Sir Max Bingham, the head of the CJC, who said not that he had exonerated his Ministers but that he had only told Mr Goss that none of them would be charged with criminal offences&mdash;quite a different thing from saying that he exonerated his Ministers. Why did Vasta and Coco pay Mr Mackenroth $5,000 in cash? Was this connected with Mackenroth's support of Vasta in the Parliament and was it an attempt to have Vasta restored to the Supreme Court?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Victoria)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP> (1.27 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In July this year the Australian Democrats and the Government finally reached a deal in relation to the superannuation guarantee charge legislation which effectively meant that, like it or not, whether businesses could afford to pay or not, they were going to have imposed upon them a compulsory regime which would increase over time and which would effectively mean that lowest common denominator superannuation would replace the current largely voluntary system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of that deal, the Australian Democrats made great play of the fact that it might be the case that the economy would be in such poor shape by the end of the year that it would be necessary to slow down the proposed rate of increase. Accordingly, an amendment was inserted into the legislation to enable the disallowance of the increase from 4 to 5 per cent for companies with payrolls in excess of $1m so that it did not take effect from 1 January 1993 but was effectively delayed until 1 July 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since that time, of course, no-one in his right mind would argue that the economy has gone other than south: we have only to look at the most devastating economic results that have been announced in the last few days in terms of current account deficit and the blow-out in foreign debt and all those economic indicators which make it abundantly clear that Australia is in diabolical trouble. Of course, those employers who have not already gone to the wall are struggling to make ends meet. Private net investment is, of course, down and continuing to go down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there is one thing that ought to be obvious to all, it is that business has even less capacity to pay that increase now than it had then. Yet what we have had in the last few days is some indication from the Australian Democrats that now they take a different view. As recently as 28 October, Senator Kernot was saying to the media, `We cannot afford it, it had to be disallowed', and she was going to urge her colleagues to support her. One does not even know whether it went to the Democrats party room and whether they resolved accordingly five weeks ago, but now we are faced with this extraordinary performance whereby Senator Kernot is currently prepared to put jobs at risk for the sake of playing some political games. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find it regrettable in the extreme that Senator Kernot can now seek to justify this volte-face by linking it to a decision that has recently been taken by the coalition in respect of the deductions of personal contributions to superannuation, because there is a very significant difference. The fact is that, with regard to the decision in relation to personal contributions, all we have said is this: the Government has the capacity to restore to individuals the right to make tax deductible contributions. They have had that right for years. Indeed, 1.3 million people in the last financial year took advantage of that opportunity and made those deductions. Yet on 30 June, on less than 24 hours notice, the Government announced that henceforth that entitlement would cease. That was an unforgivable decision. We do not for one moment condone it and we never have, and we have made our displeasure very clear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have said, in recent days particularly, is that those people will have a clear choice at the next election. They know that this Government does not propose to allow people to top up. It takes the view that employers ought to bear the burden and that employees ought to forget about super and leave it to the bosses to make the payments, as they will be required to do by statute&mdash;the usual jackboot approach. In contrast, under us&mdash;immediately after the next election&mdash;they will have access to generous tax concessional arrangements. So we are not depriving people of anything that the Government has not already taken away from them; we will be restoring tax concessions after the election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the increase in the SGC, we have a very different position. It does not have to go to 5 per cent; it certainly does not have to go to 5 per cent from 1 January. Indeed, on all the available evidence, it is clear that the country cannot afford it. But if it does go there, by virtue of the regulation not being disallowed, then we are stuck with accepting the level that is in place at the time of the next election. That, of course, would mean a totally artificial disparity between those employed by companies with payrolls of less than $1m, who would only get 3 per cent, and those above that, who would get 5 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a quite unnecessary and meaningless distinction. It simply aggravates the position and is one that we would have no ability to reverse. Quite clearly it is necessary to take the very action which Senator Kernot has been advocating for months and which would reflect the views of, I suspect, every organisation and interest group in the country except the ACTU, which has always believed in the divine right to double dip and which does not have any problem about seeing the rate go up, irrespective of whether or not business has the capacity to pay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Kernot has been visited in recent days by a whole range of business organisations, pleading with her to uphold her previous solemn promises. Yet we still have this dithering going on. I think the tragedy is this: there is rank sophistry, hypocrisy and double-speak in any suggestion that it is necessary to increase the SGC to compensate those people who might temporarily be denied access to tax concessions. That is what Senator Kernot said on 2CN this morning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a preposterous and misleading suggestion because quite clearly, if there is a Labor government after the next election, that level will automatically increase from 1 July next year. Those people are not going to be denied their increase. Of course, a coalition government would be giving them back those tax concessions. People do not need compensation in any sense, other than what might be available to them if the Government and the Democrats were able to get together and restore, at least temporarily until the election, the ability to make tax concessional contributions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, I find it extraordinary that Senator Kernot should be saying that she believes that our earlier decision this week was for what she said was the basest political reason, isolating the Democrats. The fact is that they deserve to be marginalised and sidelined, for no better reason than the fact that they have something like 1,000 members around Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry, I take it back. They would claim, I suspect, up to 1,000. They have got about 5 per cent of the popular vote. In Victoria they are truly a mickey mouse outfit. They have effectively been halved and they command no respect in the electorate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is very significant in explaining why Senator Kernot is so furious is that she is undoubtedly posturing in the run-up not just to the next election but to the next leadership contest in the Australian Democrats, which takes place by plebiscite after the election. All those people, up to 1,000 of them, have the opportunity to register their view of the current performance of the leadership. Unfortunately for Senator Kernot, who comes from Queensland&mdash;where I suspect the party membership is not in double figures&mdash;the leader, the deputy leader and I think the national president are all from South Australia, so she has got to go over their heads to the people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have been seeing in recent days is an incredible performance from someone who quite rightly recognises that she has been denied the opportunity to screw yet another deal out of the Government at the last minute, claim all the kudos, and then put that forward as her credentials for the leadership challenge. It would seem very clear that hell hath no fury like a Democrat leadership pretender scorned, and that in what she is currently in the process of doing to get Senator Coulter's job she is prepared to put up to 10,000 jobs at risk. That, I think, is the great tragedy of the Democrats' position on this issue, because quite clearly this increase will have job consequences. If employers bear the full burden, we know from Treasury that up to 10,000 jobs could go, it could add to employer costs by something like $700m, and could affect something like 25,000 firms and 40 per cent of all wage and salary earners. It has very significant job implications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other issue that Senator Kernot quite speciously seeks to link to this one is in relation to people having the ability to make tax concessions. That may temporarily affect those individuals who would otherwise have preferred to continue making significant contributions but who might now have to pay a bit more or breach their contracts, but it certainly is not putting jobs at risk; and that is what is so deplorable about the current game that is being played by the Australian Democrats. I therefore urge them to reconsider, to put the national interest first, to stop protecting the Government and start protecting jobs. I urge them to accept that this issue is one on which they have made their position clear time and again. The circumstances have changed only to the extent that they have made even more compelling the case that they have sought to make over recent months, and there can be no justification at all for putting jobs at risk in the way that Senator Kernot is proposing to do, simply to try to manufacture a bit more publicity at the last moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It might have worked in July. She might have had a compliant Government then. I suspect that if we had sought to block the removal of tax concessions in due course we would have had the Government again being prepared to make last minute concessions. Indeed, I have had very good information that the Government was not only expecting to have to horse-trade with the Australian Democrats, but was prepared to look at things such as phasing out and removing the more odious retrospective effects of this proposal, so that rather than being backdated to 1 July it would have taken effect from when the legislation came into force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, that has been denied. If the Democrats and the Government now do a deal, it will be transparently obvious that it was not forced by weight of numbers in this chamber but was simply some sort of crude political exercise. Also, of course, Senator Kernot has lost her leverage, and one can understand her fury in that regard. But that in no way excuses her from her obligation to protect the jobs that the Democrats claim are important, which Treasury makes clear are very important, and which I would hope this Government still recognises are important. Therefore, the opportunity is still there. In the days leading up to next Tuesday, when this matter will be finally debated, I hope that all those people with an interest in protecting jobs in this community will make their view known to Senator Kernot in no uncertain terms: that they are not prepared to see jobs put at risk simply for the sake of leadership games that might be played after the next election. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today to pay tribute to a great Tasmanian. Roelf Vos died as he had lived, at peace with his God and surrounded by the love and concern of his children, grandchildren and friends. Mr Vos arrived here in 1951 as a Dutch migrant with his wife Miep and the first three of his six children. He brought little with him but his faith, his hardworking attitude and a bright optimism which was easily caught by all who came into contact with him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was a true Australian. He brought little, from the material point of view, to his adopted country, but left so much that this speech could not even start to list his accomplishments. In fact, Roelf Vos commenced work as a labourer during the day and then at a cannery at night in a small town, Ulverstone, approximately 100 kilometres north-west of Launceston. From this he was able to put together enough capital to open his first shop. From there he built up, over the next two decades, Tasmania's largest supermarket chain, the Roelf Vos stores. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At one stage there were over 16 stores throughout the north of the State. A trip to Vos's for the groceries became the norm for many a Tasmanian family. In 1982 the supermarket chain was purchased by Woolworths, while the freehold of the stores was maintained by the Vos family. Woolworths at the time noted that this particular supermarket chain was so efficient that, as part of the purchase deal, it requested the continuance of the present management team and its full staff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Woolworths recognised the respect for the Roelf Vos name within the community and promptly changed the name of its own stores to this unusual Dutch name. This was but an indication of the influence of Roelf Vos's values, beliefs and ethics throughout his supermarkets. He symbolised the best of the so-called Protestant work ethic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After selling out to Woolworths, he then went on to develop one of Tasmania's most beautiful tourist and housing complexes known as Grindelwald just outside Launceston in the Tamar Valley. Within this complex beautiful chalet style homes have been built on the Swiss model. Over the years a new five-star hotel, tourist resort and convention centre equipped with golf courses, lakes, tennis courts and other facilities were added. In fact, in the last 12 months a new complex especially for the over-50s has been built. This was an example of his vision, drive and determination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, his business dealings were not his overriding passion, because he led a purposeful life. He was a businessman who respected and loved his God and lived and respected those values epitomised by his faith in the Christ of the Gospels. He loved his family and his church. He was a businessman who worked six days a week and had respect for the now often scorned day of worship, the seventh. Sunday was a day which he spent with his family, his church family and his friends. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">His values, his ethics and his beliefs were lived. They were based on his christianity, which determined and ruled his life. He was not a pious, self-righteous man, but his manner was infectious, loving, joyful and optimistic. When Christ, whom Roelf Vos loved, walked this earth, he quickly drew crowds around him. Roelf Vos was determined to reflect his God. He was a gregarious person. People were important to him. He never took on airs. Every individual was given his full attention, whether it was a chance meeting such as on one of his daily walks or in his daily contact with the business world or those who worked with him. Every person was especially important to him. A noted doctor, Dr John Morris, Chairman of the Clifford Craig Medical Research Foundation, noted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He was a marvellous person to work with and behind it all was his devout belief in his maker&mdash;it was a very motivating force in his life.</PARA>

Every household in Victoria is going to be a hundred bucks worse off before Christmas. Irrespective of whether one is a pensioner or a multimillionaire, one is going to be a hundred bucks worse off. Every wage earner in Victoria is going to be worse off as a result of the Victorian Government's industrial relations policies, and Senator Hill has the hide to come in here and try to repump up the results of the Victorian election.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The facts about the incidents over the last two days are as follows: on 1 December the Khmer Rouge captured and detained six UNTAC military observers, three British, two Filipino and one New Zealander, at a KR checkpoint on a river 20 kilometres from Kompong Thom. UNTAC has been in contact with the observers, who say that they have not been harmed. UNTAC has been negotiating with the KR and is confident that the military observers will be released shortly. There have been some reports about alleged conditionality of that release, but the Khmer Rouge headquarters in Phnom Penh says that there will be no such conditions. UNTAC headquarters understands that the local Khmer Rouge commander believed that the military observers were spying for the CPAF, that is, the Hun Sen armed forces based in Phnom Penh. The Khmer Rouge office in Phnom Penh, however, maintains that it is not Khmer Rouge policy to confront UN troops. That is the basis of the negotiated release that is now occurring.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 2 December&mdash;yesterday&mdash;a UN helicopter with a party on its way to Kompong Thom to negotiate this release was fired upon. A French lieutenant-colonel was wounded in the upper thigh. That flight returned to Phnom Penh. Again, it is the case that also yesterday in Siem Reap province two Tunisian civilian police were seriously injured when the UN vehicle they were in drove over an anti-tank mine. Two hours later in the same location three Indonesian civilian police were injured in the same circumstances when their vehicle ran over another mine.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Government is concerned by these various acts against UN personnel in Cambodia. Peacekeeping by its very nature does involve some risks, and certainly neither I nor anyone else in the Government has ever sought to disguise the risks that are inherent in the exercise for UNTAC personnel, including members of the Australian contingent. We are, of course, conducting an ongoing assessment of the security situation in Cambodia, with special implications for  the safety of Australian personnel. We will continue to do that. Every effort is being made to minimise the risks to our personnel, in line with the responsibilities of their functions, of course.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The detention of UN personnel is the first incident of its kind. According to all the information we have been able to glean, it appears likely that the detention was a local decision rather than reflecting some new strategy by the KR leadership, in which case the implications for the overall settlement are limited. However, we are continuing to assess the situation further.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The attack on the UN helicopter is one of over 20 which have now occurred since the UN arrived and which were specifically condemned in a UN Security Council resolution a couple of days ago. Such incidents certainly make the implementation of a settlement more difficult and more dangerous, but it is everyone's judgment, I believe, at this stage, that they have not threatened the settlement. Similarly, injuries to UN personnel through landmines have occurred previously. They are of grave concern and illustrate the need for extreme care in movement around Cambodia. Despite all these incidents, the implementation of the settlement does continue in the way I described a couple of days ago, with results that still give us all grounds for very considerable optimism that we will be able to proceed to elections in April-May.</PARA>

The ADF personnel are essentially scattered around the country in individual locations performing their communications role. They are constantly on the move and, as a result, liable to problems with landmines, particularly if new ones are being laid, but we have no particular current evidence of that.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The short answer to the question is that, like every other country in the OECD, this economy has been through a recession. With recession there is inevitably rising unemployment and there is inevitably falling investment, but there is not inevitably falling productivity. In fact, the honourable senator is wrong about that. The trend productivity rates in this country are considerably better than they were when we came out of the last recession. These things are the concomitant of a recession.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Hill, a while ago, did not seem to understand that industrial relations and wages policy are very important in the context of an economy like Australia's. We cannot isolate Victoria. We live in an international economy now, not the sort of silly domestic economy that the coalition operated for so many years. It is quite extraordinary for Senator Parer, in contradistinction to his leader, to come in here and suggest that the industrial relations system has failed because we have a recession. It is a ludicrous question. I know that it gives the honourable senator the opportunity to reiterate all the mindless slogans of the Opposition, but that is all it does.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industrial relations system in this country has been through an extraordinary change. That is reflected in the huge increase in manufactured exports from this country, and it is reflected in the fact that last Monday's national stoppage, as it was called, was the first time we had had such a thing for years and years. When the Opposition parties were in government we had one of those about every month. The stoppage stood out last Monday. What caused it all?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen the article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>. It was drawn to my attention yesterday. Might I say that Senator Bolkus has just informed me that a member of his staff, Liz Jakubowski, gave birth to a baby yesterday by caesarean section at Woden Valley Hospital. I would like to send a greeting to Lucy and to her mother.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A study has been undertaken by Dr Paul Lancaster, the Director of the National Perinatal Statistics Unit of the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare. In it he has revealed that privately insured women have a 50 per cent higher rate of caesareans than non-insured women. He says that there is no physiological explanation for this. Senator Herron continually says in this chamber that these matters ought to be determined by clinical need alone. I think that is a very important principle. It is of paramount importance to keep this principle before obstetricians who are performing these medical procedures and interventions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that there is a matter of great concern here. In so far as there appears to be some correlation between a higher incidence of caesarean delivery of babies in the case of women who are privately insured, quite clearly that is a matter for concern by the associations and groups concerned, particularly professional peer groups such as the one represented by Dr Reid, the New South Wales State Chairman of the National Association of Specialists, Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Reid did say that we have to look at questions such as foetal distress and so on as the possible reasons. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The higher caesarean rate of insured patients could be explained by the higher fees they paid, he said. The co-payment (what the patient pays), which could amount to $600 over the rebated amount, put extra pressure on the obstetrician, Dr Reid said.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If that is an accurate report of what Dr Reid said, it indicates a cause for great concern. I would certainly hope that the professional peer groups of doctors performing such operations and interventions would sit around the table and discuss this matter and this correlation. I think it does need discussion. Clinical reasons alone should determine the undertaking of this sort of operation. Doctors should be fortified in resisting the temptation, which appears to exist, to undertake this sort of operation perhaps for an extra co-payment of $600.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would hope that the correlation does not signify any such yielding to temptation. As I say, I hope that peer group pressure amongst obstetricians and gynaecologists would help to bring those figures back to a more universally accepted rate for the delivery of children in Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In answer to the first question, France agreed back in September 1986 to the inclusion of agriculture in the negotiations. If Senator Boswell is asking whether France has agreed to the inclusion of the agreed results from the Blair House meeting in the United States on 20 November, the answer is that it has not. The current indications are that France is not going to make a separate decision about that or seek to veto that part of the total agreement; it is going to wait until the Round, as a whole, is finally brought to conclusion with all the other heads of negotiation and respond to that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most recent indication that that will be the French position was a statement by President Mitterrand at a dinner for the King of Belgium on 30 November to the effect that France would only take a position on the Round as a whole and not just on the agricultural component. If that is right, it clearly involves some hope that there will be a repositioning of France so that it is in a position to claim that it is doing better out of the negotiations in the other areas as a whole than it is just in agriculture, and will not pursue it to the point of attempted veto.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whether or not France can veto it is an open question. The negotiations have been conducted by the Commission on behalf of the EC as a whole, and any purported veto by France would have to rely on procedures that have not really been fully tested: the so-called Luxembourg compromise. We remain generally reasonably optimistic that things are on track for conclusion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The commencement of the reforms depends, first of all, on the conclusion of the basic heads of agreement for the Round as a whole and then the agreement to the commitments by the particular countries to meet their obligations under those agreements, which has to be concluded by 1 March to meet the US fast-track deadline. Hopefully, it will not take as long as that, but it may. Thereafter, there is a signature and ratification process which could conceivably take us into 1994, but everyone hopes it will be earlier than that that the whole package will come into force. Certainly, some commitments in agriculture will be implemented in line with marketing or fiscal years and will commence at the start of the relevant year&mdash;1994&mdash;anyway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the impact on the Australian sugar industry, that will benefit, like other agricultural industries, from the reductions in border protection, overall domestic support and export subsidies.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by Senator Alston to a question without notice asked by Senator Kernot this day relating to superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA>Despite Senator Alston's hysterical attacks, the Australian Democrats have not yet taken a decision on the superannuation guarantee charge. Unlike the Opposition, we are not locked in to protecting the vested interests of some of our constituents. We wait and examine the merits of the argument. One million Australians are relying on me to expose the hypocrisy of Senator Alston's back flip on the abolition of tax deductibility on personal superannuation policies. They were relying on that deductibility to top up their award superannuation in order to have an adequate retirement income and avoid joining the age pension queue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Alston is taking this decision about the superannuation guarantee charge in isolation from other factors. The key point that he needs to remember is that the decision, whatever it is, will directly impact on other aspects of employment conditions, namely, wage increases. Senator Alston is claiming that the effects of the SGC can be determined separately. He has deliberately misrepresented the Treasury's answer on job losses, just as he and Dr Hewson did back in June when they talked about 100,000 jobs being lost. That has not happened, and he knows it. No-one swallows his misrepresentations on this matter any more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Alston asked Treasury to do a calculation based on his usual assumption that the increase represents an additional cost to employers. He then said that Treasury acknowledges that 10,000 jobs are at risk. `Garbage in, garbage out', they said last time; `Garbage in, garbage out', it is again this time. That assumption is totally false, and he knows it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My amendment to the Industrial Relations Act guaranteed that the Industrial Relations Commission would take the superannuation guarantee increase into account. It was my amendment, as the superannuation spokesperson&mdash;funny, that! Treasury further stated that, in addition, even in circumstances where wage increases are determined through more centralised arrangements, it is reasonable to assume that total labour costs, including wages and superannuation, will be a guiding consideration. Accordingly, the cost of the SGC is likely to be offset largely, if not fully, by lower growth in other forms of remuneration, especially wages. It may well be that the rejection of this increase in the SGC amount would lead to an increase in total labour costs in an across the board wage claim&mdash;costs in excess of that which would otherwise occur under an SGC increase. If that were the case, the action proposed by Senator Alston would create the problem that he has identified, not fix it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats are working through these issues with all the parties concerned. When we have made a decision which we think is in the best interests of the country, we will make that decision public. The fact remains that one million Australians will now have a less than adequate retirement income because of the hypocritical back flip that Senator Alston has done on the abolition of tax deductibility on personal superannuation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The tragedy of Senator Kernot's position is that she seeks to claim all the credit when she is only one of seven or eight Australian Democrats, all of whom presumably have a vote and all of whom should be entitled to regard it as a team game. More importantly, Senator Kernot seems hell-bent on blaming the coalition for the removal and phase-down of tax concessions on superannuation contributions. She seems to forget that it is a Government Bill which will remove these concessions, and it is our policy to reinstate concessions after the election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have not heard anything from Senator Kernot in recent days about urging the Government to reinstate these concessions at least pro tem until the next election. She tells us all this nebulous nonsense about phasing out. She ought to know that the current generation of the work force will get nothing adequate to compensate it for the removal of tax concessions. Any phasing-out would need to take place over a 40-year period. If she is not prepared to spell it out, it is a quite clear that it is a transparent gimmick. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Kernot says that she is assiduously consulting with interest groups. I challenge her to nominate any interest group that is telling her that somehow she ought to let this go from 4 to 5 per cent. They are all of one voice. They all know that, when Senator Kernot sought that amendment in July this year, she did it on the basis that she wanted to reserve the right to knock this off if the economy could not afford it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why a matter of only a few weeks ago Senator Kernot was urging her colleagues and saying that we could not afford it, that it had to go. I challenge her to say whether her colleagues had a party meeting and agreed to knock it off. I suspect that they have already taken that decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This morning on the Matthew Abraham show we had a cheap regurgitation of the usual nonsense. The Democrats choose to ignore that Treasury has said&mdash;I have said this ad nauseam, but lack of logic seems to extend to lack of capacity to appreciate the facts&mdash;that up to 10,000 jobs would be lost if employers were to bear the full burden. Senator Kernot has to know that the Treasurer conceded that there would be job losses; he said they would be negligible. It has been conceded that there would be job losses, but they could not be quantified. Do not somehow pretend that jobs are not at risk. How can this nonsense go on? Treasury has said that up to 10,000 jobs will be lost if employers bear the full burden. It is only a matter of degree&mdash;jobs will be lost; there can be no argument about that&mdash;yet Senator Kernot's justification seems to be little more than an attempt to retaliate because we have deprived her of another moment of potential glory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Kernot thought she would be able to pull off a big coup, but we have pulled the rug out on her instead. Hell hath no fury like a Democrat leadership-pretender scorned. It is quite clear that Senator Kernot is not interested in the jobs of 10,000 Australians. She is interested in one job only. That is why the game plan is all too transparent. She is furious that we are giving Australians a real choice&mdash;that if they do want tax concessions they can vote for them at the next election. If the Democrats move with the Government, there will not be any. The Democrats will not be able to do their usual grubby little deal because we will not give them the leverage to do it. In other words, their 500 party members around Australia and their 5 per cent of the popular vote will get by them about what they are worth&mdash;and that is about five minutes taking note of an answer and not changing legislation. </PARA>

Those opposite are probably not aware of the gross cynicism which Senator Alston has been engaged in and which, when he says hell hath no fury, will incur the fury of the superannuation industry towards the Opposition and, in particular, Senator Alston.

The great problem with this approach is that not only is it totally cynical and unprincipled but also it affects many people out in the industry. There are some one million people who are affected by this policy&mdash;one million people who will make decisions based on Senator Alston's announcement to end their personal superannuation.

Of those 23 countries, every country except New Zealand has compulsory levels of superannuation of 9 to 13 per cent. It is compulsory because it is the only way people will save; they will not save for their retirement based on tax incentives. It is a failed policy.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) in response to a question without notice asked by Senator Crowley this day relating to private health insurance.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, you will recall that in relation to caesarian sections Senator Crowley wished to draw some tenuous correlation between private insurance and co-payment. Somehow or another she tried to get Senator Tate to condemn that as a circumstance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was quite obvious from both the question by Senator Crowley and the answer by Senator Tate that neither has the faintest idea of anything about caesarian section rates, the significance thereof and the correlation with private insurance. For example, there is a much higher rate of private insurance among young married women than there is in their cohort group of single women because they wish to have their babies under the best possible circumstances&mdash;that is, in a private hospital with an obstetrician of choice, which is our policy. There is also a correlation between the fact that with the later marriage age of young women there is a greater risk of pregnancy in females over the age of 30 having their first child, so that there is a higher caesarian rate among young women now than there was perhaps 10 or 15 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point that should be made is that patient request comes into this aspect. That patient request is totally unavailable under the Medicare system because women go into public hospitals, are treated by registrars in training, and are not controlled by consultant obstetricians as occurs in the private system. The consultant obstetrician is called in if an emergency occurs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government has also promoted home birthing and a higher rate for midwives. During the Estimates hearings I asked for this to be monitored because the effect of the higher caesarian rate in recent years has been a consequent decrease in the number of damaged babies. The incidence of spasticity among children is lower, which correlates with the higher increase of caesarian sections. Caesarian sections are done to save the baby from damage when prolonged labour occurs. It is just cheap politics to try to draw some tenuous correlation between co-payment and the insurance rate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is an issue in which I take a great deal of interest and concern as a registered midwife and someone who has received many caesarian section babies following their delivery.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also suggest that caesarian sections are done for social reasons. I have yet to have my thoughts and knowledge dispelled by anybody. This is an issue that has been raging for many years. One has only to look at particular figures for procedures in this area to know that it is very dependent upon which particular doctors are doing those procedures to know that there is a greater rate of intervention in certain areas, with certain people and certain rates of private health insurance cover. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an issue that deserves to be looked at very closely. I greatly resent the assertion that those who have their children in large teaching public hospitals do not receive the best medical care available for those women and their children.

As someone who has worked all of her time in public teaching hospitals as far as obstetrics is concerned, I am certainly aware that the standard of health care provided for those women and children is nothing short of the best available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part of the hippocratic oath that both doctors and nurses take is to provide the best service possible for one's patient, not to harm that patient in any way and to follow procedures totally irrespective of health insurance cover. The standard of obstetric care in the public teaching hospitals in this country is internationally recognised as of the highest standard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I reject any of these allegations and aspersions. It is appalling to try to frighten these women who are unable to afford private health insurance. That applies particularly to what happened under the previous coalition government where several million women could not afford private health insurance but were forced out of private health insurance and not given adequate health cover. Under the Labor Government, these women are able to have health cover to provide care for them and their babies when they need it, as required on medical grounds. That is the way that it should be. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Leader of the Government in the Senate in response to a question without notice asked by Senator Hill this day relating unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA>About a fortnight ago the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) stood up in the House of Representatives and talked about the majesty of the democratic process. What has happened to respect for democracy in Victoria at the moment on the part of this Government? Victorians overwhelmingly elected the Kennett Government to do something about the disastrous state of the Victorian economy, and what has Mr Keating done? He has done everything possible to thwart Mr Kennett in addressing those major difficulties. He did it firstly by, in effect, endorsing the mass strike action in Victoria, which only added to unemployment and created further economic difficulty in that State, and then, when that became politically difficult, he sought to resort to the legislative process and do it by means of legislation. As I said, the electors of Victoria voted overwhelmingly for a coalition government to give Victoria another chance&mdash;to do something about the situation I mentioned in my question to Senator Button; that is, an unemployment rate of 11.8 per cent, a debt of over $30 billion, a Budget blow-out of some $2.2 billion, the loss of the State Bank of Victoria and the loss of the Pyramid Building Society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Kennett and the Victorian State Government, as elected, should be given the opportunity to have a go. But this Government will not let them have a go. This is all because they fear that Mr Kennett threatens the vested interests of Labor's union leadership mates. That is what it is all about. It is about provisions to abolish compulsory unionism&mdash;provisions that will give workers a real choice for the first time. These are the provisions that this Government cannot cope with; these are the provisions that it is terrified will be implemented after the next election. So it now seeks to thwart that program by legislative means. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tragedy is that, while this Government seeks to interfere in the Victorian democratic process, it is not facing up to its own responsibility in relation to its economic mess&mdash;a tragedy in this country whereby we have a million Australians out of work and disastrous economic figures coming in practically every day. Earlier this week the current account blew out again. The growth figures are down to a level where they will not even sustain the current rate of employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what this Government should be facing up to. That is what I asked this Government about. I asked what it will do about a foreign debt for this country that is now, for the first time, over $200 billion gross. Senator Button was asked this question every day this week and on no day was he prepared to give us an answer. We have said to Senator Button and the Government, `When will you produce policies to address this major crisis facing Australia?'. And he will not answer that. The only logical thing that follows from that is that this Labor Government is planning to go to the people on the basis of its record. It offers no change of policy direction. Its record, as I said, is an economic disaster&mdash;a million Australians out of work, debt up to the highest levels ever&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate requires that officers of the Department of the Treasury and the Department of Finance appear at the hearings of Estimates Committee B on Friday, 4 December 1992 for the committee's consideration of Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1992 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Senate will recall that it recently debated Appropriation Bill (No. 3) and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) to the end of the second reading stage, at which point it was agreed a couple of days ago that the Appropriations that are the subject of those Bills be referred to Estimates Committee B. Honourable senators will recall that it was the coalition's proposal that the appropriations be referred to a range of Estimates committees&mdash;those committees being the ones corresponding to the departments for the respective appropriations in those Bills; that is, Estimates Committees B, C, E and F. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition was frustrated in its attempt to have those four Senate committees meet because the Democrats and the Government did a deal on the matter. In the end it was agreed, by the Government and the Democrats, that only one Estimates committee would consider these appropriations, that that would be Estimates Committee B, and that officers of the other four departments&mdash;that is, the Departments of Employment, Education and Training, Transport and Communications, the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories and Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs&mdash;would come and appear at the hearings of that Committee which would meet tomorrow. Honourable senators may recall that we wanted those Estimates committees to meet today, but, again, the Government and the Democrats did a deal to refuse that and instead Estimates Committee B is meeting tomorrow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We then had a meeting of Estimates Committee B, of which I am a member. At that meeting it was agreed that we would call officers of those four departments before Estimates Committee B and also officers of the Department of the Treasury and the Department of Finance. After all, it was the Government and the Democrats who chose Estimates Committee B as the vehicle for the consideration of the Appropriations. Whilst one might have argued that that was somewhat unusual, it was logical in the sense that these are Appropriations Bills, and Appropriation Bills are brought to the Parliament by the Minister for Finance. So that is appropriate. It is also appropriate in relation to Estimates Committee B because the Appropriations relate to a reordering of the Government's spending priorities. That, therefore, is a matter of importance in relation to the consideration of economic policy. I will come back to that in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the meeting of Estimates Committee B to plan tomorrow's hearing agreed that officers of the six departments&mdash;Treasury, Finance, Transport and Communications, Employment, Education and Training, Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs and Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories&mdash;would appear. We worked on that basis until yesterday afternoon, when I was advised by Senator McMullan that the Government had decreed that no officers of the Department of the Treasury or the Department of Finance would be allowed to appear before Estimates Committee B, which is the Treasury and Finance estimates committee, because there were no specific appropriations for those two departments contained in Appropriation Bill (No. 3) and Appropriation Bill (No. 4). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I objected very strongly to Senator McMullan about that. He stuck to his guns. I then consulted, in due and proper process, with the Australian Democrats. I put that matter to them late yesterday and said that I hoped they would consider at their party meeting this morning the impropriety of what Senator McMullan was proposing and that they would join me in supporting the motion I have moved, whereby the Senate would require the officers of those departments to appear before Estimates Committee B. We need a resolution of the Senate because the Estimates committees do not have power to call witnesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcomed the call from the Democrat Whip this morning at 9.45 a.m. She came to see me in the chamber and said that the Democrats had had their usual party meeting that morning and that they would be supporting the motion I have just moved. I thanked her for that, because it was the sensible and proper thing for the Democrats to have done. Three hours later, at 12.45 a.m., I was rung again by the Democrat Whip, who said&mdash;in a very apologetic tone, I must acknowledge&mdash;that sorry, but that arrangement was no longer on; the Democrats had now had another meeting and they had decided that they would not be supporting the motion I have now moved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I asked the Democrat Whip what the reason was for that absolute reversal and complete breaking of an undertaking that they had given me for the coalition this morning. She said, `There was not a full complement of Democrats at our party meeting this morning. We thought it was okay; that party meeting agreed. But then, when we had a second meeting for the morning, there were more Democrats there and the decision went the other way'. I said to the Whip, `You may not tell me how many members there were at each meeting, but was the Leader of the Democrats, Senator Coulter, at both meetings?' `Yes', said the Whip, `the Leader of the Democrats was at both meetings'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two things might have happened. It is certainly one or other, but I would assume that it is both. The first scenario is that at the first meeting of the Democrats this morning, with the Leader of the Democrats present, they took a very sensible decision to support this motion&mdash;a right and proper decision. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. The Leader of the Democrats again got rolled because a couple of others turned up and the numbers changed. It reinforces the fracas that took place during Question Time and after Question Time today between Senator Kernot and Senator Alston. It is obvious that Senator Coulter's leadership is at great peril within the Democrats. He cannot support his own numbers. For a leader of a party to get rolled on an issue like this I find absolutely incredible. I do not wish to offer any gratuitous advice to Senator Coulter but, if I were offering gratuitous advice, I would say, `Resign, before you get rolled as leader'. I find it absolutely disgraceful that in a set of parliamentary processes where we have to work on the understandings that we give each other as parties, no-one can any longer&mdash;if they ever were able to; today is confirmation par excellence&mdash;trust, take any account of, or place any weight on undertakings given to us by the Australian Democrats.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know whether the Government finds the same problem as we do. I rather fancy not, because the second and only other reason that I can surmise for this change in the Democrats' view today is that between half past nine this morning and half past twelve today the Democrats were nobbled again by the Government. I want to know, and I will ask Senator Coulter through you, Mr Acting Deputy President: what sleazy deal have the Democrats done this time with the Government to cause them to roll over again and again to meet the Government's wishes? I repeat: I think it is an absolute disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a very serious matter indeed because these Appropriations involve a significant reallocation of the Government's spending priorities. We have only just finished in this chamber going through a very lengthy, tortuous and detailed consideration of the Government's Budget Bills in the form of Appropriation Bill (No. 1) and Appropriation Bill (No. 2). We went through a very lengthy and exhaustive Estimates process to reach satisfaction on those Bills before they were passed. Before the ink has dried on those Bills, we now have two new Appropriation Bills introduced into the Senate which significantly change some of the Government's major programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The One Nation statement in February this year was the basis on which the Government said it was going to really get this economy going, and look what has happened since. It has gone more and more into the mire, with another 100,000 people or so unemployed since that One Nation statement that was going to solve our economic problems. One of the major programs of the One Nation statement was in the area of infrastructure reform. Within that component of infrastructure reform, rail expenditure and so-called rail reform was going to be a key part. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Appropriation Bill (No. 1) and Appropriation Bill (No. 2), which we have just passed, something like $280m was allocated for rail infrastructure spending this financial year. Appropriation Bill (No. 3) and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) reallocate that expenditure, decimate it, cut it down by $150m&mdash;from $280m to something like $130m. They defer $100m of that into the never never of next year and say, `Well, we might be lucky and have the remaining $50m, which is totally unaccounted for at this stage, a couple of years down the track'. That is a major change in the Government's capital spending infrastructure reform proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government talks about micro-economic reform being a critical element of its program, although the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) then tells us that the reform program is pretty well over; it cannot do much more. Senator Button has said the same. Nevertheless, in the same breath they have a One Nation statement and a Budget statement spending all this money&mdash;which the Parliament approved; we were asked to approve it and  we considered it in Appropriation Bill (No. 1) and Appropriation Bill (No 2). We are now told, `No, we really cannot spend that money. We can only spend $130m of it. Let's shove the rest off to next year and in the meantime we will spend that $150m on a whole lot of other things, including a range of mickey mouse expenditure programs this year'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a very important change in the Government's economic policy. It is, therefore, essential that, if the Appropriation Bills are to be properly considered by an Estimates committee, there must be economic policy officials present to answer questions and to participate in the Estimates committee consideration. The Government has decreed that that cannot happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department of Finance officials are also very important because it is the Department of Finance that produces and prepares the Appropriation Bills. It is the Minister for Finance who brings these Bills to the Parliament. Yet the Democrats and the Government say that officials from that responsible Minister's Department will not be permitted to have any questions put to them by this Senate.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are very important issues which should be put to the Department of Finance in relation to these Appropriation Bills. Apparently, we will be denied, because of this turnaround by the Democrats, the opportunity to have that happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will conclude on this note because I do not want too lengthy a debate on this matter, although there has to be a debate on it as it is a very important matter. This is not a small, technical matter. I believe that, for the Senate to be not permitted to undertake its proper process of examination of the appropriations, as appears will be the case, is a very serious issue for the whole relationship between the Executive and the Parliament, and for the rights and responsibilities of this Parliament to exercise its proper role of efficient and effective scrutiny of government expenditure, government programs and the Government's overall policy thrust. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say this because I do not know whether it is too late for the Democrats to change their view yet again on this matter. I do urge them to reconsider their action. If they do not, they are being made a party to an arrangement at the Government's behest that will lead to a major denigration of the responsibilities and proper processes of this Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee should consider the proposed expenditure contained in the Bills in the same manner as the committee considered the particulars of proposed expenditure referred on 20 August.</PARA>
<PARA>That reiterates what we are dealing with. It is the orthodox procedure of Estimates committees pursuant to the Standing Orders and precedents of this Senate. That is an important issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Short, in moving the motion, said that these should be dealt with through the normal Estimates process of considering these appropriations; that it will be in accordance with the normal, proper processes of the Senate. That is what Senator Short said in moving the motion. That sets the context. Let us look at what the Standing Orders say about the way in which an Estimates committee should deal with these matters. I refer to standing order 26, subclauses (12) and (13), which relate to Estimates committees:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(12) When a Committee considers the estimates, the Chairman shall, without motion, call on items of expenditure in the order decided upon and declare the proposed expenditure open for examination.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(13) The Committees may ask for explanations from Ministers of State in the Senate, or officers, relating to the items of proposed expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what the Standing Orders of the Senate say about the way in which Estimates committees should deal with the items we have before us. What does this legislation that we have referred to that Committee deal with? It deals with appropriations, items of expenditure, for five departments&mdash;the Department of Administrative Services, the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories, the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, the Department of Employment, Education and Training and the Department of Transport and Communications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proper role for the Chairman will be to go through those departments in the agreed order and to say that the items of expenditure are open for examination. There is nothing about a general review of what might be the context in which this took place. When we deal with such appropriations in the normal Estimates process, that does not take place. The Chairman does not say, `We are dealing with the Department of Administrative Services, but would anybody like to ask a question about the background economic circumstances?'. That is not what the Standing Orders say, or what the precedents of the Parliament say; nor is it implied by the debate in this chamber on this motion; nor is it implied by the wording of the motion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The motion quite clearly says that we want these items of expenditure relating to these five departments referred to a Senate Estimates committee for consideration in accordance with the normal processes of the Senate. The normal processes of the Senate are clear: items of expenditure shall be called on item by item. In this instance it will be department by department, as it always is&mdash;exactly in accordance with normal procedures. Odgers at page 648 makes that clear. In making a point about the capacity of people to ask questions of officers, which is an important power of an Estimates committee, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An important feature of the Estimates Committees as agreed upon by the Senate is that the committees may ask for explanations from Ministers of State in the Senate, or departmental officers, relating to the items of proposed expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA>It is quite clear. It is not a committee of inquiry, a legislative or general purpose committee, or a select committee having some special brief to review the economic situation in Australia: it is an Estimates committee. The brief, the origins, the Standing Orders, the precedents and the resolutions of this chamber make it absolutely clear that the Estimates committees have an important and proper function to discharge, that is, to review the expenditure. But it is not and never has been their brief to review issues about which there are no items of expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is similar to a circumstance arising in supplementary appropriations; where there are no appropriations for a department, there would be no Estimates committee scrutiny. That is the normal course of events. Where there is a running cost appropriation, we allow wide-ranging review in Supplementary Estimates. I have some views about whether that is appropriate, but it is the tradition and we would apply that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not the case we are dealing with here. There are five departments for which there are items of expenditure and the only thing which the Standing Orders allows is for those items of expenditure to be reviewed department by department. A Minister&mdash;or in this instance, in accordance with our Standing Orders, a Parliamentary Secretary, I regret to say&mdash;and the officers from the departments, one by one, will come in the order determined by the Committee to deal with those items of expenditure for so long as the Opposition wishes and in whatever manner it wishes in accordance with the Standing Orders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition found out that suddenly it could not have the witch-hunt it wanted because the Standing Orders do not allow it, the resolution of the Parliament does not allow it and the precedents as reflected in Odgers do not allow it. In fact, the whole tenor of the Opposition's resolution does not suggest that that is what should take place, nor the manner in which the Opposition debated it. The Government did not like the resolution, but we will comply with it. Those opposite did not like the resolution, so they are trying to change it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact of the matter is that the normal Estimates committee process has been decided upon and the normal Estimates committee process should proceed. If we are going to review this by committee&mdash;I wish we were not, but I accept it may save time when we come back to the Committee of the Whole; it is not the way I would have done it, but we may do that&mdash;let us do it in accordance with the Standing Orders. We cannot just pull out of the air something that we would like to do. There is a proper process and we will comply with it, not only the letter, but also the spirit. That is what is called for. That is what we are doing. It is exactly in accordance with the Standing Orders and exactly in accordance with the procedures. It is exactly in accordance with the resolution of this Senate. We will comply with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition does not like it, so it wants to change the terms of reference. It is quite clear that what we are proposing to do is entirely proper and entirely in accordance with the traditions, precedents and Standing Orders of the Senate. That is why we are opposing the Opposition's motion on this occasion and why we will oppose a similar motion on every other occasion when the Opposition might move one. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I cannot believe what is occurring in the Senate today. Senator McMullan and Senator Coulter were both here when we debated this on Tuesday. I will read what occurred. Senator Short began by saying that these Bills represent a reallocation of considerable amounts of money which had earlier been appropriated in Appropriation Bills (No. 1) and (No. 2). Senator Short went on to state that the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) made the announcement that formed the basis of Appropriation Bills (No. 3) and (No. 4) that were before the Senate. The Senate had passed Appropriation Bills (No. 1) and (No. 2) and the Estimates committees had gone through their normal processes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation had been passed, but the Government wanted to change the allocation of the money and so it changed  it around and brought it up in different allocations. The Senate Estimates committees had already scrutinised that money for the purposes for which it was originally allocated. The Government wanted that changed. Senator Short was justified in saying, `Fine. If you are going to change the money around for different expenditure, then the Estimates committees should be able to look at it'. Under our amendment three different Estimates committees were to be involved, Estimates committees C, E and F. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then the Government decided to move an amendment. This was not our amendment; it was the Government's amendment. Senator Ray moved the following amendment:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That these Bills be referred to Estimates Committee B for consideration and report by 8 December 1992.</PARA>
<PARA>Why Estimates Committee B? Can Senator Coulter answer that question? Can Senator McMullan answer that question? It was an amendment from his Government. It was not the Opposition's amendment; it was the Government's. Senator Ray went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . `That Estimates Committee B only consider proposed expenditure contained in the Bills in the same manner' and then it flows on into Senator Short's motion.</PARA>
<PARA>We were very happy to meet on Thursday and Senator Coulter changed it to Friday in his amendment. We agreed with Senator Coulter's amendment. After Senator Button made a promise that we would also&mdash;not instead of, but also&mdash;be able to call Estimates committees C, E and F, Senator Coulter decided to agree with the Government. That meant that Estimates committees B, C, E and F would be involved. I am sure that Senator Coulter will not deny this: it was the decision of the Senate that Estimates Committee B would sit, and Senator Coulter only agreed with the Government as long as Estimates Committees C, E and F could sit as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Argument ensued because Senator Button said that we could have members, as well as the officers, of Estimates committees C, E and F. Not only could we have the officers and the membership of Estimates Committee B, but also the Opposition could call its membership of Estimates committees C, E and F as well. I asked about numbers and voting powers; he would not allow that and Senator Coulter joined him in that regard. At no stage in the Senate in this agreement was it ever said that the officers of Estimates Committee B could not be called. There was no indication at all that the Government would not allow these officers to attend. Why did the Government choose Estimates Committee B, if it will not allow the officers to be called? Why did Senator Coulter agree to Estimates Committee B, if no officers are to be called?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following that decision in the Senate, a private meeting of Estimates Committee B members was called. Senator Burns and Senator Devereux were there and the decision of that Estimates Committee was that the officers of Estimates committees B, C, E and F be called. Under what power do the Government and the Democrats now override the decision of Estimates Committee B? Madam Acting Deputy President, can you seek the power under which they could possibly override the decision of the private meeting of Estimates Committee B that its officers should be called?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not sure whether Senator Coulter will change his mind. The position in this Senate on Tuesday was that he agreed with the Government that Estimates Committee B be called, and he agreed only on the condition that we could also call Estimates committees C, E and F. I cannot begin to understand why the Democrats would go back on their word and the decision made in the Senate. Let us leave out the fact that they agreed with us that that was the decision they had reached; that they rang Senator Short this morning to say that they would go along with that because that was the decision they made; and that, a bit later in the day, they rang and changed their minds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decision of this Senate can only be overruled under certain circumstances; we have to go through those procedures before a decision of this Senate can be overruled. Madam Acting Deputy President, I am interested to find out what procedures we must go through to have a decision of the Senate overruled and a decision of Estimates Committee B overruled also, because in essence that is exactly what is occurring in the Senate at the moment. I am very concerned that the decisions of the Senate are being fiddled with, the Government and the Democrats having got together and decided that a decision, rightfully taken in this place on Tuesday, is going to be altered. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It must be extremely difficult for the Opposition to understand the way the Democrats work. It is certainly impossible to understand the way the Opposition's mind works. At the same time, it is also clear that it must be very given to conspiracy, status seeking and climbing up the greasy pole because it seems to be very concerned about leadership and everything else.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I inform the Opposition, if it did not know it beforehand, that the Democrats have a very open democratic system. That is why we call ourselves the Democrats. After the next election, there will automatically be a vote of all members of the Party to decide who will be the leader. All the Democrat senators willingly participate in that process. We are not here to seek status and to climb up that greasy pole; we are here to address as well as we can the substantive business of government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that Senator Short, having said that he would not speak for very long, spoke for 10 minutes before he got onto the substantive issue and spent all of that 10 minutes denigrating the Democrats. In the course of his remarks, he said that he had negotiated with the Democrats in relation to our position on this motion. He understood that a certain position had been reached but that when we changed our minds that was some sort of a deal which we had struck with the Government. How devious and distorted are the minds of Opposition members when they can say things like that: on the one hand, if we negotiate with them, they are negotiations; on the other hand, if we enter into negotiations with the Government and we are persuaded otherwise, somehow that is a deal. It is not anything different from the processes by which we deal with the Opposition. We look at every issue on its merits, and that is precisely what we did in this case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we had our meeting earlier this morning not all the Democrat senators were present. It is fair to say that in the mind of every single Democrat senator there were merits on both sides of this argument. Nobody felt particularly strongly about whether this motion should or should not be supported. It would be fair to say&mdash;I think this should be put on the record&mdash;that on balance and on the merits of the case we were persuaded at that earlier meeting that the Government had the best side of the argument; but, knowing full well that the Opposition would distort our position whatever we did, we were somewhat persuaded by the politics of it&mdash;and we needed to take into consideration the fact that the Opposition would quite wilfully distort the position if we chose a different course. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we met later in the morning and considered the matter again we decided that we should, in all honesty, decide the issue on its merits and we should not be persuaded by the sorts of distortion which we know full well the Opposition will engage in&mdash;it will go its hardest anyway, so we might just as well look at the merits of the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The merits of the case have already been pointed out. We certainly, as a matter of principle, do not want to frustrate the proper inquiry which surrounds the introduction of legislation under the rubric of the Appropriation Bills, whether they be No. 1, No. 2, No. 3 or No. 4. When we were debating this issue the other day we were persuaded that the offer by the Government to put these matters before Estimates Committee B, with the provision of officers who were relevant to the consideration, was an adequate way of discharging that responsibility. We are still persuaded to that point of view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having looked specifically at the sorts of officers required, in light of what is actually in Appropriation Bills No. 3 and No. 4 and given that questions in Estimates are essentially asked of Ministers and Ministers can seek advice from all sorts of other sources, we still think that the offer being made by the Government in this respect is quite adequate to discharge the appropriate function of the Estimates Committee to look at this reallocation of money and to then bring that consideration back when Appropriation Bills No. 3 and No. 4 are considered in the chamber. Accordingly, we are not persuaded that Senator Short's motion should be supported. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Committee determined just before the break that this amendment would now be in two parts. I indicated to the Committee that the Government will not be supporting what is now amendment No. 14&mdash;that is, the insertion of the proposed new clause 24A. As I said, the Government believes that this is a totally unwelcome restraint on the Minister's discretion and that, indeed, procedures are available&mdash;if the Minister were in fact of a mind to accept the recommendation&mdash;to the Minister to allow the Minister to move very swiftly if the kind of action pointed out by Senator Coulter were to occur.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I foreshadow that the Government will be supporting at least the thrust of what is now Democrat amendment No. 14A, which provides for the insertion of new clause 24B, with the slight amendment of removing the reference to schedule 3A and returning that to the original schedule 3. As I said earlier in debate on another clause, the Government does not support the addition of another schedule listing non-native species which the Democrats are proposing. But we have no disagreement with the thrust of the Democrats' amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This amendment relating to proposed new clause 24A sums up basically one of the greatest risks which can possibly exist for those who are trying to create jobs in Australia, despite the earnest endeavours of the Australian Democrats. This amendment seeks to create the same sort of status for people putting things on interim lists and thus giving them a false status. That in fact has been one of the major problems with existing heritage legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a nonsense to create an interim list which has a false appearance of status. Unfortunately, it is one which the media in Australia has tended to go along with. Far too often I have seen in the media the statement that such and such is on an interim list&mdash;as if that gives it a status of significance meriting the cancellation or deferment of projects aimed at creating jobs in Australia&mdash;when in fact it finally ends up not being listed. I am overjoyed to see that the Government is not going along with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to underline my objection, one could look at the United States experience. The Endangered Species Act of 1973 in the United States allows for public listing of species and critical habitats. The provisions in that legislation, while more detailed than those proposed by the Democrats' amendments, are essentially the same. Both allow members of the public to nominate species or communities in habitats for addition to the list. The US legislation differs in that it also allows members of the public to petition for delisting, and that is a matter I want to raise with the Minister when we talk about the Democrats' proposed new clause 24B, because it is a one-eyed, one-sided move which I find totally intolerable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the United States only those species which have, if you like, a constituency are likely to be listed. An example here are charismatic species&mdash;that is, those of tourist value or those which are symbols of some constituency, such as the northern spotted owl for those who oppose logging on the west coast. They receive attention to the detriment of other species which may be more critical to an ecosystem or which are in greater danger of extinction. But they are not popular; they are not the go ones; they are not the whacko-you-beaut ones that are likely to attract media attention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am talking about the United States experience. Listing of species on the basis of petitions may lead to conflict with the protection of another species or an ecosystem. The Florida Everglades is the site of one such conflict. Lack of water has threatened the Everglades ecosystem. In order to increase the flow of water into the Everglades national park, the National Parks Service plans to release water from nearby impoundments. However, the plan is threatened by a proposal to list the endangered small kite which populates the waters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another point is that the listing system is easily politicised and can be used to prevent trade and commerce. There are many examples, and the following two graphically illustrate this point. The American alligator was placed on the endangered species list in response to public calls to stem trade in its hide. This is despite the fact that it was never endangered and that the State of Florida regards it as a nuisance. I might say that there are some States in Australia which regard the eastern grey kangaroo as a menace and a nuisance. But I cannot imagine the Australian Democrats taking that view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1990 the Fisheries and Wildlife Service gave notice that it intended to downlist the bald eagle from endangered to threatened. Green groups protested vehemently but later admitted that part of their concern was that, given the charismatic nature of the bald eagle, downlisting would affect their fund raising efforts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Public listing procedures have proved impracticable. The number of requests for listing can never be met. It is only the most politically forceful groups that succeed in having their demands met. In a scholarly analysis of the Act, Doremus, who is sympathetic to the Act generally, writes as follows of the listing experience:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is simply impractical for all species to be protected under the ESA. The FWS has nowhere enough money to produce the required scientific justification for listing all species which currently meet the criteria for endangered and threatened status, much less to devise and implement recovery plans for these species.</PARA>
<PARA>I just want to conclude by saying that it is of widespread concern that there should be such an interim list created. I understand the rationale and the need to protect from unscrupulous developers species and communities that are about to be listed. I take Senator Coulter's point that there have been instances where people have rushed in with bulldozers when something is on an interim list. As the Minister quite properly said, we do not have to have an interim list to have something like that flagged. There is no need. If there is a risk, if there is a danger of someone exploiting a situation before a final determination is made, it is up to the Minister to hurry and to take appropriate action to ensure that that does not happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must say that the burden of benefit clearly dictates that we should not have an interim list because of the capacity of such a list to be used vexatiously by heavy pressure group activity to trigger legislation. I would much rather that we retain the atmospheric of cool, rational determination by a scientific body, not by, if you like, a government by pressure group. I find that this is simply not an acceptable proposition. I join with the Government in saying that we will oppose it with some vigour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats will inevitably call for another division. At times they have forced the coalition to vote with the Government. This is a silly ploy. We will vote against this amendment. I suggest to the Democrats and the Government that they seriously consider our proposal to resolve this matter. We will be seeking by way of amendment to replace clause 24A which is presently before the chamber. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would have to agree with at least part of what Senator Baume was saying. It is certainly true that the obvious and attractive species often get protection. They do so for a wide variety of reasons.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of my trenchant criticisms of this legislation and the Government's whole approach to this matter is that the amount of funding which the Government is putting into biological survey is totally inadequate. If I did not say it in my speech on this Bill, I certainly pointed out in the speech which I made on my legislation on this matter that a well-known and world renowned Australian biologist said to me a few months ago that at the rate we were carrying out biological survey in this country we will have to wait until the year 3000 before we know what is here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may be that there are bacteria, worms, beetles or all sorts of other things in the soil which do not attract a great deal of attention but which may be quite critical to particular ecologies and habitats. They may be critical to the survival of other species. Until we know about those things, we really will not be able to carry out a proper listing. The listing in the legislation is very much predicated on the obvious mammals and plants and so on. There probably is already built into this legislation and into the listing associated with it a very considerable defect because of that. To that extent, I would agree with Senator Baume that a lot of species may well miss out under this legislation because they are not obvious and they are not attractive. These species may not attract the support of conservation groups and those who love furry little animals or go around hugging trees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The conclusion that one must draw from that defect is that a great deal more money needs to be put into the biological survey. I might add that a great deal of employment can be generated in this respect. A proper study of the full complement of flora and fauna, bacteria and various other living creatures on this continent would require quite a large effort involving a lot of people&mdash;not only biologists but surveyors, photographers, truck drivers and support team members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have all heard stories of groups going to remote parts of Australia and, within a very short time, discovering species that we never knew existed. A recent expedition to Cape York came back after about only a week with about seven new species of plants and three or four new species of lizards. To that extent I would have to agree with Senator Baume that that criticism is founded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the rest of his criticism, I just ask him to read clause 24(1). It is quite clear that the interim listing is only a 30-day listing; it is only an interim period. This does go through the scientific committee process. It is not a list which would be made up by conservation groups, however extreme Senator Baume thinks those groups might be. Quite simply, what has been proposed here is a mechanism to ensure that those organisms that have passed through that process for inclusion, pending a declaration by the Minister, go onto an interim list and attract some sort of protection for the reasons that I have already outlined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think Senator Baume's concerns have substance. He should look very carefully at the wording of clause 24. We are talking about a very short term interim list. It is simply to gain protection in that very short period before a definitive decision is made as to whether the animal, plant, bacteria, beetle, or whatever it is, goes on to one of the lists or that the proposal is rejected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the suggestion of the Minister for Transport and Communications, Senator Collins. It is true that the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories, Mrs Kelly, can act very promptly; she does not have to wait for the full period before she acts&mdash;or he acts, if we have a male Minister for environment later on. However, the action will be taken by the Minister after the event. The advantage of the interim list is that the organism would be listed on that interim list and would immediately gain protection. To use Senator Baume's example, if somebody went in and bulldozed a lot of mangroves and that was an important habitat for a particular species, having learnt that the action was taken, the Minister might immediately list the species. Taking action after the event is not good enough. The action needs to be taken in a preventive way before the event. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole point of this amendment is that, as soon as that interim list is presented, that species gets protection for 30 days, which is a limited period. After the Scientific Subcommittee has made a determination, the Minister makes a final determination and the whole matter is resolved. There is no danger at all that this will become some sort of permanent list which conservation groups can blow right out. It is simply the proper expression of the precautionary principle that, if there is sufficient evidence for somebody to consider that a prime facie case has been made out so that a creature might be put on an interim list within that very short time, then that will be resolved. The fears being raised by Senator Baume really have no substance at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Minister pointed out, the other amendments are unrelated. We might just pick up on that so we can deal with the whole of amendment No. 14. The actual wording to which the Minister has agreed is somewhat different. The alternative wording for amendment No. 14A, which I think the Government has assented to and which I agree is fully within the spirit of what we are proposing, not only changes the actual schedule, but also says `members of the public may, in writing, nominate an item for inclusion in a list'. That is the wording I have. </PARA>

This is a piece of legislation which is designed to protect endangered, vulnerable species and ecological communities. If other considerations are to be taken into account which override the considerations that a species or a community is vulnerable, threatened or endangered, then they should be taken through some instrument which makes it transparent that it is the economic, social or other considerations which have overridden those.

What I was saying, perhaps not very well, was that while those other people are in there their task under this legislation is to advise in relation to these endangered species and endangered ecological communities. So their orientation is towards that consideration. That is the point I am making. It is certainly wider than a strictly scientific membership. Their task is oriented towards the protection of those species and those communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us run through a typical example: somebody determines that a species should be listed as it is endangered. Management plans are then put in place. If during the process that is gone through to make that listing and to put those plans in place there are overriding economic considerations which say that that is too expensive, or the impact on a particular human community is too great or too intrusive, then that is a perfectly legitimate decision to be made. But it should not be made by the committee that is advising on the endangered species; it should be made by, say, the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories (Mrs Kelly), together with her fellow Ministers, deciding that those other considerations were ones which overrode the concerns for the threatened species and overrode either the listing or the management plans. I am not saying the decision should not be made, but it is just being made in the wrong place, and that is what is of concern to me. </PARA>

<PARA>Clause 58 refers to the grounds for making interim conservation orders. Subclause (2) of clause 58 says, `For the purposes of paragraph (1)(d)', which reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ensuring that particular activities do not adversely affect a listed native species or listed ecological community, or habitat significant to the survival of a listed native species or listed ecological community, before an assessment can be made as to whether any other action should be taken under this Act to protect the species, community or habitat.</PARA>
<PARA>That section is then qualified by subclause (2), which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For the purposes of paragraph (1)(d), activities affecting the habitat&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and I emphasise that word; I drew attention to the importance of habitat earlier&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">of a listed native species or a listed ecological community are relevant only to the extent that they adversely affect features of the habitat that are significant to the survival of the species or community.</PARA>
<PARA>We have probably run through these arguments fairly well already, but it is very difficult in a particular habitat to identify clearly those features which are of concern. I used the example earlier of the gouldian finch in the Northern Territory, where there has been an absolutely dramatic decline in this bird's numbers. While there are some fairly reliable theories as to why the decline has occurred, I do not think anybody would positively say that he or she actually knows why that decline has occurred. Consequently, it is a bit difficult to identify precisely which factors in the habitat are so significant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present, in making an interim conservation order or a permanent conservation order the Minister must take into account only those features of the habitat that would be adversely affected by an activity and that are significant to the survival of the species or the community. The qualifier in clause 58(2) and clause 68(2) fails to take into account the ecological integrity of the habitat as a whole and assumes in some cases, I think, a great deal more knowledge of the ecology of the habitat&mdash;in other words, the interactions which occur within the habitat&mdash;than perhaps we can reasonably claim. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is for that reason that we propose these two amendments. We propose to omit those particular subclauses. In other words, the processes by which the Minister would make these interim or permanent conservation orders would take into account the same range of activities and factors but without this qualifier, which assumes that we have a great deal more knowledge than we have and assumes that we can, very significantly in some cases, I suspect, disturb the habitats without interfering with some of those features which we would find, to our surprise, are crucial to the survival of species or a listed ecological community. It is for that reason that we recommend amendments Nos 26 and 32. </PARA>

<PARA>Amendment No. 27 refers to clause 59, which is to be found on page 26 of the Bill. It suggests the removal of clause 59. Clause 59 refers to the consideration of the social and economic impact of interim conservation orders. It specifically talks about&mdash;and this is rather interesting&mdash;principles being `consistent with the principles of ecologically sustainable development', and seeks to set the factors which must be considered. They have to be consistent with furthering the objects of the Act and adequately address themselves to the grounds on which the order&mdash;in this case, the first one; the interim conservation order&mdash;is to be made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is, as I have said before, not appropriate in this particular place&mdash;and this is an argument that we have run before&mdash;to consider the social and economic impacts in deciding whether to make an interim conservation order, particularly in this case, because the interim conservation order is one which will only be in place for a short time, pending the decision as to whether the interim conservation order is to be replaced by a permanent conservation order, or whether the permanent conservation order would not be put in place at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I feel that, again on the grounds of the precautionary principle, and particularly with respect to clause 59, it is inappropriate to be taking into account these wider considerations in this short term interim issue. It may be appropriate further on that they be taken into account, but in this particular case one has been forewarned that one is dealing with an endangered species, a vulnerable species or an ecological community and yet, even with respect to the interim conservation order in clause 59, one is asked to take into account these wider considerations. I feel and the Democrats feel that invoking the precautionary principle would say that, if there is enough evidence to put these interim conservation orders in place, then it would be appropriate for those interim conservation orders to be so placed and for these other considerations to go elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 69 deals with permanent conservation orders. It refers to the economic and social considerations in very much the same terms as we have just been considering. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In considering whether to make a permanent conservation order, the Minister must be satisfied that such action for the conservation of the listed native species or listed ecological community in question is justified, having regard to economic and social considerations that are consistent with the principles of ecologically sustainable development.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think that we have fallen into this trap before. It is important that social and economic considerations be taken into account, but the wording in this case is not acceptable. We feel that the wording which is applied to the interim conservation orders, which we say should be deleted altogether, should be applied to the permanent conservation orders. So clause 69 would essentially be replaced by the wording which appears at clause 59. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, to reiterate, in the case of an interim conservation order, in other words, a temporary conservation order, we do not believe that it is appropriate to take these other considerations into account on the basis of the precautionary principle. In relation to the permanent conservation orders, clause 69, which is much briefer in terms, says that the Minister must take these things into account. We believe that the wording which is actually in clause 59 relating to interim conservation orders is a more appropriate set of conditions to apply to the permanent conservation orders. We do not say that, in the case of permanent conservation orders, these matters should not be taken into account. Clause 59, which is more extensive, states, in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . consistent with the principles of ecologically sustainable development&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>as does clause 69&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . minimise any significant adverse social and economic impacts, while ensuring that they:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) are consistent with furthering the objects of this Act; and</PARA>

<PARA>The first amendment seeks to ensure that even more power is not given to any future Ministers for the environment to take decisions that, perhaps as Senator Coulter would suggest, may not necessarily be in the best interests of all Australians. In other words, this amendment will ensure that there is good government, not just government by one particular segment of our society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This really follows very much the principle that the Government adopted in clause 57(1), which it has just supported against the attack of the Australian Democrats. Lines 24 and 25 of clause 57(2) are to the effect that, when making an interim conservation order, the Minister should give notice to each other Minister whose areas of responsibility include a matter which would be affected by such an order. In other words, in making the interim order, those Ministers who are affected have to be advised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present there is no requirement on the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories (Mrs Kelly), when extending an order, to advise anyone, to get approval or to do anything. Yet this could be a disruptive process. It seems to me extraordinary that the Government, when making an interim order, has on the one hand required these other Ministers to be involved and yet in extending it does not require them to be involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it would be quite unreasonable for this Government to give powers to any one Minister in such a contentious area which would lead to disaffection and disagreement around the Cabinet table itself. It would be much better if the Government devised a system whereby agreement had to be reached before such an order could be extended. As I said, to make the order in the first place these Ministers have to be informed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to see that the Government in clause 57(1) does not state which Ministers have to be informed. The explanatory memorandum states, `each other Minister whose area of responsibility includes a matter that would be affected' by such an order. In our amendment we have spelt out who in fact those Ministers are. It seems to us that the interim conservation order would clearly relate to the Minister administering the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act, the Minister administering the Export Control Act and the Minister administering the Fisheries Administration Act. This is a self-evident safeguard against the excessive exercise of power by one Minister, particularly in the context of a situation where she had other obligations, at least in the making of an interim order, which she is not bound by in extending that interim order. The same situation obtains for clause 70. It may be appropriate to take clause 70 in conjunction with clause 61 because I would be making exactly the same points in that matter. </PARA>

The Minister must not only seek the cooperation of these Ministers but also obtain their approval before she can put these interim conservation orders in place.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think it will come as a profound shock to Senator Baume to hear that we are not supporting these amendments. It is made clear in the second reading speech that it is intended that making permanent conservation orders will be done only with the approval of Cabinet. I point out to the Committee that the reason that was in the second reading speech of the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories (Mrs Kelly), was that that is a policy decision of the Government, which is part of the Cabinet decision, so that will be the case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason it is not in the legislation, apart from anything else&mdash;and I agree with it&mdash;is that we were advised by the Office of Parliamentary Counsel that it is extremely unusual to make a reference to Cabinet in legislation. Indeed, it is not contained in the Australian Constitution, as Senator Baume knows. I personally cannot think of a single Act of Parliament that contains a reference to Cabinet. It is a categorical policy decision of the Government that this will not be done unless Cabinet approves, and it is part of the Cabinet decision that that be the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of the renewal of interim conservation orders, the environment Minister has responsibility only in the case of non-commercial activities on Commonwealth land or waters, or in a case where another relevant Minister does not have power to act. We would not therefore want to single out approval by one or two Ministers, as suggested by the coalition's proposed amendment. The amendment is not, therefore, acceptable to the Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the reasons why we have not put up the proposition that the extension should be subject to Cabinet approval is that, although we were of a mind to do it, if under the Government legislation those sorts of matters are to be resolved by Cabinet, we could not see why the interim one could not be a matter for Cabinet approval. But, as the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins) rightly says, it has never been done. As a result of that, we took the view that we should have a second best situation of requiring those other Ministers who had an interest in the matter to have the opportunity of participating in any decisions further to delay activity&mdash;which is what renewing an interim order means&mdash;which may well in some instances be of significant disadvantage. It is all very well for Senator Coulter to say that it is only 28 days in the first instance and then a further 28 days, but there are some instances where delaying something for almost two months, and leaving uncertainty around for that period, may well be a matter of some substance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I stress that we think this prevents the exercise of excessive power by one Minister. We believe that is in line with the Government's own thinking because it requires other Ministers to be involved in the process in the first instance of making an order, but not in the extending of it. We think the Government's position is illogical, which is not enormously unusual. Of course, it is usual in terms of the Democrats supporting the Government on this matter. </PARA>

One would have thought that one can disturb without criminal intent. I must say that that word causes me a problem and I agree with the Minister that it extends the matter far too far.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Director must give to any person who so requests written details of:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) permits that have been issued; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) applications for permits that have been refused.</PARA>
<PARA>We seek to insert a proposed new clause 97A after clause 97 which would read:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Subject to section 100, a Commonwealth agency must not take any action that is likely to threaten with extinction a listed native species or listed ecological community.</PARA>
<PARA>One hopes that that is fairly unexceptional. Amendment No. 50 is to clause 98 which is headed `Compliance with recovery plans and threat abatement plans'. Clause 98 reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Subject to section 100, a Commonwealth agency must not take any action that contravenes a recovery plan or threat abatement plan.</PARA>
<PARA>We seek to insert proposed new clause 98A entitled `Taking etc. listed species and ecological communities'. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Subject to subsections 86(1) and 86(4), a Commonwealth agency must not knowingly or recklessly take, trade, keep or move any member of a listed native species or component of a listed ecological community.</PARA>
<PARA>We have dealt with amendment No. 51. In our amendments Nos 52 to 56, we are again looking at an amendment to clause 100. We propose to insert after clause 100 proposed new clause 100A. This is a condition which reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)  a governmental approval given by a Commonwealth agency is required before a particular activity is permitted under the law of the Commonwealth or a non-self-governing Territory; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)  the activity:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) is an activity that is likely to threaten or further threaten with extinction a listed native species or listed ecological community;</PARA>
<PARA>The point is that the Commonwealth agency must not give the required governmental approval. Again, we are attempting to ensure that the Commonwealth Government does not behave in a way which is contrary to the intention of this legislation. We also propose to insert new clause 100B. That involves the same sorts of provisions. That is all there is in relation to amendment No. 52. Our proposed new clause 100B runs over quite a few pages. Amendment No. 53 deals with the omission in clause 102 on page 45, subclause 1, line 5, of sections 98 and 99. Subclause 102(1) states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If a Commonwealth agency (other than a Minister) believes that action that it proposes to take may be an action to which section 98 or 99 applies, the Commonwealth agency must notify the Minister in writing of the proposed action and the grounds for its belief.</PARA>
<PARA>That is again coming back over this area of other agencies being involved. Again, it attempts to bind the Commonwealth by this legislation. Amendment No. 53 also relates to clause 102 on page 45, and omits reference to section 98 and substitutes proposed new sections 97A, 98 and 98A. These are the sections that we inserted only a moment ago, if the earlier amendments are accepted. Similarly, amendment No. 54 also refers to a Commonwealth agency and binds that agency. Amendment No. 56 is a tidying up amendment, which relates back to omitting section 98 and substitutes proposed new sections 97A, 98 and 98A. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now deal with amendment No. 58. Amendment No. 57 has already been dispensed with. Amendment No. 58 relates to clause 103 on page 45 under the heading `Minister to consider proposed actions etc'. The proposal is to omit all words after `action' and substitute `or carry out the activity may make written submissions to the Minister about the proposed action or activity'. That has a similar effect. The next amendment in this group is amendment No. 60. Again, it is a tidying up and consequential amendment to the earlier ones. Amendment No. 61 refers to clause 104 at the bottom of page 45, subclause (1), which states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The notice of advice must state whether the Minister thinks that . . .</PARA>

<PARA>That tidies that one up. That is the last of the amendments in this particular group. The effect of all these amendments, in one way or another, is to tie the Commonwealth and the various agencies under the Commonwealth into this legislation. We believe that it is appropriate for that to be done, and that these amendments therefore should be included. The Commonwealth should not become a loophole mechanism through which it can do things that other individuals in the community cannot do. That is very often a cause of considerable concern to the people, when they feel that there is one law for the Government and one law for everybody else. Appropriately, therefore, we think that these amendments should be acceptable. </PARA>

<PARA>This is a very important amendment. It marks quite a diversion from the other clauses in the legislation. The Government, at the time of the 1990 election, said that it would comprehensively and nationally legislate to protect threatened and endangered species. Quite clearly, in the promise which it gave to the conservation groups, it envisaged the use of all those constitutional powers which undoubtedly the Federal Government does have over the whole of the continent. I believe that a promise was given to the conservation groups, therefore, that the corporations power, which is a very extensive power which the Commonwealth has from time to time used, not only in other areas but also in the area of environmental protection, would be included in the Government's legislation. In the private member's Bill which I introduced and which was debated several weeks ago, there was quite heavy dependence upon the use of the corporations power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government, in section 5 or section 6 of its own ozone protection legislation which passed, I think, in 1988 used that particular head of power, recognising that it was indeed a very powerful instrument which the Commonwealth Government could use. It used it on that occasion and the use of that particular head of power for the protection of the environment has never been challenged. The Opposition for its part&mdash;and Mr Howard specifically&mdash;in the battle that is going on between several of the States and the Commonwealth in relation to industrial relations has said that, if necessary, if the coalition forms the next government, it would use the corporations power to impose its pattern of industrial relations on the whole of Australia. So there is no doubt that the Opposition would also use the corporations power for those things which it regards as important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, we think that it is very appropriate, given that the Federal Government, in terms of its actual territorial holdings, extends to only about 0.2 per cent of the whole of Australia, that this amendment be inserted into the legislation to extend the powers of this legislation over the States in cases where the States did not pass complementary legislation. Our proposed sections 111A B and C set out quite clearly that if the States do pass complementary legislation, if they do do the right thing by their threatened species, then the Commonwealth would cooperate and fully assist the States in that work. However, in the event that the States fail to act appropriately, the proposed quite extensive amendment, involving section 111C, goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . then the Minister may&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) introduce into Parliament proposed legislation which will override any existing State or Territory legislation; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) recommend that the Governor-General make regulations which will override any existing State or Territory legislation; and (c) take appropriate administrative action.</PARA>
<PARA>We feel that the plight of the enormously large number of species listed in the schedules to this Bill&mdash;and I think that enough has been said about the number of species lost&mdash;is desperate and urgent. This is an urgent matter, one in which some of the States have not been particularly forthcoming when it comes to protecting the threatened species within their borders. Many of the threatening processes&mdash;and I will be dealing with this matter later&mdash;take no notice of State borders. Those threatening processes go right across State borders; they are national problems. I think that Senator Baume will be supporting the inclusion of rabbits as a threatening process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, the sorts of protective actions that would be put in place may well include things which would, and should appropriately, run right across State borders. The problem with feral foxes, which are listed in schedule 3, is not confined to any particular State or Territory. We believe that to tie this legislation in the way the Government has done is quite inappropriate, given the seriousness and urgency of the problem. We make a very strong appeal for the application of this much wider head of power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I stress again that it is not that the Opposition is averse to the use of the corporations power in section 51(xx) of the Constitution. The Opposition has said quite clearly that, should it win the next election and find the national circumstance inimical to its interests, it would use it in industrial relations. If it is prepared to use the corporations powers to tie the hands of workers right across this country, surely it should be prepared to use the corporations powers to protect threatened species right across this country, particularly given the failure of the amendments that we put earlier today in relation to widening this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We already have a much narrower Bill than the Bill that we would prefer to see in place, given that the Opposition should have little concern about simply extending the powers of this somewhat narrowed legislation to the control of the States. There are very considerable safeguards written into it. This amendment is simply to allow those States that are not doing the right thing with threatened species to be brought into line in conformity with the rest of this legislation. I very strongly urge the Committee to accept this series of amendments under amendment 62, which will extend the power of the Commonwealth in that way. </PARA>

I conclude by commenting on the initial point that Senator Coulter made. At least some inference was contained in that statement about the commitments of the Government in respect of this matter. The Government, through the then Prime Minister in March 1990, committed itself to enact legislation to protect endangered species. That was the commitment that was given. With the passage of this legislation, that commitment is being discharged.</PARA></TALK.START>

We are trying to do things by consensus, by agreement, effectively and without confrontation. It is appalling that Senator Coulter has introduced his normal, authoritarian, dictatorial approach to this matter. Proposed section 111C states that, if the Minister is satisfied that a State or Territory has not made sufficient progress, he can introduce into Parliament proposed legislation which will override any existing State or Territory legislation; in other words, negotiate or else. That is not negotiation; it is coming to an agreement with a loaded gun.

Senator Collins is a well known and highly respected former Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances. He would probably share with me a sense of horror that a regulation could be of such a power as to purport to override State legislation.

An `interested person', as defined on page 59, is permitted to seek an injunction only against the Minister or the Director of the National Parks and Wildlife Service. Amendments Nos 63 to 69 would allow any interested person, as defined under the Act, to seek an injunction from the Federal Court against any person. They would also have the effect of providing immunity from the payment of damages if the case failed in court. </PARA>

In relation to the immunity from payment of damages, if a person were to lodge a claim in a vexatious or frivolous manner, the court would throw that out and the question of payment of damages would not arise. The damages question would arise only if the injunction brought by the interested person were successful in the courts.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After clause 27, page 13, insert the following clause:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Director to refer status requests to Scientific Subcommittee</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"27A.(1) A person may request the Director to refer to the Scientific Subcommittee for consideration the status of a species or ecological community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Where a person makes a request for a referral in accordance with subsection (1), the Director must make the referral to the Scientific Subcommittee.</PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of the amendment is to allow interested people to seek the removal, as well the addition, of species from the list. At the moment, there is no capacity for any person to make a representation that something be deleted from the list, but special arrangements are made for people to make requests to add to the list. I am concerned about this uneven, unfair and unreasonable approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that my concern is shared by at least some Cabinet Ministers on the Government side. I am surprised that Mrs Kelly has been allowed to get away with restoring to this legislation the sort of one-eyed, unfair approach that I thought Cabinet had gone to great lengths to remove from the legislation in order to make it a fair, proper and reasonable piece of legislation which most reasonable Australians would be comfortable with because it sought an outcome which is in Australia's best interests. That is why the amendment refers to `consideration of the status of a species'. At the moment the proposition is that a person may nominate an item for inclusion on the list, but may not request that an item be de-listed. That is grossly unfair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second thing is that this whole question of nomination is, as I have said earlier, one that has been abused and misused by people who seek to claim status for the phrase `has been nominated'&mdash;by saying that something has been nominated for inclusion on various lists such as the heritage list&mdash;and therefore there is a pretence that it has some status, and that pretence has been accepted in particular by many elements of the media. That is why I deliberately chose to remove the word `nominate' because it is a word that has an unreasonable implication, and instead to insert the words that `a person may request the Director to refer to the Scientific Subcommittee for consideration the status of a species or ecological community'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a sense, while I am disappointed that in the cause of good government the Government will not accept my amendment, which improves the Bill and is right down the path of consensus which this is supposed to represent, I suppose that in a sense some benefit will emerge out of this because it will dramatise to Australians the difference between the Government, with its preparedness to bow to the whims of unreasonable and unfair process, and the coalition, which will look at this in a proper, reasoned way and seek to follow a policy of sustainable development. We have in mind the need for action to be taken to reduce the one million unemployed, to reduce the massive and mounting foreign debt and to reduce the balance of payments crisis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have been debating this legislation since 9.30 this morning, yet we are surrounded by economic disaster and the jobless queues growing by the minute. We have been talking about something which I accept is very important indeed; but what concerns me is that this proposed clause that the Government will not accept is one aimed at making certain that we have a fair and balanced outcome. Instead of that, the Government has, for political purposes, bowed to the usual pressure from the, if you like, squeaking hinge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I urge the Government&mdash;or at least I urge those Cabinet Ministers who may have been away, may not have been informed or may be unaware of this for some reason or another&mdash;to understand that Mrs Kelly has made some extra ground over what Cabinet had allowed her, its having made her retreat considerably from her initial draft. I am disappointed that those Cabinet Ministers are, apparently, not being given a chance to have any basic input to this legislation and have, I suppose in absentia, been rolled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment that the Government is now accepting from the Democrats is not in keeping with the spirit of the legislation. It is not fair, it does not give a fair go and, quite frankly, the coalition strongly opposes it. We wanted to provide people with the opportunity to have some input; that is why I moved our amendment. It was wrong of the Government to freeze them out altogether, which was what the draft originally suggested. However, it was equally wrong for Senator Coulter to want to give to the people who want to get things added to the list an unfair, and in my view improper, position in relation to those who want things removed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This clause in the legislation is appalling. It is being rushed through in order somehow to placate the Australian Democrats. I do not know why this is. Perhaps it is to seek some of their constituency; I am not quite certain of the motives but, whatever they are, they are wrong, the conclusion is disastrous and, though it may please Mrs Kelly in the short run, I must say that it will enable us to dramatise to the Australian people which party is really trying to get a decent result and to get sustainable development where all points of view are properly weighed and balanced in this major debate. The Government, by behaving in this silly way, has to an extent, I suppose, helped our cause. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was going to say that I am really surprised at the outburst which we have just heard, but I am not surprised at all. There is no doubt that the economic plight of this country is extreme. There is also no doubt that the plight of our endangered species is equally extreme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given those two facts, for Senator Baume to argue that to somehow further impose economic activity upon the environment would turn the economy around is simply a non sequitur. It is illogical that somehow we would provide economic prosperity and jobs for people by screwing the economy a little harder. It is just a stupid argument, and it has no foundation at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It could be argued, equally strongly, that it is precisely because we have not looked after the environment that we are bearing very heavy costs from the damage that we have done to it. It could also be argued that that is part of the reason we are now in our economic predicament and that if we looked after our environment better our economy would be in much healthier shape. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I direct Senator Baume's attention specifically to clause 24(3) of the Endangered Species Protection Bill, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A member of the Scientific Subcommittee has a duty not to disclose to any other person the advice, or any information relating to the advice, before the end of that period of 30 days unless the disclosure: . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Clearly, implicit in this legislation are strong responsibilities not to use this information in this interim period in the way about which Senator Baume expressed concern. If he also looks particularly at paragraph 158(1)(a), which sets out the functions of the Scientific Subcommittee, he will see that it reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to advise the Minister, within 12 months after the commencement of this Act and thereafter at intervals of not longer than 12 months, of amendments (if any) that should be made to the lists;. . .</PARA>
<PARA>Clearly in this legislation one has a process in which the information should be protected should such a nomination be made by a member of the public. The legislation clearly envisages that protection so that it would not be widely misused. Also, a definitive decision must be given within at least 12 months and a decision made as to whether the particular application has been accepted or not&mdash;in other words, whether the species or the threatened ecological community will appear on the lists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Baume's attack on this amendment is nothing but a very thinly disguised attack on the need to protect endangered species and to move very substantially towards what he sees&mdash;misguidedly sees&mdash;as the need to protect vested financial interests. There is no evidence that the protection of those interests is, indeed, in the long term interests of either the economy or the environment. I think his proposal should be very roundly condemned. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been listening to garbage from that corner of the chamber since 9.30 this morning. This last little bit has really gone right over the top. To suggest&mdash;not to suggest; to assert&mdash;as Senator Coulter did, that what I was saying was a thinly veiled attack on the concept of protecting endangered species when I have consistently supported the Endangered Species Protection Bill; when I have, in fact, moved amendments, unsuccessfully, which would make it a fairer and more rational Bill; and when I have continually pointed out that the coalition strongly supports the thrust of the Bill, is nonsense. If that Senator from his biased, one-eyed and in my view&mdash;I might say, in view of that last comment&mdash;totally dishonourable position can, in any way, establish any fact that would support his offensive suggestion, I would be glad to hear it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He said that I was speaking only in support of vested financial interest. If the only reason anyone opposes Senator Coulter's ratbag propositions is that, according to him, that person is supporting some vested interest, 99 per cent of the members of this Senate have some sort of vested interest. Maybe it is a vested interest in the truth and in getting the best legislation through. Maybe we were having an aberration, but we even agreed to some of his amendments. I wonder what vested interest prompted us to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only am I disappointed in what he did; I am disgusted by his last remark. Not only am I disgusted; I am astounded at his incompetence. His defence of his position was incredible. He said, `It's wrong to say that people would use the fact that something had been nominated'&mdash;as they have misused it in the Heritage Act; as the media has consistently drummed up matters because something has been nominated. Senator Coulter's response is, `No, that couldn't happen because, according to subclause 24(3), a member of the Scientific Subcommittee has a duty not to disclose to any other person'. What rubbish! What about the person who makes the nomination? There is no requirement on the person making the nomination to keep quiet about it. Senator Coulter should use his brains. He should stop making these stupid remarks which are an insult to our intelligence, apart from being insulting to us personally in terms of our motives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">His behaviour over the 12 hours that we have been dealing with this legislation, with other matters interfering every now and again, has been disgraceful. I have shown remarkable restraint. I have bitten my tongue and not responded to some of the silly things he has been saying all day. I have participated minimally in this debate, despite some incredible and nonsensical sentences in some of his proposed amendments to the legislation, which fortunately the Government will not accept anyway. Having had to put up with him all day, this last statement was too much. I believe he should closely examine in his own heart his motives for making that kind of allegation against me. If he is so obsessive about a matter&mdash;as he obviously is about this one; and I do not criticise him for feeling deeply&mdash;it would make him a better man if he argued it on the merits of the case. I hope that, on reflection, he will recognise that his behaviour is unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I regret the Government's decision to go along with this man, whose motives appear to have been so dominated by an obsessive view that anyone who opposes him is somehow in someone else's pay. I regret that the Government does not have the intestinal fortitude to support an amendment which it knows is right and which gives a fair go to people who want a consideration of items to be removed from the list. There is nothing in this Bill, as it stands, that gives any person the opportunity to request that something be delisted. Sure, it says that the Minister can add or delete an item, having considered advice from the Scientific Subcommittee, but nothing gives anyone the opportunity of making the sort of recommendation to delist that is to be given to people who want to list. It is not even-handed. It is not fair. It does not follow the fine point towards consensus that this Government, properly, has been pursuing, which is one of the reasons we are supporting the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been congratulating the Government on following that course, and I regret to say that my congratulations have to be diminished to half a cheer after this very weak-kneed withdrawal which occurred, largely, I presume, because Mrs Kelly has been able to insist on a matter because the other Cabinet Ministers, who clearly would not support the course of action being taken now, are not available or do not know about it or because there is no prospect of having a Cabinet meeting. What has happened now is ridiculous. I hope the Minister will be able to do something about it. Maybe he could defer consideration of this clause or give some sort of undertaking that it will be looked at again. I would like to know why the Minister will not give Australians the same opportunity to recommend that items be taken off the list as he will give to people who want to put things on the list. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with some fear and trepidation that I now have, regrettably, to add injury to insult and advise Senator Baume that the Government, as he anticipated, will not be supporting his amendment. I do not want to prolong the debate. I think Senator Baume has said it all, but I point out to him that, as I know he realises, at the end of the day the primary advice to the Minister in respect of the situation which we all hope will occur&mdash;that is, a species no longer having to be considered endangered&mdash;will come from the Scientific Subcommittee.</PARA></TALK.START>

I know that Senator Baume is aware of that provision; I am simply drawing it to his attention. At the end of the day, that matter is subject to the parliamentary processes. The provision contained in subclause 18(3) of the Bill, on page 10, indicates that any amendments of a list that delete items from the list are disallowable instruments that have to come before this Parliament and are subject to the disallowance provisions and the expert purview of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances. </PARA>

Our amendment expands the breadth of the clause. It covers not only listed native species or communities in schedules 1 and 2 but also non-native species included in lists specified in schedule 4 and the habitats of such species or ecological communities. It simply has the effect of slightly broadening the operation of existing provisions in the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA>Some farmer friends of mine think we should add the eastern grey kangaroo, but I imagine that Senator Coulter would go slightly off his face at that suggestion, no matter how reasonable it may be. The reason we are supporting Senator Coulter's proposal here in the main&mdash;about feral cats, feral rabbits and feral goats&mdash;is that if we proceed the way the Government had suggested, basically limiting it to foxes in terms of their effect on fauna, we would create an effective disaster. I recognise that there is a limited amount of funds and the Government has to set priorities. I understand that. But if the priority is to start off with foxes, what is going to happen to the rabbits? One of the major factors in keeping rabbit numbers down&mdash;or rather a factor in holding back the rabbit population&mdash;is the effective anti-rabbit activities of foxes. So if we knock off the foxes we will end up increasing the rabbit population. In other words, it cannot be done item by item. We have to adopt a coherent, rational approach. That is why we would strongly support the Democrat proposition to extend the list. As to vegetation clearance, it would be equally rational to include lantana, blackberry, mimosa and a whole lot of other vegetation problems. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening we are debating the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Amendment Bill 1992. The purpose of this Bill is to ensure that all persons working in the offshore petroleum industry in Commonwealth waters are protected by occupational health and safety legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition will not support this Bill because it is neither urgent nor necessary. We have a short time remaining until the end of the sittings, and some 76 Bills, maybe more, have been introduced. This is a so-called urgent Bill. The reasons for our opposition to the Bill are as follows. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his second reading speech, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) stated that the provisions of the Bill will cease to apply once the relevant States move to extend the coverage of their occupational health and safety legislation. It supposedly covers people working in the industry offshore in Western Australia and Queensland because they are not currently covered by the provisions. However, no-one is working offshore in Queensland, and the Western Australian area is already covered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One problem that the Opposition has with the Bill is that neither the Minister nor the Department has consulted in any way with the industry; in fact, the Department of Primary Industries and Energy, at very short notice, sent the Bill to the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association for review. The association, which is the only body representing the petroleum industry in this country, responded to the Minister on 10 November but received no reply. It is now 3 December. So there has been no response or consultation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having had a preliminary look at the draft, the industry believes that the Bill should not proceed. It points out that the specific areas of difference to the proposed Commonwealth legislation are designated work groups and health and safety representatives' provisional improvement notices. The arrangements proposed for health and safety representatives are inappropriate for multiple union, small work force situations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The result of the Bill will be multiple work groups, each with their own representative having major powers of investigation and the ability to order work to stop; whereas a single health and safety representative should be appointed by and answerable to a single health and safety committee. It is pointed out by the industry that the Western Australian designated authority and Western Australian operators are working towards the speedy introduction of a more modern occupational health and safety regulatory system. The association therefore believes that there is no need for new legislation to cover the interim period until State legislation is enacted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill is 45 pages long. It is a waste of resources of not only the Department but also the drafting office, the Parliament and so on because, as the second reading speech states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the provisions of the Bill will cease to apply once the relevant States move to extend the coverage of their occupational health and safety legislation.</PARA>
<PARA>As I indicated earlier, it applies only to Western Australia anyway, which is already moving in that direction. There is no application in Queensland. It also notes that the amendments to the offshore directions are not reflected in the main body of the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967. The safety and management systems required as part of a safety case approach embody a wider range of work force occupational health and safety issues than the proposed amendments in the Bill. This inconsistency of approach is of great concern to member companies of APEA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The safety case incorporates the requirements of the proposed amendment in a generalised form, with the exception of the appointment of health and safety representatives. The benefit of the generalised safety case is that the operator must demonstrate a commitment to the health and safety of employees rather than relying on the prescriptive legislation. The industry recommends that a strategy for transition to goal setting regulations be prepared for input from all parties prior to any further enactment or amendment. The association maintains that this is preferable to the inherent instability of the proposed amendments, which have the potential&mdash;and this is something that the Australian Democrats should think about&mdash;to cause a decline in safety standards as operators and the employees move through different regulatory regimes over a relatively short period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here we have a Bill that is only an interim Bill until the States do something that everyone agrees to. No-one disagrees with increasing occupational health and safety standards within the industry. There is no complaint about that. This 45-page Bill comes in as an interim Bill and there has been no consultation whatsoever with the industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Exactly. It shows the arrogance of this Government. I do not know the answer to this, but one wonders what on earth is the hidden agenda of the Government when it brings in an interim Bill, with no consultation, which applies only to what is happening in Western Australia, where these occupational health and safety standards are already employed. For that reason the Opposition will oppose the Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be pointed out that personnel joining offshore facilities are routinely advised by the operator of the location and availability of the PSLA directions on the facility and are encouraged to read the documents. The inclusion of the prescriptive amendments, which appear to be an absolute waste of time and which will be inapplicable in many offshore areas, will probably create confusion among employees. In all respects, whichever way one looks at this Bill, not only is it not urgent and not only should it not have come in at this stage, but it also appears to be totally unnecessary. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If I could attach complete credibility to all that he gave us, the contribution by Senator Parer would normally lead us to some confusion. The second reading speech on the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Bill 1992 states that the Australian Government has responded comprehensively to the Piper Alpha production platform disaster in the North Sea in 1988, when 167 lives were lost, by setting up a consultative committee on safety in the offshore petroleum industry. That committee consisted of State and Commonwealth government, union and industry representatives. Its responsibility was to assess the findings from the United Kingdom and to advise the Government on future direction of offshore safety in Australia. To me, that translates to mean consultation, and the industry was included there. Yet Senator Parer assures us that there was no consultation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a bit hard sitting in this position to decide who is telling the truth on whether or not there was consultation. I can only conclude that somebody thought they were consulting but somebody else thought they were not. It is not for me to decide, and I do not think I should attempt to decide, whether consultation took place or not. What I can decide is on the merits of what is proposed here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill was the subject of some discussion in the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills, of which I am a member. The Bill itself is offered as a model for States to reach that standard. It was not the degree of consultation which was the subject of our concern; rather, the feature which was most carefully examined by the Committee was the one which ensured that an employer must not dismiss employees on the grounds of having drawn attention to the inadequacies in occupational health and safety in the employment area. That to me seems a very important component of the Bill because it safeguards the whistleblower&mdash;in common parlance&mdash;aspect of employees in these situations. This aspect deserves to be and must be safeguarded because inspection and policing of these requirements is difficult unless the employees themselves are afforded the opportunity to draw attention to any inadequacies on the platforms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must accept Senator Parer's assurance that the Western Australian Government is moving towards the very direction which is established in this Bill. I must also accept his assurance that it is irrelevant at the moment in Queensland. However, I would have thought that it would be fairly obvious that the establishment of such legislation is not going to do any harm. If there is nobody operating the offshore platforms in Queensland, it will also not be to anybody's detriment there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the purpose of this Bill is to ensure that State legislation is prepared and will be in place when these offshore platforms are established. Offshore platforms are inherently extremely dangerous situations for people to be employed in. It is also a complicated area in which to get the occupational health and safety provisions exactly right. It is for those reasons that we will be supporting the Bill without further discussion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the remarks made by Senator Parer on the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Bill 1992. Senator Bell just said that it would be pretty handy to have a bit of legislation that would cover somebody who does not need any coverage and something that is not even operating. It seems absolutely ridiculous to me that we are introducing legislation, as Senator Parer said, that everyone is moving towards anyway. Why do we want to have more legislation?  We already have 73 pieces of legislation going through this place in the last three weeks and we have before us what I regard as a completely unnecessary piece of legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Basically, I suppose it is not surprising; this is just another Bill about which the Government has failed to consult sufficiently with industry. It is another example of legislation being jammed through the Parliament for no real purpose and of exposing the industry to potential expense and unforeseen consequences. The legislation essentially applies  occupational health and safety provisions for petroleum workers in two States, Western Australia and Queensland, until such time as those two States apply their own occupational health and safety legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation in the petroleum industry at present is that operators have what they regard as effective systems to promote occupational health and safety to employees and contractors. My experience, from visiting oil rigs on the North West Shelf, is that the diligence being applied by the people on those rigs at the moment, with their own occupational health and safety, is of the highest standard. So why is there such a rush to have this legislation basically cover Queensland offshore operators? Only the Government would know, and possibly it does not know either because, as I said earlier, the situation in Queensland at present is that there are no offshore operators and there are not likely to be any in the foreseeable future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. It is this Government which has stopped the drilling there, anyway. It is trying to cover something that is not even happening. I ask again: what is the rush? Have we not already got enough legislation here to cope with without the Government whipping around to get a few more bits of legislation for us to discuss? Is the Government operating on a secret agenda? Perhaps it is so secret that it does not know what it is all about. Why has the Government not undertaken proper consultative processes with industry? What really irks me about this legislation is that the Government has not discussed it with industry. It has made an attempt, apparently, and a draft review of the Bill was sent to the Petroleum Exploration Association for comment. But, having done that, the Government did not give the Association any time to properly scrutinise it. I suppose it is a bit like saying, `We are going to do something; you may as well have a look at it before it happens'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not surprisingly, the industry is not supportive of the Bill because of the administrative difficulties likely to arise, because it will confuse industry through its inconsistency, because it duplicates current directions and because the Bill will impose significantly increased penalties. I ask again: why are we having to rush this Bill through at the moment? I support Senator Parer. The Opposition will oppose the Bill for all the reasons that I have stated and those expressed by Senator Parer earlier tonight. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There has been put, on the face of it, a series of objections to this legislation in the form of questions&mdash;questions which are meant to expose, in the Opposition's view, reasons why this legislation should not proceed. In commending this legislation to the Senate, I shall deal briefly with those issues. The list of objections that I have taken down is as follows: why the rush; what is the secret agenda; why was there not proper consultation; and it is not necessary, anyway, in Western Australia and Queensland.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I took the view that your colleague Senator Brownhill was saying that he has visited, like I have, the offshore platforms on the North West Shelf. The level of safety is, as he rightly said, very high. Indeed, I think that Woodside has won several awards both in Australia and internationally for its safety levels. But let me go to the questions. This legislation involves, effectively, two things: the provision of the Commonwealth levels of occupational health and safety for offshore operations in Queensland and Western Australia; and, secondly, the provision for future operators of offshore platforms to present a safety case&mdash;that is, to design their own safety arrangements and then, in consultation with the Commonwealth and the States, to get them approved so that the risk management of operating offshore can be properly evaluated and contained.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To answer the first question, there is no rush here, but there is essential attention to speed. This springs from the disaster in the North Sea in, as I recall, 1989 when the Piper Alpha platform was engulfed in a fireball. There was a considerable loss of life and a considerable loss of the operational use of that platform and the wells it served. As a consequence of that disaster, the British Government set up an inquiry. Because Australia is sensitive to the highest operational levels of safety offshore, and because there is a vibrant offshore industry in this country, I, as the Minister at the time, set up a monitoring group in the Department to follow the evidence to the Piper Alpha inquiry. This meant that we did not have to wait for the inquiry to receive all of its submissions, come to its conclusions, and publish its report. We were following the proceedings&mdash;this information was made available to the Australian industry as well&mdash;so that if anything came out of the evidence we could act to ensure that the reputation we enjoyed offshore for the highest level of safety was maintained and, if there were anything we needed to amend or improve when the report came through, we could do so. So we were across the game, up with the pace, and always maintaining that enviable reputation we had. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is out of that long gestation, now over three years, that this legislation arises. There has not been a rush, but there has been a proper regard for levels of safety, and a prudent responsibility exercised by government. What is the secret agenda? It is the same as the public one: we want to maintain our international reputation for operational safety offshore. Has there been proper consultation? The monitoring of the inquiry, and the information that came from it, was shared with the industry, so industry was aware all along of what was going on, what our responses were, and what our feelings were. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, it was so aware that, as I recall it, in late 1989-early 1990, Woodside itself stopped pumping on the North West Shelf for a couple of days to make a change to a gasket or a joint under water, based on the information it got out of the inquiry. Therefore, what we were doing indicated the strength of our working with industry following the inquiry. Woodside, at a cost of several million dollars, did that. We have all been cycling along together. There is a committee called the Consultative Committee on Safety in the Offshore Petroleum Industry. It is a committee made up of unions, governments, and the industry. It has been through that committee that we have consulted on this legislation. So the consultations arise out of a long prehistory of monitoring shared information, and it is on the basis of that consultation that this legislation arises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final question asked was this: why does the legislation apply to Western Australia, since the Western Australian Government has indicated its intention to legislate, and Queensland where there are no offshore platforms? This legislation applies to offshore platforms and to offshore exploration. In the absence of the Western Australian Government yet legislating, despite its honest intent, one has to make the reasonable observation that there will be an election soon in Western Australia; there will be a period of hiatus in government when that occurs&mdash;I think the State Parliament is due to be prorogued soon&mdash;and there is no reason therefore why we should not get this Bill through and proclaimed to ensure there is the proper level of provision for safety and occupational health until such time as the Western Australian Government catches up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Queensland there are no offshore platforms, but there may be&mdash;in the Torres Strait, or in the Gulf of Carpentaria, or away from the areas governed by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority&mdash;from time to time permits issued or sought for exploration, and it is prudent and sensible government, since we have to carry this Bill in any case, to cover the situation in Queensland until it catches up.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question was not raised about who will administer the Bill. I think I should announce it: the designated authority in this case will be the State Ministers. So, in that sense, it is under their purview. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think I have replied reasonably and adequately to the questions that I think have been reasonably and sensibly raised.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will speak for just a few minutes about APEC and the application by Chile to be one of the new members perhaps admitted during 1993. If very diligent, honourable senators may recall that in August last year I brought back a number of observations and recommendations from a visit that Senator Hill and I made to Latin America. This was at a time when the inquiry by the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade into relations with Latin America was at an early stage. Eventually the Senate Committee, of which I am proud to be Deputy Chairman, brought down a very significant report. In my speech in the Senate in August last year, and again in the Senate Committee's report, there is recommendation that Mexico be admitted as a member of APEC and that in due course Chile also be admitted as a member.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were 12 original members of the Asia-Pacific economic consultation process and Australia played a proud part in the early stages of developing that concept and of ensuring that those 12 members in the Asia-Pacific region came together. In November 1991 three new members were added. We know them colloquially as the three Chinas&mdash;China, Taiwan and Hong Kong. The only realistic additional membership that is contemplated now, I believe, is that of Mexico and Chile. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Until this point I had argued that Mexico be admitted first and Chile a couple of years later. I really just want to correct, upgrade or advance the argument that has hitherto been put in the Senate over the last 15 months and to argue that during 1993 Australia give consideration to supporting the dual admission of two new members, Mexico and Chile, together. There are a number of reasons for putting that forward and I want very briefly to mention two or three. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This conclusion and the convincing argument emerged from very fruitful discussions that were held one week ago, last Thursday, in Parliament House during the visit to Canberra of Mr Edgardo Boeninger, the Secretary-General of the President in the Government of the Republic of Chile, the most senior representative of Chile who has so far visited this country. We all look forward to Patricio Aylwin, the President, coming to Australia during 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I warmed immensely to Mr Boeninger. I had heard of his reputation and the regard in which he is held by everyone in government, in the Parliament and amongst the people of Chile, and he lived up to those expectations. I was able to meet with him twice&mdash;once in my capacity as Deputy Chairman of the Senate Committee and the other as the Secretary of the Australia-Chile friendship group within this Parliament. In both of the conversations we touched upon the admission of Mexico and Chile to APEC. He put an argument to me, because we were ready to assess the question of timing, and I openly admit that argument convinced me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The argument was that, to complete the Pacific Rim representation in APEC, we should admit Latin American countries, particularly those that are adjacent to the Pacific coast, and that, to make that as dramatic as the admittance of the three Chinas as new members in 1991, we should admit not just one and then another a little later but the two Latin American countries at the same time. The only argument for putting Mexico ahead of Chile is that Mexico is to be a member of the North American Free Trade Association with the US and Canada, both of which are members of APEC. But, alongside that, we need to recognise that Mexico and Chile already have a bilateral free trade agreement and that it is widely acknowledged that, after Mexico, the US and Canada have ratified the agreement and it is expected in the next six or seven months that the next member even of NAFTA will be Chile. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, we should recognise that Chile has a very extensive Pacific coast, as does Mexico; and that Chile has a sound economy, as does Mexico. The two countries are far in advance of the other nations in the Pacific in terms of growth and debt ratio to GNP, and in terms of having an outward looking economy which is seeking to be internationally competitive. Of course, both countries, especially Chile, have been close allies of ours in the Cairns Group in this Uruguay Round of the GATT. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By admitting both Mexico and Chile together we would see an end, for some years, to the agenda of extending the membership of APEC&mdash;the original 12, the three Chinas, then the two Latin American countries during 1993. That would be the end of the matter. I think at this stage it would be only towards the end of the 1990s that we could estimate any new countries successfully seeking admission to APEC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that Russia's far east seeks to be represented in APEC. Some have speculated that other Latin American countries such as Colombia&mdash;and perhaps Papua New Guinea, Fiji and others on the Pacific Rim&mdash;should also be represented. I believe all of these cases are more remote. It is estimable that these countries will not be admitted until the late 1990s at the earliest and that we should get the two candidates that are far in advance of the field, Mexico and Chile, admitted together. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by noting the advice, arising from the conversations last Thursday that I have described, that was given by Mr Edmundo Vargas, the Vice-Minister for Foreign Relations in that country, whom I met in Santiago a year and a half ago; my good friend the former Ambassador of Chile to this country over the last three years and now Ambassador-at-Large in Chile's foreign service, Mr Juan Salazar, who was accompanying Mr Boeninger on this visit; and the new Ambassador of Chile to Australia, His Excellency Mr Fernando Zegers, with whom I have happened to meet a few times over the last fortnight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note their extraordinary unanimity of response to the conversation that Secretary-General Boeninger and I were able to have a week ago. I made the suggestion that they, as</PARA>
<PARA>a group of four very senior Ministers and officials of the Chile Government, put this argument in their own terms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also suggested that the group, through Ambassador Fernando Zegers, should give that argument in writing to the Australian Government, that is, to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Gareth Evans, and to the shadow Minister for foreign affairs, my colleague Senator Robert Hill, so that their argument, in their own terms, is very much on the table. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, I urge the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to receive that letter favourably and to give it very careful consideration. I note for the Senate, and for the Australian Government, that I wish my personal view to be recorded as supporting the dual admission of Mexico and Chile together into APEC next year. </PARA>
